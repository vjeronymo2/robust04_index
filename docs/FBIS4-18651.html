			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Federal Police Office Study: </F> Switzerland Can Try War Criminals From the Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] Bern, 2 Apr (ATS) -- Swiss military justice can try  the war criminals from the former Yugoslavia who are brought  before it. A report from the Federal Police Office (OFP),  published on Saturday [2 April] by several German-language  newspapers, came to this conclusion. It was confirmed by a  spokesman from the DFJP [Federal Department of Justice and  Police]. In the case of sufficient evidence, the divisional  courts would be competent to start proceedings.    The analysis was commissioned in mid-February by the Federal  Council. The aim was to determine what exactly the situation  was from the legal viewpoint. The OFP handed its report to  Arnold Koller, the head of the DFJP, just before the Easter  weekend. The eight-page report comes to the conclusion that  military justice is competent to open criminal proceedings  against war criminals, even if they are civilians or are of  foreign nationality, and if they committed their crimes in  another country. DFJP spokesman Viktor Schlumpf, confirmed this  interpretation to ATS [Swiss Press Agency] on Saturday. It is  based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions which Switzerland has made  an integral part of its military law. In the case of a  justified suspicion with regard to a presumed war criminal or on  denunciation, military justice would conduct the proceedings in  cooperation with the DMF [Federal Department of the Military],  the DFAE [Federal Department of Foreign Affairs], and the DFJP.  The accused would, in theory, be extradited to the country in  which he committed his crimes. In the case of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, this extradition would only be carried out  with the guarantee that the death penalty would not be used. If  extradition proved impossible, the army's chief auditor would  refer to matter to the civilian justice and police authorities  in order for them to conduct the military criminal investigation  because military justice does not have its own investigation  bodies. If necessary, a charge would be submitted to the  divisional court responsible for the case. If found guilty, the  war criminal would serve his sentence in a Swiss prison. The  sentences for the various crimes are established by the military  criminal code.    According to the press, Bosnia's embassy in Bern knows of at  least 10 cases of war criminals currently in Switzerland. It is  basing this on the eye-witness reports of Bosnian refugees who  say they have identified their persecutors. The Bosnian mission  in Switzerland is shortly expected to present its documents to  the Swiss authorities. If there is a case, the stipulated  procedure will be followed, DMF spokesman Daniel Eckmann told  ATS. However, the evidence must be sufficiently specific and  clear. Hitherto no case of this kind has yet been submitted, he  stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe reiterated Friday that Japan and Germany should  become full permanent members of a revised U.N. Security Council  [UNSC] but said it implies "assuming responsibilities" such as  peacekeeping duties. "It shall seem fit that countries who  pursue their candidature (for permanent membership) proceed with  constitutional reforms implied by such membership," Juppe told a  news conference.    He was alluding to Germany's and Japan's pacifist postwar  Constitutions restricting overseas troop deployment.    Tokyo enacted a law in 1992 empowering a limited overseas  deployment of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to assist U.N.  peacekeeping operations but a legal provision bans the  peacekeepers from joining activities that may involve the use of  force. However, a constitutional amendment opening the door to  participation in proposed peace enforcement units remains highly  controversial in Japan.    Former Defense Agency Chief Keisuke Nakanishi quit last  December following public outrage over a speech advocating a  revision of the Constitution for armed peacekeeping missions.    Juppe said, nonetheless, the discussed revision of the  15-member Security Council remains a difficult problem, citing  misgivings about the efficiency of a bigger council.    Should Japan and Germany, both northern nations, be awarded  permanent seats, a number of countries from the southern  hemisphere should also become permanent Security Council members  to maintain "a certain geopolitical balance," Juppe said without  elaborating.    Juppe, who met Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Thursday, and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  other cabinet members Friday, said the top objective of his  four-day visit is "to reestablish high-level dialogue" between  Japan and France.    Juppe said he conveyed a message from French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur inviting Hosokawa to France.    He said he and Hata agreed to hold foreign ministerial talks  in principle once a year and to promote regular meetings of  senior ministry officials.    Japan and France will actively cooperate in the  reconstruction of war-shattered Cambodia and coordinate measures  to fight AIDS, he said.    Japan and France should nurture political dialogue on all  international problems, he said, adding he and Hata also  discussed security in the Asia-Pacific region, especially North  korea's alleged nuclear weapon program.    He called Pyongyang's refusal to allow full international  inspections at a key nuclear facility "unacceptable" and "a  behavior France condemns" because it involves "a great risk of  nuclear proliferation." As a party to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), North Korea must accept  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), he  said.    He added he hopes North Korea "brings itself in compliance  with international rules" since the U.N. Security Council  adopted a statement Thursday urging Pyongyang to agree to a  follow-on IAEA inspection at the controversial site.    "Japan must proceed in opening its markets," Juppe said,  citing auto parts, aeronautics, public works and the insurance  sector as special concerns but stressed that Paris is devoted to  "multilateralism" in solving trade issues.    Following a trip to Kyoto, Juppe will leave for New Delhi on  Sunday.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Stoltenberg exit a blow to Kohl: German defence minister resigns after row over arms supplies to Turkey MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, was struggling yesterday to limit the political damage to his government and party from the abrupt resignation of Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, his defence minister, in a row over arms supplies to Turkey. He announced the immediate appointment of Mr Volker Ruhe, the 49-year-old secretary-general of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), to succeed Mr Stoltenberg, the longest-serving and most senior member of the government. Like Mr Stoltenberg, Mr Ruhe is a northerner and a Protestant, and a staunch supporter of Nato, as well as a confidant of the chancellor and a rising star in the ruling party. The resignation of the defence minister could scarcely have come at a worse moment in domestic political terms, because Mr Stoltenberg is the honorary chairman and father-figure of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein, the northern state where elections are being held for a new government on Sunday. A key reason for his rapid departure from the government was an attempt to limit the electoral damage. Mr Stoltenberg announced his decision at a joint press conference with Chancellor Kohl, after insisting on Monday that he did not intend to quit. In doing so, he was taking political responsibility for the delivery last year of 15 Leopard-1 tanks to Turkey, after the German parliament had ordered an embargo because of Turkish military actions against the Kurds. The row blew up after Germany protested to Turkey at the use of German armoured cars in new operations against Kurdish guerrillas - leading to a furious slanging match with the Turkish government, traditionally a close ally inside the Nato alliance. Only after Germany announced the renewed suspension of arms supplies - Turkey has a contract for 150 Leopard tanks, as well as equipment from the former East German army - did it emerge that the 15 tanks had been delivered in November in defiance of the parliamentary embargo. On Monday Mr Stoltenberg announced the early retirement of the senior defence ministry official responsible, but yesterday, in response to a univers-ally hostile press and the advice of close political colleagues, he decided to quit himself. He said he had not changed his assessment of responsibility for the delivery of the tanks, 'but the judgment and perceptions in a broad spectrum of public opinion are different. In addition there could be complications in the election campaigns in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg. 'I want to avoid damage for both the CDU and the federal government with my decision.' Mr Kohl said he was prepared to back Mr Stoltenberg in whatever decision he took, although political observers in Bonn are convinced that the defence minister came under heavy party pressure to step down. Mr Ruhe has a reputation as a tough political in-fighter, and a wide range of international contacts, especially in London and Washington.

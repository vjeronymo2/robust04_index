It  pointed out that the Army and Air Force "will not open fire  except against armed groups who attack them, who directly  jeopardize the civilian population, or who seek to return to  positions and towns they had occupied."    In an official communique, the secretariat added, "the Air  Force, in particular, will cease fire except in cases of attacks  on Army personnel in uninhabited areas where they require help."    President Salinas de Gortari had said he decided to "suspend  all fire" in the conflict area because the Army already  fulfilled "the initial goal" of its mission to restore control  and security in the region.    In the communique, which was issued immediately after the  presidential announcement, the Defense Secretariat pointed out  that the troops "will continue to protect towns that requested  help to prevent any possible aggressions." The communique said,  "they will not allow these armed people to move outside the  region," and it added, "they will maintain free mobility in  terms of personnel and equipment, including ground and aerial  reconnaisance operations."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "Active work, both by special  representatives for the former Yugoslavia and by the foreign  ministers of Russia, the United States, and EC with UN  participation," is called for to lay the basis for a summit  meeting on a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be held in the  near future. This is set out in a statement released here today  by the Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman.    "We expect both the Bosnian parties and our partners working  to achieve a settlement to be actively involved in this  process," the document stresses. The stance taken by the  Russian Foreign Ministry is expressed once again in the  statement: "Despite the complexity of the situation, military  measures should not mask the main thing -- policies to bring  about a political settlement."</p>

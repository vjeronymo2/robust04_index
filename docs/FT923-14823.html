			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Roadblocked society IN 1969 Mr Jacques Chaban-Delmas, on taking office as French prime minister, described the country he was called upon to govern, a year after the paralysing general strike of May 1968, as 'une societe bloquee'. Since then many efforts have been made to unblock it, and President Francois Mitterrand may fairly claim to have done more than most in that direction. It was his strategy that succeeded in marginalising one of the most formidable obstacles to change, the Communist party; and since 1983 he has consistently given priority to European integration, which has had the effect of opening up France's economy to competition and encouraging, in large parts of the population, a more flexible and innovative attitude of mind. The events of the last week show how incomplete that process still is. France today appears, more literally than ever, a society blocked by the action, at once defensive and aggressive, of groups with strong vested interests, threatened by processes of change. The groups in question, composed largely of self-employed workers used to working on their own and living independently, are good at organising obstruction but unwilling to support any permanent leadership capable of proposing or negotiating constructive solutions. Poujadism is alive and well in its country of origin. The changes they are resisting are, on the whole, in the general interest. That is true of the McSharry reforms in the EC's common agricultural policy, which should in the long run make food cheaper throughout the Community, at a lower cost to taxpayers, while ensuring that subsidies benefit those farmers who most need help. It is even more glaringly true of the system of penalty points for dangerous driving offences, which has been shown in many other countries to save lives by providing a more effective deterrent, and by removing persistent offenders from the wheel altogether. Intolerable injustice Yet not only do the protesters consider themselves the victims of intolerable injustice: much of public opinion apparently sympathises with them. French opinion leaders almost unanimously accept the assumption that guaranteed prices are the only way to support farmers, equating big farmers with small ones, farmers in general with the countryside, and the countryside with 'la France profonde', supposedly the mental habitat of the physical city-dwellers who form a substantial majority of the French population. Similarly, an opinion poll last week showed 60 per cent of respondents supporting the lorry drivers. Another poll showed the same percentage supporting the new law, but accepting that lorry drivers should have special treatment - as though a drunken lorry driver, or one exceeding the speed limit or driving on the wrong side of the road were somehow less dangerous than a private motorist doing the same thing. Failed miserably The government, whose job is to protect the general interest, is in the right on the substance of the issues. But it has failed miserably both in articulating that general interest to the population and in asserting the authority of the state - something French governments are traditionally supposed to be good at. The citizen, if he expects anything at all from the state, expects it to guarantee free movement about the country for himself and for the provisions which meet his basic needs; and when a country is geographically in the centre of a region whose economic integration it has done its best to promote, the state surely incurs the same obligations towards citizens of neighbouring countries too. Nationals of all EC member states now have a legal as well as moral right to free passage across French territory, and France as a state is conspicuously failing to meet its obligations. How the government can retrieve the situation, having allowed things to get this far, is not immediately clear. In 1968 Mr Mitterrand, as leader of the opposition, fell victim to the tactics of General de Gaulle and his prime minister, Georges Pompidou, who allowed things to deteriorate until public opinion was thoroughly alarmed, while quietly preparing behind the scenes for dramatic action to free key bottlenecks (most notably the petrol supply) at the right psychological moment. He may well now try some variation on those tactics to turn the tables on his conservative opponents who, in their turn, face the dilemma of needing to attack the government without appearing to be defending the anarchic behaviour of the protesters. But he cannot afford to wait very long.</p>

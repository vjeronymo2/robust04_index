			<p>BFN     [Text] As of the end of April, the Nanjiang refined oil  depot area which is a supporting project of the Nanjiang  petrochemicals wharf of the Tianjin Port had been completed and  equipped with the simple and easy oil handling conditions.    Sheng Huaren, general manager of the China Petrochemical  Company, and Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal  party committee, jointly went to the oil depot area in the  Nanjiang Petrochemicals Wharf of Tianjin Port on 14 May to  inspect this project and offered opinions for its perfect  operation.    This refined oil depot area is built for handling refined  oil  on the sea, exporting light oil products, and developing  Tianjin's petrochemical industry. The total storage capacity of  this depot area is 100,000 cubic meters with a total investment  of 120 million. At present, this project has been put into trial  run and proved successful, and the installations are all in a  normal state for handling refined oil.    While inspecting this project, Gao Dezhan pointed out: The  petrochemical industry is a pillar industry of Tianjin and where  the hopes of Tianjin's economic development lies. All relevant  departments and enterprises should actively work for and  contribute to developing petrochemical industry. The Nanjiang  refined oil depot area is an important project. The  construction of this project has a bearing on the development of  Tianjin's petrochemical industry. It is necessary to grasp the  rounding-off work of this project, step up efforts to build and  improve rules, regulations, and systems, and exert particular  efforts to strengthen safety and fire prevention as well as  management in an effort to guarantee the normal operation of  this project.    It is learned that this depot area will handle its first  delivery of refined light oil in the near future.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Nostalgia at the 19th hole - Alternative investments / Collectors are teed up, because the auction houses now hold annual sales of golfing memorabilia.  Last summer these brought in Pounds 1.8m THIS SUMMER, there should be cheering to the rafters of the gym at Loretto School, in Scotland - not in celebration of any athletic feat, but because an old golf club has been sold for rather a lot of money. Each year, the three leading auction houses - Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips - hold major auctions of golf memorabilia on the practice days of the British Open Championship. This year, the Open will be at the Musselburgh club, and Sotheby's has cornered Loretto School, which is on the course, for its sale. Its star lot is a golf club which was made about 1700, the oldest certified club in good condition to appear on the market. Bids of Pounds 100,000, and maybe more, are expected. Jon Baddeley, Sotheby's expert in the field, is confident of beating the auction record for a golf club of Pounds 55,000, set by Christie's in 1989. Last year, Christie's sold a club head, of the same period and found in the same area (in a hedge on the outskirts of the North Berwick Golf Club, the home of the game) for Pounds 44,000 to an American dealer. Most people would have reckoned the head, fashioned by a local blacksmith, to be a lump of old iron. Its location confirmed its rarity. Sotheby's has a complete club, a family heirloom which for years had lain unappreciated in a North Berwick home. Hence its confidence in a record price. The auction houses have been holding regular annual sales of golfing memorabilia since the mid-1980s. Last summer, they brought in about Pounds 1.8m, and are the main source of new material for collectors. There are a couple of specialist dealers in the UK, one working out of Grays Antiques Market, in London; while Morton Almond, of Cincinnati, is the leading collector-dealer in the world. He publishes the essential price guides, but this is basically a collecting field dominated by the salerooms. With 50 million golfers world-wide, many of them wealthy individuals, it requires only a small proportion to take an interest in the history of their favourite game to get prices rising. Demand has been underpinned over the past decade by the interest of Japanese golfing fanatics, and by the opening throughout the world of major new golf clubs, many of them aimed at a rich membership. A new club with pretensions invariably likes to establish an alcove, perhaps near the bar, to act as a shrine to the game and to display golfing memorabilia. In the same way, old and established British clubs are keen to acquire momentos, such as portraits and golf clubs, of past members who achieved sporting glory. Even though the Japanese were not prominent among the bidders at last year's summer sales, the purchasing for club collections, and private buying, ensured a steady appreciation in price, at least for the older and rarer items. So much so that there are already forgers turning out old clubs, balls, and golfing pictures. As in most collecting fields, there is a vast price differential between the old, rare, well authenticated objects in good condition and the more recent mass-produced items. Among golf balls, it is the feather balls, produced up to the mid-19th century, which command the high prices. They were expensive in their day - 2s 6d each - so it is not surprising that a record Pounds 14,850 was paid at Christie's for a ball made in the 1840s by the celebrated Allan Robertson. In clubs, it is the tailor-made examples, produced in the same period by such important names as Hugh Philp, which sell for up to Pounds 15,000. Prices fall away dramatically for the mass-produced clubs made at the end of the 19th century, which is encouraging for new collectors with modest resources. Good Edwardian examples of golf clubs have hardly moved in price over the past five years, and can still be acquired for Pounds 10 or so. A good collection of 20th century clubs could be amassed for Pounds 500. But serious collectors must be prepared to pay much more. At Sotheby's last July, a collection of 23 clubs was sold for Pounds 627,000 (just over Dollars 1m) to a British company. They were collected by William Auchterlonie and his son Laurie, who were professionals at the Royal and Ancient Club at St Andrew's, between 1860 and 1930. The Auchterlonies acquired a club from every winner of the British Open. The appeal of the collection is owning a club used by such great names as Willie Park Senior, winner of the first Open in 1860, and the fabled Bobby Jones. The fanatics will pay extraordinary prices for a piece of golfing history. At Christie's last year a gutty golf ball marker went to Japan for Pounds 35,200. These hand-operated markers were used for a short period in the 1870s, to cut into the new gutta percha golf balls to make them fly better. The attraction of golfing memorabilia is that it stretches far beyond old golf clubs and balls. The highest prices are paid for paintings and prints of the game and its heroes, which are surprisingly rare. Sir Francis Grant is not a great painter by any reckoning, but his mid-19th century portrait of John Whyte-Melville, captain of the Royal and Ancient, standing with the club house in the background, went to Japan last year for Pounds 165,000. Sotheby's sold 'North Berwick: the Third Tee', by Sir John Lavery, for Pounds 44,000. Memorabilia - inkwells shaped like holes, ceramics illustrated with golfing scenes, statuettes of golfers - are all keenly sought after. Something as dull to non-fanatics as a certificate confirming Edinburgh membership of the Honourable Company of Golfers could attract a bid of Pounds 23,650 - because it is dated 1779. Scotland gave the world golf. Now the world is coming to Scotland to acquire an instant history for clubhouses in Osaka and the Costa del Sol. Well publicised high prices have opened up a remarkable hoard of treasures. International demand should ensure that the rarest objects remain expensive, but those whose golf stops short at the 19th hole, and whose pockets are not limitless, can still acquire intriguing momentos cheaply.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Law lords rule Baker guilty of contempt IN A landmark constitutional ruling the House of Lords yesterday decided that ministers of the Crown were not immune from proceedings for contempt of court. Five law lords ruled that Mr Kenneth Baker, former home secretary, was guilty of contempt in his official capacity - although not personally - over the deportation of an asylum-seeker in 1991 in defiance of a court order. The law lords rejected the Home Office's contention that there was no power to enforce the law by injunction or contempt proceedings against a minister of the Crown in his official capacity. Lord Templeman said that, if the Home Office's argument were upheld, it would 'establish the proposition that the executive obeys the law as a matter of grace and not as a matter of necessity, a proposition which would reverse the result of the Civil War'. He said he was satisfied that Mr Baker was acting throughout in his official capacity on advice which he was entitled to accept and under a mistaken view about the law. The finding of contempt was the first against a minister of the Crown. It was made for not complying with an injunction to block the deportation of an asylum seeker from Zaire. The man, a 28-year-old teacher, had fled to Britain claiming he had been imprisoned and beaten for opposing the regime of President Mobutu. Mr Baker ordered his deportation on the grounds that he had failed to satisfy the Home Office that he had a 'well-founded fear of persecution' if returned to Zaire. Before his lawyers could bring a renewed application for judicial review, he was flown to Paris. There, in spite of a request to a senior immigration officer for him to be returned to the UK, he was put on a connecting flight to Kinshasa. The finding of contempt against Mr Baker in his capacity as home secretary will not result in any punishment but the Home Office was ordered to pay the costs of the case. The Home Office said last night that Mr Baker had acted throughout in good faith and on legal advice in his capacity as home secretary. The department added: 'As he has made clear, he had no intention of putting himself above the law. The constitutional issues raised by the case are of great importance and we are considering their implications.'</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: What a cultural mix] - Alastair Macaulay on the work of Mark Morris and Peter Sellars / The Edinburgh Festival THE opening week of this Edinburgh Festival gives us a chance to compare the work of two of the most talked-of young American theatre people of our time  -the choreographer Mark Morris and the director Peter Sellars. They have collaborated on three opera productions, and they have much in common. However, their differences have become increasingly apparent, and it is time to compare and contrast. What do they have in common? Both are in their 30s; are smart guys; give good interview copy to journalists; endorse multiculturalism; oppose American cultural imperialism; use baroque or modern or Asian music; like to mix high and low culture; employ irony a lot. In their theatre work, both like to take something period and set it in the present day. (For those who cannot make it to Edinburgh, TV has already illustrated this. Anyone can see the resemblance between Peter Sellars's versions of Mozart's Cos fan tutte, set in an American diner, and Mark Morris's The Hard Nut, which transposes Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker to an 1960s American nuclear family.) Talk to people about Sellars, and sooner or later they say 'But he talks so well.' (Morris is a hilarious loudmouth whose indiscretions have often got him into trouble.) Sellars has a knack for saying what goes down well with liberally-minded audiences. A favourite theme of his is multiculturalism; in particular, he sings the praises of the cultures of the Pacific Rim (as opposed to tired old Eurocentric culture). But his work shows that he has only one subject: his own highly American form of cultural self-hatred. Sellars exemplifies American political correctness at its most crass. He is anti-Eurocentric, anti-paternalist, anti-imperialist. Is he pro-anything? Nothing that he can express. He certainly isn't pro-Mozart or pro-Aeschylus; he changes them right, left and centre to suit his anti-American thesis. Take his current version of poor Aeschylus's The Persians. Once I heard he was going to present it, I knew he would set it in Baghdad after the Gulf War; and he did. But who would have thought he or his 'translator,' Robert Auletta, would have the nerve to call the Greeks of 480 BC 'the most arrogant people in the world' (ie American)? In 480 BC, the Greeks were not even a nation. It is revealing that Sellars is not interested in bringing out any Persian/Iraqi characteristics in Xerxes/Saddam, who turns out to be the most crudely American person onstage. To him, Xerxes and Themistocles, Saddam and Bush are just the same (except that Bush is worse). Sellars may preach multiculturalism, but he practices monoculturalism. True, he squirts on a few bits of Indian/Javanese movement exotica onto other characters, but they are fake - just addenda to keep up his pc credentials. It is also revealing that he tries to make Xerxes/Saddam a justifiably Oedipal type. So I (Xerxes) did some bad things? Dad (Darius), it's your fault because you never showed me any love; though actually I thank you, because you made me brutal. But, Mom (Atossa), you always loved me, so the feeling's mutual. (Aeschylus did not even have mother and son onstage together - he probably had them played by the same actor. Sellars has them end the play in a protracted silent loving clinch.) All of which might be tolerable or stimulating if only Sellars made it lively. But The Persians is very, very boring, and it reveals something that has been too little mentioned: that Sellars's sheer stagecraft is crummy and his actors act lousily. (I have seen Greek tragedies in Greek that were far more absorbing than this - much shorter, too.) Sellars is a conceptualist with only one concept. What he does to The Persians is the same formula he applied to Mozart and to The Death of Klinghoffer. (It's so predictable that La Gran Scena, that travesty opera group, now does a 'Peter Sellars' version of the final scene of Der Rosenkavalier - set in a shopping mall.) This is the reverse of Mark Morris, whose work is full of obvious structural virtuosity, vivid demonstrations of the possibilities of stage space, multiculturalism so profound that he has made whole dances in different folk styles, and (in other dances) has fused them. Almost the only predictable thing about his work is his way of making heterosexuality and homosexuality so equal that there seems to be no difference between them. Much of his work is about love; and most of it is ultimately affirmative. He is both pc and unAmerican in several ways, but has also celebrated several aspects of American culture. Often he sets a work in the present day, but sometimes - witness his 1991 Brussels staging of Mozart's Figaro, or his new dance, A Spell - in period; and his musicality, with its strange blend of irony and fidelity, is the least predictable thing of all. Both Sellars and Morris love various kinds of gestural sign-language, but Sellars' use of it is incompetent in terms of theatrical legibility or dynamics. If you went from Morris's Dido and Aeneas to Sellars's Glyndebourne Magic Flute, both choc-a-bloc with gesticulation, you could see how like and unlike the two men are; and that Morris is the artist that Sellars would like to be. Peter Sellars's version of The Persians ends its run at the Lyceum with two performances today; Mark Morris's second programme, of British premieres, runs at the Meadowbank Stadium until Monday</p>

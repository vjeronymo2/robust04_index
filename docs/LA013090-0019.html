			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NOT FOR POLITICIANS' SAKE  </P> <P> From its beginning last year, the controversy created by Sen. Jesse Helms'  attack on the National Endowment for the Arts has had very little to do with  aesthetics and a great deal to do with politics.  </P> <P> No one ever contested the notion that the endowment ought to consider the  intention, content and context of the projects proposed by artists and arts  organizations seeking federal financial support. The real question was -- and  is -- will that consideration be undertaken by artists and arts professionals  acting according to the criteria of aesthetic excellence or will it be  undertaken by politicians acting according to political standards? The former  approach is the one the NEA always has employed; imposition of the latter is  what many suspected Helms really had in mind when he assailed federal grants to  a pair of controversial photography exhibits.  </P> <P> Such suspicions now seem well-founded. As Times writer Allan Parachini reported  Monday, the conservative North Carolina Republican has quietly attempted to  inject himself directly into the endowment's deliberations. In four letters  sent to NEA officials late last year, Helms demanded unusually detailed  information on grants made to eight specific arts organizations and nine  individual artists, presumably because they presented or produced work dealing  with AIDS or erotic subjects. The senator also solicited a grant for an art  education project in his state, and urged NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer to  hire a Helms supporter as the endowment's chief lawyer.  </P> <P> Frohnmayer must not give in to this sort of unwholesome political meddling. He  must hold to the standard he laid down last week in remarks to NEA employees:  "All points of view expressed in excellent art should be encouraged and  supported, and (federal) grants should not be proscribed because of partisan or  doctrinal disapproval." When artists look to the federal government, they ought  to see the outstretched hand of a fair-minded benefactor and not the grim face  of the Grand Inquisitor.  </P></p>

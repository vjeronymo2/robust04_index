W. de Klerk, says the  government is determined to go ahead with the April election,  irrespective of whether the Freedom Alliance participates. Mr.  de Klerk was speaking during a joint session of the special  parliamentary sitting that opened today. He said any attempts  to disrupt the election would be strongly opposed. This week's  special parliamentary sitting is aimed at removing the Freedom  Alliance's objections to the constitution.    Mr. de Klerk said the latest amendments removed any  reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election. He said  the government would use every possible means, including the  security forces, against any party wanting to achieve its goals  by unconstitutional methods. Mr. de Klerk said parties aiming  at secession or the illegal takeover of state or municipal  authority should not have any illusions about the consequences  of their actions and the role of the security forces.</p>

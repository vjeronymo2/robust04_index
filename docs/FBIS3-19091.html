The European Union regards as a major priority the start of  negotiations between Kazakhstan and the IAEA [Internationaal  Atomic Energy Agency] with a view to the rapid conclusion of an  agreement on generalized guarantees.    The European Union would take this opportunity of repeating  that it believes in universal accession to the NPT and full  compliance with the commitments arising from the Lisbon protocol.</p>

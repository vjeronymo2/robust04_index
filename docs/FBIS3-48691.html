How can Japanese corporations  protect themselves from having to pay huge damage claims?    Under the Clinton administration, the U.S. Congress approved  the 1993 National Joint Production Act on 27 May, making it  possible for rival U.S. companies to enter into joint production  arrangements, something which they had been severely restricted  in doing before. Relaxing antitrust policies to boost the  competitive strength of U.S. companies, legislators seem ready  to let companies do whatever they can do to improve their  competitiveness.    Now that the cold war has ended, national rivalry has become  economic rivalry, and under the Clinton administration, the  newly created National Economic Council was quickly added to the  already existing National Security Council. One the central  themes of the new council is protecting and nurturing the growth  of U.S. high-tech industry, which forms the basis of U.S.  economic strength. Toward that end, it seems the administration  is promoting a pro-patent policy, which aims at providing  greater safeguards for U.S. intellectual property.    U.S. history shows two competing attitudes toward patents,  and the United States has gone through an antipatent period,  when new technology and discoveries were considered the common  property of society, as well a pro-patent period, which gives  precedence to the rights of the inventor. During the 1950's and  1960's, the heyday of American power, the winds were blowing  strongly in the direction of a free economy and an antitrust,  antipatent mood prevailed.    In the 1970's, however, key industries like automobiles,  steel, and home appliances and electronics began showing signs  of decline and the call went out to strengthen U.S. industrial  competitiveness. In October 1976, then President Carter  announced his "industrial technological reform policy." Clearly,  he was indicating a pro-patent policy as part of U.S. national  strategy. The secretary of commerce and others who were  advocating such a policy continued to advise the White House on  the importance of protecting intellectual property rights even  after their departure following President Reagan's election.    The Reagan administration continued Carter's pro-patent  policy, further boosting its importance by making it part of the  administration's national strategy. What sent shock waves  through the nation was a report by the President's Commission on  Industrial Competitiveness concerning the competitive  capabilities of U.S. industry. In that report, which was  released in January 1985, the chairman, [John A.] Young,  released an estimate that Americans stood to lose millions of  dollars if they did not protect their intellectual property  overseas, clearly taking the stand that intellectual property  rights were a national interest.    As public sentiment grew, the U.S. Congress in 1982  established a court of appeals in the federal circuit (CAFC) to  specialize in patent cases. A revised trade act was put through  in 1988 [1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act], giving  teeth to patent regulations protecting intellectual property  rights; the United States also saw the creation of the new  Section 301 and revisions to Section 337 of the Tariff Act.    The revision to Section 337 made it much easier for U.S.  companies to petition the International Trade Commission (ITC)  to place a ban on imported foreign products that are in  violation of existing patents. Again, through Super 301, the  U.S. Government was required to create a list of countries in  which intellectual property rights were not being given adequate  safeguards and to demand that the situation be remedied.    When during Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative  (SII) talks, a revision to Japan's patent system, including  efforts to speed up patent investigations, was sought, the  incident caused a flurry of reporting in the newspapers that is  still fresh in this writer's memory.  <H5>  Patent Mafia Active Behind the Scenes </H5>   Quick to take advantage of this pro-patent tide in the  United States and turn it into a business is a group of patent  management companies known as the "patent mafia."    One of these patent management companies, Refac Technology  Development Co., bought the patent for laser-related technology  developed in 1977 by an inventor named Gordon Gould and then  sued over 200 prominent companies, including General Motors  Corp., International Business Machines, and Toshiba Corp. After  more than 10 years in the courts, Refac was able to get each of  the companies to sign licensing contracts and even now is  getting over $10 million in revenue annually as a result.    Refac used its experience in the courts to make a career out  of patent disputes. The one who pushed this strategy to the  front was the vice president of Refac, Philip Superba. His  shrewdness has given many of those working with patents at  Japanese companies cause to weep. The strategy that Superba,  himself a patent attorney, devised was as follows:    First, one of Refac's technical consultants makes the rounds  of trade shows and companies and painstakingly goes through  newspapers and magazines to dig up products that are in  violation of a patent. Next, the company buys the patent in  question from the inventor. Most times, it is only part interest  in the patent (about 5 percent). Refac then sends a warning  notice to manufacturers it thinks are in violation of the  patent, asking them to sign a licensing agreement.    If everything can be settled at this stage, the company is  promptly paid the licensing fee.    If the manufacturer refuses to agree to a licensing  contract,  Refac brings the case to court. But instead of filing directly  against the manufacturer, Refac files its lawsuit against a  selling agent or shop. For the manufacturer, who values his  relationship with the agent, there is no other recourse but to  accept a compromise in order to protect his agent. Refac then  hires an attorney, hoping for an early settlement, and promises  to pay the attorney on condition that the case is successfully  concluded.    One of the patents Refac bought was for laser-related  technology from an inventor named Jerome Lemelson. The  technology, which has had broad applications, was used in VTR's  [video tape recorders], laser disks, and laser and magnetic  memory formats. From an inventor named Melvin Clark, Refac  brought a patent that had to do with electronic musical  instruments.    Based on the patent for this kind of instrument, Refac sued  Matsushita, Yamaha, Kawai, and Casio. The case was recently  settled out of court.    Casting sidelong glances at the patent mafia and their  behind-the-scenes activities, big U.S. companies finally jumped  into the fray in the mid-1980's, making their imprint on patent  strategy in some very important ways. Rather than making money  by creating products, they turned the patents they had been  accumulating over the years into the seeds of a new business.  Since licensing fees were a quick way to get cash into their  coffers, it was an attractive proposition for corporate  managers, especially when facing fourth quarter statements.    The first company to try it was the semiconductor giant,  Texas Instruments [TI]. Under attack by Japan's semiconductor  makers, the company's then first vice president, Melvin Sharp,  was groping for a way to survive. According to one account, when  he heard that Polaroid stood to gain a huge amount of money in  damages if the courts ruled in its favor in a patent dispute  with Eastman Kodak, Sharp slapped his knees and said, "This is  what we should be doing!"    In 1991, after five years in the courts, Polaroid won its  suit over Kodak, and was awarded over 100 billion yen in damages.    Texas Instruments followed suit and in 1986 filed a lawsuit  against nine semiconductor manufacturers in Japan and Korea,  claiming they had violated TI's patent rights. The following  year, the case was settled out of court. The company ended up  getting over $200,000 from each of the violators in patent-use  fees, which quickly pulled the company out of the red.    Recently, Japan's mass media was kept busy with Honeywell  Inc. versus Minolta Camera Co. and Jan R. Coyle versus Sega  Enterprises Ltd. In the end, Minolta was ordered to pay 16.5  billion yen in damages and Sega, 5.6 billion yen, causing a  shudder of fear to pass through Japan's corporate world. Both  cases also drew a lot of attention in Japan because the outcome  was based on a jury trial, something one doesn't see in Japan.    Jerome Lemelson got out-of-court settlements from Japanese  automakers and electronics manufacturers under a patent related  to the automatic inspection and imaging devices used on  production lines. Usage fees are said to have amounted to a  total of 50 billion yen. He has now turned his attention to  automobile parts manufacturers.  <H5>  Behind Skyrocketing Damage Awards </H5>   Actions from the 1980's to grow money trees from patents  were  backed by a change in the views of the court. In the midst of  the pro-patent current, a transformation occurred in the U.S.  judicial branch.    Among other things, pro-patent judges were appointed to the  Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which, as mentioned earlier,  was established in 1982, and since the 1980's, the pro-patent  line has taken root.    What became especially noticeable is the skyrocketing value  of intellectual property; huge amounts are being awarded in  damages for patent violations.    The biggest reason is a change in the method used to  calculate damage awards for patent infringements. The method  used before, a formula based on market values in the industry,  was replaced by another method, which is based on fictitious or  "supposed negotiations." In the "industry market value method,"  damage awards were computed by taking into account market values  (values current at the time of the signing of a licensing  contract) in whatever industry (automobile, semiconductor or toy  industry, for example) that was relevant to the patent case.  According to this standard, license fees could be as little as  1 percent of market value or, as was usually the case,  somewhere between 2 and 5 percent.    The criterion now used to decide the size of damage awards  follows this line of thought: "Hypothetically, if the patent  holder and the party who wants to buy a license from him were to  negotiate in good faith, how much would the fee for such a  license be?"    Compared to the "industry market value formula," which tends  to ignore the value of a specific invention, this criterion,  when used in determining the amount of damage awards, takes into  account the value in use, or usefulness, of the invention  itself. If the product, which was made on the basis of the  discovery, yields a high profit ratio, then, naturally, a high  licensing fee can be demanded and this, of course, means a high  damage award.    In fact, it is not unusual for U.S. courts to decide on  licensing fees as high as 15 or 25 percent of sales value and,  in at least one court decision, a licensing fee of 30 percent  was even recognized.    The second reason for the high value that intellectual  property demands is found in the system of triple damages  awards. In fact, in Sega's case, the company faced the threat of  having to pay three times the amount of actual damages incurred.  This system of triple damages awards is uniquely American and  has a punitive aspect to it. In U.S. patent law, when the court  finds a deliberate infringement has taken place, the injured  party (that is, the patent holder) can demand as much as three  times the amount of actual damages. Whether triple actual  damages is in fact awarded is left to the discretion of the  presiding judge. In Sega's case, the jury recognized the  infringement as being "deliberate," so there was a possibility  that this threefold rule might be applied. Sega ended up  settling out of court before the judge ruled on the final  amount, but with this triple indemnity hanging over its head,  Sega would seem to have been handicapped while negotiating an  "amicable" settlement.    Third, even when, as in Minolta's case, the infringement  involved only one part of the camera, the autofocus mechanism,  the basis for computing the licensing fee is the sales price of  the entire camera. In other words, when the courts recognize an  infringement for a part, damages are calculated on the basis of  the entire finished product.    Naturally, with this method, when the sales price of the  finished product is high, the amount of the damage award is high.    There is one additional reason for the high price of  intellectual property in the United States--the U.S. jury  system. No matter what, juries tend to decide in favor of the  small inventor over the large corporation and in favor of U.S.  enterprises over foreign enterprises. This tends to put Japanese  companies at a disadvantage. Not used to the jury system,  Japanese companies, in many cases, have also not adequately  prepared their defense strategy.    Moreover, in determining damage awards, juries have broad  discretionary powers and are said to have a tendency to grant  large awards.  <H5>  Learn From Japan's Successful Court Cases </H5>   There are cases where a Japanese litigant, having been  accused of patent infringement, goes to court and wins, and such  cases should serve as useful references.    In the case of Refac Technology Development Co. versus  Hitachi Ltd., Refac claimed to hold three patents for liquid  crystal display (LCD) technology and sued 108 companies,  including licensees, for patent infringements.    Objecting on the grounds of legal procedure, Hitachi claimed  that Refac had failed to conduct an adequate inquiry prior to  filing the suit. In April 1992, the Federal District Court in  California not only ruled again Refac, it ordered the company to  pay $1.5 million, including the defendant's legal costs.    Without letting itself be swayed into an out-of-court  settlement, Hitachi succeeded in cleverly piercing the other  party's Achilles heel.    Another company that fought its case successfully, this time  before a jury, is Izumi Precision Industries Co., headquartered  in Matsumoto City in Nagano Prefecture. In 1986, the company won  a patent infringement case brought against it by Philips of the  United States for violating the latter's patent for an electric  shaver.    The company, which has about 100 employees, deserves special  mention as an example of a small enterprise beating out a large  multinational corporation like Philips. A lot can be learned  from the case by Japanese companies, which dislike ligitation  and have a tendency to rush into out of court settlements.    Up until now, disputes and collisions over patents where  leading edge technology has been involved have been in areas  like the semiconductor field, music instruments, and fiber optic  telecommunications. After this, however, the areas where it  seems there is going to be a growing number of patent disputes  are biotechnology and computer software. In the United States,  technical resources have been directed into biotechnology from  very early on, especially into the National Institutes of Health  (NIH), which is located in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.    The earliest example of a patent dispute involving  biotechnology is the suit brought against Toyobo in 1987 by a  California company named Genentech over a medical product based  on gene recombination technology.    In the area of computer software, pressure from the United  States will probably grow over issues like Japan's use of  illegal copies of U.S.-made software. The prologue to such  disputes over intellectual property rights began in 1982 in a  case involving Hitachi and IBM. Today, 10 years later, the  issues are more pressing than ever. The United States has been  issuing warnings about illegal software copies being used in  Japanese offices for a long time, and the atmosphere is now all  but ready to explode.    Japanese companies mustn't forget that they are doing  business in the midst of an unprecedented pro-patent mood based  on national strategy. In order for Japanese companies not to get  drawn into a patent dispute with the United States, prior  investigation to determine whether or not they might be in  violation of an existing patent is very important. Research of  this sort should be carried out before a company even considers  introducing its product on the U.S. market. Companies should  also get the opinion of an attorney regarding the results of  their investigations. Such precautions are an added safeguard  against being found in "deliberate" violation of a patent, a  finding that opens the way for awards three times the amount of  actual damage.    Companies must also carefully save and manage internal  documents. Because of a peculiarly U.S. system based on a  "first-to-discover" [rather than first-to-file] criterion in  granting patents, if there is a lawsuit, it is important that  companies be able to show the opposing side all documents  relevant to the case.  <H5>  Development of Basic Technology Is Needed </H5>   One of the strategic measures that Japanese companies must  take against U.S. pro-patent offensive is the development of  basic technology. Business managers will probably see such  research as eating into their profits and would much rather turn  their attention to applied research, where the prospects for a  successful outcome are much clearer than the uncertainties of  basic research.    But the success of the top companies representing Japan in  the 21st century--whether they will be up there with the best  companies in the world--depends on how much technical resources  managers have invested in their companies and how successful  they have been in developing basic technologies. Without  changing their present attitudes, they can't expect their  companies to be world-class representatives of their respective  industries.    If companies have developed a store of basic technology,  when  and if patent disputes do arise, this technology can be used for  cross-licensing purposes. With the revenue from such licensing  fees, companies can also stabilize their operations.    The government also has a very important role in regard to  the development of basic technology. It is true, in certain  respects, that such technology doesn't add to a company's profit  line. Thus, we have to place some of our expectations on the  universities and the country's research institutes.    It would be difficult for Japan to imitate the United States  in terms of putting the latest technology into the hands of the  private sector through its development of military technology.  To the degree that Japan can't expect basic technologies to be  developed through such means, as a nation, we must prepare to  develop alternate means.    And to that end, there will have to be substantial increases  in the budgets of our universities and national research  institutes.    We should remind ourselves of the 1980's, when official  development assistance (ODA) was steadily increased even though  Japan's fiscal budget at the time was following a strict "no  growth" line. In compliance with constitutional restrictions on  Japan's contributing militarily to international situations, the  government instead increased ODA funding.    In much the same way, as long as there are restrictions on  the development of military technology, Japan must substantially  increase the budgets for universities and institutions carrying  out advanced research. It is in such a way that the development  of advanced, basic technology capable of surpassing developments  in Europe and the United States becomes a possibility. The  development of this kind of technology, moveover, will not only  contribute to Japan's technological development but also to the  transfer of technology to developing nations. The kind of  technological containment surrounding the United States freezes  existing differences in technology between such countries and  developing nations. Contributing to such differences is not the  path that Japan should take given its national policy toward  assisting developing nations. The U.S. National Institutes of  Health gathers leading researchers from all over the world,  including some 300 from Japan, and has become a mecca for  biochemical research. Japan, too, should establish a science and  technology center that is open to researchers in every field of  advanced technology, inviting those not only from the United  States and Europe but from the developing nations as well.    Promoting projects that can contribute to the world in this  way can be thought of as creating a link in the global  partnership espoused by Japan and the United States. Such  projects will be useful on a road that leads--not to  confrontations between Japan and the United States in what is  expected to be intensified trade conflicts between the two  countries over leading edge technology--but to harmony and  cooperation. Concrete projects of this sort, based on  discussions with the Clinton administration, should probably be  encouraged as joint enterprises between our two countries.    Hiroyuki Kamano.

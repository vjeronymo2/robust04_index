			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel is trying to heat up the security situation  in the south to confuse Lebanese Government officials and cover  up its crimes, notably the children killed in al-Nabatiyah a few  days ago by Israeli shelling. Tension and anxiety prevail in  the southern areas adjacent to the occupied border strip in the  wake of continued threats by Israeli leaders to launch a new  war. Israeli shelling of southern areas have continued and more  Israeli reinforcements have been brought to the occupied border  strip.    The resistance men and the occupation forces and their  agents  exchanged artillery fire yesterday. The Israeli forces  bombarded the al-Litani River basin, the outskirts of Zawtar  al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Arnun, al-Hamra' plantation,  the Habbush bridge, the outskirts of 'Arab Salim, Kafr Rumman,  al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, Kafr Tibnit, Jabal al-Rafi', Mlita,  al-Luwayzah, Jabal Safi, Mimis, Marj al-Zuhur, and 'Ayn al-Tinah.    Israeli helicopters flew intensive sorties over the line  separating the south and the occupied area and fired flares over  the western slopes of Mount Hermon. Israeli gunboats cruised  off the Lebanese coast between al-Zahrani and al-Naqurah  throughout last night. Israeli forces brought 15 artillery  pieces to the al-Khardali bridge and stationed them south of the  township of Blat.    This just in from a NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY CORRESPONDENT in  al-Nabatiyah: The Israeli forces bombarded the al-Sit Zubaydah  bridge, the outskirts of Habbush, and the road linking  al-Nabatiyah with Iqlim al-Tuffah between 0100 and 0430 today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshiyuki Shuto and Kyoko Isa of AERA's </F> editorial department entitled: "Seven Economists Make Urgent  Proposals on Measures the Japanese Government Should Take"]    [Text] "It is not too late yet. Japan has to present its  macroeconomic `numerical targets' as reference indices that are  not pledged to the United States." So said Isamu Miyazaki,  chairman of the board of directors of the Daiwa Research  Institute.    What macroeconomic numerical targets means is how much Japan  as a whole intends to reduce its trade surplus, not the import  targets of individual items. "To increase import volume,  expansion of domestic demand is indispensable. If the contents  of measures to expand domestic demand, including additional  amount in public works projects, are decided, the target of  decrease of our surplus will become visible to a certain degree."    Miyazaki seemed to regret the "degeneration" during the  negotiations between Japan and the United States.    In the beginning, macroeconomic numerical targets were  subjects of discussion, but they were unwittingly replaced by  discussions limited to microeconomics, winding up with the term  "numerical target" alone having risen to the fore.    Miyazaki is also opposed to setting import targets for  individual items because it may lead to managed trade. He  proposes that Japan return to the original point by saying, "It  is ridiculous to deny numerical targets outright. It must once  more recall why the negotiations between the two countries  started in the first place. Was it not intended to trim Japan's  trade surplus?"  <H5>  It Is Unwise To Leave Negotiations Broken Off </H5>   Chief researcher Masaru Takagi of the Fuji Research  Institute  agrees with what Mr. Miyazaki insists and said, "The five-year  target of reduction in trade surplus should be set at around 2  percent of the surplus ratio against GDP [gross domestic  product]. Since it stood at approximately 3.6 percent in 1992,  his insistence is to cut it about in half.    He added, "President Clinton's reference to a `trade war'  looked like intimidation, but it is bad for Japan to engage in  serious quarrels with the United States. Although the numerical  targets were rejected as managed trade, they are in  macroeconomic terms the same as `economic prospects,' the growth  rate the government predicts.    As a matter of fact, the figure 2 percent against GDP  mentioned by Takagi is quite close to the figure U.S. officials  mentioned publicly in the beginning.    What these two men insisted on amounts to an opinion in  support of so-called "cooperation with the United States," based  on the realities of the situation.    They seem to belong, however, to a minority among  economists.  At the end of January when the Japan-U.S. negotiations drew  closer to an end, a group of Japanese, mostly economists, made  public a joint appeal to the effect that "Japan should  resolutely refuse numerical targets." Prof. Kazuo Ueda of  Tokyo University, one of the proponents, criticized the setting  up of macroeconomic numerical targets saying, "The trade surplus  originates, theoretically, from monetary lending and borrowing  between countries. If that imbalance becomes an issue, such a  ridiculous situation will take place that no more lending and  borrowing will be allowed."    Those on the majority side, however, do not think it right  to  support the breakoff of negotiations. Prof. Ueda insists that  now is the time for Japan to declare to the world as well as to  the United States that differences in domestic and foreign  prices should be reduced to the levels of advanced nations.    To achieve this, easing of restrictions and more opening of  markets are necessary. When they are carried out, it is  expected that trade surpluses will be reduced in the end and  more than anything else consumers will benefit. "Of course it  will be accompanied by pain to domestic forces that try to  protect vested rights and interests. Prime Minister Hosokawa,  who held on to his refusal of numerical targets, seems to have  taken a step toward the point of no return."    As a countermeasure to the refusal of numerical targets,  Assistant Prof. Heizo Takenaka of the Keio University, points to  the shrinking of the price difference at home and abroad. He  said, "To cut the difference in prices, restrictions should be  lifted. If the share of U.S. products still does not increase,  then the blame rests with U.S. enterprises."  <H5>  `Important Commitment' From the President </H5>   Meanwhile, Prof. Iwao Nakatani of Hitotsubashi University  said a drastic symbolic policy is necessary in addition to the  easing of restrictions. He added, "Why do you not take a kind  of affirmative action to remedy discrimination toward  enterprises with foreign capital? For the foreign-capital  affiliated enterprises, Japan should take a daring stance of  seriously dealing with the matter of opening its markets by  exempting taxes and the like."    However, there is an entirely different opinion, such as the  following: Prof. Tsuneo Iida at the International Japan Culture  Studies Center says "the government is better not to take any  action from a strategic or tactical point of view." It is Prof.  Iida's view that the government, as a rule, should not intervene  in economic affairs in the face of the current situation. "In a  broad sense, now is the time when the U.S.-style industrial  civilization of the 20th century has come to a deadend. It is  wrong to think that the domestic recession, for example, can be  remedied by measures taken by the government." In Japan, many  people assume the current economic negotiations to be a de facto  failure, but Prof. Yoshihiro Tsurumi of the City University of  New York has a different view -- "Prime Minister Hosokawa has  wrestled an important pledge from President Clinton."    Prof. Tsurumi, who is an old acquaintance of Prime Minister  Hosokawa, and is said to be periodically writing or faxing  advice to him on economic policies, points out: At a news  conference after the summit, the President made remarks to the  effect "I am not asking for something like the semiconductor  agreement" and "objective criteria will not be used as a means  of sanctions against Japan."    "In other words, he apparently made clear remarks that  `numerical targets that equate to predetermined-share methods'  will not be employed, contrary to the Japanese interpretation.  Japan should not overlook this statement. It should  immediately call for a resumption of negotiations to confirm the  presidential statements."    Thus he advises that the best way is to work out new  measures  for easing restrictions by holding in check those in the U.S.  Government who favor applying sanctions against Japan.</p>

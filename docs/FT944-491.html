			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Gazprom looks for industry investors Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, and its merchant bank adviser, Kleinwort Benson, have drawn up a list of 10 to 20 western industrial companies expected to take stakes in the Russian company's planned share offering in 1995. Gazprom owns an estimated 24 per cent of world gas reserves and earned Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn (Pounds 3.4bn-Pounds 4.5bn) in hard currency in 1993. Its managers see the offering of equity stakes to western companies as a way of cementing existing or proposed relationships. These core investors are expected to provide what the Russian gas company described as 'a nugget of demand' for the 9 per cent tranche earmarked for sale. British Gas, currently negotiating with Gazprom over the latter's participation in the development of the giant Karachaganak gas field in Kazakhstan, said it had neither 'ruled in nor ruled out' participation in the equity offering. The non-committal stance is echoed by other gas companies, such as Enron of the US, which has an agreement with Gazprom to use Russian gas for possible power generation projects in Europe. Gazprom's existing joint ventures with BASF in Russia and Germany makes the German chemical company another candidate but Neste of Finland, another customer and partner, has said it will not take a shareholding. While customers of Gazprom, and integrated oil and gas groups, make up most of the group of 10-20 core investors, it is believed that suppliers of infrastructure like pipelines and compressors are also included. Proposals for the equity sale also include a placement with investment funds and other institutions, but it is thought the 'trade sale' to industrial investors will predominate. International bankers who have worked with Gazprom say they would view the presence of sophisticated industrial investors on Gazprom's share register as a 'very positive' development that would enhance its credit-worthiness. An audit is under way to present Gazprom's finances in a western-style format, but in the short to medium-term, industrial investors familiar with the sector might be better placed to gauge the true state of its performance.</p>

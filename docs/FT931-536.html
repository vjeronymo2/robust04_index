			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Manila set to deal with crippling power shortages: 'Brownouts' have been a factor behind the nation's largely stagnant economy THE PHILIPPINE Congress seems set to grant 'emergency powers' to President Fidel Ramos to deal more decisively with electric-power shortages crippling the economy. Much of the main Luzon island, including Metro-Manila, has been suffering daily power disruptions that have become longer - up to eight hours on some days - since the start of the year. The shortages, or 'brownouts', have been a significant factor behind the largely stagnant economy over the past few years. In spite of reservations in some quarters because of their association with the strong-arm regime of the late Ferdinand Marcos, the emergency powers are viewed as necessary by Mr Ramos's economy managers, whose campaign for reforms in the energy sector have run into opposition. The Philippines is due to resume negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on April 15 on a medium-term economic programme to succeed the 18-month stabilisation programme that expires tomorrow. Power-rate increases necessary to help narrow budget deficits are vital to the successful conclusion of the discussions. The Philippines, though enjoying historically high reserves of more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn), feels it still needs the IMF's 'seal of good housekeeping' because its traditional creditors anchor their own lending programmes to the country on such imprimatur. After the first round of negotiations last February ended without a deal, other multilateral and bilateral lending institutions have also suspended disbursements for power-related projects. Talks for new financing have also been frozen. The Philippines has presented to the IMF a 'growth-oriented' programme seeking financial support of some Dollars 800m-Dollars 1bn over the next three years. Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, expects this programme to be the last of the series the country has sought from the fund. Under the programme, overall growth this year will be targeted at 3.5-4.5 per cent, with inflation being kept at 7.5 per cent. The programme aims at putting the economy on track towards double-digit growth rates by the end of the Ramos administration in 1998. However, revenue-enhancement measures and power-rate increases have been imposed as conditions by the IMF. These are aimed at narrowing the fiscal deficit, a chronic problem that had led to high inflation for years. The power-rate increases, for the state National Power Corporation (Napocor), were approved by the government late last year, but a court case filed by a lawyers' group resulted in a restraining order issued by the Supreme Court. Without the higher rates, Napocor will not be able to meet returns that its creditors, mainly the World Bank, require on its operations. On the other hand, new power plant projects being planned by the government have also been facing delays resulting from complicated bidding procedures and in securing environmental clearances. Mr Ramos's emergency powers will be aimed at overcoming these circuitous procedures to keep energy programmes on the move again. The power-rate increases, for instance, would be reimposed, although the courts will still continue to hear opponents' arguments. Also expected to get a boost are the baseload power plants targeted to be on line by 1995. These plants will have a combined capacity of 1,600MW, enough to cover present deficiencies and provide a comfortable reserve that will allow Napocor to refurbish its ageing plants. Napocor's power plants are about 25 years old and prone to breakdown. Last year, the government devised a programme to put up six fast-track plants that should be ready to meet the increased demand during the summer months starting in April. The first of such fast-track plants, the 100MW Hopewell-2, is set to be inaugurated tomorrow. On April 11, two others are due for commissioning, with the rest due to come on stream over the next four months. The fast-track projects are gas turbines or diesel-fired plants, which make them expensive over long periods of operation. These plants, according to officials, can only be stop-gap measures, and the real solution to the problem is for construction of the baseload plants. Meanwhile, many large business groups appear to have relied more on their gut feelings rather than on Napocor's assurances on the fast-track plants, and have gone on to acquire their own generating sets. Private economists expect overall economic growth this year to reach only about 1.5 per cent, owing to the power shortages.</p>

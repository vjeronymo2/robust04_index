			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Management: In search of excellence - TQM is about to gain a higher profile closely modelled on a scheme that has been running throughout Europe for three years - will be launched in London today by Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The initiative - backed to the tune of Pounds 500,000 from the Department of Trade and Industry plus donations from 70 corporate members of the recently reborn British Quality Foundation - should further raise the profile of the business philosophy known as total quality management. TQM is the gospel of focusing everyone's attention in an organisation on the customer. It is sometimes criticised for being a complex statement of the blindingly obvious, but the approach to business that it represents has taken deep root in the US and Japan and continues to attract interest in the UK and continental Europe. In common with the famous US Baldrige Award and the European award administered by the European Foundation for Quality Management in Brussels, the new UK scheme has a competitive dimension. But according to Malcolm Franks, the BQF's chief executive, the establishment of domestic role models is a more important objective. 'It is our mission to get the message spread across the UK business community, and right down to small businesses.' In an important departure from the EFQM model, the UK scheme will have two distinct categories - one for businesses employing more than 250 people and one for those with fewer. The European entry criteria have been modified by the architects of the UK award, while, contrary to the European practice of having a first prize and runners up, there will be no outright UK winner. In terms of evaluation, however, the assessment process will be identical to that developed by the organisers of the European award. Thus companies' performance will be judged on the basis of nine weighted criteria, divided into so called 'enablers' (leadership, people management, policy and strategy, resources, and processes) and 'results' (people satisfaction, customer satisfaction, impact on society and business results). Franks admits that most of the evidence for improved bottom-line performance via TQM is anecdotal. But he believes that even if people argue about the appropriate weightings it is hard to find a more comprehensive list of ingredients for potential business excellence. As part of its plan to propagate TQM the BQF is also publishing a guide*, which will help organisations assess systematically their key activities and business results. To apply for the UK award - open this year to all 'for profit' organisations in the private and public sectors, UK and foreign owned - companies must have undertaken at least one self-assessment. The entry for smaller businesses is Pounds 500, for larger ones Pounds 1,500. Even unsuccessful competitors will receive a report, prepared by a panel of assessors, which Franks says should form a useful basis for any future improvement plans. The final date for registering entries is April 18, the closing date for submissions June 18. *For further information about the award and the guide (price Pounds 14 to non-BQF members), contact Kevin Shergold, director of Awards, British Quality foundation, Vigilant House, 120 Wilton Road, London SW1V IJZ.

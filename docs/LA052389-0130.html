			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC, AFFILIATES AGREE ON NEW INCENTIVE PLAN  </P> <P> The traditional system by which network-affiliated TV stations are paid by  their respective network for carrying its programming and advertising is being  revamped at the annual NBC affiliates convention here this week.  </P> <P> Instead of a straight deal in which the network and its affiliate agree to a  fixed fee that is based largely on how the station ranks in its market, NBC and  its stations have agreed on a new "incentive-driven" compensation plan that  could see rates vary.  </P> <P> Unlike NBC's attempt last fall to cut its approximately $145-million annual  compensation budget, the new plan initially will provide about the same amount  of compensation dollars, though they may be redistributed to the benefit or  loss of given stations.  </P> <P> Each station's slice of the pie, moreover, could also grow or shrink in  subsequent years depending on NBC's overall profitability.  </P> <P> In a news conference during the convention, which began Sunday and ends today,  NBC Television Network President Pierson Mapes said that the network would base  its re-evaluation of each of its 208 affiliated stations on four criteria: Its  local audience ratings in the 4-8 p.m. time slot leading into prime time; its  performance at other times of the day; the size of its market, and "subjective"  evaluation of the station's effectiveness in promoting NBC shows, along with  consideration of other financial factors affecting the station.  </P> <P> Mapes also said that compensation would be affected by how much NBC programming  a given station clears. Questioned whether that policy would interfere with  Federal Communications Commission rulings preventing networks from interfering  with a station's right to refuse unsatisfactory programming, he said a station  would have to fail to clear the majority of NBC programs in order to suffer  significant compensation loss.  </P> <P> Mapes added that in the first year of the new plan, NBC will avoid any major  changes in station compensation by "capping the spikes" at 20% -- that is, no  station will increase or lose more than 20% of its current compensation  regardless of performance.  </P> <P> Having compensation dependent not only on individual station performance but  also on NBC's overall success as a network "gives great incentive for everyone  to pull their oars in tandem" and may provide a model for ABC and CBS in the  future, Mapes said.  </P></p>

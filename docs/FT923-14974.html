			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: EFA Throughout the spring, investors in British Aerospace seemed prepared to look beyond the company's immediate problems towards the faint but emerging glimmer of a profitable medium-term future. Over the last few weeks, though, short-term anxieties have again been piling up. BAe shares have lost nearly 35 per cent of their value since mid-May as worries about prospects for the regional aircraft market have been compounded by growing doubts over the future of the European fighter aircraft (EFA). The next move in the shares depends on the fate of the Pounds 20bn project following Germany's refusal to give the go-ahead to the project. Reports that the UK cabinet is divided should hardly come as a surprise, given the icon-smashing opportunity for Eurosceptics and the approach of a very tough UK public spending round. The dilemma, however, is real. The option of a significantly scaled down version of the fighter - notwithstanding the scope for a few modifications - looks implausible given progress so far. Complete abandonment is not politically appealing for the Italians and Spanish either. Investors can only hope that governments swallow the manufacturers' argument that they can keep inside the original budget even with a three-nation programme. Ironically, the unresolved regional jet issue is probably more important for BAe's long-term health. And shares in GEC and Rolls-Royce have responded more calmly to this week's EFA worries.</p>

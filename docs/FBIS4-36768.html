			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Randah Habib in Amman] </F>   [Text] Syria has decided to postpone indefinitely a visit  Syrian Prime Minister al-Zu'bi was scheduled to make today to  Amman as an expression of its dissatisfaction with some  Jordanian press articles.    Informed sources in Amman have said that at 2000 yesterday,  Syrian officials summoned the Jordanian ambassador in Damascus  to inform him of the decision to postpone the visit, without  setting a new date.    Damascus has expressed dissatisfaction with a report  published by a London-based newspaper that said Jordanian Prime  Minister 'Abd-al- Salam al-Majali had told the Jordanian House  of Representatives that his country's reply to the Syrian  request to set up economic integration is that Amman believes in  coordination provided that the relationship is not based on  slogans and emotions alone.    Al-Majali quickly denied this report, accusing the newspaper  of publishing incorrect and distorted reports. He also stressed  the strategic ties between Jordan and Syria. In addition, the  Jordanian News Agency, PETRA, has asserted that King Husayn and  President Hafiz al-Asad have decided to hold bilateral meetings  in order to promote cooperation and integration and take  advanced steps on the road to unity and comprehensive  integration. While in Amman, Al- Zu'bi was scheduled to discuss  prospects for setting up economic integration between the two  countries.    Syria has also expressed displeasure over a Jordanian  newspaper editorial urging Amman to go ahead in its negotiations  with Israel without waiting for Damascus, which, according to  the writer, has made progress on its track with the Jewish state  without consulting Amman.    The Syrian newspaper TISHRIN replied to that editorial with  a  strongly worded article asserting the commitment of Amman and  Damascus to joint coordination.    At any rate, political quarters here have not ruled out the  possibility that Damascus also wants to express its dismay at  the Jordanian-Israeli agreements signed in Washington on border  demarcation, water, and security, especially transferring the  negotiations to al-'Aqabah and Elat in July.</p>

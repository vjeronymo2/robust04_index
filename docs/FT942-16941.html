			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Cummins optimistic over first quarter Cummins, the world's leading manufacturer of diesel engines, has issued an optimistic assessment of its first-quarter performance, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Indiana-based company said earnings in the three months to the end of March would 'meet or perhaps exceed' its results in the fourth quarter. On an operating basis, Cummins generated a profit of Dollars 52.6m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, in the final reporting period of 1993. The estimate conformed with the forecasts of most analysts. Mr Gary McManus, of Kemper Securities in Chicago, projected operating earnings of Dollars 1.60 a share, based on sustained demand for heavy-truck engines and accelerating growth in the mid-range market. The company added that its first-quarter revenues should reach the same level as in the final 1993 period, when it reported sales of Dollars 1.12bn, a 10 per cent year-on-year gain.</p>

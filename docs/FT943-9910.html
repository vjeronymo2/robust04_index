			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Germans fear delay in VAT changes German industrialists were warned yesterday that a new collection system for value added tax in the European Union might be seriously delayed. It was intended to streamline and simplify the cumbersome transitional system currently in operation. However, tax experts in Bonn fear that opposition to the new rules from other member states could put back the plan until the introduction of a single European currency, in 1999 or even later. The new system, requiring that VAT payments be levied at the rate applicable in a product's country of origin rather than its country of sale, is an important element in finalising details of the single European market. Talks in Brussels between German business leaders and the European Commission have produced no reassurance for their anxieties, the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT) said yesterday. They warned that the whole principle of collecting VAT on the country-of-origin basis, which would favour big net exporters such as Germany, could fail because of the current disagreements. 'The DIHT sees with great concern (the possibility) that the so-called country-of-origin system for VAT in the European Union could fail,' the German business lobby said. 'That principle must not be overturned.' The German industrialists have been much the most energetic in seeking to simplify the present transitional arrangements, which require companies to do all the paperwork for VAT returns formerly carried out by the customs authorities. They have expressed surprise at the relative lack of support from business groups in other member states. The DIHT said that much of the opposition to the new system came from EU governments who feared they would lose tax revenues if the VAT was collected at the point of manufacture and not of sale. But the transitional rules were imposing a substantial extra cost on companies in all member states. It warned that a 'costly compromise for the business community' which might emerge would be to delay introduction of the final system until the EU had been able to make significant progress towards creation of a single currency. Under present circumstances, that could well mean 1999 or even later.</p>

In order  to learn about the work of the new organization which began  operation under its new name last June, we recently talked with  relevant personnel at the Light Industry Council Building.    Being chiefly involved in the production of consumer goods  for daily use, light industry is closely related to the masses'  daily life and its production performance has a bearing on the  prosperity of our country's markets, and on economic and social  stability. In the past, due to the planned economy and its  difficulty in forecasting future market changes and of  guaranteeing an effective market supply, there was the recurrent  phenomena of commodity shortages or stockpiling. Since China's  implementation of the policy of reform and opening up, light  industry has achieved quicker development than other industries,  thanks to its early embracement of the principle of a market  economy. Since its inception, the Light Industry Council has  been faced with the problems of how to do a good job managing  the industry and its changing functions. The council's Chairman  Yu Zhen, who assumed the post six months ago, briefed us on  reform of the industry. He said the key to bringing about a  change from past planned management to the present industrial  management lies in changing functions. The council was required  to accomplish a quick change in its operations: A switch from  the past practice of taking complete charge of the production  and operation of enterprises to the present one of providing  them with good services.    Yu Zhen said that from now on the Light Industry Council,  while preserving certain administrative and management  functions, will devote more energy to employing industrial  management means well, and indirectly guide enterprises to  engage in production and business activities; in short, the  council will try to play its role mainly in giving enterprise  advise on decisionmaking. To achieve that end, the council  called on its personnel to change their workstyle and to show  that their role is to provide enterprises with services. As an  industry council, it should give priority to doing a good job in  industrial and regional planning, and industrial policy  formulation. It has been learned that a number of documents on  light industry's goals during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan";  documents concerning opinions on the basic thinking of the  long-term plan until the year 2010; and on further promoting the  industry's opening to the outside world, were formally  introduced at the recently-held light industry national work  conference. At the same time, an industrial policy -- with the  main contents of maintaining a high growth speed, readjusting  product mix, and adopting the strategy of developing  famous-brand products -- has also been publicized within the  entire industry. Light industry is also stepping up work on  devising measures to meet the challenges which will be faced  after China resumes its position in the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade. A report on formulation of those measures  will be disclosed in the next six months. In addition to doing  a good macroregulation and control job, the Light Industry  Council has also stepped up providing microlevel guidance to  enterprises. On the heels of the experimental publication of a  guide book on the restructuring and transformation of light  industry as well as on market information, the council recently  publicized the 1994 market trends for light industry through the  public media, and presented an analysis of the market prospects  for several categories of major light industrial products. The  council's purpose was to provide enterprises with specific  references for their decisionmaking.    Hu Dongguang, responsible person of the production and trade  department under the Light Industry Council, told us that except  for the maintenance of a small number of products such as  newsprint and edible salt on the lists of products under the  mandatory plan, it has included other products on the guidance  plan lists. He told us the phenomena of people at the former  Light Industry Ministry's busying themselves with the allocation  of funds and materials, and assigning planned quotas will not be  found at the Light Industry Council. The main areas of the  council's planning work include: Suggesting which line of  business requires restrictions and should not be expanded; to  point out the gaps that exist between domestic and foreign  business counterparts; and ways to transform and restructure the  industry. A lot of work needs to be done following the  council's establishment. For instance, there is the problem of  solving pollution in the paper-making industry, of redesigning  refrigerator compressors, and of changes in supply and demand on  the sugar market. All these require the council to work out  countermeasures.    Another aspect of improved industrial management lies in  the development of information services. The reporters visited  the expanded Chinese Light Industry Information Center and saw a  scene of bustling activity. Wang Qingren, an official of the  center, told us it provides information services to the  leadership as well as enterprises. He said: The center is  developing statistical and commercial information networks for  light industry; it is also building data banks regarding  imported equipment, large and medium-sized enterprises, and  light industrial products. Its services are available to  enterprises without any restrictions. In addition to the dozens  of light industry trade magazines, the council will step up  construction of an information medium by investing huge sums in  computers and other advanced means of communication to increase  the center's capacity to collect, store, and analyze information.    A source who worked in the Light Industry Ministry for many  years observed that changes at the Light Industry Council are  stunning, when you compare what it is doing now to what it was  doing before the policy of reform and opening up was introduced.  At that time, all light industrial products, which involved  huge volumes of a wide range of miscellaneous items, were  manufactured according to plans. A minor oversight here or there  was inevitable. For example, pots were once in short supply.  Nowadays, enterprises organize their production according to  market demand and markets are well stocked.</p>

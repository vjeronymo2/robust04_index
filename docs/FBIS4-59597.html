			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 15 May (MENA)--Arab League Secretary  General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stated that the League has  proposed a peaceful overture for resolving the Yemeni crisis and  halting the continuing deterioration in the situation there.  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, who is currently visiting Syria, said that  the message he sent to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  yesterday constitutes an initiative and contains elements that  would guarantee an end to the crisis.    In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Damascus, Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid said that the first thing that must be done is end  the fighting between the brothers there, noting that the Arab  League is holding intensive consultations and contacts with a  number of Yemeni leaders on holding a national dialogue instead  of continuing the internecine fighting. He refused to disclose  the details of the initiative now, noting that replying to the  initiative is now in the hands of the Yemeni leaders themselves.  He stressed that the Arab League is eager to see the delegation  now in Yemen succeed in its mission. The League, he said, has  decided to consider its mission in Yemen to be open-ended. In  the meantime, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid today received a lengthy report  on the situation and developments in Yemen.</p>

The UD Presidium  also declared it supported actions of the Polish president  serving this goal.    "It is of great significance for our region, and in the long  run for the entire European situation, to ensure security to the  countries which overthrew the communist rule having liquidated  in this way the division of the world into political blocs.  NATO countries, Western Europe and the U.S. should be conscious  of moral obligations in this field towards Poland and our part  of Europe and know how to translate them into political  decisions," the statement read.    "The UD has on many occasions supported the development of  good political, economic and cultural relations between Poland  and Russia as well as the idea of reconciliation between our two  nations. Thus it firmly disapproves of statements by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy which are designed to poison Polish-Russian and  Polish-German relations," the statement read and stressed it  should be a warning for the democratic world.</p>

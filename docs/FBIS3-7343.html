We cannot but heighten vigilance because the anti-DPRK smear  campaign of Japan is getting all the more undisguised at a time  when the situation on the Korean peninsula has been brought to a  critical phase by the new war provocation moves on the part of  the United States and the South Korean puppet clique.    As is known, the recent inspection activities performed by  the inspectors' group of the International Atomic Energy Agency  were sufficient to fully verify the non-diversion of nuclear  material at our nuclear facilities and definitely ensure the  continuity of safeguards.    Yet the paid media of Japan are charging the DPRK with  "exclusive use of nuclear technology for arms manufacture" and  "gaining time". This is aimed at harming the DPRK by inventing a  pretext at whatever cost and isolating and stifling it through  international "sanctions" and pressure.    By spreading false rumours about the "nuclear issue" of the  DPRK, Japan seeks a sinister purpose of justifying its ambitious  project of becoming a nuclear power.    The Japanese reactionaries must refrain from a smear  campaign  against others, properly liquidate the past, discard the  criminal design to make Japan a nuclear power and stop swimming  against the trend of the times.</p>

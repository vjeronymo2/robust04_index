			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The people of Togo will be going to the polls again  on Sunday [6 February], this time to elect members of a new  legislative assembly. Elections have been postponed several  times amidst complaints of fraudulent voters lists and about  procedures at polling booths. Edem Kodjo is leader of the UTD  [Togolese Union for Democracy] party. They have agreed to take  part in the election but with certain reservations. Our man in  Lome, Ebow Godwin, asked him about his main concerns.    [Begin recording] [Kodjo] There are still two problems, and  especially one--the problem of the Supreme Court. We don't  accept the principle that the constitutional branch of the  Supreme Court to be in charge of the elections petitions and we  are proposing that the whole Supreme Court should be in charge  of these petitions. It is a very important problem because we  don't trust the constitutional branch of the Supreme Court.    [Godwin] Why don't you trust the constitutional branch of  the  Supreme Court?    [Kodjo] Because the composition is too biased, and this  branch is composed only with the members of the RPT [Rally of  the Togolese People]. We cannot accept this kind of thing. The  second one is the problem of the distribution of the cards. We  are concerned because the district commissioners in charge of  issues in the districts are not very well equipped, and we are  not sure that the timing which has been adopted is going to be  fulfilled.    [Godwin] I see that you have fielded 70 candidates. Given  the right conditions, do you think that you and the other  opposition groups can beat the RPT party hands down?    [Kodjo] I think that we will make a good score. I am not  going to be too optimistic. The problem is that we don't know  how things are moving really inside the country, especially in  the north, in the northern part of our country. But we still  hope that the mobilization of our parties will make sure that  there are not too many tricks and make sure that our elections  are going to be fair.    [Godwin] Since the last attack on Lome, the slightest noise  made by even a burst lorry tire, you know, sends people running,  panicking, do you think this will affect the security situation  during the elections?    [Kodjo] Let's say that the security situation is not very,  very good. We in the UTD, we have proposed that we should be  given a period of what I called neutralization, which will  permit security to be reinforced, strengthened. Then people  will have confidence in themselves and confidence in the system.  Unfortunately, this proposal has been rejected. [end recording]</p>

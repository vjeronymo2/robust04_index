			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / House prices 'up 1% in March' HOUSE PRICES rose by 1 per cent in March according to Nationwide, the second largest building society, Scheherazade Daneshkhu writes. The rise follows a fall of 1.4 per cent in February and a 1.2 per cent rise in January but Nationwide expects further price rises following the Budget's increased stamp duty threshold of Pounds 60,000. The society hopes this will help lure first-time buyers. Mr Brian Davis, operations director, said: 'Transaction levels have begun to move ahead and recovery is likely to continue as the normal springtime increase in activity comes through. The current low level of mortgage rates and the particularly competitive fixed-rate deals on offer appear to be attracting more people back into the market.' The average house price in the UK was Pounds 52,311 last month, according to Nationwide. House prices were 5.2 per cent down in the year to March.</p>

The 14 associations, including the Haitian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry [CCIH], asked General Raoul  Cedras to go into retirement and President Aristide to appoint a  prime minister and lift the embargo. They also asked the UN  Security Council and the OAS to immediately lift the embargo  that they refer to as genocide, and to recognize the damages  that this embargo has caused the country. The employers'  associations have further asked the Armed Forces to guarantee  the security of all legislators and to work on the formation of  a new police force and the law separating the Army from the  police, as provided for by the Constitution. In their statement,  the Haitian employers had a special message for Gen. Cedras and  President Aristide:    [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] The employers'  associations which, with an open mind, brought their support to  the president of the Republic in July 1993 are today requesting  from President Aristide, in compliance with Article 136 of the  Constitution, the appointment of a new prime minister as soon as  possible, in view of assuring the regular running of the state;  the withdrawal of his request to impose an embargo, in order to  put an immediate end to the resultant disastrous consequences;  and to initiate a policy of social appeasement.    To the legislative chambers, given that the role of the  legislative chambers is to study and vote on the necessary laws  and provisions for the efficient running of the state; given  that they have the duty to defend the superior interests of the  nation, the employers' associations request from the legislative  chambers, first: the immediate cessation of the empty-seat  policy and utilization of all indispensible measures for the  running of the parliament and application of the Constitution;  second, that the law of general amnesty be voted within six  working days; third, that they immediately begin the procedure  for ratification of a prime minister as soon as he is appointed,  as provided for by the Constitution; fourth, that they formally  make a commitment to study and vote the law on the creation of a  police force, as provided for by the Constitution.    Of the Haitian Armed Forces, in order to create confidence  among the legislators and the entire nation, and to allow for a  definitive release of the dramatic situation that is gripping  the country, the employers' associations are asking the Armed  Forces command, first, to formally reassert their commitment to  guaranteeing the safety of the legislators in the fulfillment of  their duties; second, to work with all concerned parties on the  creation of the police force provided for by the Constituion;  third, in collaboration with national interests and the  international community, to work on the formation of a police  force and on modernization of the Haitian Armed Forces. Of Gen.  Raoul Cedras, they ask for reassertion of his request for  retirement, effective immediately following passage of the law  on amnesty.    Of the UN Secruity Council and the OAS, considering that the  embargo imposed by the international community constitutes  genocide against a poor, defenseless, voiceless population;  considering that the imposed embargo is contrary to human  rights, as written in the UN charter, unfeasible to life, work,  health and social service; considering the inestimable damage  caused by this embargo to the environment; considering that it  is necessary to compensate for the harm done by this unjustified  embargo; considering the necessity of stopping the increasing  distrust of the Third World countries toward the superpowers and  powerful internatonal organizations, the employers associations  urge the UN Security Council and the OAS; first, to lift the  genocidal embargo; second, to recognize the damages caused the  Haitian nation through the economic sanctions and to make a  commitment to compensating them as soon as possible through some  means that will guarantee boosting the national economy; third,  to formally acknowledge to the private sector its commitment to  see democracy implemented in Haiti through means other than the  genocidal embargo that is odiously and unjustly punitive, not  only to the innocent national majority, but also to the entire  nation.    In conclusion, the employers' associations are convinced  that  the application of these provisions should without a doubt  immediately disentangle the political crisis. The unquestionable  good faith of all Haitians is indispensable to a definitive  solution to the crisis. The involvement of all social sectors is  also indispensable to a long-term resolution of the structural  crisis of the country, all of which are essential conditions for  a definitive state of law, adaptable to a newborn democracy.    Signatures are by the following: Haitian Chamber of Commerce  and Industry; National Association of Importers and Distributors  of Pharmaceutical Products, National Association of Distributors  of Oil Products, National College of Haitian Engineers and  Architects, Association of Agricultural Producers, Association  of Coffee Exporters, Association of Haitian Insurance Agents,  Association of National Producers, Haitian Association of  Construction Firms, Haitian Association of Travel Agents,  Inter-American Businessmen's Association, Hotel and Tourist  Association of Haiti, Center for Free Form and Democracy, and  the French-Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

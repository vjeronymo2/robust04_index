			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Rate cut trend hits D - Mark THE German currency came under pressure again yesterday driven down by US heavy selling following a rush of interest rate cuts throughout Europe, writes Peter John. Weakness in the D-Mark resulted in strength for the US dollar and a good performance from the French franc, Danish krone, Italian lira, Spanish peseta and the Scandinavian currencies. Meanwhile, the pound dropped as the UK was seen as missing out on the opportunity to ease lending levels along with the rest of Europe. A general move away from the D-Mark gathered pace as the Bank of France announced a long awaited cut in its key rates. The central bank cut the intervention rate to 6.45 per cent from 6.75 per cent and its 5 to 10-day lending rate by half a point to 7.25 per cent. Heavy selling sent the D-Mark down to FFr3.4850, the first time it has been back below FFr3.50 since the recent round of speculative attacks on the French and Belgian currencies began a fortnight ago. Dealers said US investment funds were shifting their holdings from Germany to France but the D-Mark fall was stemmed fairly quickly and there were reports that the Bank of France was taking advantage of the currency change to buy D-Marks and replenish its reserves which were depleted by the ERM crisis at the end of July. Consequently the D-Mark recovered to close at FFr3.4930, but still down on the previous day's close of FFr3.5120. The D-Mark also fell sharply against the dollar. However yesterday's dollar rally was reigned in later. Dealers suggested that the Bundesbank may have been selling dollars and there were reports that Japanese officials had expressed concern over the dollar's strength. Heavy speculation that the Bank of England would announce a cut in the 6 per cent base rate yesterday remained unfulfilled and the pound slipped. Sterling fell half a pfennig against the D-Mark to DM2.4675. Against the dollar it slid to Dollars 1.4730 from Dollars 1.4870 previously. Elsewhere in Europe, the Bank of Spain cut its money rate to 9.25 per cent from 9.5 per cent and the peseta rose to Pta79.98 to the D-Mark from Pta80.02 previously. The Danish Central Bank lowered its two-week CD rate by half a point to 8 per cent and its discount and key deposit rates to 7.25 per cent from 7.75 per cent. The Danish krone rose to DKr4.0120 to the D-Mark, up from DKr4.0255 previously. The Irish Central Bank cut its short-term facility rate to 7 per cent from 7.5 per cent, effective Tuesday, and its overnight deposit rate to 3.75 per cent from 4.25 per cent.</p>

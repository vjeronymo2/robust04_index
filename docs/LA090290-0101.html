			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's position is that there can be no negotiations with  Iraq until the Iraqi army withdraws from Kuwait. Unfortunately, even an  unconditional withdrawal, while humiliating, would not address the real  problem.  </P> <P> As long as Iraq maintains a huge army, the U.S. presence in the Middle East is  mandatory.  </P> <P> The real answer to the current problem is disarmament. One way to disarm is  with a hot war that destroys the Iraqi military machine, but perhaps this goal  can be achieved without a hot war.  </P> <P> We should agree to negotiate with Iraq while the armies hold their current  positions. Our initial position should be that the U.S. will withdraw its  forces if Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait, leaving its weapons behind;  better yet, destroy them. Iraq's standing army must be reduced to a level  required for defensive purposes only, and facilities for producing chemical and  nuclear weapons must be dismantled. Iraq should be made to promise not to  invade any of its neighbors.  </P> <P> Chances are Saddam Hussein will not accept this sincere offer, but you couldn't  accuse us of refusing to negotiate. It also puts a proposal before the world  that expresses our sincere desire for peace.  </P> <P> ROBERT S. DE WOLF  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

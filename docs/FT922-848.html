			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd attempts to calm Euro-sceptics MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, faced hostile questioning from Conservative Euro-sceptics yesterday as he sought to soothe opposition within the party to the Maastricht treaty. Mr Hurd said the European Community had an opportunity to embody into its workings the principle of decisions being made at the lowest appropriate level. Several of the 50 Tories who attended the meeting of the backbench Europe and foreign affairs committee, remained unconvinced that a greater emphasis on 'subsidiarity' would prevent an increase in European centralisation. 'The unpersuadables were out in force,' said one MP. Next week the Commons will have its first opportunity since the Danish referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty to debate the European Community. Mr Hurd is expected to open a general debate, without out a vote, on Thursday. Yesterday Mr Hurd said Maastricht was a 'prize' worth building on. The conservative party is to take a first step towards widening public information on its finances. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, is to be consulted on the feasibility of publishing a similar amount of information as in companies' annual reports. That could include, for the first time, detailed figures on debts. Mr Tim Smith, the Tory vice-chairman with responsibility for party finances, hopes he may be able to make the changes before 1992-93 accounts next summer. However, he has ruled out publishing a breakdown of donations.</p>

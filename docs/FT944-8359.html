			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Far left and right make running in Krasnodar: A poll battle in south Russia Battles for the regional and city parliaments in Krasnodar Krai, southern Russia, are a microcosm of the disorder among Russia's democrats and the organisational strength of the far right and left. The party campaigns leading up to yesterday's election - the results of which will be known today or tomorrow - have been dominated by two groups, both of which fielded some 30 candidates: on the left, the hardline Communists united in a group named Otechestvo, or fatherland; and on the far-right, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. The far-left groups which make up Otechestvo were able to put aside their sectarian differences, though they proved to be too extreme for the official Russian Communist party, which ran separately. Mr Igor Kolomiitsev, editor of the Kubansky Kurier, one of the main regional papers which enthusiastically supports the LDPR says the party has several leading members but that they all 'submit to the leadership of Vladimir Volfovitch (Zhirinovsky). We have one leader, because we know that he is the person people know and they will vote for us through him'. Mr Alexander Kovalov, an organiser for the liberal Russia's Choice party, led nationally by the former prime minister, Mr Yegor Gaidar, said: 'We tried to unite but the people in Moscow won't have it. Each of them wants the president's chair.' This view was illustrated by the absence of democratic leaders in the campaign. The local administration also put forward some 30 candidates to the regional and city parliaments under the banner of 'Our Group, Our home'. A leading light of that group is the city's mayor, Mr Valery Samoilenko who was fired last week by President Boris Yeltsin for his 'refusal to fulfil the president's decrees'. Local opinion was divided on whether this would harm him, or increase his popularity. Besides controlling the Kurier newspaper, the Zhirinovsky faction also produces a party paper called Pravda Zhirinovskovo (Zhirinovsky's Truth) and runs a local television station, M Studio, which last week was running and re-running videos of Mr Zhirinovsky's tours of the area. Mr Kolomiitsev says a group of wealthy local entrepreneurs have given financial support to the LDPR. They support the party organisation, and put up the money for, and advertise on, the television station. 'The main issues here,' he says, 'are crime and corruption: crime associated with the immigrants who have come here from the Caucasus because of the wars, and the corruption of the local administration. This is a special area. A great deal of oil and metals goes out of the port of Novorossiysk; the people in power take a slice of that and put it in bank accounts in Cyprus.' It was corruption, says Mr Kolomiitsev, which turned him from a democrat to an avid supporter of Mr Zhirinovsky. He had collected a dossier on the local administration, and went last November to Moscow to present it to President Yeltsin. After a series of appointments with officials, he was told by a fellow petitioner - with a similar dossier  - from Irkutsk that the latter's evidence had persuaded Mr Yeltsin to sign an order dismissing a top area official, only to revoke it two days later. 'I understood there was no good going on. I had an introduction to Vladimir Volfovich from his local leaders. I went to see him and was immediately shown in and had a long talk. . . . I became a member and never regretted it. I think Russia needs a period of order - not fascism, not camps - but a period where the guilty are punished.' This sentiment is widespread in Krasnodar. Nikolai, a pensioner who would not give his last name, made a torrent of complaints about migrants and about crime. 'They have no fear of punishment,' he said. 'At least in Stalin's time you could be sure of equality and of fear before the law. Now you need someone in power who says, right, you're guilty, you've murdered, you will be shot. Do that three or four times and you'll have peace.' For all his robust views, Nikolai supports not the Communists or the LDPR, but Yabloko, the reformist group led by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, which fielded six candidates The liberal parties, too, have had to take note of local sentiment. Russia's Choice, according to Mr Kovalev, has three principles: the clean-up of local government and publication of the budget; unity among Kuban Cossack organisations; and 'protection of Russian speakers'. Mr Kovalov says that 'there are many peoples living here peacefully - but the migrants who have come in from the struggles in the Causcasus cause huge problems.' Businessman Sergei Frolov, of the Economic Freedom party, who has spent Rbs20m of his own money on the campaign, says: 'I don't talk to people about economic reform, they don't understand these things. I talk about ensuring water supply, getting new trams, getting stable prices'. 'We need a sense of our own history. We need to create a middle class and property rights. People don't understand this. But they will respond to people of character and energy: everything depends on the individual in our politics.' Mr Kolomiitsev agrees, but draws a different moral. 'It's not like the west . . . Here everything is myth, rumour. People believe the opposite of what they hear from the authorities. They respect strong characters. That helps us now, which is why we're winning.'</p>

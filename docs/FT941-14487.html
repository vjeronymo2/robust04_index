			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / People: Cable and Wireless tempts second BP exec Cable and Wireless, the international telecommummunications group, has poached another senior executive from British Petroleum. Stephen Pettit, 42, chief executive of BP's petrochemicals business, has been appointed to the newly created post of Cable and Wireless's managing director for Europe. Pettit is following in the footsteps of James Ross, a former managing director of BP, who took over as Cable's chief executive in April 1992. Like Ross, who had spent 33 years at BP, Pettit is a veteran BP man, having joined the company in 1974 after university. In 1981, BP paid for him to get his MBA from Insead. Ross says Pettit has been hired for his 'extensive experience of international management in a number of very competitive markets'. Prior to taking on the petrochemicals job Pettit had been responsible for for BP's oil trading business. He will be responsible for Cable's activities in the European Union - excluding the UK - together with Austria, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, the Baltic states, Eastern Europe and the western CIS. He will also be responsible for coordinating all Cable and Wireless mobile activity around the world. Pettit is to join the European management board, chaired by Mercury chief executive Mike Harris, and will also join Ross's chief executive's committee. Harris, former chief executive of Midland's Firstdirect telephone banking business who switched to Cable and Wireless in October 1991, says that he wants Pettit to unlock 'the synergy between the investments that the group has made in Mercury and those that we look to make in Europe'.

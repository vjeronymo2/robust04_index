			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Groupe Bull employees accused in arson case Agents of Groupe Bull, the French state-owned computer manufacturer, sought huge increases in insurance cover for a warehouse in the two months before a fire devasted it in 1991, according to evidence in an arson case which began in Chicago yesterday. A suit filed by Allendale Mutual Insurance of the US claims that the June 1991 fire, which destroyed stock worth about FFr584m (Pounds 70m) at the warehouse in northern France, was caused by employees or associates of the French company. In pre-trial documents, the insurers allege that employees of the computer company started the fire at the warehouse - a central inventory collection point for most of Europe - to hide depreciating obsolete machinery stored there, and to obtain insurance money and fresh capital from Bull's creditors. In Paris yesterday, Bull vigorously denied allegations of arson and said it was counter-suing its former insurer for making the accusation. Bull claims Allendale wants to avoid paying a Dollars 100m insurance claim. The French company said it firmly rejected the allegations and that an investigation by French authorities, completed at the beginning of this year, found no evidence of arson. According to Bull, the warehouse was owned and operated by a company that was not an affiliate. The fire destroyed mainly excess inventory of Zenith Data Systems, the personal computer manufacturer acquired by Bull in 1989. The opening of the case follows a protracted dispute between Bull and Allendale Mutual. With some 1,800 exhibits and 40 scheduled witnesses, the case has already tested the patience of the presiding judge, who says he will give both sides only seven days in court to air their dispute. Judge George Marovich will submit his written decision some time after October 1. The suit is being heard in federal court in Chicago because Illinois is the US base for Bull Data Systems, the legal name for Bull's US operations. The suit comes as the French group is preparing for privatisation. Last week, Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said he hoped to reduce the government's stake in Bull to below 50 per cent before next spring's presidential elections. The privatisation is due to take place through the sale of stakes to industry partners, with a separate share offer to employees. A large public offer of shares was deemed difficult because of the financial situation of the group. Bull has lost more than FFr15bn since 1990, although a restructuring package being implemented by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the chairman, has sharply cut losses this year.</p>

Governor Nikolay Podgornov has set the local  duma elections for 20 March. But president's representative  Guriy Sudakov has publicly described the future duma at a press  conference as a "device for voting through projects prepared by  the administration."    Professor Guriy Sudakov delivered this sharply worded  statement after analyzing how many documents on the local duma  elections and local self-government organs signed by Nikolay  Podgornov are in line with the Constitution and the president's  Edict "On the Basic Principles of the Organization of State  Power in the Components of the Russian Federation."    "The system of powers in the region should be balanced,"  according to president's representative Sudakov. "But since  October we have only had executive-administrative power  operating here. In addition, the temptation has arisen to  exploit the upcoming elections to consolidate that priority  forever. Under the president's edict, the rayon self-government  organ is to be formed from representatives of the  self-government organs of villages, settlements, and so forth.  But according to the statute signed by the Vologda Oblast head  of administration, the rayon assemblies will be formed solely  from the heads of local administrations."    In his opinion, representative power in Vologda Oblast will,  if formed according to Governor Podgornov's conception, be  subordinate to executive power. Among other things, the  governor has set tough deadlines within which the future oblast  duma must submit legal acts to him for signature.    The membership of the Vologda Oblast Duma has been  determined  by the governor at 15 deputies, only six of whom will work on a  permanent basis. The governor has allowed workers in organs of  executive power to combine their duties with deputy status.  President's representative Sudakov fears that on 20 March the  people of Vologda will get an administrative-industrial lobby  obedient to the governor instead of a proper legislative organ.</p>

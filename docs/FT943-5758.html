			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Move to reorganise local councils under attack Government pressure to standardise local authority services and limit councils' autonomy to spend money raised locally is 'in conflict with local democracy', the Joseph Rowntree Foundation warns in a report today. The report says international comparisons suggest that local government in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the US is more accountable than in the UK and is viewed in more 'positive' terms. It suggests that these countries are helped by a 'relatively stable structure of local government' which is often based on an unchanging basic unit, the municipality. This is a basic local tier of councils representing very small populations. These countries also distinguish between services where there is wide public interest, and where the interest is local. In Germany regional authorities control education while municipalities make decisions about refuse collection. The government's plans for local government reorganisation involve moving further away from successful foreign models, causing further instability, creating larger 'lowest tier' authorities, and combining more functions in one council. According to the foundation the 'lowest tier' in Great Britain are the districts, with an average population of 110,000. The Local Government Commission proposes to replace these in England with new unitary authorities, combining the powers of districts and county councils, with populations of between 150,000 and 250,000. In France, the lowest tier 'commune' authorities have an average population of 1,600. Municipalities in Germany, Spain and the US have average populations of 7,500, 4,800 and 7,000 respectively. According to the foundation autonomy is also helped by a wide local tax base, but less than 20 per cent of all local revenues are retained locally in Great Britain. This compares with 43 per cent in France, 41 per cent in Germany, where there is a local income tax, and 38 per cent in the US, which has local property and sales taxes.

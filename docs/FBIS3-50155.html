This statement was made yesterday by Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys following his return from a visit to Lithuania.    According to Baudys, the reason is that the Lithuanian Army  does not have a clear concept for its structure or for its  armament program.    Baudys said that the Lithuanian Army, in essence, has no  equipment; however, a much better atmosphere prevails in it than  in the Czech Army. According to him, this is because Lithuania  feels more than the Czech Republic that it has to guarantee its  own security, first and foremost, alone.</p>

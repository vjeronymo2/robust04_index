			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Redland floats Belgian arm The Benelux brick interests of Redland, one of Britain's biggest building materials companies, have been floated on the Belgian bourse with a valuation of BFr8.2bn (Pounds 161m). The flotation raised about BFr1.5bn, which will be used to pay off debt incurred in expanding the business. Redland said that its beneficial interest in the company, which has been renamed Terca Brick Industries, had been reduced to 35 per cent. The Benelux interests were known as Redland Koramic Bricks, jointly owned by Redland and Koramic, a privately owned Belgian industrial group. Last April Redland Koramic merged with the brick interests of Van Biervliet, also a privately owned Belgian group, reducing Redland's interest to 42 per cent. Terca will have annual turnover of Pounds 135m and produce more than 1bn facing bricks a year from 25 sites in the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany.</p>

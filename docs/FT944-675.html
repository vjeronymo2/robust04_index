			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan acquires share stake in Banesto Banco Santander said yesterday it had sold 1 per cent of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled banking group it acquired in April, to the US bank JP Morgan. The sale, at Pta830 per Banesto share, is worth Pta5.8bn (Dollars 44.3m). The development renews Morgan's association with Banesto and cements its relationship with its new owners. The US bank is now part of a core of shareholders brought in to Banesto by Santander that includes the Royal Bank of Scotland, First Fidelity and Metropolitan Life, of the US, a group of Mexican investors led by the Modelo drinks group and the Barcelona-based savings bank La Caixa. Morgan was the financial adviser to the Banesto board which was dismissed by the Bank of Spain a year ago, scarcely four months after it had led international equity issues that raised almost Dollars 700m for the Spanish banking group. In the rights issue last year the Corsair fund, a Morgan-managed portfolio backed by US institutions, invested Dollars 175m in Banesto to own nearly 8 per cent of the banking group. Corsair's Banesto equity was, however, diluted to 3.1 per cent following a Pta780bn rescue plan that involved after a write-down of the par-value of Banesto shares and the institution's recapitalisation. The Banesto core shareholder group that Morgan has joined controls 9 per cent of Banesto. Santander now owns 48.5 per cent of Banesto following the disposals and after placing 6.3 per cent of its equity in the bank with Santander shareholders in a 3 Santander shares for one Banesto share offer priced at Pta783 per Banesto share. Mr Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, second vice-chairman of Santander and a member of Banesto's board, said yesterday Santander did not foresee any significant variation of Banesto's shareholder structure in the mid term.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / ITN profits at record Pounds 5.6m as property troubles recede Independent Television News achieved its largest ever pre-tax profit last year - Pounds 5.6m before exceptional items on a turnover of Pounds 83.3m. The figure represents a considerable turnaround in three years for the commercial television news organisation. Then there was a cost overrun of Pounds 10m and a growing financial crisis because of lease charges on its new headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, London. There was a fear that the loss on the lease on the near-empty building could reach Pounds 25m over five years. But the building has been filling up slowly, mainly with media organisations. The latest tenant will be The European newspaper which plans to move from Orbit House, part of the former Maxwell empire. When it takes over the seventh floor in the summer, the ITN building will be 95 per cent occupied. ITN was virtually forced to become a profitmaking organisation by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. Previously, it was jointly owned by all the ITV companies. The act said 51 per cent of ITN had to be owned by non-ITV companies by the end of this year, although the consortium that now owns ITN hopes to persuade the government to change its mind.</p>

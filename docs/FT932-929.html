			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Buying flurry lifts gold price GOLD'S PRICE jumped by Dollars 5.80 a troy ounce to close at Dollars 373.80 in London yesterday. The sudden change followed some days when the price had drifted gently downwards. But trading was dull and one dealer described yesterday's volatility as 'a blip in a quiet market where professional moves are exaggerated'. New York professional investors started the flurry on Tuesday. Having failed to drive the gold price down below Dollars 366 an ounce, they changed tactics and had much more success pushing it the other way. The market was quiet overnight because of a holiday in Hong Kong but the London market reflected the New York activity. Gold touched Dollars 375.20 an ounce at one stage before falling back. Trade in physical gold was slow. 'Demand is falling away, particularly in the Far East and producers are doing no hedging,' said Mr Andy Smith, analyst with Union Bank of Switzerland. He pointed out that, since the gold price sprang to life in April, imports of the precious metal to Dubai had dropped by about 25 per cent from the monthly average in the first quarter, those to Singapore were 30 per cent down and those to Taiwan were down 50 per cent. Only in Hong Kong, where jewellers were stocking up because China was easing its currency export regulations, had there been a rise in gold imports in April.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Benefits for DRG Group pensioners not poor Sir, Your article 'How does your pension rate?' (September 11/12) is based on a questionable survey by Bryn Davies. It appears to be the result of an analysis of the 101 leading pension schemes (only 1 per cent of all UK schemes). It is at best misleading, using only a few criteria and ignoring often crucial discretionary benefits like pension increases. DRG was a fairly large plc which was taken over and broken up in 1989 and no longer exists. The DRG Pension Fund retains only a small number of employed members but mainly consists of a large number of pensioners and deferred pensioners. It has no relevance in such a survey. Mr Davis knew of this so it is most surprising that DRG is included. In any event, the DRG Fund provided good benefits that compared favourably with similar companies and workforce. One feature not fully valued in the 'analysis' is that immediate unreduced pensions are provided for members made redundant after age 50. This has been particularly welcome during the high number of redundancies in past years. In broad terms, it doubles the value of the benefits for a member at age 50. To state that DRG 'offers their employees among the poorest pensions packages in the country' is untrue. This, though, is history. The relevant feature for members is that we secured all the large surplus at the time of the takeover for their benefits. For our pensioners this means that increases to their pensions will now be greater - another feature overlooked in the analysis. The article has already caused members to be concerned at the security of benefits which is totally unwarranted. We are dealing with a number of inquiries from them and as a result administration costs payable by the fund will increase.

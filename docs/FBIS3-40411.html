			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bernard Bombeau: "Thomson-CSF Modernizing </F> MiG-21/23's and Su-22"; introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] Thomson-CSF and its subsidiary Sextant  Avionics are coveting a deal for the modernization of between  550 and 600 MiG-21's, a few hundred MiG-23's, and 500 Su-22's.  The deal is worth a total of from 25 billion to 30 billion  francs.    The French equipment manufacturer unveiled technical details  at the Dubai Air Show regarding two agreements signed with  Mikoyan and Sukhoi (see our issue No. 1439) to retrofit  MiG-21's, MiG-23's, and Su-22's in partnership with the  Phazotron firm, which produced the Doppler radar used on the  MiG-29.    Those modernization programs are aimed primarily at Asian  and  East European countries wanting to upgrade their combat fleets  consisting basically of older generations of Russian aircraft.    In charge of the project at Thomson-CSF is Gerard Le Breton,  director of operational projects. He estimates that the  potential market (excluding the PRC and the CIS [Commonwealth of  Independent States]) totals from 550 to 600 MiG-21's, from 400  to 500 Su-22's, and a few hundred MiG-23's. That comes to over  1,000 aircraft in all, not counting the related opportunities  that will arise if the same program is extended to  first-generation Mirage F1's and Mirage III's (from 200 to 300  aircraft)--all told, a gold mine worth from $4 billion to $5  billion.    One coveted customer, India, has already expressed a need to  modernize between 100 and 150 of the 450 to 500 MiG-21's it  still has in flying condition. But while described as a  priority, that program has not yet been the object of any  official call for bids. Indian intentions regarding an  industrial effort expected around 1995 should become clearer in  coming weeks or months.    Thomson-CSF is not the only beneficiary of special  agreements  with Mikoyan. Dassault Electronics, in partnership with the  Russian research institute GosNIIA, signed a three-party  agreement last June covering a more limited modernization  program (see the end of this article). There is also especially  stiff competition with the Israeli firms IAI and Elbit. They  have joined with Romania's Aerostar to propose in particular an  independent modernization program for from 100 to 120 MiG-21's  belonging to the Romanian Air Force. The Israelis have a letter  of intent for four prototypes. Russian participation is not out  of the question.    The competition also includes Great Britain's GEC-Marconi,  which is offering retrofits centered on the Blue Hawk radar, and  Italy's FIAR with a variant of its Grifo.    In the face of their competition, Thomson-CSF and Sextant  Avionics are banking on an extensive and particularly ambitious  modernization program. Le Breton says: "We are the only ones  proposing a multirole weapon system based on a complete  architecture meeting the needs of each customer and capable of  being adapted equally well to MiG-21's, MiG-23's, Su-22's,  Mirage III's, and Mirage F1's. Each deal is subject to a prior  authorization request depending on the customer. The only  restrictions imposed absolutely are political in nature and  concern such `sensitive' countries as Libya, Iraq, or Syria."    The proposal by Thomson-CSF/Sextant includes no fewer than  20  different items of equipment meeting the Mil-Std-1553B bus  standard, many of which are already certified (or in service) on  French and foreign aircraft. Other items of equipment, including  radar, are in development.    At the heart of the architecture in question is a wide-angle  (26 degrees) so-called smart head-up display [HUD], all of whose  functions (symbol generation, display, and keyboard interface  with the inertial system) are integrated within a single unit.  That HUD is being offered with an OTAL200-1300 camera for image  interpretation.    The head-down display, consisting of multifunction  liquid-crystal displays, is capable of displaying images from  the Rubis navigation and targeting system.    Also as part of its package, Thomson-CSF is offering the  Totem gyrolaser inertial guidance system--which its subsidiary  Sextant is also producing for a retrofit of the Air Force's  Transall aircraft--combined with a NSS100 Code P GPS [global  positioning system] receiver that comes as a separate unit and  is capable of horizontal accuracy of 18 m. Another piece of  equipment being offered and meeting NATO standards is an SC10  Mk-XII IFF [identification friend or foe] unit in protected mode  (Secure). The field of electronic warfare is covered by the  installation of a Sherloc radar warning detector, a Barem  jamming transmitter, and an ER/IR chaff dispenser.    In cooperation with Phazotron, Thomson-CSF is currently  developing the Phathom multifunction and multitarget Doppler  radar based on Russian Kopyo (MiG-29) and French RDY technology.  In that development work, Thomson-CSF is directly involved in  the refinement of digital and signal processing systems, while  Phazotron is working on the transmitter, receiver, antenna, and  power supply. The two equipment manufacturers are working  together to refine an analog processor.    Characterized by a compact, small-diameter antenna weighing  no more than 120 kg, the Phathom is a radar in the generic 40 Nm  class with a detection range of from 50 to 60 km in the case of  aerial targets, 100 km in the case of ground targets, and 30 km  in the case of targets at sea.    In air-to-air mode, it is reportedly capable of detecting 24  targets and tracking six using discontinuous data and four in  intensified pursuit with the possibility of engaging two at a  time using target-seeking missiles with active warheads.    According to Mikoyan, the weapon system on the modernized  MiG-21 (MiG-21-93) will be able to reach targets flying at an  altitude of between 30 and 20,000 meters.    In air-to-surface mode, the Phathom, combined with a  head-down display, can be connected with the Rubis FLIR  navigation and targeting pod, the TMV630 laser rangefinder, and  the CLDP laser designator (day/night) pod with modular  capability (TV/IR). In the two last-named configurations, it can  also be combined with the HMD (helmet-mounted display) (20  degrees) that is being offered as an option.    Thomson-CSF feels that the Phathom is currently the best  radar available in the retrofit market. "Its performance puts it  in the same class as the RDY, although it has less detection  capability because of the small diameter of its antenna."    Although the current tendency is to use existing armament  (air-to-air and air-to-surface) of Russian origin, the weapon  systems on the modernized MiG's and Su-22's will make it  possible to use missiles or laser-guided bombs made in the West.  Thomson-CSF is adding to that the possibility of using a  subsidiary infrastructure: mission simulator, NCS (Matra) flight  preparation systems, and peripheral equipment.    In Gerard Le Breton's opinion, mounting the Phathom on  Russian fighter planes of an older generation is only the first  stage of a long-range development that it will be possible to  apply to more modern aircraft such as the MiG-29, the Su-27, and  even the Mirage-2000 10 years from now.    But despite that, Thomson-CSF rejects any idea of competing  with anything currently in production: "Our proposal is directed  at air forces whose temporarily limited budgets do not permit  them to consider the acquisition of modern fighter planes, which  cost in the neighborhood of from $20 million to $35 million per  unit."    Depending on the options requested by each particular  customer, retrofitting a MiG-21 or Su-22 may cost from $3.5  million to $8.6 million (from 20 million to 50 million francs).  The price of the radar alone borders on $1 million, to which can  be added $3.5 million for an air-to-surface mission profile  based on a CLDP with TV/IR head. "We are more than open to  various forms of financing and industrial cooperation that may  include subcontracting or technology transfers," says Le Breton,  expanding his remarks to encompass the future: "By offering  modern equipment on old aircraft, Thomson-CSF is also making a  number of potential customers aware of our firm's capabilities  and of the most recent products that French aircraft  manufacturers have available in the market for new products."    The architecture being proposed by Thomson-CSF/Sextant for  the Sukhoi Su-22 consists of the following:    1. Radar warning detector (Sherloc).    2. GPS/Glonass (NSS 100P) receiver.    3. Radio altimeter (AHV-6).    4. Gyrolaser inertial guidance system (Totem).    5. Helmet-mounted display (HMD).    6. Smart head-up display (SHUD).    7. Multifunction liquid crystal displays (MFD-55).    8. Radio navigation: VHF/UHF (ERA 2000); VOR/ILS (NR-810A);  TACAN (NC12); and IFF MK XII (SC-10).    9. In-flight refueling system and probe.    10. On-board instruments.    11. Multifunction Doppler radar (Phathom).    12. Laser rangefinder (TMV630).    13. Digital mapping.    14. Mission preparation system (CINNA 3PN).    15. Mission computer with recorder and mission playback.    16. FLIR navigation and targeting pod (Rubis).    17. TV/IR laser designation pod (CLDP).    18. Armament (missiles).    19. ECM pod (Barem).    20. Electric generator (Auxilec).    21. Equipment cooling system.    22. Chaff dispenser (cartridges).  <H5>  Dassault Electronics: Different Philosophy </H5>   In its program for modernizing the MiG-21-93 in cooperation  with Mikoyan and the Russian research institute GosNIIAS,  Dassault Electronics has taken a different approach than  Thomson-CSF. Considering "the urgency of the demand," Dassault  Electronics is focusing on "fast response" with a program that  is less ambitious in terms of both cost and deadlines. "Rather  than proposing a retrofit that might take 30 months, we prefer  to offer a more focused modernization available in less than two  years." The program announced in June 1993 has two parts: a  modular bus/computer (bus 1553) unit that can handle Russian or  Western digital weapon systems and a sophisticated electronic  warfare unit developed in close cooperation with Mikoyan and  based on a new EWS-21 radar warning detector that was inspired  by a system recently adopted (over its competitor Sherloc) by  the French Air Force for modernizing its Mirage F1's. The entire  package has an estimated cost of 15 million francs.</p>

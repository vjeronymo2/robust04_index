			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 39.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Every 30 days. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The PDLI recommended that the parenthetical phrase ``(i.e., every 30 days or less)'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.19(c)(1) be deleted as an unnecessary guideline with which compliance could be impossible. The OBES presented similar comments that the final rule should reflect administrative and logistical realities by specifying such period for waiver review to be 60 days. Basic TRA payments should be made once a waiver has been issued until such time as the waiver is revoked, and not require documentation of such waiver reviews on an ongoing or routine basis. The CEDD also recommended that the frequency of waiver reviews be changed to 60 days. The MESC recommended that waivers be reviewed every 90 days, while the ODHR recommended that the State have more flexibility in the frequency for reviewing waivers. The NJDL recommended that States be given authority to establish procedures for reviewing appropriate waivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A major objective of the 1988 Amendments is to enroll adversely affected workers in training programs to help facilitate their return to employment as quickly as possible. The Department believes that, when the training requirement is waived for an individual, proper program administration necessitates regular reviews of waivers issued by the State agencies. The frequency of such reviews at 30-day intervals is reasonable to carry out the provision requiring adversely affected workers to be enrolled in training for purposes of receiving TRA, particularly in light of the fact that TRA is a weekly benefit program and the 30-day rule only requires review approximately every four weeks. Section 231(c)(2)(B) provides that ``If, after submitting to a worker a written statement *&blank;*&blank;* a State or State agency finds that it is feasible or appropriate to approve a training program for such worker pursuant to the requirements of section 236(a), the State or State agency shall submit to such worker *&blank;*&blank;* a written statement that revokes the certification *&blank;*&blank;*.'' To review waivers less frequently than every 30 days would not give the sense of urgency reflected in the law on placing adversely affected workers into training programs as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the comments highlight an omission in the regulations, in that, in individual cases, when circumstances change, the need to revoke a waiver may arise earlier than the next periodic review, and, accordingly, necessitate action to revoke the certification before the next review date. Therefore, &sect;617.19(c)(2) is amended to require revocation in individual cases at any time a change in circumstances occurs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver determinations appealable. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MESC, commenting on &sect;617.19(c)(4), stated that waiver actions should not be appealable determinations. If training is being denied, the denial and any appeal should come on the training determination, not on the waiver. Otherwise, duplicative appeals and confusion of issues will result. The waiver form should contain an explanatory statement, such as: ``If you disagree with this waiver action, you have the right to appeal any denial of training or trade readjustment allowances (TRA) that results from this action.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See discussion under item 34, above. A determination on the feasibility and appropriateness of training, and the reason(s) therefor, constitutes the critical determination on whether a worker is subject to the EB work test regarding claims for basic TRA. Equally important is the relevance of a waiver in some cases. For example, a waiver is not appropriate concerning entitlement to additional TRA, because additional TRA is payable only while the worker is actually participating in training, and, in that case, the EB work test is not applicable. Similarly, a waiver is not appropriate during breaks in training. It is not needed if the break is not more than 14 days. A waiver is not appropriate if the break is more than 14 days, since payment of basic or additional TRA in this case would be inconsistent with sections 231(a)(5), 233(a)(3), and 233(f). It is clear, therefore, that the determination resulting in the issuance, denial or revocation of a waiver presents justiciable issues, and, accordingly, determinations relating to waivers must be subject to the right of appeal and review. To deny the right of appeal and review on justiciable issues cannot be justified. Paragraph (c)(4) of &sect;617.19, therefore, has a sound basis in law, and is unchanged in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recording waivers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NYDL, commenting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.19(d)(1), stated that recordkeeping and reporting of waivers issued and revoked by reason constitutes a very real problem in that the agency relies on time consuming manual systems. Any requirement in this regard must be accompanied by appropriate levels of administrative funding, specifically for this purpose, in order to yield reliable data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations at &sect;617.19(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) track the language of section 231(c)(3) of the Trade Act, which provides that the Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on the number of waivers issued and the number revoked. As explained in item 14 above, matters concerning the administrative funding for all TAA activities are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department and will be addressed further in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.60 when it is published. No special funding category is contemplated for this item. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

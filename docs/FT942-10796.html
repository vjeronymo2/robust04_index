			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The pay demon not yet dead: The upward trend in UK average earnings could be a matter for concern Workers at the cashmere spinning company Todd &amp; Duncan in Kinross, Scotland, have just won an 8.5 per cent pay rise, more than three times the current inflation rate of 2.3 per cent. Pay rises such as this have contributed to the recent upward trend in UK average earnings. Last October, earnings were increasing at an annual rate of 2.1 per cent, but by February, the latest month for which figures are available, the rate had reached 4.4 per cent. But as pay-setting enters its busiest season in Britain, there is only a glimmer of anxiety among employers about the possibility of wage inflation being spurred by the strengthening recovery and decline in unemployment. The relaxed mood of Mr Neville Barnes, personnel director at Todd &amp; Duncan, is part of the explanation. Instead of managing 440 workers for the company's most hectic production period from February to September, as he did last year, he now has only 360 workers producing the same amount of cashmere. Pay for the 360 is now based on a system of annualised hours, which allows managers to cope more efficiently with the seasonal peaks and troughs of consumer demand, and obviates the need to employ temporary contract workers. 'This way you can also reduce excessive overtime during one part of the year and short-time working at another,' says Mr Barnes. The 8.5 per cent pay rise - a one-off reward for shifting to the new system  -is more than paying for itself through higher productivity, so labour costs per unit of output are lower than last year. Across manufacturing industry as a whole, unit labour costs are no longer falling, as they did for periods of last year, but they are scarcely rising. Average earnings increases of about 4.5 per cent are being almost matched by productivity gains. According to the Confederation of British Industry it is such gains that are driving up pay, and not the slight upturn in inflation (now heading towards an annual 3 per cent) or even the recent increases in tax and national insurance contributions. Nevertheless, the slight rise in pay settlements and the likelihood that unit labour costs across the economy as a whole will increase by at least 2 per cent this year is causing some concern among employers. 'There is a danger that the old inflationary habits will reappear as the recovery gets under way,' says Mr Ian Thompson of the Engineering Employers Federation. Even small increases in unit labour costs may be bad news, he says. 'To remain competitive in some sectors you need falling unit labour costs so you can pass on lower prices or higher quality to the customer.' The CBI, too, which was recently claiming that British pay-setting was now more disciplined than Germany's has done an about-face. After a period of pay laxity induced by unification, German unit labour costs are now falling, and Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, warns that 'other countries in Europe are now tackling their cost competitiveness in a determined way'. While employers are not yet talking about a new wage-price spiral, they are markedly less sanguine than the government, which continues to claim that inflationary pay bargaining - and even the annual pay rise - is a thing of the past. The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, last week celebrated the steady decline in collective bargaining (which now covers fewer than half of all employees) and the idea of the 'going rate'. 'It has taken over a decade for both employers and employees to accept that an annual pay rise need not be inevitable,' he said. Inflation continues to set a floor beneath pay rises for the large majority of employees, however. And, as Mr Kevin Gardiner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, says: 'Real wage growth has been substantially stronger during this recession than during the last.' The low absolute level of earnings increases has disguised the fact that, relative to inflation, wage growth continued strongly through the recession. According to Mr Gardiner, real disposable earnings rose only 0.8 per cent in 1980-82 but 7.8 per cent in 1991-93. 'Employers and employees are tacitly colluding, at the expense of the unemployed, to keep wages and prices higher and output lower than it could be,' he says. Events at Todd &amp; Duncan, where 80 jobs (albeit seasonal ones) have gone, appear to support this view. The Bank of England, too, warns the government that the UK's pay-setting system remains biased against employment-creation. In its latest inflation report, the Bank writes: 'Wages are still strikingly unresponsive to changes in unemployment. Either the labour-market reforms have yet to bear fruit, or other forces of inertia are at work to offset them. 'The most important factor preserving the bargaining power of employees may be the scarcity of their skills and an unwillingness to recruit from the ranks of the unemployed . . . those in work, whether members of unions or not, will still be able to push for real wage increases that, in aggregate, keep others out of work.' Skill shortages helped to stimulate wage inflation in some sectors at the end of the 1980s, and there are some signs that they are now returning. According to a recent Department of Employment survey, 17 per cent of employers felt that the skills of their existing workforces were inadequate to meet business objectives. But there are more prosaic reasons for the recent upward drift in pay. Last year pay negotiations were dominated by a continuing decline in inflation, stubbornly high unemployment and a 1.5 per cent pay policy in the public sector. This year none of those conditions applies. Inflation is rising slightly, unemployment is falling, and despite the overall pay bill freeze in the public sector, most workers will receive rises of close to 3 per cent. Further, as Mr Bill Callaghan, the chief economist at the Trades Union Congress, points out, many workers will try to claw back the effect of income tax and national insurance increases this year through higher pay. One recent two-year pay deal - at the tractor maker Massey Ferguson - has recognised the effect of the tax increases by giving a higher rise this year than next. The scope for clawing back the effects of tax rises is probably limited, however. Many economists expect earnings to rise by just over 4 per cent in 1994 with inflation at just over 3 per cent for the year. But the combined tax rises will cut income by more than 2 per cent, leaving a net reduction in income of more than 1 per cent. The final factor contributing to the pick-up in pay is the tenacity of 'pay drift' - the gap between what is agreed in settlements, still running at 2.5 to 3 per cent, and actual earnings increases, running at about 4 per cent. Overtime payments are usually an important part of the gap but overtime is falling at present. Bonuses and profit-sharing, especially in the financial services sector, may be a more relevant explanation for 'pay drift' and may lie behind the jump in service sector earnings from 3.1 per cent in January to 4.8 per cent in February. Some economists worry that whatever the benefit of an increase in performance and profit-related pay, it may bring the cost of permanent upward pressure on earnings. Thus the message to employers from organisations such as the CBI is: do not fritter away the competitive gains of the past few years. Mr Robbie Gilbert, employee relations director at the CBI, concludes: 'Given our history, one can never be confident that our pay problems are behind us.'</p>

Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex has developed a new index called the Mexico Index, based entirely on the value of shares or related American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') of widely held Mexican companies traded on the NYSE, Amex, or that are National Market (``NM'') securities traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). The Index contains securities of highly-capitalized companies with major business interests in Mexico. The Exchange states that these companies have been drawn from a variety of industries, including construction, telecommunications, banking, shipping, tobacco, media, and food and beverage, to reflect the diversity of the Mexican market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Index Calculation and Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index is calculated using a ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. In an attempt to more closely approximate the industry weightings within the Mexico stock market, the two highest capitalized components within the Index are given higher weightings, 24% and 12%, respectively, while the eight remaining Index components are weighted equally at 8%. Accordingly, as of the market close on June 17, 1994, a portfolio of ten Mexican component securities was established representing a hypothetical investment (rounded to the nearest whole share) of $24,000 in the largest capitalized component in the Index, $12,000 in the second largest, and $8,000 in each of the remaining Index components. The value of the Index equals the current market value ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the Index components divided by the Index divisor. The Index divisor has been established to yield the benchmark value of 175.00 at the close of trading on July 22, 1994. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter from Howard A. Baker, Senior Vice President, Derivative Securities, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated August 3, 1994. The Amex initially proposed to utilize a divisor calculated to yield the value of 231.00 at the close of trading on June 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third Friday of March, June, September and December, the Index components will be ranked in descending market capitalization order and the Index portfolio adjusted by changing the number of whole shares of each component so that the largest capitalized Index component once again represents 24% of the Index value, the second largest component represents 12%, and each of the remaining components represent 8%. If the number of components in the Index increases to greater than ten, the Amex will continue to weight the two components with the highest market capitalizations 24% and 12%, respectively. The remaining components will then be weighted equally. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  For example, if two new components are added to the Index, the two securities with the highest market capitalizations will be assigned a 24% and 12% weighting, respectively, while the remaining ten Index components will be assigned a 6.4% weighting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If it becomes necessary to remove an Index component, the exchange will either add an Index component having characteristics that will permit the Index to remain within the maintenance criteria specified in the Generic Narrow-Based Index Approval Order (and also contained in exchange Rule 901C), <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  or will permit the Index to be calculated based upon the remaining components (but no fewer than nine) until the next quarterly rebalancing, at which time the Exchange will replace the component so that the Index will continue to have at least ten components. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange has chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day following the quarterly adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994) (``Generic Narrow Based Index Approval Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that it has routine experience making regular quarterly adjustments to a number of its indexes and has not encountered investor confusion regarding the adjustments, since they are done on a regular basis and timely, proper, and adequate notice is given to market participants. Particularly, an information circular is distributed to all Exchange members notifying them of the quarterly changes. This circular is also sent by facsimile to the Exchange's contacts at the major options firms, mailed to recipients of the Exchange's options related information circulars, and made available to subscribers of the Options News Network. In addition, the Exchange will include in its promotional and marketing materials for the Index a description of the ``modified'' equal dollar weighting methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Looking toward the anniversary  of 17 June [1953 uprising in East Berlin], CSU [Christian Social  Union] General Secretary Erwin Huber has called for a "decisive  examination" of the "legacy of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of  Germany] regime." If the successor party PDS [Party of  Democratic Socialism] could get 25 percent of the votes in the  local elections in the states of former East Germany, this is a  serious danger for stability and internal peace in Germany,  Huber said in Munich today.    Huber called on the SPD [Social Democratic Party] to clearly  dissociate itself from the "SED-PDS." Any cooperation with this  "left-wing extremist organization" has "to be taboo for a  democratic party." The CSU will never let the "demons of  dictatorship" again threaten the freedom of people in Germany.</p>

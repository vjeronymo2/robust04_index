			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WINFIELD SUES HIS BOSS, SEEKS FOUNDATION FUNDS  </P> <P> Dave Winfield sued his boss, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, for  more than $1 million that the outfielder said is owed to his foundation, which  fights drug abuse.  </P> <P> In a lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Winfield charged  that Steinbrenner has not complied with an agreement to pay $300,000 a year to  the David M. Winfield Foundation.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner, in a statement, said a yearlong investigation of Winfield's  foundation discovered "numerous questionable practices" that would be outlined  in a countersuit to be filed Monday.  </P> <P> Kenneth E. Warner, Steinbrenner's attorney, said the Yankees will complain in a  suit of excessive and wasteful limousine travel expenses amounting to more than  $40,000 over a 2-year period, excessive and disproportionate management and  administrative costs and other items.  </P> <P> Winfield's suit seeks $450,000 that Winfield says Steinbrenner has not paid in  quarterly payments owed since Sept. 1, 1987. In addition, the suit seeks the  balance owed, for a total of $1,050,000, for the 10-year life of the contract.  </P></p>

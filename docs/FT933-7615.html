			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Arts: Grown-up graffiti - Jean-Michel Basquiat His trajectory was that of a shooting star. Discovered on the streets of New York City by an art critic before he reached the age of 20, where he was scrawling graffiti (signed: SOMA) on the walls of Soho and Greenwich Village; quickly taken up by dealers and gallery curators alike; followed by an astonishing, though fitful, flow of work that ended abruptly at the age of 27, when he died of heroin addiction like two of his heroes, the musician Jimmy Hendrix and the singer Janice Joplin. That is the life-story of Jean-Michel Basquiat, quintessential New York painter of the 1980s, who recently enjoyed a major retrospective at the Whitney and is currently having a second large show, in Europe this time, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Lausanne. Basquiat, Puerto Rican on his mother's side, Haitian on his father's, was both more and less than the legend of his life. Though born in Brooklyn, his childhood was not a deprived one. Though his art blazes with anarchy, he was not the wild, untutored boy that his early sponsors sometimes pronounced him  -and perhaps even hoped he might be. He drew from childhood onwards and his mother nurtured his passion for painting and drawing by taking him regularly to the major museums and galleries of New York City. The work itself is full of painterly references. The Lausanne show charts his progress year by year, though that word progress is itself a misnomer. In a sense, there was no progress - it was all too hurried, too explosive, too frenetic. What his paintings and recordings record, in canvases that teem with signs and symbols, words combining street slogans and menu listings, images of African masks, cartoon heroes and much else, are the violent disharmonies of his own inner and outer worlds - that trick he had, for example, of scribbling a statement across a painting and then immediately crossing it out. Basquiat has been many things to many critics. Because he painted images of Lester Young and Charlie Parker, and himself played the clarinet and the synthesiser, he is said to be predominantly a jazz artist and his paintings and drawings the visual equivalents of jazz improvisation. Because his mature work grew out of a graffiti-based art and he once took it into his head to list the per capita incomes of the states of America down the middle of one of his canvases, he is said to be a political artist. Because he used so much language in his work and juxtaposed his words with such unpredictably humorous results, he was, according to yet another, a concrete poet of the first order. Two things are certainly true. In the words of one admirer, 'he lived his life like a fire: he went out with the coals still hot.' And he had a marvellously insolent way - like the young Bob Dylan - of seeing off some of the parasites who surrounded him: interviewer: 'Do you have any Haitian primitives at home?' Basquiat: 'What, you mean people?'</p>

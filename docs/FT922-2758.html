			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (4): A more relaxed grip on the reins - The Economy / The imbalances underlying the economy will not allow it to grow healthily for long unless comprehensive reform is taken further China's economy has an alarming propensity to boom and then bust. Twice in the 1980s, the brakes had to be slammed on its rapid growth because of dangerous inflationary pressures. The latest risk is that overheating will again rapidly recur. In China's typical cycle, the growth period sees rapid expansion of credit, money supply, investment and consumption, and is followed by tighter control of credit, investment and prices. However, this quickly creates budgetary pressures, because of chronically loss-making state industries, and unemployment. So the cycle is repeated. The tendency for severe cyclical swings is inextricably linked with pressures caused by economic reform. The transition from a planned to a market economy is difficult, and Chinese reformers are anxious to avoid the chaos which has occurred in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. The slowdown in economic reform, though often identified with the political crackdown on pro-democracy elements after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, began at the end of 1988 as inflation approached 20 per cent even though prices for many leading goods remained controlled. A period of austerity reduced the inflation rate to 2 per cent in 1990, and the economic growth rate to just over 3 per cent compared with the 10 per cent annual average for the 1980s. The reins have been steadily relaxed since then. However, Chinese economists are worried that large pent-up enthusiasm for reform around the country has been let loose this year by Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. Mr Deng's endorsement of the economic progress made in the south, especially in Guangdong, has inspired provincial officials elsewhere to move faster on reforms. As part of the reform process, which has been under way for 13 years, provinces have far greater autonomy even though they must still apply to Beijing for approval of significant projects and they still depend on the central planners to approve, for example, new electricity capacity. Professor He Jianzhang, director of the institute of economics in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, says: 'We have some concern about overheating of the economy in the provinces. The provinces are focusing on taking big steps forward despite their different conditions and circumstances.' Prof He says that some of the inland and remote provinces will have to accept slower growth rates because they lack the infrastructure to support rapid growth. 'We believe that the economic growth rate should be conducive to the overall improvement of economic efficiency.' Introducing better macroeconomic control while at the same time freeing up the economy will be the greatest challenge for China's planners in the coming years. An attempt to avoid the cyclical swings might, for example, begin with changes in the way in which credit is allocated. Currently, banks operate with quantitative credit controls set by the central government. The role of interest rates in the granting of credit remains limited. However, giving a greater role to interest rates would involve substantial reform of the banks, which still carry out a large amount of state-directed lending to loss-making industries. Secondly, it would have a significant effect on borrowers, since loss-making enterprises would face higher cost of credit which they would be unlikely to be able to afford. This, in turn, would increase the urgency of industrial, price and social reforms. Macroeconomic control is made more complex by the rapid growth of new enterprises - private sector industry and rural enterprises which have been developing rapidly and which operate on more commercial lines than state industries. Both suffered severely in the slowdown of 1989 and 1990, whereas inefficient state industries, which still account for about half China's industrial production, retained the protection of government subsidies, fuelling the budget deficit. There are signs of greater discipline. Dou Jianzhong, executive vice-president of CITIC Industrial Bank, says that in the face of fears about renewed overheating: 'Bankers are reminding themselves to keep a clear mind, and not to do what they are told'. In a normal market environment where banks had greater freedom (CITIC Industrial Bank, for example, is not allowed to make long-term loans to back industrial investment), they would be happily looking forward to the next few years' business. Economic growth is expected to be healthy. The Asian Development Bank, forecasting before the effects of Mr Deng's pronouncements became clear, projected growth in 1992 and 1993 just exceeding last year's 7 per cent. Industrial production was forecast to grow 15 per cent this year, compared with 14 per cent in 1991. These predictions mask big disparities between different regions of the country, since growth is particularly concentrated in the south. Consumption spending is expected to accelerate as a result of rising urban incomes, and investment will rise because of heavy spending on infrastructural development. However, the budget deficit will remain large, and inflation in some areas is probably much higher than the official figure - consumer prices officially rose 3 per cent last year and the ADB projects them to increase 7 per cent in 1992. Unemployment is heavily understated by official figures, since state industries keep unneeded workers on the payroll. However, with a growing proportion of the labour force outside the state sector and more vulnerable to cyclical swings, it will increasingly be a problem the government cannot ignore. Reforms of state industries will inevitably involve job losses. China's trade position is expected to remain healthy, even though imports are likely to rise because of higher consumption and investment spending and relaxation of import controls. Following the push towards economic reform this year, the flow of foreign investment, especially into the south, is likely to remain strong in the absence of political upsets. However, the imbalances underlying the economy will not allow it to grow healthily for long unless comprehensive economic reform is taken further. Price controls, subsidies and other protections necessary to maintain a grossly inefficient public sector will increasingly be incompatible with development of a strong market-oriented economy. This could spell political problems, because the economic strength is concentrated in the south and the weakness in the north.</p>

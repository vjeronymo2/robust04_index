			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOREA DIALOGUE: SLOW BUT STEADY;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION UNCERTAIN, BUT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO KEEP TALKING  </P> <P> To some, there was no progress. To others, some, but not enough. Yet last  week's meeting between South and North Korea was at least a beginning. Seoul  and Pyongyang finally opened a dialogue after a 45-year estrangement.  </P> <P> The historic talks between Prime Minister Yong Hyon Muk of North Korea and  Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon of South Korea -- the most senior officials ever  to meet formally since the peninsula was split in 1945 -- ended without a major  agreement but on a promising note. There was some compromise, frank discussions  of their differences and a commitment to continue the dialogue next month.  </P> <P> The fact that the meeting even occurred, and in Seoul, was a breakthrough in  itself. It was uncertain whether Pyongyang would make good on its plans to meet  with its most hated rival until the very last minute. Then Pyongyang pressed  for joint entry into the United Nations, an end to joint U.S.-South Korean  military maneuvers and the release of political prisoners jailed last year for  their unauthorized visits to the north. Seoul preferred cultural and family  exchanges and joint economic ventures to build confidence first before future  discussions on military issues.  </P> <P> They overcame an impasse when Seoul said it would not pursue an application for  separate entry into the United Nations. In turn, Pyongyang appeared willing to  resume border talks between Red Cross organizations in the north and south to  allow humanitarian family exchanges. They had been cut off in protest of joint  U.S.-South Korean military exercises.  </P> <P> Seoul is right in moving cautiously towards its Communist neighbor. It has  reason to be mistrustful of North Korea's Kim Il Sung, who started the bloody  Korean War in 1950. His 42-year Stalinist regime is becoming increasingly  isolated with the transformation of the Communist world. He agreed to a meeting  only after the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic ties with South Korean President  Roh Tae Woo's government.  </P> <P> The capitalist south and Communist north have little in common except for their  people. Their reconciliation at best will be long and difficult, their  reunification uncertain.  </P></p>

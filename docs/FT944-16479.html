			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (7): Western visitors lead the way - Theodor Troev finds that prospects for the tourist industry are picking up The Russians are back, enjoying their holidays in some of the best resorts along Bulgaria's sandy Black Sea coast - not shepherded in large groups as they were under the communist regime, but strolling around with the self-confidence of big spenders. 'Now everybody wants to attract Russians,' says Dotko Dotkov, general director of Grand Hotel Varna, Bulgaria's only five-star hotel on the Black Sea, and the first to be privatised earlier this year. Ironically, it is often German tour companies that are bringing the Russians back. Big operators, such as TUI, have become aware of the reviving market in what was for decades the Riviera of the former Eastern bloc and their branch offices in Russia - better organised than local competitors - have been more successful than most in selling Bulgarian holidays. But the recent increase in arrivals from the east has not yet reversed a trend which began after the collapse of communism. Until then, Bulgaria had been forced into the lower end of the mass tourism market with cheap package holidays in block-like hotels. More than 60 per cent of tourists then came from Eastern bloc countries. Since 1990, the number of Russian and east European visitors has dropped to less than 15 per cent of the total while western markets have picked up. The number of travellers from western Europe grew by 28 per cent last year when the overall number of visitors rose to 2.4m from 872,000 in 1992. Most of these come from Germany (with a market share of more than 40 per cent) and Britain (with a market share of more than 25 per cent) followed by Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. No official figures are available for this year but there is strong visual evidence of a sharp rise after a slow start. The main state-owned tour operators, Balkantourist whose name until 1990 was synonymous with the country's travel industry, and Balkan Holidays, with subsidiaries in 17 countries, have reported increased demand throughout the season. Seaside and mountain resorts, which have started negotiating directly with foreign partners, as well as most private operators, also report a steady flow of business. Tourism managers have started to pay more attention to the long-term image of the country and managed to prevent double-booking this summer. Last year, Bulgaria received bad publicity when some customers of Balkan Holidays, the main agency for the UK, arrived on the Black Sea to find their rooms occupied by higher-paying German visitors. Problems of this sort are not uncommon at a time when Bulgaria's travel industry is trying to make the bold step from state ownership to free market and private initiative. The first steps led to chaos, largely due to the lack of a clear tourism policy and the power struggle between institutions such as the Committee of Tourism, the Privatisation Agency, and the still powerful managers of state-owned resorts and hotels. Western consultants who have looked into Bulgaria's leisure industry identify drawbacks such as poor quality of service and infrastructure, some unsafe hotels and inhospitable airports. Only 6 per cent of the country's high class hotels were estimated to meet European standards. Substantial investment will be needed to upgrade them and attract a more up-market clientele. But officials are optimistic about the long-term potential of the industry. The country is only just starting to promote its wealth of Thracian, Roman and Byzantine remains, monasteries and mountains. Apart from cheap summer seaside or winter skiing packages, Bulgarian tour operators can also offer special interest tours, focusing on traditional architecture, history, religion, arts, hunting and rural tourism. Picturesque little towns on the Black Sea such as Nessebur and Sozopol, built over ancient Thracian and Greek ports, now offer holidays in residents' houses matching Greek islands-style vacations. Untapped opportunities also exist in spa treatment, motor touring and green tourism, as well as in conference travel.</p>

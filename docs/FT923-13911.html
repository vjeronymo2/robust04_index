			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Lamont says regulation failed in Maxwell case MR Norman Lamont conceded yesterday that the Securities and Investments Board review of regulators' handling of the Maxwell affair showed grave deficiencies which were a matter of 'serious concern' to the government. In reply to a question in the House of Commons, the chancellor promised to ensure that necessary steps were taken to tighten the system of regulation. His statement was the government's first public acknowledgement that regulation had failed in the Maxwell case. He added, however, that the majority of pension funds served their members well, and that the Maxwell affair was 'wholly exceptional'. The SIB yesterday unveiled its conclusions about the role in the Maxwell affair of Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said his board had rejected a suggestion that it withdraw recognition from Imro. Instead, it had decided to work on correcting key shortcomings. The SIB also announced that Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, is to resign as soon as a replacement can be found. In May, Imro announced it was seeking a successor to Mr Morgan after his term expired in September 1993. Mr Large said the SIB had decided against releasing the full contents of an Imro investigation into the affair for fear of prejudicing future legal actions. The parts of the report released yesterday show that Imro had concluded it was 'unduly ready to rely on the good faith and professionalism of those with whom it dealt' and 'its monitoring activity was insufficiently alert and responsive to information available to it'. Its response to the crisis after Robert Maxwell's death was also 'inadequate'. Imro believed, however, that it acted properly in authorising Maxwell's fund management companies to operate under a looser regulatory regime. The SIB's report, released yesterday, took a harsher view of Imro's role. It said: 'Imro's monitoring failures in this case reveal more than a general lack of market awareness and scepticism in dealing with information about transactions and in monitoring returns.' It added, however, that 'Imro had in many respects shown itself to be a committed and effective regulator'. Mr Large, who took over as SIB chairman on June 1, said he remained committed to self-regulation for the City. 'What we have to look at is how to improve the system we have without throwing out the parts that are good.' His main initiatives would include a drive to recruit more industry practitioners to work for the self-regulatory bodies. The SIB board has asked Mr Large to review how it carries out its own regulatory responsibilities and how it monitors the activities of the four self-regulatory organisations (SROs). 'This re-examination will have regard to considerations both of investor protection and efficiency,' the report said. In particular, Mr Large said, he was anxious to recruit more industry practitioners into the SROs. Mr Large signalled, however, that he wants no significant changes to self-regulation. 'The reality is that the problem is not as great as it's perceived to be.'</p>

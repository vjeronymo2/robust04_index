			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slightly lower in quiet trading US Treasury prices were slightly lower in quiet trading yesterday as the market calmed down following an extremely volatile Wednesday that saw yields flirt with 2 1/2 -year highs. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 93 9/32 , yielding 8.093 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  1/32 lower at 99.26 to yield 6.960 per cent. Trading was light as investors awaited key figures on US employment due out today. Prices slightly in the early morning on stronger than expected figures on single-family home sales, which increased by 2.6 per cent in September over the same period last year. By mid-morning, prices bounced back as the Federal Reserve once again stepped in to support the dollar, even though the US currency had held its own in early trading. However, by late afternoon prices slipped again, in line with the slight decline in the dollar. News of a drop in jobless claims that was lower than analysts had forecast also contributed to steadiness in the bond markets. Claims fell by 3,000 to 321,000 in October, which was good news ahead of today's employment data. Some analysts predict the government's figures will show an increase in October non-farm payrolls of 300,000, which would be slightly above recent trends. If the figures are much stronger, the market fears the Fed will raise interest rates immediately rather than wait for its November 15 open market committee meeting. The value of the dollar will continue to be closely watched by traders who are worried that it may spark inflation and deter foreign buyers from investing in US assets. As bond traders continued their tense vigil for today's US jobs data, European government bonds spent most of the day drifting sideways. Prices staged a late rally when the US Fed stepped into the foreign exchange market to support the dollar, but drifted lower in after-hours trading. German government bonds rallied into the close, supported by the Fed's intervention and a bout of short-covering in the futures pits. The December bund futures contract on DTB breached psychological resistance at 89.00 to close at 89.07, up 0.31 on the day. Prices slipped slightly on buoyant manufacturing orders data for September, but the numbers had no lasting effect on bunds. Although the figures were much stronger than expected, they were partly distorted by seasonal factors. Moreover, broken down into its components, the release was 'excellent from a bond market view', painting a picture of export and investment-led growth, said Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets. French bonds closed higher, buoyed by strength in other markets and the successful auction of FFr19.5bn in nine-, 11- and 15-year government bonds. The paper attracted solid demand, resulting in bid-to-cover ratios of between 1.7 and 2.4, and was broadly distributed, dealers said. The unexpected success of the sale prompted some short-covering in the futures contracts traders had sold before the auction. UK gilts traded roughly in line with most other European markets, with traders reporting thin cash activity. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 100 3/16 , up  1/8 . Prices - especially among shorter-dated stock - rose early in the day on waning fears of an imminent interest rate increase. Dealers were relieved that the Bank of England did not signal a change in lending rates at its open-market operations following yesterday's meeting between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. However, given that the last base rate increase came five days after their meeting, dealers said they would remain cautious, especially ahead of today's crucial US data. Swedish bonds took another hit from the first opinion poll on European Union membership showing a majority of 'no' votes. Bonds, which have been discounting a 'yes' victory, fell sharply, with the yield on the new 11-year issue jumping by 24 basis points to 11.43 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] This year the soybean prices will rise compared with  those at the end of last year. The reasons for the increase are  as follows: First, the push is from the oil processing  industry's demand for soybean material. In recent years, due to  feed and feed material industries development, the soybean has  become popular in the market, stimulating the irregular  development of the oil processing industry. The processing  demands at the oil factories far exceed the actual supply of  soybean materials. Many oil factories have a serious shortage of  supply. In the future the improvement in the people's living  standards and the adjustment in their diet structure will  inevitablly cause the feed and feed materials industry to  develop. This trend will require an increased development of the  soybean supply and the oil processing industry, causing the  already "hungry" oil processing factories to demand more soybean  materials. This is unquestionably the main stimulation for the  price rise in the soybean market. Second, price differences  between the production area and the marketing area. In the  selling area the soybean market has always been tight with a  large selling amount and high prices. Using Shanghai as an  example it can be seen that its annual demand is several hundred  thousand tons, and the local selling price is 1.9 yuan per jin  which is 0.20-0.30 yuan diferent from the market selling price  in the main producing area of Heilongjiang. This area price  difference means that the managing unit would gain profits if  they could send the soybeans directly from Heilongjiang. Third,  the total opening of the grain market has caused the  distribution system to operate smoothly with the soybean  transported by train. Thus, it will cause a conflict between  supply and demand. Customers arriving from outside are finding  it increasingly difficult to locate soybean resources. The  phenomenon of rising prices comes back. As time goes by, the  conflict between supply and demand becomes more serious, causing  contracted soybean prices to continuously rise. Therefore, since  last fall, the procurement purchasing prices of soybeans has  always remained high and even risen to 0.8 yuan per jin.  However, some economically sound large sellers still don't want  to sell the soybeans. The purchasing prices are continuously  increasing, and will have a chain effect on the contract prices  in the market. Last year was a period of increase for the  soybean market price. At the beginning of the year the soybean  contract prices to other provinces were 1.30 yuan per jin. Up to  the fall grain harvest the highest price was 1.74 yuan per jin.  It is projected that this year's soybean market will no longer  have this striking increase, but rather a slow increase. The  reason is as follows: 1. The resources of the procurement  priced soybeans have increased compared with last year. Last  year the production of soybeans increased which enlarged the  sources for collecting soybeans by tens of thousands of tons.  This will moderate the conflits between supply and demand this  year and is the material foundation for reducing the rising  price tide. 2. The limitation of the tolerance of consumers in  the selling areas. If the soybean market price in 1993 still  rises with the speed of 1992, the price in August will increase  to over 2 yuan per jin which will exceed the actual consumer  toleance in the selling areas, and restrict the market sales.  3. The adjustment from the imported soybeans. Every year the  selling areas need the imported soybeans to adjust the market  demands. According to the projection for China's import and  export of soybeans from "The Situation and Projection of World  Oil Materials" made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in  1992 and 1993 China will import 100,000 tons of soybeans which  will play a decisive role in moderating the conflicts between  supply and demand in our country's soybean selling areas, and  stablize the prices.</p>

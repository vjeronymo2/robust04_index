			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News - Wace: Rapid expansion in US after series of acquisitions IN 1990, Wace USA, which has its headquarters in Chicago, moved from second to first position in the pre-press printing sector, according to Graphics Arts Monthly, a US trade publication. The US company, whose clients have included the newspaper USA Today, Time magazine, catalogue retail firms such as J. C. Penney and Sears Roebuck, and retailers such as Macy's and Bloomingdales, refused to disclose any information about profits, turnover or other financial data. All enquiries were referred to Wace in London. Wace has expanded rapidly in the US through a series of acquisitions, beginning with the 1988 purchase - for Dollars 56m - of Techtron Imaging Network of Chicago, a company that had achieved an annual turnover of Dollars 83m in the previous year. Wace agreed to pay Dollars 20.3m in cash to holders of Techtron stock, and a further Dollars 33m to pay off debt built up during a 1985 management buy-out of the company from the Beatrice Group. The remaining cost of the purchase was for profit-related payments to Techtron's management. Techtron's name was changed to Wace USA, and the present chief executive is Mr John Collins, an American who sits on the main board of Wace plc. In 1989, Wace made its second US acquisition - a Dollars 5.5m purchase of Etheridge Company, a printer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Later that year, Wace paid Dollars 5m for Ros Ehlert, a film processing laboratory with operations in Illinois and Florida. In February 1990, Wace agreed to pay Dollars 450,000 for Hawkey and Associates, a Chicago-based consulting and services company. Mr Clegg said in April 1990 that about one third of Wace's group profits came from the US. In late 1991, SPP Hambro &amp; Co helped Wace Group to tap the US private placement market for Dollars 60m. Mr Neil Powell, SPP Hambro's chairman, said at the time that the proceeds would be used to repay bank debt. Mr Powell said four buyers, principally insurance companies, had agreed to the offer of Wace bonds. Hambro of the UK is the main shareholder in New York-based SPP Hambro.</p>

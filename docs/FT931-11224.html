			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool After minor fluctuations around the 500 cents mark for the AWC market indicator since sales were resumed in Australia, there was a more definite decline on Tuesday. This took the indicator down by 10 cents and established a new low for the 1992-93 season, 488c/kg. Withdrawals by growers were heavier, approaching 20pc at the two centres. Sterling weakness has obvious relevance to UK users of imported wool and prices have been advanced, but business, whether home trade or export, is poor enough to make even these increases difficult to establish.</p>

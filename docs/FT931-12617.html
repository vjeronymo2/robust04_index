			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Government debt auctions will test investors' appetite / Review of the arguments for the convergence of European bond yields THE two auctions of government debt due to be held today in France and Spain will prove important tests of investor appetite for high-yielding bonds. For as tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism ease, bond market analysts and investors have begun to re-examine the arguments for convergence of European bond yields. For the first time since April, France has decided to sell Ecu-denominated government bonds, representing the first sovereign issue of Ecu bonds since Denmark rejected the Maastricht treaty on European economic and monetary union and threw the Ecu and European bond markets into a state of confusion. Spain, meanwhile, is holding an auction of new three, five, and 10-year bonds. The coupons are higher than on the existing issues, providing a more realistic picture of yields in the secondary market. Dealers and economists believe that both auctions are likely to go well. France is due to issue between Ecu500 and Ecu700m of 8 per cent OATs due 2003. Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, described the French Ecu auction as 'very significant' adding that 'the French are helping to rebuild the credibility of the market'. Earlier this week, the Bank of England said it would resume issuing three-year Ecu notes. Other market analysts have said it is 'psychologically important' for the market that France is creating a new 10-year benchmark, rather than reopening an existing issue'. Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said the decisions by France and the UK 'show a willingness by governments to get the Ecu bond market up and running again'. The French auction is expected to go well, given that the amount involved is not particularly large. Even though Ecu yields have come down from a maximum of just above 200 basis points over 10-year German bonds in October to around 110 basis points recently, they are still yielding more than 10-year French franc denominated OATs. In other words, it is costing the French treasury more to raise the funds in Ecu than it would in francs. The Spanish government bond market has seen strong buying interest from UK, US and European investors recently as tensions within the ERM have eased, allowing Spain to cut interest rates on Friday. Investors have been keen to lock into high-yielding Spanish paper on expectations of further falls in yields. Ten-year Spanish bond yields have fallen from their October peak of 14.03 per cent to around 11.75 per cent recently. 'The convergence argument is back on track to a certain extent,' says Adrian James, international bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets. While ERM tensions appear to have eased recently, analysts point out that if the Irish punt is forced to devalue, tensions could resume. The French franc may also come under pressure again closer to the French general election. More importantly, bond analysts say investors will probably have to wait for the Bundesbank to cut German interest rates before other European central banks can safely follow suit. Although Spanish bond yields have fallen back dramatically, they are still above the levels seen in early 1992. So the bonds to be auctioned today - the 11.85 per cent bond due 1996, the 11.45 per cent bond due 1998, and the 10.90 per cent bond due 2003 - have higher coupons, reflecting the rise in yields in the secondary market.</p>

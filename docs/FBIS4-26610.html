It is an obligation on the part of the peasants to pay taxes  to the state and undertake all the charges and corvee as  prescribed by these regulations. The peasants will take the  initiative in performing this obligation, but they have the  right to refuse the solicitation of any other financial or  material contributions or labor services to be rendered gratis,  since a demand for such contributions and services is illegal.    Article 3. The Agricultural Committee (hereafter referred to  as the department supervising and administering affairs related  to peasant burdens) under the people's government at and above  the county level is in charge of supervision and administration  of affairs relating to peasant burdens within its own area of  jurisdiction, the township people's government is in charge of  supervision and administration of affairs related to peasant  burdens within townships, while routine operations are to be run  by rural economic management and administrative departments at  all levels (hereafter referred to as rural economic  administrative departments).    Departments concerned in charge of planning, statistics,  finance, auditing, commodity price controls, and administrative  supervision will assist in supervising and administering affairs  related to peasant burdens in accordance with their respective  duties and responsibilities.    Article 4. The duties and responsibilities of departments at  all levels supervising and administering affairs related to  peasant burdens are as follows:    1) To arrange for these regulations to be implemented; to  publicize and implement state laws, ordinances, regulations, and  policies concerning peasant burdens; and to supervise and  monitor the progress of implementation;    2) To coordinate, supervise, and administer affairs related  to peasant burdens within their own areas of jurisdiction;    3) To examine rules and measures concerning peasant burdens  formulated by departments of the people's governments or by  other units at the same level;    4) To check and verify annual peasant per-capita net income;    5) To attend to complaints and prosecutions concerning  peasant burdens;    6) To investigate and handle, alone or in cooperation with  other departments concerned, cases of violation of these  regulations;    7) To provide training to personnel in charge of supervision  and administration of affairs relating to peasant burdens.    Article 5. A peasant burdens affair supervision card system  and budget and final accounting system will be strictly  enforced. All kinds of funds turned over to the authorities and  corvee undertaken by peasants should be recorded in the "Manual  of Registration of expenses and Corvee Undertaken by Peasants,"  uniformly prepared by provincial department supervising and  administering affairs related to peasant burdens, and these  records are subject to regular review.    Article 6. Every unit or individual has the right to report  any violation of these regulations. Departments at all levels  supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens  and other departments concerned will investigate and handle such  reported cases without delay.    Article 7. People's governments and departments concerned at  all levels will commend and reward organizations or individuals  who have strictly implemented these regulations and made  prominent contributions to keeping the burden on peasants at a  legally accepted level and to protecting legitimate peasant  rights and interests.  <H5>  Chapter II -- Village Profit Retention and Township </H5> Coordination Fees    Article 8. The amount of the village profit retention and  township coordination fee which peasants pay directly to  collective economic organizations (profits turned over by  collective-run township and village enterprises not included)  will be calculated on the basis of figures given by the rural  economic income distribution statistical statement prepared with  data collected by rural economic administrative departments at  all levels, according to the statistical method formulated by  the Ministry of Agriculture and approved by the State  Statistical Bureau. This amount which is to be calculated on a  township or village basis will not exceed 5 percent of net  peasant per-capita income recorded in the previous year.    Article 9. The village profit retention comprises a  provident fund, a public welfare fund, and management fees.    1) The provident fund is to be used to finance farmland and  water conservation capital construction projects, tree planting  and afforestation work, purchase of fixed assets for production,  and operation of collective enterprises.    2) The public welfare fund is to be used to support  households enjoying the five guarantees, to subsidize households  in extreme difficulty, and to finance cooperative medical and  health care services, epidemic prevention service, woman and  child care, as well as cultural activities, education, and other  collective welfare undertakings.    3) The management fee is used to pay village and production  group cadres, as well as expenses for administrative operations.  The employment of village and production group cadres, and  rewards and subsidies for these cadres will be strictly subject  to the relevant rules formulated by the provincial people's  government.    Article 10. The township coordination fee is to be used to  run schools at the township and village levels, and to finance  family planning programs, militia training, care for disabled  servicemen and family members of servicemen and martyrs, road  construction and maintenance works, and other civilian-run  public facilities.    The township and village school fund is to be used to pay  off  subsidies for teachers of non-government-run primary and  secondary schools, premise maintenance expenses of these  schools, and expenses on other non-government-run education  services.    Article 11. The levy percentage of village profit retention  and township coordination fees will be in keeping with the level  fixed by the provincial people's government. No unit or  department will make any extra levies in the name of village  profit retention or of township coordination fees or appropriate  these two types of funds for any other purposes, except for some  economically developed localities which may moderately raise the  percentage only with the approval of the provincial people's  government.    Article 12. Village profit retention and township  coordination fees are discriminatingly levied on peasants mainly  according to the trades they are engaged in and to their actual  income.    Peasants who farm on contracted plots of land will pay off  to  their respective collective economic organizations the village  profit retention and township coordination fees in proportion to  the area of farmland (or water or hilly land) or the number of  laborers working on the plots of land.    A peasant who has an individually owned business or private  enterprise, after taxes will pay to the local authorities which  his residential household registration is attached to, village  profit retention and township coordination fees at the rate of 5  percent of his net income as recorded in the previous year. But  this amount will be distinguished from the 5 percent of peasant  per-capita net income as referred to in Article 8 of these  regulations.    Article 13. An annual centralized assessment and collection  system applies to both village profit retention and township  coordination fees, and village collective economic organizations  and township people's government organs are authorized to  collect these fees. No other units and departments will do  this, and no unit or individual will ask for advance payment or  collect the said fees by force under any pretext.    When collecting village profit retention and township  coordination fees from peasant households, all collectors will  present a "rural cooperative economy internal accounting  voucher" prepared by the authorization of the county (city)  department supervising and administering affairs related to  peasant burdens.    Article 14. Households in extreme difficulty, specifically  family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, disabled  servicemen, and demobilized or retired servicemen who have lost  their working ability, may be exempted from payment of village  profit retention or have their payment reduced, providing that  it is approved by the assembly of the members of the village  collective economic organizations or by member representative  meetings.    Villages that are rated by the township people's government  as impoverished villages and which have suffered great economic  losses caused by serious natural disasters can have payment of  township coordination fees reduced, providing that an  application for reduction of payment is lodged by a village  collective economic organization, endorsed by a township  people's government, and ratified by a township people's  congress.    Article 15. As far as the amount of village profit retention  is concerned, the village collective economic organization is to  prepare at the year end the final accounts for that year and to  propose the budget for the next year. After being reviewed by  the township organ in charge of rural economic administration,  the final accounts and budget will be discussed and approved by  the assembly of members of the village collective economic  organization, and then submitted to the villagers' assembly for  discussion and approval before they are filed to the township  people's government for record purposes.    As far as the amount of township coordination fee is  concerned, the township people's government is to prepare at the  year end the final accounts for that year and to propose the  budget for the next year. After being reviewed by the county  organ in charge of rural economic administration, the final  accounts and budget will be discussed and approved by the  township people's congress, and then they will be filed,  together with the village profit retention final accounts and  budgets of all the villages under the township's jurisdiction,  to the county department supervising and administering affairs  related to peasant burdens for record purposes.    The final accounts and budget, after review and approval,  will be published by a notice which will be put up so that the  public can supervise the progress of implementation.    The villagers' committee will supervise the collection and  allocation of the village profit retention.    Article 16. The township coordination fee belongs to all the  peasants within the collective economic organization framework,  and is to be used to finance local public-aided undertakings.  The nature and use of the township coordination fee as a type  of collective fund will not be confused or altered.    The township coordination fee will not be used to make up  any  financial deficits of the township, nor will the sum of the fee  be divided up and separately collected, managed, and allocated  by different departments.    It is prohibited to place the township coordination fee  under  the county management.    Article 17. The village profit retention and township  coordination fee are subject to strict financial management.  The village profit retention will be retained and allocated by  the village under strict control and supervision by the township  rural economic management department. The township coordination  fee which is subject to centralized administration by the  township rural economic management department will be allocated  to different special accounts, with specific funds to be used  only for specific purposes.    As far as appropriation of the village profit retention and  township coordination fees is concerned, an appropriation plan  will be drawn up according to the quota and proportions fixed by  the provincial people's government. The appropriation of these  funds is subject to budgetary control and will not exceed the  quota. The account will be settled in good time after fund  appropriation. The practice of collecting funds without filing  an application or of levying appropriations without fulfilling  the fund withdrawal procedures is strictly prohibited. It is  prohibited to spend the village profit retention or township  coordination fees on entertaining guests or presenting gifts,  and extravagance and waste will be banned. The village profit  retention and township coordination fee will not be allocated  indiscriminately on an egalitarian basis, nor will they be  misappropriated, diverted to inappropriate use, or used as a  financial guaranty.    Article 18. The county and township departments supervising  and administering affairs related to peasant burdens will  practice a tailor-made auditing system for the allocation,  management, and use of the village profit retention and township  coordination fees.  <H5>  Chapter III -- Rural Voluntary Labor Services and </H5> Accumulated Labor Work    Article 19. Rural voluntary labor services are mainly to  undertake such works as flood prevention, tree planting, road  construction and maintenance, and school construction. Each  rural laborer will undertake rural voluntary labor services for  not more than 10 standard work-days each year.    If extra voluntary labor services are needed in case of  emergencies, such as disaster fighting and relief operations,  the people's government at and above the county level is to  centralize the work.    Article 20. Accumulated labor work is mainly to undertake  such efforts as farmland and water conservation capital  construction, comprehensive agricultural development, tree  planting and afforestation, and the blood fluke extinction  operation as a part of snail fever prevention. Each rural  laborer will undertake accumulated labor work for not more than  20 work-days a year. The amount of labor work may be moderately  increased where the local conditions allow, with approval by the  people's government at and above the county level. But in no  case will the extra amount of work for each rural laborer exceed  10 work-days. Accumulated labor work will mainly be levied  during the slack season.    Article 21. Rural voluntary labor services and accumulated  labor work will mainly be rendered in the form of real labor  work. If a peasant asks to substitute money payment for labor  work, his request is subject to the approval of the rural  collective economic organization. On the other hand, no peasant  will be forced to pay money in place of labor work.    For disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and  servicemen who enjoy special preferential treatment, voluntary  labor work can be exempted or reduced according to the relevant  regulations formulated by the provincial people's government.  Peasants who cannot render labor services because of illness or  disability may have their labor service duties exempted or  reduced if approved by the assembly of members of the village  collective economic organization or a meeting of member  representatives after discussion.    Article 22. A rural voluntary labor services and accumulated  labor work allocation plan will be jointly proposed by the  township people's government and the village collective economic  organization after discussion. This plan will be implemented  after examination and adoption by the township people's  congress, and the actual allocation of such labor services will  be revealed by a notice posted at the end of the year, subject  to public supervision.

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Poor show in NY: Saleroom Christie's offered the finest group of Impressionist and modern paintings seen on the market for four years at its New York auction room on Tuesday evening, but the results were disappointing. Only half the 76 lots found buyers. The auction totalled Dollars 50.7m with the best prices paid for a group of seven paintings acquired over 30 years ago by a European collector and fresh on the market. They were expected to make Dollars 15m between them and actually sold for Dollars 17.87m. A rare Fauve landscape of 1906 by Maurice de Vlaminck was the star lot: it sold for Dollars 6.8m, double its estimate, while Picasso's Cubist 1913 masterpiece 'Violon, bouteille et verre' was at the top of its estimate at Dollars 6.27m. In contrast paintings from the collection of the retailing magnate Mr Meshulam Riklis, whose McCrory Corporation has filed for bankruptcy law protection, found few bidders, apart from one lot, an imaginative 1932 Picasso portrait of his young mistress Marie-Therese Walter which sold for Dollars 4.6m. Mr Michael Findlay, Christie's specialist in the field, was at a loss to explain the poor result. 'Interest suddenly ebbed on Monday afternoon,' he said.</p>

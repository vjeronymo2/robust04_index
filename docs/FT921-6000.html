			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Food: Sailing on a full stomach - Appetisers THE DELAY over the opening of the Channel Tunnel and the closure of some ferry services has somewhat muddied the waters we British have to cross for our holidays abroad As some compensation, the Automobile Association has just published a concise guide to 27 car ferry services sailing from the UK to Northern Ireland, Eire, Scandinavia, France, Holland, Germany and Spain, and rated all their facilities and services on board. Top culinary marks are awarded to vessels operated by Scandinavian Seaways to Denmark, Sweden and Germany, the Olau Line to the Netherlands and to Brittany Ferries for their flagship vessel, the Bretagne, on the route between Plymouth and Santander in Northern Spain. The guide is available free from all AA shops. * * * GERMANY imported 14.05m bottles of champagne last year and, for the first time, became the biggest foreign buyer of this wine, dislodging the UK - which had been Champagne's biggest customer for the previous five years - by a mere 27,000 bottles. But while even German imports were slightly down on 1990, Britain's were 34 per cent lower, in spite of a remarkable 2.7m bottles shipped to the UK in December. In view of the widespread stories of the collapse of champagne sales everywhere, with a world total of ex-Marne sales of 120m bottles, this is less than 10 per cent below 1990's total. Although the gap between last year's vintage of 276m bottles will add to the stocks in Champagne's chalk cellars, the extra age in bottle resulting should only be for the good. * * * LOVERS of Spanish food and cooking have never really been satisfied by the offerings in Spanish restaurants in London. Many of the tapas bars which opened in the 1980s have closed, Los Remos of W2, and Meson Don Felipe of SE1 being honourable exceptions; of the restaurants, Galicia W10, Rebatos SW8 and La Giralda in Pinner have been the most reliable and Pepe's is due to open this month in Malvern Road, W9. Meanwhile, the small firm of Brindisa in Crimscott Street, London SE1 (071-231-0016) has been quietly importing the best that only Spain can offer: serrano ham hung for a minimum of nine months; chorizo sausage; membrillo, the quince cheese; sherry vinegar and saffron. Two of their cheeses are now in Safeway supermarkets, a blended manchego and a Majorcan mahon, while more of their range is at Selfridge's, Harrods and Villandry in London; The Flour Bag, Lechlade, Gloucestershire; and the Fine Cheese Company in Bath. Within London Brindisa will now deliver reasonable orders to your home twice a week as well as sending orders by post. * * * THE Rhone house of Chapoutier has been revolutionised by the brothers Marc and Michel, who are still in their early 30s. By instituting organic methods and shrinking yields, they are making exceptionally concentrated, serious wines. Best value in Britain at the moment is their barrique-aged 1990 Rasteau, so spicy it tastes almost mulled, with its 20 per cent ration of Mourvedre grapes. At Pounds 5.25 from Majestic it could be drunk now but should reach its best in a year or two. * * * THE NEW Food Safety Act is forcing all professional food handlers back to the classroom. What can never accurately be established, however, is just how many cases of food poisoning or an upset stomach occur in restaurants or at home. Some time ago I went on a one-day course for Environmental Health Officers and picked up many useful tips about how correctly to prepare and store food at home. The Central Catering College, Cornwall Road, London SE1 (Tel: 071-928-9686) is now offering similar one-day courses for professional and amateur cooks. The cost is Pounds 55.</p>

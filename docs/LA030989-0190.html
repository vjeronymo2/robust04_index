			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. WON'T BEND STUDENT LOAN RULES; B OF A FEARS BIG LOSSES  </P> <P> The parent company of Bank of America said Wednesday that the federal  government has refused to relax regulations covering $1 billion worth of loans  in the most expensive foul-up in the history of the student loan program.  </P> <P> The action essentially voids federal guarantees on the loans and leaves Bank of  America and several other major banks vulnerable to losses estimated by the  bank at $450 million to $650 million.  </P> <P> Those losses are likely to affect some of the world's largest banks and may  cause banks to reconsider their participation in the federal loan program,  which provides about half of all financial aid to post-high school students in  the United States.  </P> <P> Education officials expressed concern Wednesday that it will become more  difficult for students nationwide to obtain financial aid. They said the impact  is potentially most serious on students attending community colleges and  vocational schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Processing Mistakes  </P> <P> "I'm very much concerned about the impact on the student loan program  throughout the United States," said Samuel M. Kipp III, executive director of  the California Student Aid Commission, whose compromise plan was rejected by  the federal government. "The impact can only be a profound reduction in access  to post-secondary education."  </P> <P> The concern stems from the U.S. Department of Education's refusal to bend its  rules and have taxpayers pick up the tab for massive processing mistakes by an  Encino firm in handling $1 billion worth of student loans.  </P> <P> The refusal came despite intervention on behalf of the San Francisco-based bank  by several California politicians, including Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), and  concerns voiced by educators across the country.  </P> <P> In a letter to A. W. Clausen, BankAmerica chairman and chief executive,  Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said his responsibility to protect the  taxpayers and the integrity of the federal student loan program meant that  guidelines on the guarantees could not be altered.  </P> <P> The letter, dated Monday, followed a Jan. 31 meeting in Washington arranged by  Wilson at which Clausen presented the bank's case to Cavazos and other top  department officials.  </P> <P> At issue are hundreds of loans to students, mostly at vocational schools,  guaranteed originally by the federal government. About 40% of the loans were to  students in California.  </P> <P> Bonds backing the loans were sold on the secondary market. Bank of America  served as trustee for the bonds, which meant it has responsibility to assure  that the bondholders are paid off and that the loans are serviced properly.  </P> <P> A consortium of big banks, including New York's Citicorp and the world's two  largest banks, Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji Bank, provided letters of  credit to back the bonds. The letters of credit require the banks to provide  their own funds if collections on the loans are insufficient to pay the  bondholders.  </P> <P> A chief cause of insufficient revenue is the failure to students to repay  loans, and vocational schools have notoriously high default rates. But the  lenders are normally protected because the federal government promises to  provide funds for bad loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computer Failure Blamed  </P> <P> However, federal regulations set out specific steps that must be followed in  attempting to collect bad loans in order for the guarantee to remain in effect.  </P> <P> In this case, United Education &amp; Software of Encino was hired to service  the loans, including taking the required steps to seek repayment on delinquent  loans. Last summer, a federal examination of United Education uncovered serious  flaws in its compliance with the collection rules.  </P> <P> United Education and Bank of America blamed the problems on a massive computer  failure at the firm. Bank of America ultimately bought out United Education and  hired another company to process the loans.  </P> <P> But the Department of Education, after months of negotiations with the bank and  California student loan officials, said the problems were so grave that its  guarantees would not be honored.  </P> <P> The decision was conveyed to the bank on Jan. 30 and the next day Clausen met  with Cavazos and others in Washington in an attempt to persuade them to change  their ruling.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Funds to Cover Loans  </P> <P> Kenneth D. Whitehead, an assistant secretary of education who attended the  meeting, said Clausen argued that the regulations were meant for routine errors  and should not cover a massive computer failure. He also argued that the bank's  shareholders would be hurt if the department did not reverse its decision.  </P> <P> "The secretary carefully considered this and all the facts, but concluded that  the integrity of the program and the interests of the taxpayers obliged him to  maintain the regulations," Whitehead said.  </P> <P> That means that the banks that issued the letters of credit will have to  provide the funds to cover the loans without any federal repayment. Those banks  have already indicated that they intend to try to recover any losses by suing  Bank of America for what the other banks consider to be negligence in  administering the program.  </P> <P> In a statement issued Wednesday, B of A said the estimated losses of $450  million to $650 million include loans that are never repaid, the costs of  trying to collect delinquent loans and the bank's legal costs.  </P> <P> The bank set aside about $80 million in the fourth quarter of last year to  cover expected losses in the program and said Wednesday that an unspecified  additional amount will be added to the reserves as a result of the government's  decision. The bank said its 1989 earnings should not be affected.  </P> <P> Bank of America said it believes that it has fulfilled its obligations as  administrator of the program and will defend its actions in court. The bank  said it expects lawsuits to drag out over several years.  </P></p>

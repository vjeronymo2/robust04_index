			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 6 (XINHUA) -- About 800 American  companies, trade associations, farm organizations and consumer  groups wrote Thursday [5 May] to U.S. President Bill Clinton,  urging him to extend the most favored nations (MFN) trading  status to China.    The business coalition for U.S.-China trade released the  letter today and stated that not renewing China's MFN status  would jeopardize the over 180,000 high-wage American jobs  dependent upon the over 9 billion worth of U.S. goods and  service exported to China last year.    In the letter which about 800 American businesses put their  signatures to, the coalition said that "our companies are  engaged in diverse businesses, ranging from manufacturing,  farming, and retailing to financial and entertainment services,  but we share a common conviction that trade with China is vital  to America's future."    "We are deeply concerned that initiating economic conflict  through MFN revocation or other sanctions, such as denying MFN  for state-owned companies, would put American jobs and exports  at risk, cede the Chinese market to Europe and Japan," it noted.    John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell-Douglas, explained in  a  news release by the coalition that "China represents an  incredible market opportunity which will create thousands of  additional U.S. jobs and further improve the U.S. economy as the  Chinese demand more American products and service."    "If we let this opportunity slip away, our global  competitors  will take over where we leave off and it will be nearly  impossible to recover a competitive position in that area of the  world," McDonnell said.    The business leaders highlighted the important role that  Chinese market has for the American consumer.    "Loss of MFN or any form of trade sanctions will have a  direct cost for American consumers," said Myron Ullman, chairman  of R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. "Low- and middle-income American  families will face higher prices and shortages of many familiar  items."    Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American International Group,  said the United States ought to view its relationship with China  "in a broader, strategic context and not have a single issue  foreign policy."    "Massive change is occurring in China, bringing with it  improvements in living conditions for the Chinese people that  would have been impossible to envision even a few years ago,"  Greenberg added.    The business leaders urged Clinton to support continued U.S.  trade with China by extending MFN and to devise a U.S. policy  that de-links trade sanction and human rights.</p>

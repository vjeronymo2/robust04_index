			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe on Friday [15 April] turned down a request by  Liberal Democratic Party president Yohei Kono not to break with  but to defend the unity of Japan's largest opposition party.    Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also  expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito  and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in  order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country."    Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and concurrently  foreign minister of the once-dominant LDP, made the remarks  after two hours of talks with Kono.    Earlier in the day, Japanese mass media reported that  Watanabe had decided to quit the LDP to form his own party.    "We held extremely serious talks," Watanabe told reporters  after emerging from his bargaining session with Kono, who paid a  visit to the factional leader at his political office in his  faction's headquarters.    Watanabe said, "I told him (Kono) it is necessary for  politicians of the same political opinions and doctrine to band  together to form an alliance in order to surmount the crises now  confronting this country, from the standpoint of making  full-fledged efforts to save the country."    Watanabe was apparently referring to the political ideals of  intra-coalition forces led by the chief coalition strategist  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the core coalition  component.    Ozawa has advocated the same stand as Watanabe on such key  issues as Japan's role in UN peacekeeping missions, tax system  reform and the need to take a tough stand against the suspected  North Korean nuclear arms program.    Kono told reporters he has not given up his efforts to  persuade Watanabe not to break away from the LDP, which lost its  38-year lock on power in a 1993 general election following a  series of defections.    Kono said he told Watanabe he does not have any intention to  give up his own bid for the premiership in the Diet election for  the post.    Kono said he told Watanabe, "I will take the responsibility  as the president of the LDP."    A majority of LDP legislators have voiced their support for  Kono's bid to run for the nation's stewardship, party sources  said.    Watanabe said, however, he told Kono he also intends to run  in the parliamentary vote for a new prime minister.    No date has yet been set for the vote to pick a successor to  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his  resignation on April 8.    Watanabe also expressed his intention to change the nature  of  the current coalition, telling Kono, "I will become the  torchbearer who will drive a wedge into the governing  coalition's structure by advocating the LDP's policies."    The remark apparently reflects Watanabe's long-time  criticism  of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the  ruling coalition, which he has repeatedly blasted as "distorting  the policies of the coalition."    LDP sources said Kono and Watanabe agreed to resume  discussion next Monday in an attempt to reconcile their  differences over Watanabe's possible defection and his avowed  bid to seek the prime ministership, while monitoring whether the  coalition parties are able to narrow their gulf over the  succession issue.    LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori later told a news  conference that Watanabe gave no indication of his possible  breakaway from the LDP in the talks.    "The point is that Mr. Watanabe and LDP president Kono  shared  serious perceptions of the current political situation," Mori  said.    During the meeting, Mori said, Watanabe told Kono that he  wants to join hands with those whose basic policies are close to  his own as long as the LDP is in opposition and cannot directly  take part in the management of national politics.    "That's what I call a 'moderately conservative' political  setup," Mori quoted Watanabe as saying.    Kono retorted, however, that the LDP should take a  wait-and-see attitude toward the current political development  following Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits last week.    "It is evident the coalition government will suffer a major  collapse next time around," Kono reportedly told Watanabe.    Watanabe and Kono agreed to continue their talks and to hold  another round as early as Saturday, Mori said.</p>

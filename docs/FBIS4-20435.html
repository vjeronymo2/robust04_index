			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Liheng [3769 4409 1854]] </F>   [Excerpts]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   Mr. Wang Liheng, Vice Administrator of the Chinese National  Space Administration (CNSA), was invited to discuss China's  space program at the 29th Joint Development Conference on 28  June 1993. In his speech during the opening ceremony, he  summarized China's future space development plans and policies,  and pointed out the changes in China's space management system  as a result of organizational reforms initiated by the Chinese  Government. He also revealed China's near-term goals in its  space program and stressed China's interest in cooperation with  other members of the international space community. [Excerpts  from his speech are presented below.]    [Passage omitted] It is well known that since the launch of  the first artificial earth satellite, the accumulation of space  activities and the development of space technologies over the  past several decades have played a special and unprecedented  role in the advancement of society and civilization and in  raising the standard of living for mankind. For a developing  country like China with a large population and extended  geographic area and complex terrain, our dedicated mission and  responsibility have always been to lift China from poverty and  backwardness, to develop our economy and protect our  environment, and to accelerate the advancement of our society.  In accordance with the policy of accelerating China's economic  modernization without going through the traditional development  cycles of developed nations, we believe it is necessary to  develop space technologies which may pay huge dividends in the  form of social and economic benefits. For this reason, a space  development program was initiated in this country back in the  mid-1950s. After 30 years of hard work, significant progress has  been made in both capability and the standard of China's space  technology and a comprehensive and coordinated research and  production system has been established. Today China is in a  position to accept jobs in research, design, manufacturing,  testing and production of artificial satellites, launch vehicles  and other high-tech products; it has also built up a dedicated,  experienced and technically competent research and development  team in aerospace engineering. The development of space  technologies has a visible effect on solving some of the major  social problems facing China: over-population and shortage of  resources, environment pollution and natural disasters,  communication and transportation, education and cultural  activities. It has also played an active role in promoting the  development of high-tech industries and new technologies.    The next few years until the end of the century will be a  critical period in the history of China's modernization and  economic development. As China implements its reform and  open-door policy as part of the overall national strategy, the  effort to develop our space industry will undoubtedly continue  to grow and our efforts toward international cooperation will be  changed. In this regard, we will continue to follow a path of  development that is consistent with China's tradition and its  economic conditions and available resources; we will optimize  our development program by concentrating our efforts on a  selected number of advanced technologies.    The near-term objective of China's space program is to  develop application satellites and satellite application  technologies. We will focus on an integrated plan to develop  both space systems and ground systems in parallel. The  development of applications satellites is primarily motivated by  the requirements of China's economic and social development; it  is also our goal to develop an autonomous capability to build  satellites that are operationally reliable and will eventually  provide coverage for the entire country. At the same time,  continuing efforts are being made to improve the Long March  family of launch vehicles to meet the launch requirements for  different payloads and different orbits.    We are currently developing a new generation of applications  satellites which include high-capacity communications  satellites, multi-purpose earth resource satellites, and various  types of weather satellites. These satellites are expected to  become operational in the next two years. By that time, the  capacity provided by China's applications satellites will have  increased by an order of magnitude compared to the 1980 era. We  are also actively supporting the study of multi-spectrum,  high-accuracy, uninterrupted, all-weather satellite remote  sensing technologies as well as communications, navigation and  microgravity technologies. Our objective is to build up a  sizable space high-tech industry and to speed up the process of  commercialization of space technologies.    A year ago, the government issued its ``National Guideline  for Long-Range Science and Technology Development'' which covers  the period from 2000 to 2020; it clearly stresses the importance  of research and development of space propulsion technology,  telemetry and control technology, and manned space technology.  Once these objectives are achieved, China will be in a position  to make greater contributions toward peaceful development of  space resources and raising the standard of living for all  mankind.    Space exploration and development of space resources are  immense tasks that cannot be accomplished by one people or one  nation, nor can they be completed within a period of a few  decades or even a century. To accomplish these tasks requires  the joint efforts of all nations over many generations.  Recognizing this, China will continue to play an active role in  promoting international cooperation in space activities.    In the past year, China, Thailand, and Pakistan jointly  organized a ``Multi-Lateral Joint Symposium on Space  Technologies and Applications for the Asian Pacific Region'';  the purpose of this symposium was to establish the basic  guidelines and to seek the proper format and approach for  strengthening regional cooperation. Through multi-lateral  efforts, substantial progress has been made in this regional  cooperative venture. We believe that such cooperation will  undoubtedly have a positive effect on the rapid economic growth  in the Asian-Pacific region.    China's current economy, its basic industries and its  science  and technology are in need of further improvement and  development. We are very interested in continuing our technical  exchanges and maintaining contacts with advanced nations in  space technologies with the hope of deriving mutual benefits  from such exchanges.    In addition to maintaining and expanding cooperative efforts  between governments, China also encourages academic exchanges  and cooperation on a private level. We extend our warm welcome  to the space scientists and experts of other countries to visit  China and to give lectures. Members of Chinese academic  institutions are also interested in participating in technical  conferences on space technology and will continue to be a part  of the ``Mission to Planet Earth'' joint effort.    In recent years, the five launch vehicles of the Long March  family have provided launch services on the international  market. They have been used either to carry individual payloads  or to launch complete satellite systems. The entry of the Long  March launch vehicles into the international market provides the  user a new option for delivering his payload into space. In the  future, we will offer more robust forms of services such as  satellite orbit transfers; leasing of transponders or providing  remote sensing data; providing ground systems equipment for  different satellites applications; joint development of  communications and broadcasting satellites, weather satellites,  resource satellites and navigation satellites.    In order to carry out China's responsibility as a member of  the international space community and to promote international  cooperation, we joined the ``Outer Space Treaty Organization''  in 1983; in December 1988, we signed the ``Agreement on the  Rescue and Return of Astronauts and the Return of Space  Objects,'' the ``Treaty on International Responsibility for  Damages Caused by Fallen Space Objects'' and the ``Treaty on  Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space.'' In  addition, in late 1988 and early 1989, the governments of China  and the United States signed the following bilateral documents:  ``Memorandum of Mutual Agreement on the Safety of Satellite  Technology,'' ``Memorandum of Mutual Agreement on the  Responsibility of Satellite Launch Activities'' and ``Memorandum  of Mutual Agreement on International Trade Issues of Commercial  Launch Service.'' In other words, a mutual understanding was  reached between China and the United States concerning the  ``permit'' issue of providing satellite launch service. It has  been shown from the experience of launching ASIASAT, AUSSAT and  the Swedish satellite that China has closely adhered to these  agreements; I am confident that China will continue to do so in  its future space activities and in cooperative ventures with  other countries. In recent years, China has also made clear its  position on the problem of space debris, and has made a  concerted effort to protect the space environment. [passage  omitted]</p>

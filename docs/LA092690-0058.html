			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> WATER-WASTING BAN GETS INITIAL OK  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council gave first-round approval Tuesday to a water  conservation ordinance that would ban water-wasting practices such as hosing  off driveways and would impose fines and cutoffs for repeat violators.  </P> <P> The vote was unanimous.  </P> <P> A second reading and vote on the ordinance is scheduled for sometime next  month, and it would take effect 30 days after that.  </P> <P> Although Oxnard is hooked into to the State Water Project, city officials said  the ordinance will help avoid future shortages.  </P> <P> The ordinance would also prohibit the following: watering lawns between 9 a.m.  and 5 p.m., allowing water to run onto streets and sidewalks, and serving water  at restaurants unless requested by a customer. It bans carwashes that do not  recycle water, decorative fountains that do not recycle, and broken or damaged  water fixtures that are not repaired promptly.  </P> <P> Violators will be warned on their first offense. A second offense within 12  months will result in a fine equal to 25% of the most recent utility bill or  $25, whichever is higher. A third offense within 12 months would result in a  fine equal to 50% of the most recent bill or $50, whichever is higher.  </P> <P> If a fourth violation occurs, the city will install a water restriction device  on the violator's line.  </P> <P> If a customer violates the ordinance more than four times within 12 months, the  city will cut off water service.  </P> <P> The ordinance is patterned after one adopted in Camarillo in May.

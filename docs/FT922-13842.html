			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: PM's brave fight against party's past / Weighing up the campaign performance of Thatcher's heir IF Mr John Major loses today's general election it will be because he has failed to disentangle himself from his party's past. The judgment of history might well be that after a brief 16 months in Downing Street, the prime minister was faced with an impossible task. No party since the Napoleonic wars has won four successive terms in office. He is seeking to match that record in the midst of the worst recession in living memory. But if Mr Neil Kinnock stands on the threshold of 10 Downing Street tomorrow morning, the judgment of the present may prove a great deal harsher. An election defeat could well be followed by a leadership challenge. In personal terms Mr Major has fought a brave election. He has been as energetic and determined as could be expected of any leader. Predictions that he would crack under the pressure of a month-long campaign were proved wrong. There have been gaffes, but fewer than were made by his predecessor in 1987. His personal rating in the opinion polls has dropped. As a candidate for office rather than a prime minister, he has sometimes looked ill-at-ease and vulnerable. Neither trend surprised those who have followed previous elections; and Labour as well as Conservative candidates testify that on the doorstep he has remained an asset to his party. But to win elections it is not enough to be brave. Nor is it enough to be nice. Mr Major's appearances on an old-fashioned soapbox jarred with those who view election campaigns through the establishment prism of Westminster. The prejudices of the chattering classes may not matter. But it was a style that diminished the image of the international statesman which had been so carefully constructed in Downing Street. If the opinion polls are right, his you-get-what-see honesty and decency have not persuaded enough voters to forgive his party the poll tax and the recession. Mr Major's promise of a different future has not been projected with great enough clarity to wipe out painful memories of the past. From the outset he has relied on the contrast between his leadership and that of Mr Kinnock to boost the Conservative share of the vote. The polls say that share has fallen fractionally during the campaign. His advisers always overestimated the part that personal popularity plays in politics. The electorate, after all, voted for that nasty Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1979 when the avuncular Mr James Callaghan had a strong lead in the ratings. It is the message that counts. The prime minister's best hope was that his prospectus for the 1990s - wealth creation and welfare side by side - would persuade the electorate to look to the future rather than the past. The Conservatives always knew that after three terms in office the most resonant chord Mr Kinnock could strike would be time for change. Mr Major, they said, would offer that change, depriving Labour of its most powerful message. That was why Mrs Thatcher had been toppled. But instead it has been an election campaign in which the new prime minister never quite explained to the voters just who he was. The electorate was told he could be trusted; but to do what? Mr Major is not a Thatcherite. As he explained again yesterday morning during some bruising encounters on the BBC's Election Call programme, nor is he a politician driven by ideological certainties. He works from a set of principles - belief in individual choice, responsibility and ownership - which are as true to the tradition of one-nation Toryism as they are to the theology of his predecessor. His election manifesto replaces the radical zeal and simple truths of the Thatcher years with page after page of dispassionate pragmatism. She was determined to change the world from the top down, her successor promises to work from the bottom up. Mrs Thatcher herself offers private testimony to the break with the past. In spite of her public loyalty during the campaign, her disdain for the policies of her successor is an open secret. She believes that he has been too lax over public spending and borrowing; she is dismissive of the Citizen's Charter; she is convinced that he gave too much ground to Britain's European partners at the Maastricht summit. Mr Major, though, has not been prepared to admit - let alone proclaim - a distinctively different agenda. Nor has he shown the sheer force of political personality which allowed Mr Michael Heseltine to pretend that there is no contradiction between conviction and consensual politics. At times the prime minister tried to fight the election on his own record: victory in the Gulf, a return to consensual government, abolition of the poll tax, better funding for the welfare state and the European deal at Maastricht. But the cautious politician who climbed the ladder to Downing Street by making friends rather than enemies was not willing to disown the errors made in the triumphalist aftermath of the 1987 election victory. I am not Mrs Thatcher, he would say, but I greatly admire her. There was a record to defend - the replacement of statist with market economics, the taming of the trades unions, privatisation, the spread of ownership. But Mr Major found himself dogged during the campaign by the two most damaging mistakes of Mrs Thatcher's government: the economic boom which brought the recession in its wake, and the poll tax. Time and again the prime minister was asked to apologise for those mistakes. Time and again he demurred. On each occasion the credibility of his promise of a different future was diminished. The identity crisis brought a series of swerves in his party's campaign. Mr Major began with the proclamation of his caring Conservatism, lurched into a defence of the incomes of the affluent, and then retreated into a less-than-convincing defence of the Thatcher revolution. For a week the campaigning became entirely negative - until the party discovered that a bruised and disgruntled electorate wanted to be told why they should vote Conservative as well as why they should not vote Labour. The most powerful message of the campaign - that Mr Kinnock's tax and spending plans would abort the economic recovery promised by a Conservative victory - was persistently obscured. It may well be that the opinion polls will be proved wrong. That in the privacy of the ballot box the voters will decide to forgive the prime minister his party's sins for fear of Labour's tax plans. If Mr Major wins an overall majority he will be free of the baggage of his past, with a mandate to build his own political identity. If Mr Kinnock wins, Mr Major's party may prove as unforgiving as the electorate.</p>

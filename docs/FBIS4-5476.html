			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station correspondent Hoai Thu's essay: "Efforts by Dien </F> Chau District To Fight Hunger and Poverty"]    [Summary] Nghe An Province's Dien Chau district has a  population of 260,000, most of whom engage in agricultural  production, planting various crops on a total area of  23,000-24,000 hectares of land. Among them 14,000 hectares are  planted with rice and 3,000 hectares with peanuts. In the most  productive year, the district can produce 63,000 tonnes of  grain. Its per capita in grain is 260 kg. People in the  district also engage in fishing, salt production, and livestock  breeding.    "However, after six years of implementing Resolution No. 10  on the contractual system, only 65 percent of households in the  district earn enough grain for self-consumption. The remaining  35 percent face a grain shortage and numerous difficulties due  to poverty, among them more than 11 percent experience hunger  [dqois] from five to six months."    What is the main causes of hunger and poverty experienced by  the abovementioned 35 percent of the district's households?  Through our studies, we found that these households had  insufficient capital, used poor cultivation methods, while the  cost of production was too high and the price of rice was  relatively low in the market.    "Indeed, more than half of the 35 percent poor households  are  short of capital; they have too many children, most of them are  in poor health. Worse still, they could not pay their debts to  the local agricultural cooperative year after year."    To overcome these difficulties, the district must strive to  encourage the peasants to plant new high-yield rice and peanut  varieties to attain an average rice yield of 45 quintals per  hectar and peanut, 20 quintal per hectare. The district must  also strive to plant more soybean and sweet potatoes on its  fallow land to attain a production target of 70,000-80,000  tonnes of grain by the year 1997.    The goal of the district is to overcome hunger by 1998,  reduce the number of poor households by half, and help 40  percent of the total households in the district lead a better  life by the year 2000.    "The struggle against hunger and poverty is a difficult  task.  It requires coordination from various sectors and branches while  efforts must be made from the top to the lowest level. It is  necessary to carry out this struggle in close association with  the implementation of the family planning program to reduce the  population growth rate of the district from 2.4 percent at  present to 1.7 percent in the year 2000."</p>

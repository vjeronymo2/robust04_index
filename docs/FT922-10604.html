			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Deal reached on 7-day working at Kambalda WESTERN Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group, yesterday said that it had reached agreement with the Australian Workers' Union on continuous mining at its troubled Kambalda nickel operations in Western Australia. The group said the deal would lead to the revival of an ADollars 105m expansion plan for Kambalda, and the re-employment of 150 workers made redundant when the plan was abandoned during an industrial dispute in November. The union said that it had agreed to switch to seven-day mining in continuous shifts from five-day operation after WMC agreed to reduce the duration of shifts from eight hours to seven and a half hours. However, the agreement cannot be implemented until the Western Australian state government implements an undertaking to amend the state's Mines Regulation Act to allow continuous working. Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the company and the union had jointly requested the government to expedite the amendment, which would bring Western Australia into line with other Australian states. WMC said last week that production at Kambalda had been seriously affected by industrial action over the continuous mining dispute in the nine months to the end of March. The group said said ore treated at Kambalda fell to 763,000 tonnes over the first nine months of the current financial year, compared to 910,024 tonnes in the comparable period of the previous year. WMC's expansion plan for Kambalda would increase deep mining at several mines in the area, where WMC produces about 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year. The project is part of a ADollars 400m spending programme intended to increase the group's nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from 53,000. WMC shares rose 12 cents to ADollars 3.98 on the Australian Stock Exchange as news of the possible solution to the Kambalda problem filtered through.</p>

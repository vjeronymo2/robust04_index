			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Nato orders Serbian pull-back: Air strikes threatened in 10 days unless Sarajevo artillery is withdrawn Nato last night ordered the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their artillery encircling Sarajevo or face air strikes. The alliance ultimatum gave the Serbs 10 days from midnight tonight to comply. The dramatic Nato move, its most explicit threat of military intervention in the 22-month Bosnian war, came a few hours after Bosnian Serb commanders, under pressure, promised to move their guns from the hills around Sarajevo and observe a ceasefire in the battered city. US president Bill Clinton said Nato hoped that Bosnian Serb actions would make air strikes unnecessary. 'But no one should doubt Nato's resolve,' he said. 'Nato is now set to act.' The 16-member Nato alliance decided to create a 20km (12.5 mile) 'exclusion zone' around Sarajevo. All heavy weapons, including artillery, tanks and mortars must be moved out of the zone or placed under United Nations supervision. Heavy weapons left inside this zone 'will, along with their direct and essential military support facilities, be subject to Nato air strikes', a communique warned. Nato also warned that, even before the deadline, it was ready to unleash air strikes on heavy weapons found responsible for shelling civilians in Sarajevo. The decision is a watershed in the history of the Nato alliance, which is primed for offensive action for the first time since it was founded in 1949 to hold back communism. It came after more than 12 hours of talks, with Greece, an ally of Serbia, dissociating itself from the ultimatum without blocking it. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there was no need to go back to the UN Security Council for fresh authority to conduct air strikes. He appealed to Russia to support efforts to persuade the warring Serbs, Moslems and Croats to reach a political settlement in Bosnia. Mr Worner said there should be no speculation about the seriousness of the 10-day ultimatum. 'The deadline is firm . . . We are not looking to use force. We prefer a negotiated solution agreed by all the parties.' Nato explicitly authorised the commander-in-chief of allied forces in southern Europe to launch air strikes at the request of the UN. Air strikes taking place before the expiry of the deadline would need the approval of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Mr Worner said. After the deadline, attacks could take place simply 'in close co-ordination' with Mr Boutros Ghali. The Nato ambassadors hammered out the ultimatum in Brussels amid growing political pressure in the west for a military response to last Saturday's shelling of the Sarajevo market, when 68 civilians were killed and more than 200 wounded. During more than 12 hours of intense debate, Canada voiced concern that an open threat to intervene for the first time in the Bosnian civil war could put at risk nearly 200 lightly armed Canadian UN peacekeepers trapped in the eastern Moslem enclave of Srebrenica. But the issue was pressed by France, the US and the UK. Britain, a long-time sceptic on military intervention, supported a Franco-American draft setting a deadline for a pull-back. The wider diplomatic goal is to use a withdrawal to demilitarise Sarajevo and persuade the Bosnian Moslems to agree to a political settlement. The promise given by Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday was made in an accord with the Moslem-led Bosnian government army in talks at Sarajevo airport. General Sir Michael Rose, commander of UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, helped to bring about the accord, but voiced some scepticism. 'This is a very small start to a very large problem. People should not read too much into it as far as the overall situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina is concerned,' he said. A senior Bosnian army commander said he did not believe the Sarajevo truce would work. 'I think this is yet another game which the Serbs will get away with,' he said. With the threat of Nato air strikes hanging over their heads, Bosnian Serbs are due to hold talks with their Moslem and Croat foes in Geneva today to try to bring peace to Sarajevo. The talks were originally to have dealt only with issues such as hotlines between the factions. Nato's jets converge with its diplomacy, Page 3</p>

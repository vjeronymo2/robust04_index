			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Brazil's privatisation plans suffer setback Brazil's privatisation programme was set back yesterday by the failure to sell the petrochemical company Petroquimica Uniao, known as PQU. Only 5.07m of the 50m plus one voting shares, a controlling stake, were bought at auction on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange because of a dispute over government prices for petrochemical naphtha, PQU's main raw material. The privatisation had already been postponed five times, due to disagreements over the sale structure and the naphtha dispute. It looks unlikely that the government will manage to sell a further 32.5m shares, which would total 75 per cent of the offer, by this afternoon's deadline. If 75 per cent of the offer is not sold, the privatisation auction will be ruled invalid. A failure of the sale is expected to slow down the government's privatisation programme. Four petrochemicals companies have been privatised since April 1992 and others are planned. The Copene petrochemicals complex in the north-east Bahia region is among the largest potential privatisations. The main prospective buyer for PQU has been a consortium including Union Carbide and Polibrasil, some of PQU's main customers. Despite negotiations with the government's privatisation committee, they are still not satisfied with the price formula fixed by the government for naphtha, which is supplied to PQU by Petrobras, the federally-controlled oil company. The controlling stake is being given up by Petroquisa, a Petrobras subsidiary. The minimum sale price for the stake is Dollars 340m. The Odebrecht group, which announced last week it would not be bidding, has a minority share in the holding company Unipar, which owns 29 per cent of PQU. PQU is the basic supplier for chemicals companies in the Cubatao area near Sao Paulo and is the oldest of its kind in Brazil. The company expects sales of Dollars 450m this year.</p>

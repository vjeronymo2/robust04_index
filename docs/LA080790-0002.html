			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THURGOOD MARSHALL  </P> <P> Justice Thurgood Marshall's remarks regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge  David Souter and President Bush only served to demean the Supreme Court and  raise serious questions about Marshall's continued presence on the court  ("Somebody's Calling Bush's Shots, Marshall Says," Part A, July 27).  </P> <P> It is apparent that Justice Marshall is unable to remain and unbiased jurist  and sit in judgment on the important cases that come before the court. It might  be wise for the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct hearings to determine  whether Justice Marshall should be subject to impeachment for his conduct,  after completing its confirmation hearings on Judge Souter.  </P> <P> JOHN T.

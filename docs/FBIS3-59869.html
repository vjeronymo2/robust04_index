The United States desire to  contain China is being perceived here as a possible reason for  its exploiting the Kashmir dispute to further its own national  interests.    It is being said in influential circles here that the U.S.  is  not as much interested in India, Pakistan or Kashmir directly as  it is in using the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) region to  gain direct access to Tibet, sit at the doorstep of China and  needle China on human rights violations in Tibet.    A second U.S. objective is to compel India and Pakistan to  sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The Kashmir  dispute comes handy to the U.S. in trying to achieve this other  objective also.    The "China factor" is important as the U.S. never reconciled  itself to Pakistan ceding certain areas in the northern  territory of PoK to China in 1962. This made possible the  Karakoram highway and gave a motorable road to China leading to  Karachi and the waters of the Arabian Sea.    As it happened, Sardar Swaran Singh was India's foreign  minister then and leading a delegation to hold the first of five  rounds of talks with Pakistan. Some of the senior members of the  delegation, including Mr G. Parthasarthy, India's high  commissioner to Pakistan, were in favour of calling off the  talks in protest against Pakistan's act of ceding territory to  China which did not belong to Pakistan.    However, Mr Swaran Singh, after gathering a second opinion  from other delegates and also those who were not part of the  delegation, like Mr Pran Chopra, felt it more prudent to  continue with the talks as walking out in protest would be  portrayed as India having wriggled out of a situation.    During the Indo-Pak talks then, India lodged its protest  with  Pakistan over its ceding of this territory to China. When China  conveyed its displeasure over the Indian stand, it was stated  that the agreement provided that what was subsequently to be  done with the ceded territory depended on the settlement reached.    The view of a leading American journalist, Mr Tom Brady,  then  was that it was a clever move by China to get Pakistan to cede a  territory that gave it access to the Arabian Sea and the Gulf  region. As things stand, that territory is still with China and  it rankles not only India but the U.S. also.    It is possible that in this backdrop, the U.S. could be  floating the idea of a "unified independent Kashmir" through  various Kashmiri groups. There is no hard evidence for this  inference but considering that an independent Kashmir might be  more amenable to U.S. influence than to that of India or  Pakistan, it would be logically desirable from the U.S.  viewpoint to cultivate this proposition, more so because of the  unforeseeable kind of problems that might arise in the Central  Asian region and in Pakistan in the not too distant future. Put  simply, an independent Kashmir serves U.S. interests better.    It is known that the U.S. policy on China is to contain it  and continue to involve China in the world mainstream so that it  could convert itself into a democracy at some point of time. Its  first major approach to China, incidentally, was through  Pakistan when Dr Henry Kissinger paved the way for the  President, Mr Richard Nixon, to visit Beijing in the full glare  of international publicity.    Although U.S. regards Tibet as an autonomous region of  China,  it continues to use Tibet as an important stick to beat China  with on the issue of human rights violations in Tibet. If only  the U.S. can get to play a role in sorting out the Kashmir  dispute, it feels, it can increase the pressure on China by  focussing more sharply on human rights violations in Tibet.    In this context, when Ms Robin Raphel spoke of Kashmir being  disputed, the U.S. interest in the PoK part therefore cannot be  lost sight of by Indian policy makers. It is that part of  Kashmir, more than the part with India, that gives direct access  to Tibet and China and serves U.S. interests better.    There is a strong view among Kashmiri groups also that  neither the U.S. nor the European Parliament should be allowed  to play the broker in resolving the Kashmir issue. Despite that,  if the U.S. does get to play a role because India and Pakistan  cannot solve the problem through bilateral talks, the the U.S.  could well use that influence, after resolving the Kashmir  problem, to force India and Pakistan to sign on the NPT [Nuclear  Proliferation Treaty].    Unfortunately, there is no Policy Planning Group in the  external affairs ministry today. Such a think tank existed  during the days of Mrs Indira Gandhi's prime ministership and  was led by Mr G. Parthasarthy.    There is a view that such a group needs to be set up now to  provide valuable inputs and help avoid the impression that  government's responses were of a knee-jerk type. Apart from  experts, strategists and academicians, it could also have  articulate businessmen who can play an important role in  lobbying abroad for India.    As far back as 1988, a former foreign secretary had  recommended to the government to employ Mr Mark Siegel as a  lobbyist for India in the U.S.    Taking into consideration that the Israeli ambassador to  India has backed India on the cordon around Hazratbal shrine  issue, India could build on it and involve the powerful and  influential Israeli-Jewish lobby to which Mr Siegel belongs to  serve indian interests.    At a time when Pakistan is going all out to befriend and  convert U.S. Senators and British MPs [Member of Parliament] to  support its weak case on Kashmir, observers feel it would be  prudent for India to get its act together and make the best of  its strong case on Kashmir which might otherwise go by default.    Also interesting is the fact that relations between Israel  and China are warming up as are Sino-Indian relations. Sources  say it is perhaps time for a New Delhi-Beijing-Tel Aviv axis to  swing into operation to thwart evil designs on Kashmir.</p>

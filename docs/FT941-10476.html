			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Palmerston reveals funds shortfall Palmerston Holdings, the lossmaking property group whose shares have been suspended at 10p since the beginning of October, yesterday announced that there was a deficiency in its shareholders' funds of about Pounds 39.2m. The shortfall derived mostly from guarantees given in favour of its subsidiary and associated companies, the directors said. In the accounts for the year to March 31 1992, shareholders' funds showed a surplus of Pounds 1.78m. Having failed to reconstruct its finances in other ways, Palmerston is continuing with its plan to enter a company voluntary arrangement with its creditors under which they would refrain from exercising any of their rights for six months. During the six months, the group would seek an investor to inject new capital or pay the creditors. Palmerston feels this would produce a more satisfactory outcome for creditors and shareholders than the alternatives of receivership or liquidation.</p>

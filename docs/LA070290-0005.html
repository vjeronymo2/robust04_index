			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR'S CRISTIANI  </P> <P> It is unclear for whose benefit Jefferson Morley ("What We're Paying for in El  Salvador," Opinion, June 17) lambastes El Salvador's president, Alfredo  Cristiani, and Congress' decision to financially back him.  </P> <P> Perhaps it's for the benefit of the FMLN (the Communist guerrilla group that is  waging war against the Salvadoran government) or for just the usual media. In  any case, he does not speak for the proud Salvadoran people who give Cristiani  a 72% approval rating.  </P> <P> JUAN ROSA LOPEZ TROMEZ  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Straying from the charted path / A look at the background to Amstrad's problems WHEN Amstrad became a public company in 1980, the UK was sliding into a recession. Despite this, the company was able to beat its forecast and raise profits by 50 per cent. Twelve years later, as Mr Alan Sugar contemplates the possibility of taking Amstrad private again, Britain is once more in the grip of a recession. But this time Amstrad is about to report a loss that many expect to be worse than the company has forecast, and it faces the prospect of further retrenchment in one of its biggest and most successful businesses - the personal computer market. To some extent the reversal in the company's fortunes reflects the changes in the markets in which it operates. Consumer electronics and personal computers, two markets where Amstrad has made its mark in Europe, have become so competitive that one bad mistake can send even the leading players reeling. But the company's problems are not simply a result of the turmoil in its markets. 'Amstrad is not losing money just because of the recession,' as one analyst put it. The difficulties the company finds itself in are as much symptoms of a creeping change in the way it operates. Amstrad has failed to follow its own cardinal rules that laid the foundation for its extraordinary success in the 1980s. Mr Sugar had built Amstrad from scratch into a company with a Pounds 600m annual turnover by offering consumers product after product that were based not on any technological breakthrough but on a brilliant grasp of what they wanted. In the late-1970s it was the Tower System which combined the amplifier, tuner and cassette deck in one unit and brought the hi-fi set to the truck driver and his wife, as Mr Sugar liked to say. By the mid-1980s, Amstrad had moved on to personal computers and scored a coup with its low cost, one-plug, all in one PCs. As one computer success followed another and were joined by inexpensive facsimile machines, video recorders and satellite dishes, the company's profits soared to a record Pounds 160m in 1988 on turnover that peaked at Pounds 635m. Amstrad's share price climbed to a high of 233p in August 1988. While Mr Sugar steered Amstrad to the height of its glory with one hit after another, he was always careful to ensure that the company moved out of its markets as soon as the going got rough. 'We're a very profit-oriented company and the best way to make profits is to be active in an area where no-one else is. And as soon as margins are eroded, it's time to say Sayonara,' Mr Sugar once remarked. As the company prepares to report a huge loss for the year, shareholders may be forgiven for wondering if Mr Sugar has lost his knack for reading the market. The company has not had a big hit on the market for some time and the new offerings it has lined up do not have the same sparkle as its earlier products. The cheap videophone and user-friendly notepad PC are fine ideas but the videophones made by the big name manufacturers are not significantly more expensive and everyone knows that prices will fall anyway within a few years. The problem facing Amstrad is perhaps not just that it cannot come up with good ideas, but that the formula of selling easy-to-use electronics at low prices is no longer its sole preserve. That is where the company got stuck with the PC market. Having plunged into the business, Amstrad was clobbered when it was slow in moving old products and introducing new ones. While going private could pave the way to the more radical surgery that may be needed to nurse the company back to profitability, the view among analysts is that it may also provide an easier exit from the PC market. The company still has a credible position in brown goods and satellite equipment which could provide profits when the upturn comes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Special Envoy Yasushi Yasushi Akashi by </F> Tessa Szyszkowitz; place and date not given: "Do You Like  Boxing Fights?"]    [Text] [Szyszkowitz] Compared with Beirut or Kigali,  Sarajevo is still lucky in this unfortunate war. Why is the  United Nations committing itself here, of all countries, with a  reconstruction plan totaling 6 billion schillings?    [Akashi] Sarajevo was a symbol of coexistence between  nations with different religions and ethnic backgrounds. This  symbol was destroyed in the last two years with incredible pain.  It is therefore of particular importance for Europe to  reconstruct the city.    [Szyszkowitz] The central point of the reconstruction plan  is free access to the city. As long as the roads to Sarajevo  are blocked by the Serbs, basic materials cannot be supplied.    [Akashi] The traffic route from Metkovic on the coast to  Sarajevo and Tuzla is improving constantly. It is not perfect,  but there are certain successes. We must rebuild bridges and  repair roads. If we show the people that peace pays off, they  will eventually not wish to fight any more. They will exert  pressure on their leaders to negotiate more seriously.    [Szyszkowitz] Are the three warring parties not negotiating  seriously enough?    [Akashi] We will never achieve a solution if every side  calls for peace on their terms. Everyone wants 100 percent.  There must be compromises.    [Szyszkowitz] Could you imagine that the Bosnian Serbs will  return 20 percent of the conquered territory?    [Akashi] That will be difficult, but I do not rule it out.  The plan to divide the territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51  percent for the Muslim-Croat federation -- was developed in  long, tough negotiations with the three parties. The UN  delegates believe it is feasible. In the future, the  negotiations will be on the quality of the territories rather  than on percentages.    [Szyszkowitz] In Mostar last week, Croat women stopped a UN  relief convoy for Muslim refugees. Do you not think that the  Muslim-Croat cooperation could fail in reality once again?    [Akashi] Is there any federation that has been peaceful from  the start? Think of the United States, Switzerland, Canada --  they are all federations. They were not perfect at the  beginning. We must give the Muslims and Croats time to win  confidence in one another. Do not be so pessimistic!    [Szyszkowitz] Even if you are optimistic regarding the  Muslim-Croat friendship -- could not this federation also lead  to an escalation of war against the common enemy, the Serbs?    [Akashi] You could interpret it this way. I hope, however,  that this federation will be an element of peace in all of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Szyszkowitz] Bosnian Government troops are currently  fighting for the reconquest of territories. Will the political  leadership be satisfied with 51 percent of the former state  territory?    [Akashi] One needs the spirit of concession and the feeling  that every side will win more by making peace than by continuing  the war. Of course, for small territories a war could be  continued for another 100 years. However, the peoples'  prosperity depends not only on the size of their countries.  Germany and Japan are good examples of this. They were reduced  by World War II and are now richer than they were before the war.    [Szyszkowitz] Do you also have such philosophical debates  with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic?    [Akashi] I am very often philosophical -- with all parties.  They cannot be convinced easily, but all these talks are useful.  Do you like boxing fights? I watch them often on television.  Then I tell myself that, granted, I cannot defeat my opponent,  but I have staying power. In the twelfth round, it is not I who  is exhausted, but my opponent. The same holds true for the  negotiations. We must continue, even though there are no  prompt, striking successes. The media only report on our  defeats and setbacks. I already had such a critical world media  in my last job in Cambodia. However, I won in the end.    [Szyszkowitz] You were sharply criticized in the Balkans  because you were allegedly too pro-Serb. Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic told me a few days ago that he will not speak with you  any more. How do you negotiate in such a climate?    [Akashi] We have all types of contacts. As you have seen in  our news conference, I do speak with Hasan Muratovic, the  Bosnian representative on the Sarajevo committee.    [Szyszkowitz] Mr. Muratovic apparently wanted to apologize  to you for his government.    [Akashi] Well, the mood has improved a bit. I am trying to  do my best to remain unbiased. We will never be able to fully  satisfy everyone. The warring parties must see the necessities  to which we are subjected. Being an impartial international  organization, we cannot become the fourth warring party. We  must be above it. This is of course not always pleasant for the  people concerned. Some weeks ago, the Serbs did not want to  talk to us any more, because we called for NATO air raids for  the liberation of Gorazde. Now we are having a similar problem  with the Bosnian Government.    [Szyszkowitz] The West Europeans are also threatening to  strike and withdraw their UN soldiers. Granted, during the NATO  defense ministers' spring meeting in Brussels last week, the  participants corroborated their commitment. But France, which  has threatened more vociferously than the others to withdraw its  troops, is not present at these meetings.    [Akashi] To a certain extent, I can understand that the  French and other governments are frustrated and impatient.  After all, we cannot stay in the former Yugoslavia for ever.  There are 16 other UN operations, and we only have limited  resources. If the parties to the conflict continue to be  unwilling to make peace, we can only go. I hope the three sides  see this.</p>

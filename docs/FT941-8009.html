			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Thatcher arms memo demanded A prominent opposition figure in Malaysia says he will ask the government of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, for a copy of a 1988 memorandum of understanding signed by Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the then UK prime minister. The document related to more than Pounds 1bn of British arms sales to Malaysia. Mr Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party, has been the main force behind the setting up of a parliamentary panel to investigate the arms sales. 'The all-party parliamentary committee on parliamentary honour and national integrity will write to prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for a copy of the secret memorandum of understanding signed with Margaret Thatcher,' said Mr Lim. Mr Lim said the panel would also ask for a list of the local agents of the various British companies involved in the arms sales following the signing of the memorandum 'to ascertain whether there was any favouritism, irregularity or hanky-panky involved'. The Malaysian parliamentary committee has yet to meet and opposition MPs say it is unlikely that parties that make up the governing national front coalition will agree to being represented on the body. In Britain the Labour party has alleged that the 1988 memorandum on defence sales to Malaysia was linked to the granting of Pounds 234m of UK aid for the Pergau dam project in Malaysia. Such a linkage would be a breach of the government's own aid guidelines. Two British parliamentary committees are investigating the affair.</p>

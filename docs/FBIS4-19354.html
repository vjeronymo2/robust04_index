			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Eduardo Catroga by Virgilio </F> Azevedo, Francisco Ferreira da Silva, and Luis Tiberio; place  and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  Economic Policy </H5>   [EXPRESSO] Is it possible right now to give some basic  guidelines of the state budget for 1995?    [Catroga] The 1995 budget's basic guideline is the  continuation of the aim of budgetary consolidation. In 1995 we  wish to do better than in 1994, within the context of concern to  achieve a sound course for public finances.    [EXPRESSO] But do the Revised Convergence Program (PCR)  figures still stand?    [Catroga] That is the goal for now and for 1995. In the  Portuguese convergence program, the target for the deficit is  around 5 percent.    [EXPRESSO] In the state budget, the average for 1995-96 is  around 4.75 to 5 percent....    [Catroga] We succeeded in moving from a deficit of 10  percent of GDP in 1985 to 3.3 percent in 1992. Hence we will  certainly be able to achieve the budgetary consolidation aims in  the medium term, with the contribution of economic recovery,  success in the struggle against tax evasion, and success in the  constant improvement of the tax authorities' efficiency. For  next year, we hope that the economic recovery will accelerate,  in line with the European economies' prospects for 1995.    [EXPRESSO] "Will accelerate...." Do you mean that you now  believe in an economic recovery in 1994?    [Catroga] I have said that the main aim of economic policy  for 1994 and 1995 is the creation of conditions for a sustained  and noninflationary economic recovery. Three or four months  ago, I said that there were hopes and some signs. I now  emphasize: There are very positive signs.    [EXPRESSO] What are they?    [Catroga] In the first place, the indicators of confidence.  I have just received a Confederation of Portuguese Industry  survey of manufacturing industry that shows a significant  improvement in the indicators of confidence, enterprises' order  books, and employers' expectations of new investments. If we  compare the levels of operating capacity in October 1993 with  the figures available in January 1994, we will see that there  was an increase of around 4 percent in the rate of use of  production capacity.    If we analyze the industrial production indexes, we find  that  since July there has been some change for the better. There are  also positive signs in the tourism sector: Tourist demand for  this year has increased substantially. There are also some  positive signs in the sphere of agriculture: This year, for the  first time in many years, we have favorable weather conditions  that have made it possible to restore the water level in dams  and for spring crops to grow normally.    [EXPRESSO] But there are also unfavorable signs....    [Catroga] There are, such as, for instance, the consumption  of cement and steel in the first two months of 1994. This is  linked to the normal lag in the construction sector's reaction  to the economic cycle -- especially in the civil construction  sector.    In any event, there are positive signs from the external  demand side, and signs in the European economies that are also a  mixture of encouragement and apprehension: Encouragement,  because the indicators at the European level show a  strengthening of confidence over the past four months;  apprehension in view of the weakness of the recovery of some  locomotive economies (such as the German economy) and the French  and Spanish economies' uncertain trends.    These are contradictory signs, as is characteristic,  moreover, of a period of a change of trend. Because of all this,  I believe that there will be a recovery. It will be slow and  difficult, but it will happen.    [EXPRESSO] Right now in 1994?    [Catroga] In 1994, there should be some recovery, albeit  insignificant. The level of economic activity is expected to  rise gradually in the second half of this year, and more  strongly in the course of 1995, in line with the European  economies.    [EXPRESSO] What will Portuguese economic growth be this  year?    [Catroga] The favorable and unfavorable external and  internal factors do not yet enable us to draw conclusions for a  revision of the macroeconomic scenario underlying the budget for  1994. So, right now, the government's goals are still the  same....    [EXPRESSO] With respect to all the indicators?    [Catroga] With respect to all the indicators. There are no  figures as yet for undertaking a revision, so those indicators  still seem possible. An economic recovery is taking shape that  will be modest in 1994 and stronger in 1995. I have always  said, and I repeat, that the recovery will be slow and difficult.    [EXPRESSO] Do you still believe in the goal of a 5.5 percent  inflation rate set in the state budget for this year?    [Catroga] I believe that right now there are no grounds in  this, as in the other macroeconomic variables, for changing the  macroeconomic scenario projected in drafting the budget. The  inflation target is difficult but not impossible. Moreover, the  inflation rate has now fallen; it resumed its downward trend in  December....    [EXPRESSO] In annual terms, yes, but not in monthly terms.    [Catroga] In annual terms it is now 6.2 percent....    [EXPRESSO] But in monthly terms that trend is not confirmed.    [Catroga] No, there are always month-to-month fluctuations,  but there is a much more important factor (to which analysts do  not always pay due attention) -- the trend in inflation in terms  of comparable fluctuations in the nonnegotiable goods sector  [sector dos bens nao transaccionaveis]. The nonnegotiable goods  sector, which showed considerable resistance to the fall in  inflation until November, clearly fell from December. From 8.8  percent in November, it then fell to 7.8 percent and 7.6  percent. Now this is a favorable factor.    [EXPRESSO] There are economists who say that if the current  monthly rate of growth of inflation -- around 0.7 percent --  persists, we will reach the end of the year with a rate close to  8 percent, and that we will succeed in reaching last year's  inflation rate only by reducing it to 0.5 percent per month.    [Catroga] It is always possible to devise several scenarios.  The scenarios depend on the assumptions. Many of those analysts  also did not believe that the government would achieve the goal  of 6.5 percent in 1993, just as they did not believe that the  8.9 percent target in 1992 was attainable. I say that it is a  difficult and challenging, but not impossible, target, and that  it remains a goal of economic policy to continue the process of  deflating the Portuguese economy within the framework of the  targets set.    [EXPRESSO] Let us turn to monetary policy and interest  rates....    [Catroga] The other central banks' benchmark rates [taxas  directoras] have gradually moved downward, and so the Bank of  Portugal, using its powers to implement monetary policy, which  it exercises independently, took the view that there are  conditions for a fall in benchmark rates. I will be more  specific: The Bank of Portugal's liquidity transfer rate [taxa  de cedencia de liquidez] in real terms (that is, nominal rates  minus inflation) was around 8.1 percent 31 March 1993, as  against 8.6 percent in Spain. Today, the Bank of Portugal's  benchmark rate in real terms is around 3.6 percent, and in Spain  it is 2.8 percent....    [EXPRESSO] According to the prime minister, interest rates  will fall another 2 percent.    [Catroga] No. What the prime minister said was that in a  scenario in which inflation falls to around 5 percent, and in  which there is success in the policy of budgetary consolidation,  in the wage restraint policy, and in the fight against  inflation...with all these assumptions it is natural for  benchmark rates to fall! That is what he said.    [EXPRESSO] But some economists have said that the repetition  of the "promise" of a fall in interest rates in official  speeches has now brought the situation to such a pass that there  is no longer room for maneuver....    [Catroga] Confusion between benchmark rates and credit  market rates has become widespread. In the case of benchmark  rates, the room for maneuver depends on the trend in inflation  and the trend in the other banks' central benchmark rates. So  it will be concluded on the basis of the trend in these two  variables whether or not there is room for maneuver. We believe  that the trend in the other European central banks' central  benchmark rates is downward, and we believe that the tendency  will be for the downward trend for the inflation rate to  continue. Accordingly, and without prejudice to exchange rate  targets, if these conditions are fulfilled, conditions for a  sustained and gradual fall in interest rates will continue to  exist.    [EXPRESSO] Are you not worried that we have witnessed an  upsurge in short-term interest rates?    [Catroga] They are not benchmark rates, and we must not  confuse erratic movements, which are sometimes the result of  certain specific daily developments, with structural trends....    [EXPRESSO] And are you also not worried by the market's  nervous reactions? There was, in fact, a nervous reaction to  the prime minister's statements. Rates reached around 30  percent, and the Bank of Portugal spent almost 200 million  contos [1 conto:1,000 escudos] in order to calm nerves.    [Catroga] The Bank of Portugal has considerable reserves --  it has reserves totaling $20 billion -- and Portugal is one of  the countries in the world with the best external liquidity  positions (it is one of the countries with the highest cover  ratios for import months [coeficiente de cobertura dos meses de  importacao]), and so this does not worry the central bank or the  government.    If it is rational -- and in the medium term markets are  rational and pay attention to "fundamentals" -- the market will  have to pay attention to a sign of which I have just learned  from REUTERS -- the good results of the implementation of the  budget in the first quarter. This was a good sign! Another  good sign is the effective wage restraint, which is occurring in  this country as it has not occurred for many years, not only in  the public sector but also in the private sector.    [EXPRESSO] In any event, the agitation on the market has a  great deal to do with exchange rate policy and with some  people's gambling on a possible devaluation of the escudo.    [Catroga] The central bank can reduce its real benchmark  rates and without prejudice to the aims of exchange rate  stability. The macroeconomists are in the habit of saying that  an exchange rate of balance is one that maintains an appropriate  exchange rate that maintains equilibrium in the balance of  payments in the long term.    And my conclusion is that in fact the current exchange rate,  following the adjustment which occurred last year, is a correct  exchange rate, because -- employers assure me when I speak with  them -- it has ceased to be cited by the real economy as a  factor that affects Portuguese enterprises' competitiveness.    [EXPRESSO] "Has ceased to be" because the escudo used to be  too strong?    [Catroga] What I say is that the exchange rate is no longer  a factor affecting the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy  and Portuguese enterprises. It is clear, as the prime minister  has already stated, that exchange rate stability, contrary to  what many fundamentalists also believe, does not mean exchange  rate immutability.    [EXPRESSO] Does rejecting "exchange rate immutability" mean  having a flexible escudo instead of a strong escudo or a weak  escudo?    [Catroga] No. We must have an appropriate exchange rate,  and today's exchange rate is appropriate to the competitiveness  of the Portuguese economy and enterprises.    [EXPRESSO] Which means that it used not to be....    [Catroga] Hmmmm.... I have not conducted a historical  analysis.  <H5>  Europe </H5>   [EXPRESSO] Portugal came closer to the Community average  between 1986 and 1990 than between 1986 and 1992. That is, the  fall in the period of recession was clearly noted, and it  converged less than Spain between 1986 and 1992, but convergence  now has a goal called Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).    [Catroga] Portugal is committed to building EMU. We  ratified the treaty on European union and believe that this  project, which is a gradualist project, is important for  galvanizing competitiveness in the European economy, but we also  believe that EMU is not in itself a factor promoting European  economic recovery on a sustained basis.    As regards real convergence, Portugal has achieved  significant progress. As compared with Spain, with respect to  convergence, we were better in 1993 than in 1991, and we are  much better than as compared with Greece; Greece has widened the  gap.    Between 1986 and 1992, our GDP rose from 52 percent of the  European average to 60.7 percent. Moreover, the Community aid  plan [Quadro Comunitario de Apoio] must be viewed in its true  significance, within the framework of a Union's regional  development policy, and it must also be explained that there are  other, richer countries than Portugal, such as the Netherlands  or Denmark, which receive higher per capita Community aid. In  any event, the second Community aid plan will make possible,  like the first, the reduction of regional inequalities. The  Portuguese Government's medium term aim is to grow again at an  average rate exceeding the Community average by 1 percent.    [EXPRESSO] Starting from when?    [Catroga] Starting from now, from the new Community aid  plan, which starts in 1994 and will have greater impact from the  second half of 1994. According to a European Commission  estimate, the effect of this factor alone points to a growth of  the Portuguese economy exceeding the Community average by 0.5  percent.    [EXPRESSO] According to the Commission, the Twelve's growth  forecast is 1.3 percent in 1994 and 2.1 percent in 1995. Will  Portugal exceed this growth rate by that 0.5 percent margin?    [Catroga] I believe so, in the medium term....    [EXPRESSO] In 1994 or 1995?    [Catroga] I believe that we will exceed the Community  average in 1995.    [EXPRESSO] But not in 1994?    [Catroga] In 1994, much depends on the European economy's  performance.    [EXPRESSO] Let us talk about the convergence criteria for  EMU.    [Catroga] As [European Commission Vice President] Leon  Brittan stated in an interview published last weekend, I believe  that these conclusions on the criteria are not yet properly  founded in terms of a reassessment or otherwise. The criteria  exist, we must be pragmatic, and they are the benchmarks for the  economic policy targets. I must say that, as benchmarks, I do  not believe that the main guidelines of economic policy would be  substantially different with or without these convergence  criteria. In my opinion, what is essential is the consolidation  of a favorable trend with respect to all of them.    [EXPRESSO] But in the case of the public debt, Portugal's  trend has been clearly unfavorable. For a set target of 71  percent for this year, we already reached 70.2 percent in  January, and February brought the 750 million [currency  unspecified] foreign loan "bill...."    [Catroga] Let us examine each of the convergence criteria.  With respect to the trend in the inflation rate, I believe that  we are on the right path. With respect to the public deficit  criterion, the Portuguese economy has already shown through the  trend from 1986 to 1992 (the public deficit, in terms of GDP,  was just 3.3 percent of GDP in 1992, whereas in 1985-86 it was  around 10 percent) that it is possible to have success in the  process of budgetary consolidation. So 1993 must be viewed only  as a point of discontinuity, and as I have already said, the  strategy of budgetary consolidation is a settled policy of the  government and the Finance Ministry, and we will resume the path  of that sound course for public finances in 1994.    In 1993, according to the latest figures at my disposal,  Portugal stood at 7.1 percent. The provisional figure for Spain  is 7.3 percent, but the latest figures at my disposal suggest a  higher figure, after the inclusion of the so-called regional  deficits. Italy is close to 10 percent, the United Kingdom  stands at 8.7 percent, Greece at 17.5 percent, and Belgium at  7.2 percent. France stands at 5.5 percent. The figure I have  for Germany is 4.2 percent, except that, according to what  Helmut Schlesinger stated in Lisbon, it will rise to 7 percent  if we take into account the deficit of the Treuhand -- the state  agency overseeing the privatization measures in the former GDR.    [EXPRESSO] There remains the public debt....    [Catroga] At the end of 1993, we had a ratio of 66.4 percent  with respect to GDP.    [EXPRESSO] At the end of January, it had risen by nearly 4  percent. Is the trend not the main thing?    [Catroga] Certainly, but we are also going to reduce it,  and we are close to the target, which is 60 percent.    [EXPRESSO] Except that we have already been in the area of  64 percent....    [Catroga] Yes, but the indicator worsened in all the  countries. Look, in Italy it went from 108 percent to 118  percent; in Germany it went from 44 percent to 49 percent, in  France from 39 percent to 44 percent, in the Netherlands from 79  percent to 81 percent, in Belgium from 121 percent to 128  percent, and in Denmark from 68 percent to 80 percent.    With respect to the fourth criterion -- long-term interest  rates -- we are virtually there. Right now, the criterion is  7.6 percent, and we are already below 9 percent.    [EXPRESSO] With all this, will the third stage of EMU really  be in 1997?    [Catroga] The view now shared within the Union is that the  third stage will perhaps be not in 1997 but somewhere between  1997 and 1999. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Weaker gilts unsettle equity market THE improvement in market sentiment for much of the week all but disappeared yesterday as dealers reacted strongly to extremely disappointing inflation numbers as the long three-week Easter account drew to a close. Already shortened by the Easter Monday bank holiday the week's trading was severely disrupted by the second national railway strike in two weeks. Many trading desks were badly affected by the industrial action but its was the inflation statistics which took the heart out of the day's trading. 'The market's appetite went out of the window with the inflation figures,' commented the head of trading at one of the leading UK securities houses. Equities took their cue from the gilts market where early minor falls rapidly turned into substantial losses after the inflation details were published. The Footsie 100-index ended a thoroughly disappointing session 15.3 lower at 2,824.4, leaving the index only 2.4 higher on a week which provided strong evidence in the form of increasing business confidence, rises in house prices and an upturn in car sales, that the recovery in the UK economy is well and truly underway The session began quietly with dealers opening share prices marginally below their overnight closing levels after a less than convincing performance by Wall Street, which rallied after some hefty early falls. And London dealers were unhappy at the steep decline on the Tokyo market. Opening some 1.7 lower the Footsie 100 did little more than mark time until the release of news that the underlying rate of inflation had risen to 3.5 per cent shook the market. It triggered a sharp sell off in gilts where the longer dated stocks, down around an eighth of a point at the opening, quickly went into reverse and eventually ended a busy session with losses extending to just over a full point. Index-linked issues settled with falls of around  5/8 . The inflation numbers doused lingering hopes that UK interest rates could move lower in the short-term. Sterling fell heavily against the dollar although it was only marginally lower against the D-Mark. The Footsie future immediately fell sharply as the inflation implications filtered into The market, taking the cash market with it. At its worst the Footsie 100 was down 22.6 at 2,817.1 with traders noting the appearance of some large lines of stock. A modestly firm opening by Wall Street helped steady the London market which managed to recoup some of its earlier losses. Turnover was a creditable 586.7m shares.</p>

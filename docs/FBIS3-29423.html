			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 17 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-il, the son  of and heir to Kim Il-song, has recently been rebuked by his  father over Pyongyang's nuclear policy and has since been  refraining from appearing in public scenes, a source here in  Beijing said on Thursday.    The source well versed with North Korea's internal affairs  said this is why he has been staying away from various recent  public gatherings designed to mark his 52nd birthday on Feb. 16,  one of major North Korean national holidays. The junior Kim is  known to have been managing day-to-day state affairs on behalf  of his aging father for years.    "It has been learned that the senior Kim reprimanded his son  for engineering Pyongyang's nuclear policy in a hardline  direction, a policy which has made North Korea's position very  difficult," the source said.    As Kim Il-song has lately been raising his voice in major  policies and as nuclear talks with the United States were  progressing, Kim Chong-il voluntarily chose to be on his good  behavior, the source said. He was quick to add, however, that  this does not mean that Kim Chong-il's position as the future  ruler has been shaken. The junior Kim enjoys a broad power base  built elaborately in the party, administration and military, the  source said. Yet, he said, it is true that moderate people with  Kim Il-song in the center, who advocate the resolution of the  nuclear question through negotiations, are rising fast in North  Korea today.    The source also showed skepticism over various rumors  surrounding the junior Kim, saying none of such rumors could be  verified. The rumors include an alleged brain damage he  suffered in a traffic accident last autumn and his being in an  awkward position over the uncovery of his misuse of a large  amount of foreign exchanges.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Somewhere there's a bull run seeking a china shop These are tough times for the global investment strategists as the markets seek to re-establish order and coherence after last year's bull run. Take your pick: Morgan Stanley, for instance, which rampaged through Hong Kong so noisily as a raging bull last autumn is now in a seriously bearish mode globally, while on the other hand Goldman Sachs is complaining bitterly that the markets have over-reacted to the Federal Reserve's modest tightening. In important sections of the global securities market price leadership is shifting from one group of investors to another - from international hedge funds to domestic pension funds, for instance. US mutual funds have introduced a new element of potential volatility. In the process investment yields are taking quantum leaps to levels at which the new investors can hope to attain their objectives. The damage to securities prices has in some cases been substantial; to take an extreme, the stock market in Turkey has slumped by 45 per cent from its mid-January peak. Yet there is also the intriguing likelihood that new anomalies are being created. UK gilts, for instance, are now providing yields (of up to some 7.6 per cent at the long end) which the Bank of England is apparently no longer willing to offer on new issues, hence the floater launched yesterday. The great divide is between the static interpretations of global valuations and the more dynamic theories of flows of funds. On the former basis a sharp jump in the yield on, say, long Treasury bonds is most easily explained in terms of a significantly worsening view by investors of the prospects for inflation. However, this makes little sense when the Fed tightening that triggered the move was designed to head off future inflationary pressures. Cause and effect are more easily related on a flow of funds analysis: the Fed is in the process of shutting off the liquidity pump which inflated securities markets worldwide. The effect of loose monetary policy is normally evident much sooner in financial asset price inflation than in the prices of goods and services generally. A liquidity-driven equity bull market can be punctured more completely than one primarily supported by growth in dividends and earnings. Distance makes the heart grow harder: there has been a near-30 per cent tumble in the Hong Kong equity market since the peak at the beginning of the year, while New York's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index has only retreated some 3 per cent. The contrast is symptomatic of how last year's flows have begun to reverse: US-based money is being withdrawn, or at least is being parked on the sidelines. Flows of money do not easily explain the whole confusing picture, however. In the UK (and elsewhere in Europe) the equity and bond markets have moved down more or less together, but in the US almost all the damage has been suffered in bonds. As for Japan, the Nikkei Index is up some 16 per cent so far in 1994 whereas yen bonds have slumped (the 10-year JGB yield is up by 106 basis points to 4.1 per cent over the same 12 weeks). Stick all that into your tactical asset allocation model and watch it crash. Well, perhaps, your model is extremely sophisticated. It might allow for the fact that the UK stock market is yield-oriented and is thus sensitive to long-term interest rates whereas nobody buys Japanese equities for the income (which is still quite a long way short of 1 per cent). Some valuation models look at the influence of short-term as well as long-term interest rates, however: the puzzle here is that everywhere outside the US short and long rates are moving in different directions. Again, your model will freeze unless you have programmed in some sophisticated time lags. Japan is the real challenge. Recovery prospects are a matter of faith, but Tokyo is the beneficiary of setbacks elsewhere. Global investors are seriously underweight in Japanese equities and naturally consider filling that gap when they take profits elsewhere, and find there are no better stories around. But as Mr Robin Griffiths, James Capel's technical analyst, says, the views get more bullish the further you go away from Japan. In the chaotic world of global investment there simply has to be a bull market happening somewhere.</p>

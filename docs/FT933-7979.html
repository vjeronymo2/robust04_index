			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Two banks to advise on Brent Walker disposal BRENT WALKER, the property and leisure group, yesterday announced the appointment of two merchant banks to advise it on the possible flotation of William Hill, which might value the betting shop chain at over Pounds 500m. The banks are Hill Samuel, which is Brent Walker's existing adviser, and NM Rothschild. William Hill has to repay a Pounds 350m loan by March 1 1994, and a flotation is one way of raising the money. Brent Walker has received a cash bid of Pounds 360m for William Hill from a consortium of investors, led by SG Warburg. However, Brent Walker is keen to retain a stake in William Hill and had talked of maintaining a 40 per cent shareholding. Bankers believe it would not be possible for Brent Walker to keep more than a small interest or 'the sums don't work out,' one said. Potential investors are likely to want to see William Hill managed independently from Brent Walker and financially viable on a stand-alone basis. Brent Walker bought William Hill for Pounds 685m in 1989 from Grand Metropolitan but is trying to reclaim Pounds 200m of the purchase price.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Labour's Maastricht dissidents pull back from clash with Smith LABOUR'S deep-rooted internal divisions over Maastricht were patched over yesterday when critics of the treaty shied away from a direct confrontation with Mr John Smith, the new party leader. The party's national executive committee postponed a debate on European policy until after the French referendum on Sunday. The leadership will then draw up a formal position to present to the shadow cabinet and NEC the following Wednesday. The decision by senior shadow cabinet ministers not to press for immediate policy changes is likely to defuse the row in the short-term. However, profound differences between Labour's keen Europeans and those determined to see substantial changes in the Maastricht treaty are unlikely to dissolve. Mr Bryan Gould, the senior frontbencher who challenged Mr Smith for the leadership, made clear before the meeting that he viewed the weekend realignment in the exchange rate mechanism as likely to exacerbate rather than relieve economic tensions in the longer term. In interviews with broadcasters after the meeting, Mr Smith made clear that he expected the three members of the shadow cabinet who have criticised his strategy over Maastricht and sterling to toe the line once a formal policy position is agreed. Dismissing the likelihood of a confrontation with Mr Gould, he nonetheless signalled that he will act firmly to enforce a common stance. 'I don't think there will be a case of any of my colleagues not accepting the collective responsibility they have been living with for years,' he said. Officials also said the leader would not cede to pressure for a referendum on the treaty and continued to oppose any suggestion of a sterling devaluation. The truce came after a personal appeal from Mr Smith at the national executive meeting, called to approve a new document - Agenda for Change - setting out Labour's post-election goals. In consequence, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, agreed to withdraw amendments to the document's section on Europe which aimed to keep open the policy option of devaluation and which required democratic constraints on a European central bank. Describing the meeting as constructive, Mr Blunkett said there was a case for a breathing space until the French referendum was completed. 'It seemed sensible to heal wounds and ensure we have a positive way forward,' he said. Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwinger, mocked the shadow cabinet dissidents, however, claiming they were merely adopting leftwing postures before the NEC elections at the party conference later this month. The Agenda for Change document, agreed yesterday, intends to address the causes of Labour's election defeat by presenting the party as the champion of ordinary people's goals and ambitions.</p>

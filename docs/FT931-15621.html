			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: London gets a diffused view of the Bolshoy - This company needs full-length ballets to do justice to its talents Ludicrously hyped as 'the dance event of the century' - not even the Bolshoy's stunning first visit to London in 1956 deserved those laurels  - this appearance by Moscow's pride at the Albert Hall is an exercise both welcome and exasperating. There is nothing especially notable about large balletic spectacles. The Bolshoy has played in huge arenas before (though not in Britain); Maurice Bejart took his troupe to vast sports stadia in Berlin and Mexico, and even the tented Grand Place in Brussels. Under the aegis of the Entertainment Corporation, the Bolshoy and the Kirov played 'popular' seasons - and very successfully so - in a tent in Battersea Park and in halls in Dublin and in Islington. Ballet has also been well presented at the Albert Hall: two decades ago we saw Festival Ballet with some Kirov stars in fascinating performances. What Derek Block, impresario of this present venture, has identified is a public taste for the artistic gigantism that has lately produced arena opera here, and which is seen in Moscow in the balletic spectacles at the Kremlin Palace, and in Paris at the Palais des Congres and the Palais des Sports. Since London can offer no stage suitable for the grandiose effects which are part of the attraction of such shows - and it is worth recalling that the Entertainment Corporation planned a theatre for just such events five years ago - the Albert Hall has been converted for the occasion. The result, as I saw it on Sunday night, is curious. The organ is hidden behind a mock-up of the Imperial box at the Bolshoy Theatre, with a cluster of surrounding loges to form a convex screen. The curtains of the box are drawn back to suggest a distant false proscenium behind which pieces of scenery can be placed and dancers can stand or make entries. The effect is disorientating. Are we gazing at the box (if so, we are on stage at the Bolshoy) or is the box back-stage for us to view as members of the public? In front of this tease there projects a large apron stage which occupies about half the promenade, while the orchestra takes up the remaining space. Surrounding this on three sides is placed the audience. The generous dance area, which will allow the Bolshoy style that freedom of movement it knows at home, and the fine acoustic for the BBC Concert Orchestra who are the musicians of the season, are a real advantage. But it is one largely dissipated by two inescapable facts. Ballet is an art designed for a proscenium arch. It is framed, shaped, focused by our view through that magic opening. And choreography and dance interpretation are orientated to the stage's confines, are created for a head-on view by an audience and are conceived as having a central point of interest. (Balanchine theorised about this, and identified problems attendant upon peripheral dance activity). In Sunday's performance, the choreography - spread over the stage so that the encircling audience might feel that they were seeing the Bolshoy dancers, and even the ballets named - was dispersed as if by the gales blowing outside the hall. Action, dance-interest, characterisation, were diffused. As an aid to incomprehension, the programme, like most of the offerings in this season, comprised 'suites' abstracted from full-length ballets. The cursory notes in the Pounds 10 souvenir books could be little aid to understanding for new-comers to this repertory, and I infer that the season seeks to bring in a fresh audience - whether for ballet or for the idea of 'spectacle' is less clear. The Golden Age suite comprised part of the ballet's second act, without much indication of why Rita was by turns slinky and lyrical; the Corsaire suite offered pirate dances, a first act duet, and part of the Jardin anime. The Romeo and Juliet suite took us from the ball-room, by way of the balcony pas de deux to the deaths of Mercutio and Tybalt and left us with Lady Capulet behaving like Mrs Vincent Crummles. Abbreviation or bowdlerisation? Yury Grigorovich has made every attempt to vary the direction of the dance-action  -the Bolshoy's artists race down the aisles between seats, as well as from the entrances provided by the stage, and manage to emote sideways - but sight-lines must inevitably be curious, and the theatrical logic of the performance uncertain. The rewards - and I suppose the management's justification - of these performances lie in the fact of the Bolshoy's power as a dance troupe. Certainly the ensemble looks strong, youthful, and audiences can say they have 'seen the Bolshoy'. Physically, yes. Artistically, I am less than certain after this first evening. The genius of the Bolshoy has ever lain in a double strength: in the impassioned energies of a style where academic distinction was not swamped by an exultant manner that enabled emotion to speak eloquently to us. They danced - and we believed in the drama, and the dance. But to know these qualities at their truest we need to see the troupe involved in whole ballets, in the theatrical surroundings for which they were intended, and focussed upon superb central interpretations. From Ulanova in Giselle and Vasiliev in Spartacus, to Bessmertnova and Mukhamedov in Golden Age, and the ensemble in Swan Lake, we have seen great dancers in major works of art. I do not think for an instant that those days are gone for the Bolshoy, but few of the interpretations I saw on Sunday night could triumph over the surroundings. The Golden Age principals looked coarse, unconvincing - though Alexey Popovchenko, as the villainous Yashka, is clearly an interesting artist. I hope that later performances will allow us to see something more from Nadezhda Gracheva (whom we first knew as a student with the Bolshoy Academy) than the blatant stylist - balancing inelegantly, legs at six o'clock - of Corsaire. She has beautiful qualities, and hectic bravura clouds them. The most touching interpretation came from Inna Petrova as a Juliet of child-like sweetness and delicate grace, and it was the street brawl of this Romeo suite, pouring over the thrust stage, that made the best choreographic sense of the evening. Among the character performances I salute Yury Vetrov as a wonderfully degenerate bourgeois in Golden Age, Gedeminas Taranda as a pistol-packing brigand in Corsaire, and Andrey Buravstev as a bounding Mercutio. About further programmes - and implications - I hope to report soon. The Bolshoy Ballet season continues at the Royal Albert Hall until February 14 Programming varies nightly</p>

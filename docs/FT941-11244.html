			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Clinton calls an end to US Vietnam myths: Why post-war confrontation has been allowed to persist President Clinton's decision to lift the US trade embargo against Vietnam - announced in the early hours of Friday morning, Vietnam time  - should mark the end of the long confrontation between Washington and Hanoi which has been so damaging to both sides. Vietnamese nationalists have often been baffled by American attitudes to their country. Ho Chi Minh, the father of Vietnamese communism whose embalmed body can still be seen in a mausoleum in Hanoi, so admired American ideals and American condemnations of colonialism that he called repeatedly on the US for help in his struggle against the French, particularly after the second world war. In declaring independence in Hanoi in 1945 for the brief period before the French colonisers returned in force, Ho echoed Jefferson in starting with the words: 'All men are created equal.' He sent numerous appeals for assistance by letter and telegram to the Truman administration. There was no reply. The Cold war was beginning, and eventually the US, in supporting the government of South Vietnam, replaced the French as the main enemy of Vietnamese communists in the north. Casualties were disproportionate - hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese dead compared about 60,000 Americans - but after the war the Vietnamese have been more willing to forgive the Americans than the Americans are to forgive them. (The communists reserved most of their bitterness for those of their fellow-Vietnamese who had sided with the South Vietnamese government; many were sent to re-education camps.) The fate of US soldiers missing in action (MiAs) in Vietnam continues to generate intense interest in the US and further afield, although fewer than 100 are still completely unaccounted for. An estimated 300,000 Vietnamese are also MiAs, but neither Hanoi nor Washington has ever expressed more than token concern for Vietnamese people widely assumed, like the Americans, to be dead. By the mid-1980s, while the US was still obsessed by the humiliation of its defeat and reluctant to forgive the Vietnamese communists for winning, Vietnam's rulers had other problems to deal with. They were trying to extricate their armed forces from neighbouring Cambodia (where they had overthrown the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge in 1979) and confronting a hostile China, while relying on a communist economy that was evidently a failure. From 1986, economic reform became the priority. Vietnam started to court the Americans because Washington was blocking aid from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Vietnamese co-operation in the hunt for US MiAs improved dramatically, and President Clinton lifted the veto on multilateral aid in July last year, a move which was in economic terms much more important than this week's ending of the unilateral and ineffective US trade embargo. For reasons of foreign policy, however, the Vietnamese will be delighted to see a stronger American presence in their country. Washington is regarded as a useful counterweight to China - a traditional enemy of much greater historical significance to Vietnam than the US (and closer besides). Most Vietnamese welcome the end of the embargo, although of course there are hardline Vietnamese communists who remain as suspicious of the Americans as hardline American MiA lobbyists remain of the Vietnamese. No single cause ended the embargo; there was pressure from US companies which wanted to take advantage of Vietnam's fast-growing economy, and there was the Vietnamese government's anxiety to please Washington by helping in the hunt for MiAs; there was also a feeling among some Vietnamese-Americans that the time for isolating Vietnam was over. Ms Tiana Thi Thanh Nga, a flamboyant Hollywood actress and karate expert, recently returned to Vietnam against the advice of her anti-communist relatives (her father and uncle were ministers in the South Vietnam government) and created an extraordinarily moving and amusing documentary which explores the tortured relationship between the US and Vietnam. 'Hollywood,' she said on a recent trip to south-east Asia, 'is perpetuating the myth of the Gook and the Rambo, and they all buy it.' Perhaps, after Mr Clinton's announcement, there will be fewer buyers than before.</p>

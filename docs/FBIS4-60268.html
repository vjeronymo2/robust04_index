			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arabic service of the BBC, which is subordinate  to the British intelligence MI6, broadcast what it called a live  coverage of confrontations which took place in Cairo between the  security forces and the lawyers' bar association. It also  broadcast hostile statements against the Egyptian Government.    JANA Arab affairs editor commented on this flagrant  intervention in Egypt's internal affairs and said: Through its  Arabic-speaking service, which is subordinate to the English  intelligence MI6, England continues the vilification campaign on  the Arab countries seizing any opportunity and exploiting any  internal incident to give vent to its anger and grudge on the  Arab regimes.    The editor expressed extreme astonishment at the Arab  governments' silence over this continued audacity exercised by  the English radio and other Western racist media which makes  daily subject-matter of the news, commentaries, and analyses  which harm the ruling Arab regimes.    It seems that the BBC is reassured of the non-existence of a  deterrent in the shadow of the Western governments'  encouragement and the silence of the Arab regimes, while the  situation changes completely when a news item is reported by  Arab mass media.    The editor concluded his comment by saying that the logic of  things would be that we, the Arabs, accept what is being issued  by us against one another as being an internal Arab affair, and  entirely refuse the West's intervention and allegations.</p>

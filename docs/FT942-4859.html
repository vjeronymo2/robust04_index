			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Jordan shuffles cabinet as peace talk hopes grow Jordan yesterday announced a cabinet reshuffle in expectation of a fresh phase of peace negotiations with Israel. Prime Minister Abdel Salam al-Majali is expected to keep his post but officials say new faces will be brought into other key positions to 'reinvigorate' the government and its efforts in the peace process. The change came amid optimism from the Jordanians that a breakthrough in its peace talks with Israel was imminent. On Monday, Jordan and Israel restarted direct talks in Washington on their peace agenda signed in September last year. Officials in Amman said they expected the two sides to agree to set up a joint committee to examine the countries' land dispute. The border between Jordan and Israel has never been formally recognised; both sides are said to see the need to settle territorial issues before moving to others such as water, economic co-operation and refugees. It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said this 'was doubtful'. The last cabinet reshuffle came after the kingdom held its first multi-party elections last November. Since then, the government and parliament have had frequent stand-offs. The cabinet has come in for criticism over its handling of talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation on future economic ties between Jordan and the West Bank. One former prime minister, Mr Ahmad Obediat, said the old cabinet lacked clear policies; he blamed its members for the uncertainty in the kingdom. The new cabinet, it is hoped, will be able to restore confidence in the peace talks.</p>

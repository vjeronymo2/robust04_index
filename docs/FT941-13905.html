			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: Carving a crafty niche For those who are tempted to think of wood-carving as a simple utilitarian skill, the touring Crafts Council exhibition will be an eye-opener. Like all real crafts, woodcarving has a rich and interesting past and, equally importantly, a vibrant present. The two are intimately connected and for those who are interested in the craft it is the exploration of the links between the present and the past that makes this exhibition so illuminating. The carving of wood for domestic use - whether it be a butterpat-maker in Somerset, a stirring spoon in Zimbabwe, a drinking vessel in Indonesia, an old printing-block in India - goes back thousands of years but what gives joy to the eye and a lift to the heart is the love and skill which carvers have brought to their craft. Here, too, is a chance to come across much grander work - pieces by such luminaries of the craft scene as Ernest Gimson, Sidney Barnsley, Eric Sharpe, George Jack - as well as what is probably, for scholars of the genre, the highlight of the exhibition, the panel by Grinling Gibbons, whose work in the late 17th century is generally agreed to mark the apogee of the craft. It is divided into sections, encompassing architectural applications, furniture and fine woodwork, the home (food and drink); the home (personal effects); recreation (outdoor life and music, games and toys); and trades, professional and crafts. And it gives a wide-ranging and comprehensive view of the craft, from the 17th century (Grinling Gibbons' panel) to the present day. We see carving that is ornate and almost over-blown (a mahogany candlestand of unknown provenance); we see it weird and witty (Howard Raybould's mirror, Fiona Clark's chameleon coathook, David Cox's International sound box); we see it streamlined and fastidious (John Makepeace's rhythm chair); we see it friendly and domestic (the kitchen and domestic utensils). Those who are devotees of Guy Taplin will be pleased to see one of his boldly carved ducks. If you favour a strong contemporary air you should look to the furniture and fine woodwork section and the work of David Cox, Howard Raybould, and Tim Stead. They give an invaluable view of the contemporary scene. Lindsay Anderson's oil-painting on lime-wood is a unique work, haunting, moving and inspirational. It shows just what modern woodworkers have to offer, whether in the public or private domain. Of course, as in any exhibition, some works are more to one's personal taste than others - this is exactly as it should be. This is a celebration of diversity. For me, as for many others, possibly the most moving pieces are not the grand panels and elaborate carvings, they are the small, homely pieces - a lovespoon, made by an unknown Welsh sailor, a snuff box made by a blind carver, David Lewis' potato masher, a biscuit print roller, and a gingerbread mould. My favourite work in the whole exhibition, the one I long to take home and keep, is a late 19th century malt shovel, lovingly carved and exquisite in its simplicity. This exhibition is a timely reminder that simply because things have a utilitarian role to play in life there is no reason for them not to be beautiful - rather the reverse is true. Because they are the essential elements of everyday life, it matters even more that they have an inherent aesthetic appeal. The spoon that we use every day, the door we open all the time, the hook we hang our coat on, the box we keep our trinkets in - that these should be beautiful or witty, charming or dramatic matters. Not for these carvers the simplest and easiest means to an end. The chance to celebrate their craft has been seized and taken to the greater enrichment of us all. The Woodcarvers Craft is on the move and opens at the Usher Gallery, Lindum Road, Lincoln LN1 1NN on January 30 (until April 5) and after that will go on to Bradford in West Yorkshire, Glasgow and, finally, Hove in East Sussex.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chief legal strategist at Prudential Securities quits Mr Loren Schechter, chief legal strategist at Prudential Securities, has resigned from the post and as a director of the firm amid a widening government investigation into a 1980s scandal involving the sale by Prudential of high-risk real estate and energy investments. Mr Schechter, who will remain an employee of the company, with the title of executive vice-president, had been Prudential's general counsel since 1982. An internal Prudential memo said Mr Schechter was stepping down at his own request because of 'unfortunate and unfair publicity and innuendo' in press reports about the scandal. Last October Prudential paid Dollars 371m to settle charges of 'massive misconduct' made by state and federal regulatory bodies over its sale of so-called limited partnerships - pooled investments - which were often portrayed as low risk ventures when they were the very opposite. Federal prosecutors are now investigating the scandal. The US attorney's office in Manhattan is understood to be investigating the role of Prudential's legal department in vetting sales documents used in connection with the partnerships. However, Mr Harwick Simmons, chief executive of the firm, said in the internal memo: 'I strongly believe Loren has acted honourably in all his dealings with the limited-partnership issue, and that the US attorney's office will take no action once all the facts become clear.' Prudential is expected to look for a new chief counsel from outside the firm.</p>

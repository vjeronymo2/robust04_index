			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece must show mature approach on Turkey Sir, Greece's crocodile tears about Turkey's membership application to the European Union again being deferred cannot be taken seriously. Mr Papadopoulos (Letters, December 28) forgets to mention that the reason for Turkey invading Cyprus was to protect Turkish Cypriots in the event of a Greek-sponsored terrorist campaign for Enosis (uniting Cyprus and Greece, or rather making Cyprus a part of Greece) succeeding. The Turks well remember how the Greeks treated the Turkish population on the many little Turkish islands in the Mediterranean that were ceded to Greece between the wars. It was with the very understandable objective of protecting their kith and kin on Cyprus from being similarly thrown out of their homes that the Turkish army invaded, scuppering Greece's hopes of Enosis at the same time. It is time to let bygones be bygones and for Greece to behave like a mature member of the EU. It should work to help Turkey come closer to the EU as its political leaders wish. If Turkey is not kept in the European camp, it may well flip over and become a fundamentalist Islamic state (like Iran&gt;, which would present far more problems and dangers to the European Union - and in particular to its neighbour, Greece.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by defense affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>   [Text] Several states which have defense ties with Israel  have asked to "lower the profile" of these relations after the  Cave of the Patriarchs' massacre, for both diplomatic and  internal political reasons, a senior military source said  yesterday.    This led to a slow down in contacts to complete deals for  Israeli military hardware and to second thoughts by  representatives of foreign governments about going ahead with  visits to Israel.    French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who completed a  visit to Israel 10 days ago, dispatched a special envoy to  Israel several days prior to his arrival to study the situation  in the wake of the Hebron massacre.    Sources close to the French Defense Ministry reported that  the French Government -- which maintains close political and  defense ties with the Arab states -- found itself in an  uncomfortable position due to the timing of the visit so soon  after the massacre.    The political situation following the massacre also  influences ties with Muslim Turkey, which recently enhanced its  defense ties with Israel. Following President 'Ezer Weizman's  visit to Turkey in January, Israeli military firms are  participating in tenders to refurbish Phantom and F-15 aircraft  for the Turkish Air Force.    Since the visit, which helped to formalize the defense ties  between the two countries, the contacts have continued at  various working levels but no large deals have yet been  finalized. The Turks nevertheless agreed to Israel deploying a  military attache at its embassy in Turkey and he will arrive  there in several weeks. Defense sources, however, believe the  move is inadvisable. Turkey is on the eve of municipal  elections, which will indicate the strength of the ruling  parties. According to public opinion polls, the present  government will not gain significant support in these elections.  If that is the case, this government might be forced to resign  and be replaced by a new government with which Israel will have  to start new negotiations.    Germany is another country which recently asked to moderate  its overt defense ties with Israel for political and diplomatic  reasons.    The Germans recently cut their defense budget significantly  in the wake of the union with the East and diverted financial  resources for internal needs, a move which harmed military  purchases from Israel, mainly of ammunition from the Israel  Military Industries.    According to evaluations by defense sources, Germany will  complete its reunification process next year when its internal  situation will start to improve. If that happens, the sources  believe, new procurement budgets will be presented and an  improvement in trade ties with Israel will be felt.</p>

Performance-Based Definition of Renewable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its proposal, EPA solicited comments on the proposed definition of renewable oxygenates and, in particular, on the potential for establishing a performance requirement based on energy consumption and/or greenhouse gas emissions to define renewable oxygenates. After further consideration and evaluation of the comments received, EPA has decided not to promulgate a numerical type of performance-based standard for renewable oxygenates for a number of reasons. First, the degree of scientific uncertainty associated with quantifying energy consumption and emissions of different greenhouse gases throughout the entire life cycle of various oxygenates is considerable. Second, even if life cycle emissions could be estimated, based on comments on the proposal and discussions with EPA's Global Change Division there is currently insufficient scientific consensus on the relative warming potential of various greenhouse gases, notably VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (the bulk of the emissions other than CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), to provide reliable comparisons. Third, EPA has concluded that at the present time it would be difficult and costly to collect and verify the necessary data to implement a performance-based standard for renewable oxygenates, to the point where the recordkeeping and reporting burden could discourage new, more efficient feedstock and oxygenate production practices. Fourth, EPA believes that the definition of renewable oxygenates contained in this rule is sufficient to provide certainty that fossil energy savings are being achieved without the establishment of a numerical performance standard. As discussed below in section III.C.4, the group of oxygenates derived from renewable sources are expected to achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission performance levels roughly equivalent to or better than those achieved by ethanol alone. For these reasons, EPA does not believe it to be appropriate at the present time to institute a performance standard for renewable oxygenates. However, the Agency reserves the right to alter its definition of ``renewable'' to a performance-based standard in the future if a reasonable, workable, and enforceable definition can be developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Renewable Alcohols/Ethers Limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the December NPRM, the only oxygenates included in the proposed definition of renewable oxygenates were ethanol and methanol produced from renewable feedstocks and their ether derivatives. However, EPA recognizes that for a number of reasons the production of other oxygenates from renewable feedstocks is likely to produce fossil energy savings similar to that for renewable methanol and ethanol. First, many of these other oxygenates may at times be produced as co-products or by-products of methanol or ethanol production. As a result, they should have similar fossil energy balances. In fact, if by including them in today's definition they are not forced to be separated out from the ethanol and/or methanol to make them pure, it could help reduce energy expenditures. Second, even if not co-products, they are likely to be produced from similar feedstocks using similar production practices as those currently used for renewable ethanol and methanol. As a result, the energy balance should not be significantly different. In fact, the energy balance could very well be better, since the energy balance of either the oxygenate production itself, or that associated with blending it into RFG, may be the reason prompting the production of the other oxygenates in lieu of ethanol or methanol. Third, in order for these other oxygenates to compete in the marketplace with renewable ethanol or methanol they will need to be cost competitive. Since the energy inputs represent a significant portion of the costs of renewable oxygenate production, these other oxygenates are unlikely to be produced (unless they are co-products as discussed above) unless they are at least as energy efficient as the alternatives. Furthermore, if they are able to compete, the oxygenate they are likely to displace from the marketplace will be the marginal renewable oxygenate production which is the most costly and inefficient to produce and therefore provides the least energy savings to begin with. Fourth, while EPA does not expect these oxygenates to represent a large portion of the renewable oxygenate market, their exclusion from the definition might hinder their entry into the market and hinder the development of new, energy efficient renewable oxygenate production technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, EPA is including other oxygenates produced from renewable feedstocks in its definition of permitted renewable oxygenates under today's rule. As discussed above, however, such oxygenates cannot be blended during the high ozone season unless either they are converted to an ether form, or it can be demonstrated that they do not cause a volatility increase when commingled with other gasoline blends.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although several commenters supported the petition process which EPA proposed as an optional means to respond to future developments in oxygenate technology, the Agency is limiting this petition process to determining whether the renewable oxygenate exhibits commingling effects which are relevant to their use under this program during the summer months. As discussed above, EPA is extending the definition of renewable oxygenate based on its determination that all oxygenates derived from renewable sources and expected to be used to comply with this program should exhibit energy benefits similar to those resulting from ethanol use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Averaging and Trading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is promulgating averaging and trading provisions, as proposed, for the oxygenates in reformulated gasoline receiving renewable credit under today's program. Refiners are allowed to average the renewable oxygen content of reformulated gasoline over the calendar year. During the first year, however, the averaging period will run for 13 months, from December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995, to track the time period for the other RFG requirements. Refiners are also allowed to trade credits earned by exceeding the renewable oxygenate requirement to other refiners. No banking of credits from one year to the next, however, is allowed, in order to keep the program as simple as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Averaging and trading provide refiners many benefits. For example, averaging provides refiners with production flexibility, since every gallon need not meet the renewable oxygenate requirement. Trading provides additional flexibility by permitting refiners to specialize: it may be more cost-effective for some refiners than others to produce reformulated gasoline with a renewable oxygenate content. Trading enables those refiners for whom it is less cost-effective to buy renewable credits from those who find it more cost-effective to blend renewable oxygenates. Averaging and trading also allow refiners to avoid any cost associated with compliance margins, since refiners will not need to blend renewable oxygenates in excess of the 30 percent requirement to assure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These provisions are especially important during the initial startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate program takes effect for refiners beginning December 1, 1994, individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable oxygenate into their gasoline until later in the year, or at all if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate that they met the requirements over the course of the entire year through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable oxygenates in the latter part of the year, or the purchase of credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging and trading provisions effectively provide refiners with additional time to meet the initial requirements of the program, and allows them to smoothly ramp up their use of renewable oxygenates during the course of the first year to the full 30% requirement in the second year (1996). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

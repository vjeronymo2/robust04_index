			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Bad weather is blamed as retail sales decline for second month BRITISH retail sales posted a small decline in May for the second month in a row but government statisticians and retail sector representatives said the fall reflected bad weather rather than economic weakness. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that seasonally adjusted retail sales fell by an estimated 0.2 per cent in volume terms in May after a 0.2 per cent fall in April. Sales volumes in May were 2.3 per cent higher than in May last year - the smallest year-on-year increase since December. The CSO said last month's decline in sales reflected a sharp 5.9 per cent drop in clothing and footwear sales as miserable weather conditions dissuaded consumers from buying summer outfits. According to the British Retail Consortium, which claims to represent more than 90 per cent of retail outlets, turnover of do-it-yourself stores was also depressed because the late May bank holiday was the last day of the month and its sales will be counted towards the June total. But other CSO figures pointed to a slowdown in the growth of retail sales since the first quarter. Taking three-month figures, which the CSO says give a better guide to underlying trends, re-tail sales rose 0.8 per cent in the March-to-May period compared with the previous three months and were 3 per cent higher than in the same period of 1992. By contrast, sales in the first quarter were up 1.6 per cent on the final quarter of last year and 3.3 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1992. The retail consortium said cool weather helped sales of electrical and electronic goods after with a depressed May last year. White goods sales were healthy, while business-related products were 'a star performing area'. The consortium reported higher sales of food and drink, furniture, carpets and healthcare products in May, while sales made by London stores to tourists were 'buoyant'. It said clothing and footwear sales had recovered 'to encouraging levels' this month in line with better weather. Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, the UK investment bank, said stronger growth of banknotes and coins in circulation so far this month also pointed to a revival of retail sales in June. The note and coin figures grew only slowly in May and have proved to be a good coincident indicator of consumer demand in the economy since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September. The Treasury was untroubled by the slight dip in May retail sales. 'If consumer spending is holding up, without going mad, while manufacturing output and exports grow, it means we have the sort of recovery that we want,' a spokesman said. PSBR soars, Page 6</p>

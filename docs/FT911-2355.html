			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Philips to take over east German lamp maker PHILIPS of the Netherlands, the world's biggest lighting manufacturer, is to take over Narva Lamp Factory, a maker of vehicle and other types of speciality lamps in eastern Germany. The Dutch company declined to say how much it will pay for the company but it said that it would be making substantial investments in modernising the factory over the next few years. Narva Lamp, located in Plauen, has annual sales DM40m (Dollars 22.6m). The company exports a large part of its output to other parts of Europe, where they tend to be sold in shops which cater for the lower end of the price range. Philips will retain the Narva name for the factory's international shipments. Under an agreement reached between Philips and Germany's Treuhand, the agency handling the privatisation of eastern German industry, Narva's workforce will number 500 when Philips assumes formal control on May 1. A year ago, Narva employed as many as 1,300 but the workforce has been reduced sharply as the company was prepared for privatisation, a Philips spokesman said. Last month Philips reached agreement on acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Polam-Pila, a Polish lighting maker with annual sales of Dollars 50m and substantial exports to west-ern markets, including the US.</p>

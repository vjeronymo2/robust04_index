			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible Palestinian source within Fatah has  told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that he doubts that all of the  resistance operations that have been carried out against the  Israelis in the occupied territories are the making of Hamas, as  Israel declares.    The source said Fatah fighters are still practicing  resistance to pressure the Israelis and are carrying out  military operations. The source said that the person who carried  out the 'Afula operation was from Fatah [see 13 April Terrorism  Report].    Last week, the chief of the Israeli police said that the  Palestinian youth who carried out an operation in Jerusalem was  a Hamas member, but it turned out later that he was a Fatah  supporter who wanted to avenge the death of a friend killed by  the Israelis a few days before near Jerusalem.</p>

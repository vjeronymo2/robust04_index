			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- The Romanian press  of the past days comments on the results of an opinion poll  ordered by the government conducted by the Romanian Institute of  Public Opinion Polling (IRSOP) in April 1994, and the results of  which, however, being unfavorable for the government, are being  kept strictly confidential.    According to the poll -- which carries the title National  Study Regarding Public Perception of Current Social Issues, the  Government's Eligibility for the People's Favors, and the  Popularity of Parties and Their Top Politicians -- two thirds of  the Romanians are not satisfied with President Ion Iliescu's  performance and view him as not eligible for another mandate in  office. More than 27 percent are stating in favor of Ion  Iliescu, considering him still eligible for the presidential  office.    Eight out of ten Romanians are reproaching the president  with  not doing anything or doing too little to eliminate corruption  (83 percent) and for agriculture (81 percent.) Two thirds are  of the opinion that he does not encourage enough the market  economy (67 percent) and is bringing a far too tiny contribution  to the speeding up of privatization. Such opinions are,  however, revealing that one part of the population has a wrong  perception regarding the responsibilities of the presidential  office.    Eight out of ten Romanians have a negative view on the  government (79 percent). The negative views seem to be grounded  more on the given impression of the government's lack of  interest for the population, than on the lack of abilities in  the performance of the executive. Only one out of four  Romanians (23 percent) is accusing the government of lack of  competence. With a smaller percentage, namely two out of ten  Romanians (21 percent) are ready to praise the government and to  find excuses for its failures, invoking an intervention by  several forces sabotaging their good intentions.    The population's confidence in the political parties is  pictured as follows: The ruling Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR] -- 21 percent; the National Peasant  Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] (opposition) -- 17 percent;  the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR] (backer of the  government until recently) -- 8 percent; the Civic Alliance  Party [PAC] (opposition) - 8 percent; the Democratic Party [PD]  (opposition) -- 6 percent; the National Romanian Unity Party  [PUNR] (government backer) -- 6 percent; the Romanian Ecologist  Party [PER] -- 6 percent; the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] -- 5  percent; the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] --  5 percent (all opposition forces); the Socialist Party of Labor  [PSM] -- 4 percent; the Greater Romania Party [PRM] -- 4 percent  (both government backers); and the Romanian Social-Democratic  Party [PSDR] -- 1 percent (opposition.)    The circumstances under which the poll was leaked to the  press are still unknown, because its orderer, the Government's  General Secretariat, did not make an official release of the  document, while the executive has neither denied nor confirmed  speculations of the press.</p>

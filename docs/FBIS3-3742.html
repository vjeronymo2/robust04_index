			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon [21 March], Wang Bingqian, vice  chairman of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing  Committee, joined a group discussion by our province's NPC  delegation. He pointed out: It is necessary to give full play  to the role of people's congresses so that their work will  become more active.    After listening to the speeches of Deputies Yan Haiwang, Lu  Kejian, Xu Feiqing, (Ni Anmin), (Chen Xiuguo), and (Jin  Guosheng), Wang Bingqian said: The people's congress is an  organization of the people's power. Our power is granted by the  people, and we shoulder an important historical mission. Party  committees must lead and support the work of people's  congresses. Within the jurisdiction conferred upon them by law,  people's congresses must exercise their power boldly, and must  carry out legislation and supervision work in an effective  manner. The prestige of people's congresses must be established  through their own work.    Wang Bingqian stressed: People's congresses must give full  play to the role of people's deputies, conduct investigations  and studies well, promptly reflect the opinions and aspirations  of the masses, and solve popular and difficult problems to which  the masses are paying close attention. In the meantime, it is  necessary to strengthen education on the legal system, as well  as the propaganda work of people's congresses themselves, so  that people understand and support this work.</p>

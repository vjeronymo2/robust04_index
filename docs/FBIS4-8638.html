			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan </F> Karadzic with unidentified correspondents in Belgrade on 14  April -- recorded]    [Text] Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic this afternoon  held talks with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic. Slobodan Milosevic is expected to hold talks with Lord  Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the Geneva  conference, this evening. In the meantime, President Karadzic  held a news conference [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] What did you talk about with Mr. Milosevic?    [Karadzic] We discussed the newly created situation, the  crisis, and so forth, and, of course, our usual issues.    [Correspondent] Are there any signs of progress  (?concerning) this proposal.    [Karadzic] We will see. It appears that the international  community is currently most aggravated with us breaking off  relations with the UN. We will see whether our supreme command  will change something in this respect tomorrow.    [Correspondent] Lord Owen stated that you have accepted in  principle to meet Mr. Akashi, which means the civil sector, in  order to maintain contacts.    [Karadzic] Not to maintain contacts. We agreed to meet Mr.  Akashi tomorrow and to tell him what the stand of our supreme  command is. Whether there will be any contacts with the civil  sector will depend on the stand of the supreme command.    [Correspondent] In view of agency reports on the situation  around Tuzla and Doboj, can you tell us briefly what is  happening there.    [Karadzic] First of all, I will tell you what is happening  around Gorazde. The first nice day that facilitated the flights  of NATO U.S. planes was used by the Muslim forces to try to  drive us from the right bank of the Drina. They launched an  offensive. They set off in large numbers at our positions and  our forces from the left bank, over the bridges, probably  expecting to receive the support of U.S. aircraft.    Regarding Doboj, the town is constantly being shelled and we  are having civilian casualties all the time. Fortunately, most  of the casualties are wounded and not dead. Finally, we have an  offensive on almost all the fronts, near Kupres, Srbobran, that  is formerly Gornji Vakuf [name as heard: Donji Vakuf is what  the Serbs call Srbobran], and Teslic. The fiercest offensive is  between Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo all the way to  Ilijas. In other words, this is an all-out offensive.    They pulled out about 20,000 troops from Sarajevo because  there is peace in Sarajevo now. They were obliged to keep these  troops in Sarajevo, but they pulled them out and deployed them  on other fronts.    Regarding Tuzla, transport planes have been landing there  for  days and they are bringing military materiel. We warned them.  The airport is not open. It will be open only in accordance  with our agreement with President Yeltsin and his special envoy  Churkin, and finally with Mr. Kozyrev. Before that, the airport  must not be misused for military purposes. It must not be  misused after the opening either. It should be opened for  humanitarian purposes only.    Two transport planes were preparing to land today. We warned  them not to land. We thought it better to warn them than to  shoot them down.    [Correspondent] Mr. Karadzic, just one more question. Mr.  Churkin today stated that he had conveyed to you some proposals  regarding the global settlement of the crisis and that he  expected an answer from you. Can you tell us something about  that.    [Karadzic] There are some proposals, there are some  proposals that could even lead to total peace. Not immediately,  of course, to the political solution, but total peace could  perhaps facilitate a speedy political solution. We will examine  these proposals and see what can....    [Correspondent] Are the cease-fire and the end to  hostilities possible at all on the entire territory of the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not, as you said, only in some  parts? Is this possible?    [Karadzic] A partial cease-fire is impossible. The  cease-fire on the entire territory would be desirable and  possible. It cannot be done partially, because if they attack  us in Olovo we will attack all their other positions. In other  words, we have the right to defend ourselves and to launch  counteroffensives on all points.    Regarding the halting of hostilities, we take the view that  we should reach an agreement on that. Of course, one must  understand that the sanctions on Yugoslavia are an act of  aggression and that if the hostilities are to be halted, then  the sanctions should also be lifted.</p>

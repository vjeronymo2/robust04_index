			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants have consented to the following conditions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A majority of the Board of Trustees of the Trust (``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested persons,'' as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and Rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that, if this condition is not met by reason of death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (i) For a period of 45 days, if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (ii) for a period of 60 days, if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (iii) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Board will monitor the Trust for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the contractowners of all separate accounts investing in the Trust. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons, including: (a) State insurance regulatory authority action; (b) a change in applicable federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action or interpretive letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of the Trust are being managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity and variable life insurance contractowners; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard contractowner voting instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Participating Insurance Companies and Forum will report any potential or existing conflicts, of which they become aware, to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and Forum will be obligated to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for it to consider any issues raised. This responsibility includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each Participating Insurance Company to inform the Board whenever contractowner voting instructions are disregarded. These responsibilities will be contractual obligations of all Participating Insurance Companies investing in the Trust under their agreements governing participation therein, and such agreements shall provide that such responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contractowners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If a majority of the Board, or a majority of the disinterested members of the Board, determine that a material irreconcilable conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable (as determinated by a majority of disinterested members of the Board), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material conflict, up to and including: (a) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the Trust or any Fund therein and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium (including another Fund, if any, of the Trust), or submitting the question whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contractowners and, as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> annuity contractowners, life insurance contractowners, or variable contractowners of one or more Participating Insurance Companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contractowners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a Participating Insurance company's decision to disregard contractowner voting instructions, and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the Trust, to withdraw its separate account's investment therein, and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of an irreconcilable material conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under their agreements governing participation in the Trust and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contractowners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

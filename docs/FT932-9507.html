			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Slight reversal at Jessups Profits of Jessups, the Romford-based car dealer, sliped from Pounds 189,000 to Pounds 160,000 pre-tax for the six months ended February 28. Turnover improved from Pounds 38.3m to Pounds 40.4m. The directors said trading conditions in the opening months of the period were particularly severe, aggravated by an unprecedented fall in used car values. Losses per share widened to 0.96p (0.24p) but in view of the improved outlook the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p. The shares declined 6p to 92p.</p>

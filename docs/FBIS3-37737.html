He was twice at the center of public attention.  The newspaper recently published his program for the Russian  Government. Next week this well-known economist is flying to  the Crimea. He has been invited there by Yuriy Meshkov, the  leader of the government, who was recently elected president of  the Republic of the Crimea.    The temperature on the peninsula is above zero. Local  residents are already concerned about the approaching sowing  work and in addition, of course, at the rising unemployment, the  stoppage of enterprises, the rising cost of living, and the low  wages. Generally speaking, then, it is like everywhere else.  Will the political temperature change after the Russian  Government team's arrival in the Crimea?    "It is hard to say," candidly admitted the 47-year old  Saburov, who has spent almost all his life since graduation from  the Moscow State University-Mechanical-Mathematical Department  devoting himself to sectoral economics. "I am going there as an  economist but there is work for a politician down there, too."    "Will Saburov take all his ministers with him from Moscow?"    "No, no way," he himself answered as he opened the door. "It  will be necessary to form a balanced cabinet on the spot and we  will have to include local representatives. Anyway, in  principle I have not actually been appointed. At the moment,  Yuriy Meshkov has only invited me to fill this post and I have  agreed. Now it is necessary to study the law most carefully --  and see how it is to be done..."    [Pavlova] Within Leonid Kravchuk's entourage the opinion has  already been expressed that according to the law there cannot be  a premier in the Crimea, is that not so?    [Saburov] I think that this is the initial reaction, that is  all. There has been some misunderstanding here -- we will  investigate it together.    In Saburov's opinion, he is aware of how complex the status  of the Crimea is and how difficult relations there could be in  the future. But he is convinced that pro-Ukrainian people will  not present serious opposition to his "duet" with Yuriy Meshkov.  Even die-hard nationalists are still looking out for the  well-being of their nation. If the government team sets itself  the task of raising the living standard of the Crimean people  and if the specialists who have been invited in do not merely  state this but actually get down to tackling the urgent  questions here, things could improve.    What are the priorities in the Crimea? My interlocutor, a  candidate of economic sciences, believes that one of the  paramount and main problems is the establishment of market  relations there.    [Pavlova] In your opinion, are the reforms in the republic  going extremely sluggishly?    [Saburov] They have almost ground to a halt. This is where  that half-forgotten word, acceleration, is needed -- not in the  formal sense of the word, of course. My task is to ensure that  all citizens have the opportunity to work, to ensure that those  employed in the state's service get their pay on time, that  everyone has water and electricity, and that public transport  works properly. This is the policy, but it is a national  economic policy. Sorting it out will not be all that easy.    [Pavlova] Do you consider the problem of the [Black Sea]  fleet an economic policy? After all, one way or another it will  have to be dealt with?    [Saburov] Without fail. My task is to ensure that the Black  Sea Fleet gets prompt finance and, to put it crudely, that the  officers and seamen do not starve. And to ensure that, come  what may, the fleet does not become a seething cauldron of  passions. [Saburov ends]    It was difficult not to ask Saburov about the fleet. And the  conversation on that theme was, to put it bluntly, not a brief  one. But his main idea was this: To take all measures  necessary to ease the social tension in the fleet. Furthermore,  he said the same thing about the residents of settlements and  cities. The measures needed there are somewhat different -- a  reliance on small- and medium-scale business, which will give  the Crimean people both knowledge of the market and income and  correspondingly will generate income for the Crimean exchequer  which, in Saburov's opinion, is almost empty.    Will all this not be empty assurances and mere words?  Definitely not, he believes, recently our people have been  working more and more on the budget or on programs or else they  have been selling off every last thing that they have... But  for an economist (in power) to openly declare that his main task  is the well-being of the people and not simply to declare it but  to make every effort to achieve it -- such a thing, in Saburov's  opinion, has not happened in a long time.    The serious economic work which will begin after a detailed  study of the situation on the spot will be highly specific,  Saburov believes. Here in the capital he is already making  promises but immediately seems to restrain himself. "Judge by  my actions. The Crimea will be open to all -- that is the first  and the main thing, you will see that for yourself..."    [Pavlova] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, does the annexation  [prisoyedineniye] of the Crimea to Russia feature in your plans?    [Saburov] This is unreal. After all, you know that it has a  special status. Furthermore, I do not intend getting into a  conflict with the motherland or aggravating the Ukrainian  question. Breaking off ties is a bad thing to do, they must  only be strengthened!"    My last question to Saburov was this: What will one of his  first economic steps be? The answer was quite unexpected but, I  think you will agree, interesting -- to create the conditions  for the activity of banks in the Crimea.</p>

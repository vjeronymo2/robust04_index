			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> About 200 angry veterans, their friends and families, some choking back tears,  marched on the Art Institute in Chicago, demanding an end to a student exhibit  that allows the American flag to be walked upon. "We are absolutely outraged at  the insensitivity of the Art Institute," Tom Stack, a Vietnam veteran, told  flag- and sign-waving protesters from the steps of the institute. In  subfreezing, windy weather, Stack told the crowd, including several veterans in  wheelchairs, that the issue is respect for the nation's symbol, not freedom of  expression. The exhibit features the flag spread on the floor beneath  photographs of flags, including some draped over coffins, and a shelf which  holds a ledger. Visitors may use the ledger to record their comments.  </P></p>

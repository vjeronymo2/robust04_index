			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Heineken to buy Swiss brewer stake Heineken, the Dutch brewery group, is to buy a 52.3 per cent stake in Brauerei Haldengut of Switzerland which controls the second-largest Swiss brewer, Calanda Haldengut. The stake will be acquired from the Schollhorn family and from Winterthur, the Swiss insurer. Heineken declined to say how much it would pay for the shares. Brauerei Haldengut's market capitalisation is SFr72.3m (Dollars 49.9m). The remaining 47.7 per cent of Brauerei Haldengut is listed on the Zurich stock exchange. The Dutch brewery said it was still discussing the possibility that Calanda would brew Heineken beer in Switzerland. Heineken has exported its flagship Heineken brand to Switzerland since 1980. Calanda, in which Heineken already owns a 10 per cent stake, distributes Heineken beer in the south and east of Switzerland. Calanda, with annual turnover of around SFr245m, has 12.5 per cent of the Swiss beer market. Its two breweries in Chur and Winterthur have total production capacity of 600,000 hectolitres of beer per year. The company is also involved in soft drinks and mineral water. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 1994.</p>

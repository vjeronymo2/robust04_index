			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCE BLOCKS PARRETTI BID FOR PATHE CINEMA  </P> <P> The French government blocked an attempt by Italian investor Giancarlo Parretti  to take full control of France's Pathe Cinema, citing the bid as a threat to  "public order."  </P> <P> Separately, Beverly Hills-based Pathe Communications Corp., of which Parretti  is president, extended its $1.2-billion tender offer for MGM/UA Communications  Co. until June 22.  </P> <P> The extension came as Pathe and MGM/UA officers discussed the possibility of a  much longer delay if Pathe fails to work out details of an agreement with Time  Warner Inc., its major backer, an individual familiar with the talks said.  </P> <P> The tender offer, which had been extended before, was set to expire Friday. But  Pathe has until June 23 to complete its offer under an agreement with MGM/UA's  majority shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian.  </P> <P> A Pathe spokesman said only that the offer's closing was delayed because of the  complexity of Pathe's financial arrangements, which have not yet been  completed. They involve a patchwork of short-term bank loans and advances, and  $650 million from Time Warner in exchange for the right to distribute MGM,  United Artists and Pathe films for 20 years.  </P> <P> As of late Friday, Parretti was still in talks with Time Warner executives and  was separately discussing a contingency plan under which he might extend his  offer for as long as three months while seeking a new backer if the  negotiations with Time Warner fail, individuals close to the discussions said.  </P> <P> "A proposal (to extend for three months) has been made. I'm not sure if Kirk  has accepted it," one of the individuals said.  </P> <P> One unresolved point has been Pathe's ability to finance new pictures once it  completes the acquisition. According to a filing with the Securities and  Exchange Commission earlier this week, Pathe has proposed to provide $125  million in production financing, rather than the $200 million required by its  Warner agreement.  </P> <P> The action by France's Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, followed an intense  public debate in that country over Parretti's bid to pay about $167 million for  the 52% of Pathe Cinema that it doesn't already own.  </P> <P> Pathe Cinema is a major French movie and TV producer with a 400-film library  and a chain of about 150 theaters.  </P> <P> French officials had previously raised, and then dropped, a claim that  Parretti's purchase should be blocked because much of the funding came from a  company owned by Pathe Chairman Florio Fiorini. The French had initially  objected because Fiorini's company is based in Switzerland, which isn't a  member of the European Community.  </P> <P> In explaining the government's latest move, a Finance Ministry spokeswoman said  "rumors" about people involved with the deal were sufficiently serious to  justify postponing it, according to a report by Reuters. The spokeswoman didn't  elaborate, Reuters said.  </P> <P> A threat to public order is one of the few grounds on which French officials  are permitted to block a bid from within the EC.  </P> <P> A Pathe spokesman in Paris, Salvatore Picciotto, was quoted by Reuters as  maintaining that "what Beregovoy has done is only postpone a decision. It is  not a veto. It just means he is saying, 'I will not give my ruling today.' That  is all."  </P> <P> Pathe's representative in Los Angeles, Craig Parsons, said he didn't expect the  European controversy to hamper Pathe's bid for MGM/UA.  </P></p>

Timerov, Moscow Electronic </F> Engineering Institute; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] The inadequacy of the semi-empirical simplified  models used to describe the resist relief evolution for  simulating submicrometer lithography due to the assumption that  the local polymer resist dissolution rate depends only on the  mean value of the polymer's molecular mass prompted a new look  at the process of selective polymer dissolution. In so doing,  resist development is considered as a selective polymer  dissolution process, and the diffusion origin of the selective  polymer dissolution process, mass transfer in the  polymer-gel-liquid solution system with selective dissolution,  and nonselective dissolution are examined in detail. The  concentration distribution evolution of monodisperse polystyrene  in methylethylketone in a film, the development profiles of  polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in methylisobutylketone (MBIK) and  of polystyrene in methylethylketone, and the dependence of the  critical groove size in the swelling polystyrene  (PST)-methylethylketone (MEK) system on the initial  polydispersity degree are plotted; the above description of  selective polymer dissolution as an evolution of the spatial  molecular and mass distribution (allowing for the dependence of  the transport properties of the macromolecules on their size)  makes it possible to simulate the process of slightly  (PMMA-MIBK) and highly (PST-MEK) swelling polymer resist  composition development and shows that the proposed model is  suitable for describing the development process with the  fullness required by submicrometer lithography. The findings  demonstrate that by properly selecting the molecular and mass  distribution of the polymer base, one can increase the resist  composition resolution.

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Schools award Pounds 6.7m projects GARDINER &amp; THEOBALD has started work on two schools projects with a combined value of Pounds 6.75m. Work involves the refurbishment and extension of University College School in Hampstead on behalf of the school development committee. Gardiner &amp; Theobald Management Services is acting as project manager and Gardiner &amp; Theobald is providing cost management advice. The school is a listed building and the project is being constructed in two phases. Phase one involves lowering the level of the playground to create windows for the new classrooms at basement level. A changing block and sports hall will also be built. Phase two provides additional classrooms, a library and a music centre. Phase two is due to begin at Christmas. Gardiner &amp; Theobald has also been appointed by Haberdashers Aske's Girls School in Elstree, Hertfordshire to build a new Pounds 750,000 music and art centre. Gary Griffiths, partner at Gardiner &amp; Theobald said: 'The development of the design to this point involved the detailed participation of the heads of department. The demands of the national curriculum call for additional space and as the design shows students will soon be able to study in an atmosphere even more suitable for excellence.' Construction work on the project is due to start in spring next year.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW AGE MAGAZINE ATTAINS FISCAL HEALTH;  </P> <P> PUBLISHING: ORANGE COUNTY RESOURCES FINDS A NICHE BY BLENDING SPIRITUALISM AND  MONEYMAKING.  </P> <P> It took nerve for Brian Enright to bring his crystals-cherishing,  bliss-following New Age magazine to Orange County, an area usually regarded as  more hospitable to John Wayne than Shirley MacLaine.  </P> <P> The only magazine of its kind in the county, Orange County Resources has  sometimes faced an uphill battle, dealing with a fragmented community of New  Age advocates and conservative Christians who have urged distributors to ban  the magazine.  </P> <P> Despite such problems, the 7-year-old magazine has grown from a 16-page  calendar of events to 68 pages packed with advertisements in its latest issue.  Distributed free to county retail outlets, it claims a circulation of 40,000.  </P> <P> Enright, the magazine's 45-year-old founder, has successfully exploited an  increasingly popular twist to the New Age movement: the marriage of  spiritualism and moneymaking.  </P> <P> "It seems like the New Age really has been co-opted by materialism in Southern  California much more than other places," said Glenn Bradley, who ran a sister  publication in Los Angeles for seven years.  </P> <P> Some recent advertisements in the magazine read: "Have a $$ Million Dollar$$  Retirement Program" and "Drive a Mercedes and Be Independently Wealthy in 90  Days."  </P> <P> "We joke that all of our readers are hippies who drive vans, but it's not  true," said Enright, an easygoing man who was wearing an aqua-color corduroy  shirt during a recent interview at his second-floor office in a Huntington  Beach strip mall.  </P> <P> "The traditional concept of people involved in healing, growth and  transformation used to say that people who pursued financial prosperity were  selling out. But a lot of people have learned that they can take ideas of  integrity and incorporate them into the workplace; for instance, what we're  doing here. We're producing this publication, and we still eat."  </P> <P> Enright said the most recent issue of Orange County Resources grossed $65,000  in sales and turned a $5,000 profit.  </P> <P> A native of Chicago, Enright is a salesman by trade. Since moving to Huntington  Beach in 1966, he has sold insurance, motorcycles, antique and classic cars,  telephone answering machines and fitness equipment.  </P> <P> About seven years ago he became interested in herbal healing, an interest that  harked back to his earlier studies in chiropractic medicine. Searching for a  way to swap information about herbal healing with other local enthusiasts, he  was discouraged to find only a single bulletin board at a Huntington Beach  health food store.  </P> <P> In 1984, he published a directory of alternative health services modeled after  Los Angeles Resources magazine.  </P> <P> "It sounds corny, but I was sincerely motivated by the need of people who are  into alternative healing and growth," Enright said. "A need from the humanistic  point of view, not the business point of view."  </P> <P> He named his magazine Resources after two separately owned publications, Los  Angeles Resources and San Diego Resources.  </P> <P> Enright borrowed $50,000 and continued working as a part-time salesman to keep  his magazine going. And he raised another $20,000 by selling his 1935  Rolls-Royce limousine.  </P> <P> In 1986, when the owner of Los Angeles Resources decided to get out of the  business, Enright bought the magazine.  </P> <P> Resources has a small staff, two full-time and two part-time workers, including  Enright. Besides scores of ads for everything from laser acupuncture to  past-life therapy, the magazine regularly features music and book reviews, a  three-month calendar of events and stories on environment and health-related  topics that are mostly excerpted from books and other alternative magazines.  </P> <P> Orange County Resources is distributed to 100 locations, mostly health food  stores, restaurants, bookstores, chiropractors and holistic health centers.  </P> <P> As Enright has groped his way through his first publishing venture, he admits  making some blunders. The biggest, he says, was his attempt in 1986 to switch  from four issues a year to six -- a move that failed financially.  </P> <P> Enright likes to recite the concept, "serve your customers, then your business  will prosper." With that in mind, he has organized a series of marketing and  advertising seminars with Harry Pickens, a well-known jazz  pianist-turned-marketing consultant.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, many people who attended the seminars wound up placing ads in  Enright's magazine. Advertising revenue is up 15% to 20%. "We wound up creating  a group of advertisers for us and also boosted our image substantially,"  Enright said.  </P> <P> To support the seminars, Enright installed a toll-free 800 telephone number and  another computer, sent out mailings, rented hotel rooms and hired a full-time  marketing person. With the fees attendees pay, the operation will just about  break even, he said.  </P> <P> Though Enright says most of his advertisers run legitimate businesses, he  admits that there is a kooky fringe. He doesn't accept sexually explicit ads  and has rejected requests from satanists and witches.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some conservative Christians have charged that Satan, not  Enright, runs Orange County Resources and have asked his distributors to remove  the magazine from their newsstands. Enright is touchy on this issue and  initially was reluctant to be interviewed for this story, saying he didn't want  to stir up sentiment against his magazine.  </P> <P> "We have had people come in and say, 'Oh, you shouldn't have that here,' " said  Jeff Doleman, a salesman at the Fahrenheit 451 bookstore in Laguna Beach. "No  one has been violent. We just tell them we're in the business of catering to  people's interests, and this is one thing people around here are interested  in."  </P> <P> "Satan is not running this magazine," Enright said. "If he were, it would make  my job a lot easier."  </P></p>

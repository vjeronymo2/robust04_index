			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Energy tax risks being cut to death PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's proposed energy tax has run into more opposition this week as it starts its journey through the committees of Congress. While business and farm groups have embarked on a campaign to kill the tax altogether, the greatest danger to the administration's plans appears to be the likelihood of a string of exemptions and loopholes. These would reduce the estimated Dollars 73bn the tax is expected to raise over five years, and also weaken its secondary purpose of encouraging energy efficiency. The administration had already made concessions between the first announcement of the tax and publication of its details. Bowing to pressure from maize-growing states such as Illinois, it agreed to exempt ethanol and methanol, and also exempted home heating oil in deference to concerns from icy New England. But members of Congress from oil-producing states are keen to make further changes to the bill, such as moving the point of collection downstream away from the oil well or coal mine. And some representatives of farming communities are pushing for a blanket exemption for agriculture. The tax will be levied in general at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units, with a surcharge of 34.2 cents per million BTUs on refined petroleum products. Many members of Congress have their own concerns about the tax. Montana's Senator Max Baucus is worried about the effect of the tax on the aluminium industry, a heavy energy user, and representatives from other northwestern states, which get much of their electricity from dams, are arguing for hydro-electric power to be exempted like most renewable energy sources.</p>

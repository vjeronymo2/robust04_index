			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Figuring out the Gatt Sir, The estimate of annual gains of at least Dollars 213bn (in 1992 dollars) which will accrue by 2002 from a successful completion of the Uruguay Round has been discussed in a recent FT editorial ('Endgame in the Gatt', September 29) and in commentaries by David Dodwell (World Trade News, September 30), Frances Williams (World Trade News, September 30) and Samuel Brittan ('Where Gatt's Dollars 200bn really comes from', October 4). Your readers may be forgiven for finding it difficult to identify the source of these numbers. The one citation that has been given (September 30) was erroneous as it referred to an earlier publication I co-authored rather than the relevant recently released volume. The book which summarises the results of the four-year modelling collaboration between the OECD Development Centre and the World Bank is published jointly by OECD and the World Bank under the title, Trade Liberalisation: Global Economic Implications, by Ian Goldin, Odin Knudsen and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe. Ian Goldin, senior economist, World Bank, 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US</p>

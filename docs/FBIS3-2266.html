			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that China attaches great importance to  its ties with Azerbaijan and intends through common effort to  further develop such friendly cooperation in every field.    Jiang made these remarks during talks with visiting  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev here this afternoon.    He said China and Azerbaijan are both in Asia, and their  peoples' friendly contacts can be traced back to the "Silk Road"  of more than 2,000 years ago.    The Chinese people have always harbored friendly sentiments  toward the hardworking and wise people of Azerbaijan, which has  a long history of culture, he said.    Jiang said Azerbaijan's independence and the establishment  of  diplomatic relations between the two countries have laid good  conditions for the growth of bilateral ties.    Noting that the two countries have established contacts and  cooperation in every aspect, Jiang said bilateral relations are  now advancing in a healthy and steady way.    Jiang said the two countries also can strengthen and  coordinate cooperation in international affairs and the United  Nations.    He expressed the belief that the president's current visit  to  China will surely help raise bilateral relations and cooperation  to a new level, as the two sides will sign a  Sino-Azerbaijan joint statement and other documents on bilateral  cooperation.    On the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Jiang said China is deeply  concerned about the escalation of the conflict, the large number  of people who have been wounded or killed, and the great loss of  property during the conflict.    He said both sides of the conflict have paid a great price.  It will bring no benefit to the two sides to delay the  settlement of the conflict.    "We sincerely hope that Azerbaijan and Armenia will properly  settle the conflict through peaceful negotiations as early as  possible," Jiang said.    President Aliyev said that Azerbaijan places great  importance  on China's role and influence as a big nation in the  international political and economic arena.    He said that his country is looking attentively and with  great interest at the smooth execution of China's reform  movement.    China has made tremendous achievements in its reforms, the  visiting president said, adding that the Azerbaijani Government  and people are willing to learn from China's experiences.    He expressed the belief that his current China visit will  push Azerbaijani-Chinese ties to a new stage.    The two leaders shared the view during the talks that the  five principles of peaceful co-existence should be the norms for  handling state-to-state relations.    The leaders also briefed each other on their respective  countries' domestic situations and foreign policies.    Among those attending the talks on the Chinese side were Qi  Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the State  Council, Yin Dakui, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception  Committee and vice-minister of public health, and Dai Bingguo,  vice-minister of foreign affairs.    Viktor Kuliyev, first deputy prime minister of Azerbaijan  [name and position as received], Gasan Gasanov, minister of  foreign affairs, Ali Insanov, minister of public health, and  Sabir Rustamkhanly, press minister [name and position as  received], also took part in the talks.    Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony  in the central hall of the Great Hall of the People for his  Azerbaijani counterpart. Tomur Dawamad, vice-chairman of the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China  (NPC), attended the ceremony.    In the evening, Jiang held a banquet for the Azerbaijani  president and his party.    Aliyev arrived here on an official visit to China this  morning by special plane, at the invitation of President Jiang.    He is the first Azerbaijani president to visit China since  Azerbaijan gained its independence.</p>

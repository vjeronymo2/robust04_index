			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG CATS ARE NO PROBLEM; IT'S LAWS HE CAN'T TAME  </P> <P> Joe Maynard is a tough-talking trucker who loves exotic big cats but has a hard  time getting along with the state officials who try to regulate how he cages  and cares for his rare leopards and tigers.  </P> <P> "They try to tell us how to run things, but they've got no expertise  whatsoever," said Maynard, a wiry, bearded man who spends 14 days at a time as  a cross-country truck driver.  </P> <P> Maynard and his wife Jeanne run the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound Inc. a  private, nonprofit zoo located west of this small desert town in Kern County,  about 80 miles north of Los Angeles. Many of the 40 wild cats caged here are  endangered species, some are owned by zoos that have loaned them to Maynard for  breeding.  </P> <P> State regulators say the Maynards are operating a zoo without proper  accreditation and have been keeping wild animals without a state permit that  has been required since 1985, when new animal protection laws went into effect.  The facility does not meet new state standards, primarily because its cages are  too small, state inspectors say.  </P> <P> Prior to 1985, the compound was exempt from state regulation because it was  classified as a private zoo, officials said. But under the new law, such  facilities must meet standards set by the American Assn. of Zoos, Parks and  Aquariums, a national organization created to upgrade animal protection and  public safety criteria.  </P> <P> Already operating on a shoestring budget funded by donations and paid  memberships in their zoo, the Maynards said, they want to upgrade their cages  to association standards but have little money with which to do so. They have  built one big new cage, for the snow leopards, but most of their funds must go  for care and breeding, Maynard said.  </P> <P> "The bureaucrats in Sacramento are wrong. . . . We have a bona fide zoo,"  Maynard argued, claiming that the compound should be exempt from state  regulations because it is a designated federal research facility and has the  necessary federal permits to handle and transport endangered species. State  officials agree that he has the federal permits, but say the new state rules  must be applied.  </P> <P> Maynard has little nice to say about state officials, but his whole demeanor  changes when he walks among the big cats, talking about breeding programs and  the need to keep the rare cats from becoming extinct. He is gentle with the  felines.  </P> <P> "All my life I've loved big cats," he explained. He bought his first leopard 20  years ago for $600. The couple lived in Northridge then. "I wanted to breed . .  . these leopards because they were being killed off and I wanted to do  something to save them."  </P> <P> The Maynards moved from Northridge to Simi Valley, then to Kern County in 1977,  buying 68 acres to make room for their cats. Doing the work himself, Maynard  built the cages and fenced off the compound. In 1983 the Maynards formed the  nonprofit corporation and sold 2,000 memberships to finance the operation. Last  year they raised $134,000, he said.  </P> <P> Although Maynard has no college degrees, he has a good reputation among zoo  professionals active in the work of saving exotic cats. Breeding the animals in  captivity is essential to the effort to save them from extinction, experts say.  </P> <P> The Maynards' unusual collection includes seven North Chinese leopards, a pair  of snow leopards from the Himalayas, on loan from the San Diego Zoo, several  big Siamese tigers and three tiny Temminck's Golden Cats. The compound -- a  haphazard mix of old cages, new construction and mobile homes -- is open to the  public, without charge.  </P> <P> "He's got one of the best collections (of North Chinese) leopards in the  country . . . in terms of genetics." said veterinarian Allen Schoemaker of the  Riverbank Zoo in Charlotte, N.C. Schoemaker keeps breeding records on the 90  Chinese leopards in captivity. No one knows how many of these rare cats still  exist in the wilds of northern China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Competent'  </P> <P> "His knowledge of (big cats) . . . is very superior from what you'd expect in  the private sector," said Pat Morris, a zoo veterinarian and assistant  professor of wildlife medicine at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  Morris, one of Maynard's medical consultants, added, "He is very competent."  </P> <P> State Department of Fish and Game officials concede that Maynard cares about  animals but insist that his facilities must now meet state standards.  </P> <P> "In the past we had no serious problems with him, but the law has changed,"  said Celeste Cushman, a department spokeswoman. The state's caging and fencing  standards had to be upgraded to protect both the animals and the public, she  said.  </P> <P> Most of the Maynards' cats are housed in cages that are about 10 by 20 feet.  Each contains a heavy plywood shelter. The flooring is dirt and few of the  cages have double-gated entryways to prevent escapes. As Maynard builds new  cages, he is adding these safety features.  </P> <P> When the Maynards failed to comply with the department's demands, the state  Fish and Game Commission stepped into the controversy. At first the Maynards  refused to participate in commission hearings, but in February they appeared to  present their case. The commission gave the couple 90 days to come up with a  plan detailing how they will meet state standards within three years.  </P> <P> "No one wants to take animals away from him," said Harold C. Cribbs, the  commission's executive secretary. Cribbs said the department has been  cooperating with Maynard on developing such a plan. If a plan cannot be worked  out, the commission could seize the animals, Cribbs said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, state game wardens are asking the Kern County district  attorney to file misdemeanor charges against the Maynards for importing a North  Chinese leopard in January, in violation of a department order. The animal is  on loan from the Omaha Zoo. The state had instructed the couple not to obtain  any more animals until they are in compliance with state laws.  </P> <P> Maynard denied that he violated the law, saying that he had a valid federal  permit to transport the leopard from Omaha.  </P> <P> "They (state wardens) came here with the cops . . . (and) said we'd brought  that cat in illegally," Maynard said. Zoo keepers who work with the Maynards on  a regular basis say they are not put off by the compound's physical facilities  because the couple cares for its animals and works to preserve threatened  species.  </P> <P> "It's true their facilities . . . don't meet (public) zoo standards," said Dr.  Lee Simmons, director of the Omaha Zoo. "But by all reports . . . Joe Maynard  doesn't fall short on animal care. . . . (He) really cares about his animals."  </P></p>

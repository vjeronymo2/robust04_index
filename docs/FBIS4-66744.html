			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Pressure"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott  has declared India the greatest democracy in the world while  paying tribute to India. He said that it is the leader of this  region because of its democratic traditions, size, and  stability. He said that India is the strongest candidate to  become a member of the UN Security Council. Mr. Talbott was  addressing a press conference on Friday in Delhi after talking  with the Indian government. Mr. Talbott assured the Indian  government that F-16 fighter planes will be supplied to Pakistan  only after Pakistan stops production of nuclear weapons and  provides assurance to freeze its nuclear program. He said that  both India and Pakistan are suspicious of American efforts and  are refusing to sign the NPT. He said that the Kashmir issue  could ignite a destructive war between the two countries and  that is why the issue of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons  was getting most of U.S. attention. He said that both countries  should resolve the Kashmir issue by holding bilateral talks  according to the Shimla pact. He made it clear that the United  States was not favoring Pakistan.    Mr. Strobe Talbott is not only the deputy secretary of  state,  he is also an expert on policies on weapons reduction. He was  not very successful in his mission in India because India  refused to cooperate in any plan for weapons reduction or  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. After several days talks  with the ministers and the prime minister, the U.S. deputy  secretary of state has unilaterally put the whole pressure on  Pakistan. However, the Pakistan Air Force has already lost  interest in F-16 fighter planes and is busy looking at fighter  planes in other countries. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has  hinted that Pakistan does not need F-16 planes. Both the  president and the prime minister have loudly declared that  Pakistan's nuclear program will not be frozen. The Pakistani  government let this stand be known when Mr. Talbott was holding  his press conference in New Delhi. This was a psychological  pressure and the Pakistani government neutralized it. The U.S.  deputy secretary's announcement about getting a certificate from  Pakistani government promising to cap its nuclear program is  equivalent to our opening up our nuclear installations for  inspection. Since Pakistan has announced that it is not  interested in F-16 fighter planes, the demand for inspecting the  nuclear installations has become ineffective. However, Mr.  Talbott continued to increase this psychological pressure and  announced the desire to make India a member of the Security  Council. He advocated inclusion of Germany and Japan in the  Security Council in his press conference and declared India to  be the best candidate for membership to the Security Council.  Mr. Talbott's has tried to create a soft spot for the United  States in the Indian mind. As the result of it, the Indian prime  minister has accepted the U.S. invitation to visit the United  States. At the same time, the United States has used this  strategy to put additional pressure on Pakistan. The goal of all  this is to make India the "police inspector" of South Asia and  to stop Pakistan from its defense preparations.    Pakistan should not take time to understand what is hidden  in  this new U.S. strategy because India's inclusion in the Security  Council is absolutely dangerous for Pakistan. The United States  used this psychological weapon against Pakistan. However,  Pakistan should not forget the fact that if the United States  wants to appoint India the custodian of its interests in this  region, Pakistan will not change its policies even when it  accepts all U.S. conditions with its eyes closed. Even if the  United States has said this is just to placate India, its  pressure on Pakistan's policies will continue. These lines are  being written at a time when two U.S. deputy secretaries of  state--Mr. Talbott and Ms. Raphel--are busy in negotiations in  Islamabad. General Abdul Waheed, Pakistan army chief, has  returned to London after his talks in Washington and is on his  way home. During the last few months, there have been several  rounds of talks on security of this region. However, the present  talks are being called final. It is important to mention here  that before the recent round of talks between Pakistan and the  United States, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President  Farooq Leghari have expressed the government's definite stand  that neither our nuclear program will be capped nor our national  interests will be compromised. The government has dropped its  unusual interest in acquiring F-16 fighter planes. Despite this  all, the Pakistani government should keep a close eye on the new  changes that have occurred in relations among Pakistan, India,  and the United States.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / People: Aspiring novelist shunts coal into private sector Ray Proctor, 48, British Coal's new finance director, retains a surprising sense of humour for a man who, if he makes a success of his new role, may work himself out of a job in a couple of years. Proctor, who has spent his whole life in the nationalised coal industry since leaving Oxford in 1967, does not view his career quite so bleakly. Having trained as a management accountant, he worked on the financial side before moving into line management in 1983. Following the death of deputy chairman Ken Moses, Proctor was given responsibility for preparing the industry for privatisation. He will retain his responsibility for privatisation when he takes over from Michael Butler as finance director at the end of next month. It is a two year appointment which should cover the period up to privatisation. Proctor sees his role as twofold - making sure that costs have been driven down to the level where the industry is profitable on a sustainable basis, and helping organise a successful privatisation. Unlike some old mining hands, Proctor is one executive who seems perfectly happy with the prospect of taking the industry into the private sector. However, he is not forgetting his outside interests. During his time as director of studies at the National Coal Board staff college he penned a well received paper-back, 'Finance for the Perplexed Executive', and is toying with writing a novel. ' It's easier to write than a textbook, and you don't need to check the figures' jokes British Coal's new financial supremo. Meanwhile, Andrew Horsler, 45, who like Proctor is another ex-Leeds grammar school boy and Oxford graduate, has also been appointed a member of the British Coal Corporation. He is executive director of marketing and replaces Malcolm Edwards who was ousted last year. The Government has also reappointed Albert Wheeler, 59, deputy chairman and operations director, for a two year term running till March 31, 1995, and Kevan Hunt, 55, the employee relations director, has been reappointed for a one year term.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-Tayyash: "Kuwaiti Defense Minister: Army </F> Has Regained 70 Percent of Its Capabilities"]    [Text] Kuwait -- Kuwaiti Defense Minister Shaykh Ahmad  al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah has stated that the Kuwaiti Army has  regained 70 percent of its capabilities and expected it to reach  100 percent in the near future. In a statement to AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT yesterday the Kuwaiti minister said that what mattered  to Kuwait was "to get the best arms from any source because our  criterion is the quality, not the source, of the arms." In his  first statement since assuming his new post he said that the  government would not hesitate to provide everything of service  to the members of the Kuwaiti Army.    In reply to a question about coordination with the Gulf  states regarding the Peninsula Shield forces, the minister said  that the defense of Kuwait was primarily the responsibility of  the Kuwaiti Army, followed when necessary by the role of the  brothers and friends. He said in that respect that "Kuwait does  not trust the Iraqi side. Once bitten, twice shy."    He affirmed that attention at present was focused on  preventing infiltration of any Iraqi elements into Kuwaiti  territory to destabilize its security. He added: "When I was  interior minister we foiled Iraqi attempts to undermine Kuwaiti  security and we exposed many such designs at the time." The  Kuwaiti defense minister also said that his past experience as  interior minister would consolidate his role as defense minister  in the present government in providing complete security for the  public and in ensuring their safety. He added that he was  confident about the strength of the internal situation, thanks  to the public's conscious support for the work of the security  forces.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bayer predicts sharp decline in earnings BAYER, the German-based chemicals group, expects earnings to drop 20 per cent to around DM2bn (Dollars 1.1bn) this year, following a similar decline in the first half, and despite expected cost savings of almost DM1bn. There is no prospect of an economic recovery in Europe, source of 62 per cent of sales, and the favourable effects of current US dollar and yen exchange rates will not compensate for adverse shifts in European currencies, the company said yesterday. Pre-tax earnings fell DM344m to DM1.4bn on sales down 5 per cent at DM21bn in the first half, according to an interim report. The effects of an 11 per cent drop in European turnover were partly alleviated by a 4 per cent improvement in north America and 10 per cent elsewhere. Sales in the healthcare divisions, the group's main protection against recession, were stable at DM4.6bn, while all other sectors showed declines. Polymers and industrial products were worst hit, with sales down 10 per cent. Healthcare performed relatively well, despite prescription limits and other medical service reforms in Germany, and due in part to growth in self-medication products. Turnover at Bayer AG, the German parent, fell 12 per cent to DM8.6bn, mainly because of lower volumes. In agrochemicals, where sales were down 2.6 per cent, turnover improved in the second quarter after a 9 per cent drop in the first three months of the year. The results, towards the top end of analysts' expectations, followed a 16 per cent drop in pre-tax profits from DM3.2bn to DM2.7bn for the whole of 1992, which led to the first cut in the group's dividend in a decade. Last year's payout was cut DM2 to DM11, although the group made no mention of 1993 prospects in yesterday's interim report. Workforce reductions and other rationalisation measures appear to have been accelerated. The group said costs were reduced by around DM500m in the first half, and further savings of several hundred million D-Marks were expected in the remainder of the year. In the period under review the group shed 2,700 employees, out of the 3,000 planned to go in the full year. Personnel expenses excluding pensions fell as a result - by 4 per cent to DM6.5bn in the group and by 8 per cent to DM2.7bn at the parent.</p>

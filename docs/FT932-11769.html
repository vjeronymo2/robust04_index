			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Ukraine PM seeks more power MR Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine's prime minister, said yesterday he wants to introduce a state of emergency to override opposition to his economic reforms and step up the fight against inflation. He said he would this month ask parliament to extend the special powers under which he has been running the economy for six months. 'What we need is to introduce a state of emergency. This could be used to push ahead rapidly with demonopolisation in various sectors,' he said. In particular, he said: Parliament, which has been stalling the government's reforms, should no longer have a veto over economic measures; The National Bank, which in March prompted a 50 per cent drop in value of the Ukrainian currency by issuing a massive tranche of subsidised credits to state industry and agriculture, should be brought under direct government control; The government should take charge of the State Property Fund, the privatisation body which has recently been criticised for its slow progress. It is not clear whether Mr Kuchma will secure the extra powers he is demanding. There have been recent signs that the other two Ukrainian leaders, President Leonid Kravchuk and parliament chairman Ivan Pliushch, are willing to back the prime minister. An increasingly fractious parliament, however, may refuse to renew any special powers at all when they expire at the end of May - in which event, Mr Kuchma said, he would resign. The prime minister said decisive action was needed in the face of a worsening payments crisis and intensifying inflationary pressures. Increases in the cost of Ukraine's fuel imports from Russia would force another sharp increase in prices and wages this month, he added. Ukrainian officials say the rise could be as much as 20-fold. Tighter control over credit and the budget deficit are also essential if Ukraine is to qualify for a Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) loan which Mr Kuchma said Ukraine hoped to obtain from the International Monetary Fund by the end of June. An IMF mission is expected in Kiev in mid-May for negotiations on this so-called transitional facility, which could pave the way for further assistance from the World Bank later in the year. Although looser-than-normal conditions would be attached, Ukraine will not qualify unless the government can demonstrate the will and the means to curb spending. In April the country moved close to hyperinflation, with prices rising at nearly 50 per cent a month, said western economists. Ukraine may face an additional problem in obtaining western assistance: rising American and Russian anger over its tardiness in ratifying nuclear disarmament treaties. In yesterday's interview, Mr Kuchma, recently appointed chief negotiator with Russia on the issue, said mounting western pressure was helping to turn this into a problem by fuelling pro-nuclear sentiment in the Ukrainian parliament. 'Even the kindest, gentlest man, if pressed and pressed and pressed, will want to bite back,' he said.</p>

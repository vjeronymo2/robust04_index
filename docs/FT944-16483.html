			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (3): Plenty of hurdles remain - Privatisation has had limited success so far Bulgaria's mass privatisation programme (MPP), based on the Czech model using vouchers and private investment funds, suffered a severe blow before it even got off the ground when the rival privatisation agency took more than 35 most promising state companies in the MPP list for direct sale to foreign and domestic investors. Legislation to set up the MPP was approved just before the government resigned, but Dimiter Stefanov, the executive director of the Centre for Mass Privatisation, admits that much technical work remains to be done before vouchers with a nominal value of 25,000 'investment Leva' can be distributed to those willing to pay Lv500 for privatisation coupons. Even then a big effort will be required to arouse popular enthusiasm for the scheme. In the meantime Reneta Indjova, the tough-minded executive director of the privatisation agency, is forging ahead with privatisation by direct sale to investors, a method which has already privatised 30 medium- to large-sized state-owned enterprises, of which the biggest and most recent is the Dollars 55m purchase by the German transport entrepreneur Willi Betz of a controlling 55 per cent stake in Somat, Europe's biggest trucking company. The Somat deal, like most other deals to date, promises substantial future investment and job guarantees. But thus far the benefit to the Bulgarian treasury from privatisation has been limited. 'Net revenues from privatisation to date are probably no more than Dollars 20m. But some Dollars 1.5bn in enterprise debt has been written off as a result of privatisation while the prospects for penetrating new markets and attracting further greenfield investment have improved,' says Ms Indjova. Meanwhile the agency is hoping that the recent foreign debt reduction agreements, with their provision for debt/equity swaps, will stimulate the interest of foreign investors in state-owned assets with potential for growth once old debts are cleared and new management methods and equipment are installed. Ms Indjova is anxious to speed up the process as much as possible, largely because the negative effect of delay is only too obvious. Given the slowness of formal privatisation, Bulgarian state and municipal enterprises have been subjected to a wave of 'hidden privatisation' which has alienated a large but unquantifyable amount of the choicest state or municipally-owned assets. 'It is impossible to calculate the loss accurately, but hidden privatisation reduces the net worth of enterprises and is reflected in rising inter-enterprise debt, the high level of debt to commercial banks and ultimately adds to the budget deficit, driving inflation and crowding out the private sector,' she says. Such 'hidden privatisation' usually involves the formation of private companies to supply state enterprises with inputs at high prices and other companies take their subsidised output for resale at market prices. In this way enterprises accumulate inter-company debts and losses while allowing a new class of millionaire 'biznismen' to cream off economic rents. The process of nationalising losses and privatising profits is widespread throughout the former Soviet bloc but has been most blatant in countries such as Bulgaria or Romania where the continuing influence of former communists, coupled with the weakness of the law and the inexperience of civil society has been most pronounced. In Bulgaria's case what is popularly perceived as the 'mafia-isation' of the economy has been further stimulated by the baleful side-effects of the UN embargo on trade with Serbia and the Greek embargo on trade with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Small but powerful groups of Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians have made quick fortunes by smuggling oil, weapons and a wide range of other commodities across the borders by a variety of ingenious methods which mostly include the bribing of police, customs and other officials at some stage. 'The war in former Yugoslavia has been a disaster for Bulgaria. I seriously doubt whether a country like the Czech republic would be so law-abiding if it had borders like ours,' says Alexander Bozhkov, the former head of Bulgaria's privatisation agency who now runs a private consultancy firm specialising in assisting foreign investors. Perhaps the most pernicious result of the widespread suspicion in which the new business class is held is the confirmation of many of the old communist propaganda images of rapacious capitalists grinding the faces of the poor and the 'zero sum' notion that wealth is a stock rather than a flow so that one man's wealth is always at the expense of another. Rising awareness of the dangers to future economic and social development of such widespread antipathy has spurred the more intelligent and genuinely entrepreneurial, rather than parasitic, members of the 'new class' to try and change both the image and the reality of private business ethics and methods. This became clear last month when a split developed within the ranks of the G - 13, a group of 13 leading private business groups, which has now been reduced to a rump G - 9. Lyubomir Gibinsky, the prime mover behind Prime Investment Trust, a holding which controls 40 companies and is a major shareholder in TSBank one of the largest and fastest growing private banks, led the breakaway. 'TSBank was a founder members of G - 13 whose idea was to consolidate and strengthen national capital so that we could have a dialogue and proper partnership with foreign partners. But in practice some of the members interpreted this as a way of dividing up the market and to express their dislike of foreign investors,' says Mr Gibinsky. They also had a tendency to use 'non-market methods' he added, a euphemism to explain the rash of car bombs, shoot-outs and beatings which have punctuated Sofia street life in recent months. 'We decided to leave G - 13 as our principles are free enterprise and fair competition, a North American not Latin American style of business,' he said.</p>

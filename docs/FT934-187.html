			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Planting the seeds for future growth - Hewden-Stuart, an avid exponent of 'bottom fishing' The art of 'bottom fishing' - snapping up competitors or their assets when prices are at a minimum - is more spoken about than practised. One avid exponent, however, is Hewden-Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company. The Glasgow-based group paid Pounds 11m in July for the Hireplant assets of BET, acquiring 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties. By October, analysts were pleasantly surprised to learn that the previously lossmaking business was expected to make an immediate contribution to group profits. Hewden-Stuart bought Hireplant, which usefully extends the group's existing network of depots, at a Pounds 3m discount to its already written-down net assets, and did so in time to take advantage of capital allowances. The shrewdness of the deal gives a clue as to how Hewden-Stuart has managed to come through the recession without recording a loss, although profits have slumped by two thirds from the Pounds 36m made in 1989. Sir Matthew Goodwin, Hewden-Stuart's veteran chairman, says the group drew on its experience of previous recessions to navigate the recent downturn, but cautions that the national recovery is erratic and the 'crazy' days of the late eighties are unlikely ever to return. The group was certainly not unscathed by the crash. Hewden-Stuart had 70 per cent of all the tower cranes in London at the peak of the boom, and was the main supplier to Canary Wharf. It had hoped to transfer many of them to east Germany, but was caught out by the European recession. However, for Sir Matthew recent experience has just confirmed what has long been his fundamental tenet: 'The only thing that matters in any business is cashflow. This must be understood throughout the group.' Using a conservative depreciation policy, Hewden-Stuart has maintained strong cashflow, even although pre-tax profits flagged, and can usually sell old equipment at a premium to its written-down value. The chairman says: 'When looking at a depot, there was never any question of closure so long as it was generating cash.' A qualified chartered accountant, Sir Matthew, 64, has been chairman of the group since 1979 and an executive director since 1960. He says this cautious approach to finance is long-standing: 'We would not buy anything unless we could finance 25 per cent of its purchase price in cash. That rule still applies.' Hewden-Stuart also steers clear of leasing and hire-purchase. Sir Matthew says: 'Wherever possible we have bought our properties so that if we want to move out, we can sell up and move on.' October marked the 25th anniversary of Hewden-Stuart's flotation. Sir Matthew pointed out that any investors who joined in 1968 would by then have seen a thirty-fold increase in the capital value of their holding, an overall return few companies could emulate. The group's pre-tax profits increased by 35 per cent to Pounds 9.1m in first half of the year, even though turnover rose only slightly. The chairman said the downward trend in profits experienced for the last three years was reversed in the early summer, but this was more a reflection of good husbandry than any real strengthening in the workload of customers. Hewden-Stuart has net cash balances, in spite of having spent Pounds 11m on Hireplant and a further Pounds 17m on new equipment in the first half, and investment in plant is continuing at a high rate. The improvement in the hire division's profits reflected benefits from the heavy capital expenditure programme which had been carried through the recession, often at a cost which adversely affected profits at the time. Sir Matthew said machines taken in part-exchange by the group's merchandising business now tended to be older than usual, with a shortage of modern second-hand equipment. 'This supports the view that the condition and age of plant fleets generally has deteriorated and brings nearer the time when customers will seek quality and service, albeit at higher prices.' The group expects that construction companies will hesitate to buy plant in the face of an uncertain upturn, which should benefit hire businesses. The growing gap between the value of old plant and the cost of replacing it should also encourage hiring rather than purchase. Sir Matthew says this will be encouraged by the reduction in the number of finance companies prepared to fund the acquisition of equipment: 'Many banks and leasing companies have said to me 'never again'.' Although even the group's much reduced tower cranes operation is expected to be back in the black by the end of the year, Sir Matthew sounds a cautious note about the speed of any upturn - emphasising that he has yet to see much sign of recovery in hire rates: 'In the longer term the surplus of plant which still exists in this country will be eliminated and the demand for hire will increase, a process that hopefully will become apparent in 1994.' In spite of being deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, Sir Matthew stands apart from some of the attitudes which have dominated the financial and commercial world in recent years. He has little time for blandishments of merchant bankers who continually offer their services to the group, and also eschews the more aggressive forms of City public relations. He sees his group as a partnership between shareholders, management and employees - making no apology for what some described as a 'parsimonious' recent dividend increase. He says: 'In a recessionary period where salaries, wages and costs require to be carefully controlled, it would be inappropriate to do other than moderately increase the dividend.' Meanwhile, the employees at Hireplant have been getting to know their new boss. Sir Matthew said: 'I spent three days going round the depots. I find it very useful to sit down and have a mug of tea with drivers, fitters and managers and discuss problems. They hadn't seen anyone from head office for years.' The former BET staff also discovered a habit of Sir Matthew's long familiar to Hewden-Stuart's depot managers: 'I always go round the back the check what's in the junkyard.'</p>

The two sides reached the agreement during a three-day  Japan-Russia joint committee meeting on environmental  conservation at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said.    They also agreed to hold a second joint committee meeting in  Russia sometime in the first half of 1995 to review the progress  of the projects and hammer out new ones, they said.    The meeting in Tokyo was the first to be held based on an  accord in 1991 on environmental conservation between Japan and  the then Soviet Union.    Moscow and Tokyo had agreed to hold the meeting annually but  were unable to because of Russia's domestic situation, the  officials said.    Issei Nomura, director general of the ministry's European  and  Oceanian Affairs Bureau, headed the Japanese delegation.    Officials from the Environment Agency, the Science and  Technology Agency, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry and other related ministries also attended.    The Russian side was headed by Yuriy Kazakov, director  general of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry  of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources.    The joint projects to be conducted in 1994 and 1995 include  joint studies on acid rain, the quality of water of Lake Baikal,  the environment of the Sea of Japan, and observation of the  greenhouse effect in Siberia.    The program also includes joint observation of methane gas  from frozen land regions and exchange of information to prevent  air pollution in both countries, the officials said.    Also during the meeting, the two sides discussed each  nation's administration and policies concerning environment, as  well as domestic and global environmental problems, they said.    Specifically, they discussed air and water pollution,  disposal of wastes, global warming, and protection of  biodiversity and the ozone layer, the officials said.    The two sides did not discuss Russia's dumping of nuclear  waste into the Sea of Japan since it was not on the agenda, they  said.    The Japanese and Russian officials agreed that cooperation  between the two nations is important for environmental  preservation and that cooperation in the field could contribute  to the improvement of bilateral relations as a whole, the  officials said.</p>

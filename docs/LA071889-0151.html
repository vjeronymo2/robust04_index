			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MILLION GALLONS OF OIL SPILL FROM TANK  </P> <P> A storage tank ruptured today and spilled an estimated 1.25 million gallons of  crude oil, but the spill was stopped short of a waterway that leads to the  Atlantic, the Coast Guard said.  </P> <P> The oil was contained by a system of earthen dikes and was not expected to  reach the outermost dikes, which are 15 feet from the water, Coast Guard  spokesman Paul Milligan said.  </P> <P> Tanker barges were sent to the scene on the shore of Arthur Kill, a narrow  waterway separating New Jersey and the New York City borough of Staten Island.  As a precaution, 900 feet of booms were lowered into the water.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear what caused the rupture in the tank, which is  owned by Northville Industries.  </P></p>

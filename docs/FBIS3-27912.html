Under the public servants' ethics law, government officials  above the grade one level who are obliged to disclose assets had  to report any change in their financial standing since  registration last Aug. 12 by Monday.    Kim himself is worth 575 million won, up 15.21 million won  from 560.29 million won last August, due to the accumulation of  monthly savings of 3 million won.    His other assets include a 410-million-won house in  Sangdo-tong, Seoul, and 150 million won worth of farmland in  Koje, South Kyongsang Province.    Thanks to a bumper anchovy harvest, his father, Kim  Hong-cho,  increased his wealth by 425.38 million won, which he has  deposited in three separate banks.    President Kim's wealth grew by 15.21 million won due to  interest increases in his monthly savings while his father  benefited from the fact that he can deposit all his earnings now  that he no longer has to contribute to his son's political  activities, according to Hong In-kil, senior presidential  secretary for administrative affairs.    Another change in Kim's assets resulted from his second  daughter-in-law's purchase of a used car for 6 million won last  September.</p>

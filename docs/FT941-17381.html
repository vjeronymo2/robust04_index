			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Prisons on alert as system shows strains Security was increased at prisons across Venezuela yesterday after a riot and mass breakout at two separate institutions left more than 100 prisoners dead, writes Joseph Mann. Soldiers and firemen were still pulling bodies out of a compound in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second-largest city, after about 100 prisoners died during a riot and fire on Monday. Venezuelan authorities said that two rival bands of prisoners began fighting late on Monday afternoon and set fire to prison buildings. Units of the National Guard were called in to crush the ensuing riot. Meanwhile, 40 prisoners escaped and nine were killed while trying to flee Tocoron prison, 75 miles south-west of Caracas, while government officials were dealing with the aftermath of the Maracaibo rampage early on Tuesday morning. A National Guardsman also died.</p>

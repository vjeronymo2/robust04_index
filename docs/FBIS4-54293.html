			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Indonesian Government has asked the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry [MITI) to extend financial  assistance to Asahan [name as published] Aluminum, a state-run  aluminum smelting company in which Japanese firms have a stake.  The financial assistance being sought by the Indonesian  Government is that: 1) Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation  Fund and Japanese firms that invest in Asahan Aluminum subscribe  for about 10 billion worth of shares in a fresh capital increase  to be made by Asahan Aluminum; and 2) the current interest rate  on approximately 190 billion yen in loans extended by the Export  and Import Bank of Japan be lowered. Asahan Aluminum has come  into being as the sole overseas aluminum production base for  Japanese firms that have withdrawn from their overseas aluminum  smelting business, and the Japanese firms have staked their  survival on the aluminum smelting industry in Indonesia.  Nonetheless, Asahan Aluminum has continued to register a poor  performance because of sluggish aluminum markets around the  world. MITI plans to accept in principle the Indonesian  Government's request for the financial assistance after  concluding that Japan needs to secure an overseas source of  aluminum ingots to prepare itself for potential fluctuations of  the world aluminum market. MITI will discuss specific ways to  provide the financial assistance with 12 Japanese firms,  including the Sumimoto Chemical Company and the Nippon Light  Metal Company, which have invested in Asahan Aluminum, and the  Finance Ministry and the Export and Import Bank of Japan.

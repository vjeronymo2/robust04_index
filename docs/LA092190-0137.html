			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S JUST A FRIENDLY LITTLE MATCH;  </P> <P> TENNIS: U.S. AND AUSTRIAN PLAYERS PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES IN DAVIS CUP  SEMIFINAL. CHANG PLAYS MUSTER, THEN AGASSI FACES SKOFF.  </P> <P> For the Americans, who have momentarily quit feuding and having their feelings  hurt, the Davis Cup match that begins today at a converted soccer stadium on  the banks of the Danube is a chance to reach the finals for the first time in  six years.  </P> <P> For the Austrians, who have temporarily stopped calling each other names, the  best-of-five competition is something like a Holy Day of National Recognition,  the biggest sports event in years that is not performed on skis.  </P> <P> The fact that these contentious teams, each with its resident free spirit, are  meeting in a soccer stadium is also considered a redemption for the Austrians.  </P> <P> A week ago, their proud national soccer team lost in the opening round of the  European Championships to some place called the Faroe Islands, a Danish  protectorate somewhere in the mists north of Scotland. A few days later, the  Austrian coach was fired.  </P> <P> As a result, Austrians, who a few years ago didn't know a tennis ball from the  Viennese steamed dumpling, semmelknodel, have turned to their battling tennis  trio of Thomas Muster, Horst Skoff and Alex Antonitsch to restore national  pride lost ingloriously on the bleak isles.  </P> <P> Skoff, 22, whose girlfriend was the 1988 Miss World, is the free spirit. A few  years ago, Skoff called Muster, 24, something bad. As a result, the two leading  lights of Austrian tennis barely spoke. Skoff claimed it was because Muster, a  laconic sort, couldn't manage a complete sentence.  </P> <P> Austrian Davis Cup captain Filip Krajcik, explaining that it is difficult  having two tennis stars in a country as small as Austria, said Muster and Skoff  had some kind of rapprochement in Spain last February when the Austrians beat a  tough Spanish team, 3-2.  </P> <P> The American team of Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and doubles players Jim Pugh  and Rick Leach, has also had its share of turmoil, mainly between Agassi and  team captain Tom Gorman, who dared to criticize Agassi's sense of "commitment"  after the U.S. team lost to West Germany in the semifinals last year.  </P> <P> But at the draw for the order of matches Thursday in a marble ballroom of the  Austrian Imperial Palace, Agassi said the quibble has been ironed out.  </P> <P> "Me and Gore had some differences a while ago, but we have come many steps  since then," he said, looking like an Indian prince at an English public  school, with his long, tinted hair, earrings and regulation Davis Cup blue  blazer and tie.  </P> <P> Later in the afternoon, as Agassi practiced looping topspin forehands on the  new clay court in the 15,000-seat Prater soccer stadium, Gorman actually  offered his young star a few words of friendly advice. Agassi smiled back  tolerantly .  </P> <P> Even if old wounds have healed, the match will not be a waltz or walk in the  Vienna Woods for the Americans, mainly because the playing surface is clay, the  Austrians' favorite. Muster, a muscular, hard-hitting baseline player, has not  lost on clay in 22 Davis Cup matches.  </P> <P> "I'm not kidding myself," Krajcik said, "This team is mediocre on another  surface. We have had the luck to play all of our matches this year (against  Spain and Italy) on clay."  </P> <P> Because of the clay factor, veteran tennis commentator Bud Collins rates the  Austrians slight favorites.  </P> <P> However, Agassi was quick to mention in the prematch news conference that the  Americans are no slouches on clay either. Two years ago, Chang won the French  Open on the famous red clay of Roland Garros Stadium. This year, Agassi was  runner-up, losing to clay specialist Andres Gomez of Ecuador in the final.  </P> <P> Chang seemed particularly nationalistic about the duel with Austria, comparing  the challenge to something worthy of Sylvester Stallone.  </P> <P> "It's like a Rambo movie, one man on a court against another man and 15,000  people in the crowd," he said. "It will be very intense."  </P> <P> According to the draw at the Hofburg Palace, Chang will open today with a  singles match against Muster, whom he has never played. This was considered a  break for the Austrian team, since Muster will be paired with Antonitsch in  Saturday's doubles match.  </P> <P> If Muster had drawn the second match of the day instead of the first, he faced  the possibility of playing late this evening or, even worse, continuing the  match Saturday morning before playing doubles.  </P> <P> In the second singles match today, Agassi will play Skoff, a stylish clay court  player with a powerful forehand who has always been in the shadow of Muster,  the most accomplished Austrian player ever.  </P> <P> Krajcik says Skoff has a chance against Agassi if he can rise to the quality of  tennis he played in a grueling Davis Cup victory over Sweden's Mats Wilander  last year. Skoff beat Wilander, 6-7, 7-6, 1-6, 6-4, 9-7, in a five-hour match.  </P> <P> Most people believe that for Austria to win, Muster must win both of his  singles matches and Skoff must beat Chang. Leach and Pugh, the Wimbledon  doubles champions, are heavy favorites over the Muster-Antonitsch team,  although the Americans have not played well recently on clay.  </P> <P> If Chang wins the first match today, the Americans are likely to win the series  and advance to the finals Nov. 30-Dec. 2. The young Californian considers  himself an underdog but seems to delight in the challenge.  </P> <P> "Because I am an underdog, I think that puts more pressure on Thomas (Muster),"  he said.  </P> <P> But Skoff, never one to overestimate the talents of his fellow Austrian,  predicted Muster will have a tough time with Chang. "I think it is going to be  a long, physical match," Skoff said. "And Chang is in terrific shape. Of  course, so is Thomas. I hope Thomas will win, but I think it will be long."  </P> <P> The United States was last in the Davis Cup finals in 1984, when it lost to  Sweden. It last won in 1983, against France.  </P></p>

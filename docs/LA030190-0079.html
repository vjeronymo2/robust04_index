			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOPE: QUALITY TIME FOR SOME FAMILIES IS A TRIP TO CLASSROOM  </P> <P> Larry Nix had not been back to school in 14 years, and he never expected that  the day he finally returned he would find himself sitting in a circle singing  the children's song, "Cheesecake, gobble gobble, cheesecake gobble gobble."  </P> <P> But there he was, with wife Andrea, his two daughters Shante and Tiffany, and  15 other children he had never laid eyes on, watching a banjo-playing teacher  who called himself Michael Jackson and referred to the rest of the class as the  Jackson family.  </P> <P> "This is fantastic," Nix said. "It makes you feel like a kid all over again."  </P> <P> Nix, a 31-year-old janitor, went to Washington Elementary School in Bellflower  on a recent Saturday with his family to relearn some of the basic academic  skills he had forgotten since graduating from Centennial High School in  Compton.  </P> <P> What he got was his first computer lesson, a few sing-alongs with teacher Jim  Lanners, a.k.a. Michael Jackson, a lecture on personal safety from the  "Stranger Danger Lady" who warned the children against talking to strangers,  and his first homework assignment since 1976: instructions for the family to  create whatever they wanted from a bag of marshmallows, a box of Jell-O and  some toothpicks.  </P> <P> The Nix family is among the first participants in a Bellflower Unified School  District program for parents who do not have the money to go back to school and  who are looking for a way to spend more time with their children, project  coordinator Linda Bobkowski said.  </P> <P> Every Saturday for half a day, parents and their children meet at Washington  Elementary School, where they play together for one hour until parents separate  to attend classes that hone their reading, writing and mathematics skills on a  computer.  </P> <P> Bobkowski calls the 14-week program Parent Partners and said it is the only  program in Los Angeles County and perhaps Southern California designed to get  low-income families involved in school life. Bobkowski said children are taught  hygiene, self-esteem, good nutrition and personal safety, and their mothers and  fathers learn basic parenting and academic skills.  </P> <P> "How can the parents help their kids if they don't have the skills?" Bobkowski  asked parents recently. "A lot of parents don't want to help their kids with  schoolwork, because they don't know how to do it. It doesn't mean you are  stupid or uneducated. It just means you need help in basic skills."  </P> <P> During the first meeting of Parent Partners in a classroom with crooked  Valentine hearts pasted on the windows and wooden dinosaur toys scattered  about, Nix grabbed the chance to relearn what he said he did not learn well in  the first place -- math, reading and writing.  </P> <P> "This is a chance for me to make up for it," he said.  </P> <P> Bobkowski said the program is modeled after a federal program known as Even  Start. It is Bobkowski's hope that Parent Partners will eventually be funded by  a federal grant. The $4,000 project was coordinated by Bobkowski, Merwyn Smith,  director of adult education programs, and Maryann Suggs, director of child  development programs. It is supported by federal funds for poverty level  families.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure that when parents are learning, kids are learning, too,"  Suggs said.  </P> <P> Eleven families have joined already, and Smith said that because the program is  well under way no more families will be allowed to join.  </P> <P> On the first Saturday of the program, nine families with about 20 children gave  up a sunny weekend morning to go to school, and no one seemed to mind. They  came for different reasons: some to learn how to work with their children, some  to show their children that they are interested in what they do at school, and  some to brush up on academic skills.  </P> <P> "It seems to help everybody all the way around," said Donna Rodgers, 53, who  attended the classes with her daughter and 6-year-old grandson, Brian. "I've  always wanted to learn the computer. If I had one at home, I could find  something to do to supplement my income. Anything would help."  </P> <P> Third-grader Cheri Ballard, who was busy covering the classroom's frantic  gerbil with raw white rice, did not know much about her mother's being able to  take classes, but said she was glad her mother was coming to school. "We never  get to see her that much," Cheri said.  </P> <P> Cheri's mother, Sharon, said: "I wasn't sure what this program was going to be  about," Ballard said. "I just knew I needed more communication and time with my  daughters. This will give us a chance to have time together, I hope."  </P> <P> For Mireya and Sebastian Cerda, Parent Partners is much more than being able to  spend time with their 3-year-old daughter, Angela, or sitting down in front of  a computer for the first time. It is an indoctrination into American society,  Mireya Cerda said. The couple moved to Bellflower from Chile about 1 1/2 years  ago.  </P> <P> "We come from another culture," she said. "We are learning two things. We are  learning about the society and we are learning to be parents."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IOWA;  </P> <P> BLAME ASSIGNED FOR CONTAMINATED CORN  </P> <P> Iowa environmental officials said that a federal agency and a grain elevator  operator were equally responsible for cleaning up 12,755 bushels of corn  heavily tainted by aflatoxin, a natural cancer-causing toxin. The order from  the Iowa Division of Environmental Protection gave the Farmers Home  Administration and the Pruess Elevator Co. of Lowden, which purchased the corn,  until next Friday to remove it. But a lawyer representing the FmHA, which sold  the corn from a foreclosed farm at Chouteau, Okla., and knew that it was  tainted, contended the agency has no responsibility.  </P></p>

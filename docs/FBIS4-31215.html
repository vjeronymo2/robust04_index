			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  returned from Geneva to Sarajevo this evening. He stated that  the international mediators have been trying to impose a  take-it-or-leave-it solution by exerting pressure on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that the contact group said it  would put forward its proposal in a week or two. We are not  pleased with the proposal of the territorial division in eastern  Bosnia, and there are no instruments of coercion. Therefore, we  are wondering how any kind of agreement would be implemented,  Silajdzic added. He also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina demanded  that NATO offer guarantees for the implementation of the  agreement and secure Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders in case the  peace agreement is accepted. Bosnia-Herzegovina also demands  specific plans for the return of refugees and clear guarantees  that reconstruction aid will be provided. Silajdzic announced  that members of the contact group would visit Sarajevo in  approximately 10 days to resume negotiations.</p>

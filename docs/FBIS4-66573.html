			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khaled Melhaa: "Large GIA Network Discovered in </F> France" -- first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] Less than six months after a spectacular round-up of  FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] activists in France, the arrest on  21 March of two Algerians, Ahmed Seba and El-Hadj Chaib Eddour,  in the French city of Lille (Nord) has revived debate about the  existence of European rear support bases for Islamist  terrorism...    Paris -- Two thirtyish Algerians, presumed FIS sympathizers,  who were arrested in Lille last Monday were formally charged on  Friday evening with complicity in a terrorist plot and bound  over by Parisian magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere. The Algerians  were in possession of an assault rifle and ammunition (not for  the assault rifle), as well as tracts and false documents, it  was learned from judicial branch sources.    We have also learned there is a lot more to the story than  suggested by that terse 25 March dispatch: in fact, the  discovery of the first GIA [Armed Islamic Group] in France.  Disturbing and incredible as it may seem, no one--not the DST  [Directorate of Territorial Security], the antiterrorist section  of the Paris PJ [Judicial Police], the 6th Central Directorate  of the Judicial Police [DCPJ] responsible for counterterrorism  nationwide; not even the DGSE [General Directorate for External  Security] or the Algerian intelligence services--knew of the  existence of such a terrorist ring. Some time ago, on 9 November  1993, 75 Islamists were arrested in various parts of France,  among them prominent FIS leaders residing in France such as  Moussa Kraouche and Djaafar El-Houari, leaders of the Algerian  Fraternity in France (FAF), as well as Ahmed Simozrag, currently  under house arrest, an attorney for FIS leaders incarcerated in  Algiers.    The latter was the subject of an expulsion order signed by  the Ministry of Interior on 9 November 1993. The decision to  place him under house arrest was made after he refused to pick a  destination country, Algeria for example. That police operation  set off panic in Islamist circles in France, as well as a  political and media outcry. French Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur said the day of the arrests that "the round-up of FIS  leaders and sympathizers in France... should serve as a warning  to all and sundry...that in France, everyone must obey the laws."    For his part, French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua issued  a strong warning to Islamists that "the government will not  tolerate the growth of subversive activity in France, under  whatever pretext, and we will put an end to it."    Thus the French Government, which thought it had put the  Islamist menace behind it, discovers now to its consternation  that Islamist activists seem to have paid little heed to those  warnings. But Islamists were already known to be implicated in  various trafficking activities, including narcotics, that serve  to finance activities of the terrorist groups in Algeria and in  Europe.    This particular story goes back to December, when the  investigative division of the police security branch [RG] in  Paris and the Lille PJ began their separate sleuthing. The Paris  RG was on the trail of a GIA support network, while the Lille PJ  was investigating a heroin trafficking ring that was smuggling 4  kg per month of the drug from the Netherlands into northern  France.    On 21 March at about 1700, the PJ squad in Lille arrested 18  members of the network, which had been using for its base of  operations the "El Djazair" cafe, which was located at 15 Rue de  la Cle in Lille's old town and owned by a 67-year-old Algerian,  Mohamed Bougrioua. Forty-eight hours later, Mrs. Catherine  Fontaine, examining magistrate with the Lille public  prosecutor's office, signed committal orders for nine of those  apprehended, including the cafe owner and Messrs. Adji, Djouab,  and Amireche (aged 22, 24, and 30, respectively), on drug  charges.    Hundreds of grams of heroin were seized in police searches  that also brought to light links between the GIA network and a  big criminal ring specializing in fabrication of forged Algerian  identity documents.    Nine members of that ring had been arrested in a raid about  twenty days earlier but were released for "lack of evidence."    The work of the investigative divisions of the RG in Paris  and Nord led to the discovery of 511 blank Algerian national  identity cards and 606 national service cards (bearing the stamp  of the High Commissioner's National Service Office [HCSN]) at  the Lille residence of a 39-year-old Algerian "student," El-Hadj  Chaib Eddour. These ANP [People's National Army] documents had  already been placed in envelopes bearing names and addresses of  the intended recipients in Algeria. According to our sources,  the list of these names was passed to Algerian authorities. Also  arrested was Ahmed Seba, a 28-year-old Frenchman of Algerian  origin. He quickly confessed and said he had been induced, by  threats of reprisals against loved ones in France and Algeria,  to deliver the documents to Chaib Eddour's domicile at the  behest of one Chemellal Boudjellal, a GIA Islamist now a  fugitive from justice.    Boudjellal, born in Mascara in November 1966, is also said  to  have given Ahmed Seba an assault rifle of Israeli manufacture  (Galil) found during the search of the latter's domicile in  Persant-Beaumont, on the northern outskirts of Paris; inspectors  from the 6th DCPJ found munitions, plus--once again!--hundreds  of blank Algerian identity cards and certificates issued by the  army's HCSN.    Police also found GIA documents sent from London and  addressed to one Aymar Elachir, various postal transfer  documents, some cash, and rubber stamps bearing the name of an  ANP officer. According to our sources, the false papers were  intended for GIA members returning from Afghanistan and for  elements of the same terrorist group in Algeria.    The search also turned up a connection between Ahmed Seba  and  Larbi Beddiaf, who was charged on 12 November with conspiring in  a terrorist plot: A copy of the judicial order was found in  Seba's residence in Persant-Beaumont.    This sweep was the largest ever mounted by French police  against a "dormant network" of Islamist operatives in France.  Ahmed Seba and Chaib Eddour--both unknown, we emphasize, to  either French or Algerian security services--have been bound  over by examining magistrate Jean Louis Bruguiere, who  frequently handles terrorist cases. The two suspects were  charged on 25 March with "conspiracy to engage in terrorist  action, violation of the weapons laws, falsification of official  documents, and utilization of falsified documents." An  international look-out bulletin has been issued for Chemellal  Boudjellal, who French police say is the "brains" behind the GIA  in northern Europe.    Unlike the November police sweep against Islamists residing  in France, this affair has been handled very quietly by French  authorities. The new approach suggests that the implantation of  Islamists in France and Europe may be more extensive than  previously thought.</p>

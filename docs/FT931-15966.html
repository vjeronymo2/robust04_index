			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Pioneer shakes Japanese faith in jobs-for-life system MANAGERS at Pioneer Electronic, the Japanese maker of compact disc players and video equipment, have discovered that the country's famed lifetime employment system is under threat from a new product, compulsory early retirement. Like most other leading Japanese companies, Pioneer had already trimmed capital and advertising spending. It has now told 35 senior managers to retire or face dismissal. Pioneer's move creates a precedent for other Japanese managers, who consider the last years in office to be the most enjoyable. The successful cherish the view from atop the corporate hierarchy, while the less successful are known as mado-giwa-zoku, literally, the window-sitting tribe, who spend their final years in blissful irrelevance. But recession has amended the terms of Japan's social contract. Pioneer says the 35 section chiefs and department heads, some as young as 50, were selected because the company needs to promote younger, more vital managers, and cannot afford to carry the window-sitters. 'A few days ago, these managers would have been looking forward to a comfortable last few years. Now they are told the company doesn't want them. Who will be next?' said an employee. In trimming staff, companies have usually targeted part-time workers and women, as both groups tend not to be unionised and are generally thought to be excluded from the lifetime employment system. But the continuing domestic slowdown, reflected in a 48.8 per cent fall in interim operating profits at Pioneer, has forced further job cuts. The 35, who had presumed that they would be employed until their 60th birthdays, will be given between 12 and 24 months' salary in compensation if they accept the offer by the end of this month. If not, they face dismissal. Managers at two other Japanese electronics makers, NEC and Sanyo Electric, have already done their bit for their companies by accepting a portion of their year-end bonus in vouchers which could be swapped for a television or a rice cooker.

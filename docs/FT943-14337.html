			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Nigerian court blocks bail for Abiola Mr Moshood Abiola, the winner of an annulled Nigerian presidential election last year, was refused bail yesterday on a technicality and faces trial for treason on July 28, as oil workers rejected claims by the military government that the strike which is bringing Lagos, the commercial capital, to a standstill was easing. The judge in a recently created High Court in the capital Abuja ruled out Mr Abiola's bail request, which was made orally, as he said it should have been in writing. Mr Abiola was arrested last month for declaring himself president one year after his election victory was overturned. The millionaire Mr Abiola, who looked sickly and frequently coughed in court, complained about the poor cells in which he was being kept. Oil workers on strike in southern Nigeria are protesting against the actions of the military government, and are also critical of the state's lack of investment in the oil industry. The main producers of Nigeria's output of up to 2m barrels a day of crude oil say they are maintaining output but that, without key staff, they are 'limping along'. The government claimed yesterday that the key Warri branch of Pengassan, the senior staff union, was ending its strike, although this was denied by Pengassan's head office in Lagos. The strike has stopped the Warri terminal producing natural gas for Nigeria's four thermal power stations in southern Nigeria. The plants have all stopped working and there is no mains electricity in the south-west. Supplies of diesel in the region are also running out as offices, factories and homes rely on back-up generators. Filling stations are nearly all dry and fuel is selling with a mark up of 1,000 per cent on the black market. In northern and eastern Nigeria supplies of fuel are normal but, although reaching Lagos harbour, the strike prevents supplies being distributed into the city. A split appears to have emerged between northern and southern members of Pengassan. The Kaduna refinery in the north is not on strike but is not receiving crude oil from Warri. At the country's main refinery in Port Harcourt, workers of northern origin are considering staying at work while those from the south propose to strike. Two northern branches of the Nigeria Labour Congress ruled out a political strike ahead of next Tuesday's vote by the executive of the congress on a general strike in support of the oil workers.</p>

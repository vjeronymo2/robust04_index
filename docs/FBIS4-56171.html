			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Text] Havana, 1 May (PL) -- Statistics may be cold facts,  but figures revealed today during a special session of the local  parliament resulted in heated debates over how to improve Cuba's  internal finances.    A large number of parliamentary members spoke in favor of  the  proposals submitted by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister of finance  and prices, who outlined what may be collected by the state to  achieve the liquidity the economy requires through an increase  in tax collection.    The minister emphasized the need to have healthy finances,  the lack of which presents the greatest obstacle to improving  the Cuban economy.    Following the statements made after thousands of meetings  were held throughout the country earlier this year at the  so-called parliaments in the workplace, deputies endorsed the  elimination of certain benefits, as well as the implementation  of formulas to encourage savings.    The plenary session was encouraged by the report that  outstanding debts among enterprises dropped 11.3 percent in the  first quarter.    The reduction of 1 billion pesos (equal to the dollar at the  official exchange rate) in this year's budget, determined by the  government, was taken as an example of the implementation of  recommendations issued within the consultation process begun  months ago.    There was a consensus among speakers that none of the  proposed measures per se will work miracles if they are not  accompanied by increased production and economic efficiency.    Another general idea that prevails among parliamentary  members is the need to strengthen the national currency, to  encourage work and productivity, and to progressively recover  the role of the salary.    According to the analysis, this entails a gradual increase  in  the offering of assets and services to predetermined groups,  along with measures to encourage workers in priority areas.    Benefits were also questioned, and special emphasis was  placed on the educational character of charging for certain  services that are offered free or at nominal fees to the  population.    While the debates continue, the search for solutions is  still  the main concern of the 551 parliamentary members.    The goal is to overcome the country's difficult economic  situation, which was characterized by a monetary surplus of  approximately 11.636 billion pesos at the end of March and a  budget deficit of approximately 4.2 billion.</p>

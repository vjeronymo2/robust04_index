			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTS TALKS IN MOSCOW GET REAGAN'S OK  </P> <P> President Reagan has approved U.S. participation in a controversial  international conference on human rights to be held in Moscow in 1991, thus  eliminating the last major roadblock to a new set of East-West arms  negotiations, Administration officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Reagan's decision came at the recommendation of Secretary of State George P.  Shultz, who is expected to take part later this month in issuing an East-West  declaration in Vienna authorizing the Moscow conference and proclaiming an  enhanced list of internationally accepted freedoms.  </P> <P> U.S. agreement to hold a human rights conference in the Soviet capital would  represent the Reagan Administration's strongest endorsement yet of Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's internal reforms. Some human rights groups  strongly disapprove of U.S. participation.  </P> <P> Approval of the Vienna declaration by the 35 nations that have been working on  it for two years is expected to lead to convening much-awaited East-West  negotiations early this year on phased reductions of the massive armies that  have faced each other in Europe since the onset of the Cold War four decades  ago.  </P> <P> Administration officials said President-elect George Bush and his designated  secretary of state and national security adviser, James A. Baker III and Brent  Scowcroft, were consulted in advance. Reagan's decision is scheduled to be  announced by the White House in Los Angeles this morning.  </P> <P> An official said that Bush was consulted at "every step in the process" and is  fully behind the decision, which includes conditions on Soviet conduct that  would allow the new President to reverse course before 1991 if the Soviets  backtrack.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DeConcini Declined  </P> <P> Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security  and Cooperation in Europe, said through a spokesman that Shultz telephoned him  Tuesday seeking his concurrence with the decision to approve the Moscow  conference but that he declined. DeConcini's view is that about 80 more  long-term refuseniks who have been seeking to emigrate from the Soviet Union  should be allowed to leave before the United States accepts the Moscow  conference, his spokesman said.  </P> <P> A number of U.S. human rights groups are also expected to protest the  Administration's position, on grounds that the Soviets should be required to  take additional actions on outstanding human rights cases before the West  agrees to participate in the Moscow conference.  </P> <P> The State Department, in a statement read Friday by spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley,  set the stage for Shultz's recommendation and Reagan's decision by declaring  that "the Soviet Union has taken a number of significant, positive actions on  human rights in recent months."  </P> <P> Oakley mentioned the release of more than 600 political prisoners in the past  two years, including all Helsinki-process human rights "monitors" who were  being held and "all prisoners known to us who were charged under political or  religious articles of the Soviet criminal code."  </P> <P> She also cited the settlement of all but about a dozen U.S.-Soviet  family-reunification cases, a sharp increase in Jewish, Armenian, German and  Pentecostal emigration from the Soviet Union, permission for many long-term  refuseniks to emigrate, cessation of Soviet and Eastern European jamming of  Western radio broadcasts and commitments by Gorbachev to make extensive changes  in Soviet laws and regulations on human rights.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Conditions  </P> <P> Just such Soviet moves were listed by Shultz in an early November letter to  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze setting out U.S. conditions for  participation in the Moscow conference.  </P> <P> The Shultz letter had the general approval of the British and Canadian  governments, which had been nearly as reluctant as Washington to send diplomats  to a rights meeting held by the Soviets in Moscow.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze proposed a Moscow conference on human rights in his opening  statement to the Vienna negotiations two years ago. And in recent months the  Soviets emphasized the demand for such a meeting.  </P> <P> Besides providing international recognition to its recent steps to improve  human rights at home, conditional Western approval of such a conference could  be used by Gorbachev as a lever for further reforms in his internal maneuvering  with Communist Party conservatives and police agencies, according to U.S. and  some Soviet officials.  </P> <P> In Vienna on Tuesday, nine neutral or nonaligned nations presented a nearly  complete draft of the declaration proposed to be proclaimed by Shultz,  Shevardnadze and others in Jan. 17-19 ceremonies winding up the Vienna  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, a follow-up meeting on the  1975 Helsinki accords.  </P> <P> U.S. sources said the draft calls for greatly enhanced freedoms for Soviet Bloc  citizens to travel; emigrate; circulate and receive information; practice  religion, and reunite with relatives in the West.  </P></p>

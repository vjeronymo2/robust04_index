			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Putting the Names first Sir Hugh Bidwell is to take over from John Church as non-executive chairman of Octavian Group, the Lloyd's agency, in a move which reflects the growing links between the insurance market and the wider business community. Sir Hugh, now 58, spent much of his working life in food manufacturing but has become more involved in City affairs since the mid-1980s and was Lord Mayor of London between 1989 and 1990. A Name at Lloyd's since 1986, Sir Hugh says he would 'prefer to forget' about his own recent underwriting results. Sir Hugh describes his recent losses 'as about the market average', but admits to being concerned by the disastrous performance of one of his syndicates, Bromley 475. He says that losses on the scale suffered by Lloyd's Names between 1988 and 1991 'must never be allowed to happen again' and that Names' interests must be better represented in the market. At Octavian, Sir Hugh says he will remind people 'that the interests of Names come first. The Names are our shareholders.' Octavian was formed in a management buy-out in the mid-1980s and has had a non-executive chairman since 1986. It hopes to benefit particularly from Sir Hugh's experience in exporting. He has successfully marketed products such as Viota cake mix in the United States and is currently chairman of British Invisibles. In addition, Sir Hugh's City connections could prove to be invaluable at a time when all Lloyd's agencies are examining ways in which the market can attract capital from institutional investors and insurance companies. Sir Hugh is also a director at Rothschild Asset Management, and has a desk at the merchant bank's offices.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / De Beers sucks jewels off seabed Seventeen nautical miles off the coast of Namibia, armed with techniques that would not be out of place in a science fiction novel, De Beers is vacuuming diamonds from the seabed 125 metres below. The South African group, which dominates the world's diamond business, is pushing mining technology to the limit, to explore for and recover tens of thousands of very small precious stones scattered across hundreds of square kilometres of seabed. The Debmar Atlantic, a converted oil exploration vessel, has been turned into a floating diamond mine. It sucks up tonnes of material a minute from which the diamonds are sorted. Then, for security reasons, the diamonds are canned on an automated production line, with technology most commonly used for peaches and pineapple chunks. Each can is filled with a mixture containing up to 1,900 diamonds. De Beers Marine, a wholly owned subsidiary of the group, is the only company operating at these depths. The stones in these Namibian waters are 60m years old and may have travelled 1,500km, washed down the Orange River by thunderous downpours in the Transvaal. To locate the diamonds, De Beers meticulously sampled an area as large as Holland. Only the most durable diamonds survived the trip, according to Mr Graham Rees, DBM's general manager. Nearly every one recovered is of gem quality, which is what makes the considerable expense of fishing them out of the sea worthwhile. DBM has spent about Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) to buy and convert its seven vessels. More than Dollars 50m has been spent exploring since 1991. The Debmar Atlantic uses a huge drill to get at the stones. A short helicopter hop away its sister vessel, the Louis G Murray, is using an under-sea robot crawler, as big as a truck, with hydraulic drills operated electronically from the ship. Last year DBM sucked up 302,754 carats of diamonds from the sea bed, 16 per cent more than in 1992. This year the seabed is likely to yield even more carats, according to Mr Rees. It is impossible to say how much the seabed diamonds are worth but DBM's production last year was about a third of Namibia's diamond output in carats and more than that in value.

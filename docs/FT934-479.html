			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Argentine equities meet violence with equanimity - John Barham on a lucrative Buenos Aires bourse A week ago, rioting broke out in one of Argentina's northern provinces. In a matter of hours, rioters took control of the city of Santiago del Estero, burning and pillaging as they went. It was Argentina's worst day of violence since hyperinflation brought looting to a number of the country's big cities in July 1989. Yet the next day, with the dramatic images still fresh in the minds of investors in Argentina, and around the world, share prices rallied with a respectable, 2 per cent gain. There are a number of explanations. One may be the firm response of the country's president, Mr Carlos Menem, who flew back the same day from a state visit to the Vatican, ordered security forces to reimpose control and refused to allow the uprising to blow his economic reforms off course. Another is that, as in other markets in Latin America, equities in Buenos Aires were also lifted by with a inflow of international funds. Argentina, too, is still widely viewed as one of the world's most exciting emerging countries. It has a rapidly developing equity market, which offers easy and increasingly representative exposure to a fast-growing economy. It also has currency stability, with the peso tied to the US dollar. The bulls continue to be rewarded. This week the market has been climbing steadily after idling for most of the month. So far this year the Merval market index has risen by a quarter and the IFC Argentine index is up by 55 per cent, both in local currency and in dollar terms. This seems a fair reward for dabbling in explosive Latin American risks. In London the FT-SE 100-share index has risen 17 per cent this year and in New York the Dow has seen a 14 per cent advance. Inevitably, the Merval's advance masks far more interesting shifts in individual stocks. Mr Christopher Ecclestone, a Buenos Aires equity analyst, says Swiss-owned cement company Holderbank's equity stake and management contract in Corcemar, an Argentine cement-maker, has transformed this into the market's hottest company, with a 300 per cent price rise this year. Yet he is still estimating Corcemar's prospective p/e, to June 1994, at 14. Banco Shaw, a small retail bank taken over by Spain's Banesto, has put in a 250 per cent share price increase. Banks are expected to make big profits from the embryonic mortgage lending business. Yet Shaw's prospective, calendar 1994 p/e is only 12. Even the top-ranking companies in the sector, Banco Frances and Banco Galicia, which have seen very strong advances all year, remain relatively cheap. At the other extreme, Argentina's two highly profitable telephone companies, Telecom and Telefonica, are both considered overpriced after gains of 22 per cent this month. The steelmaker, Acindar, hit by unexpected recent losses and a government investigation into trading and accounting irregularities, is also deemed expensive. Siderca, another steel company, and Celulosa a pulp company, are mired in losses. The market is seeing an increasing number of initial public offerings. On Tuesday, Citicorp, the US bank, began floating off a minority stake in CEI, its Argentine investment vehicle, which holds stakes in 12 companies, mainly privatised utilities. The government floated its remaining stakes in two privatised power stations in December. One of them, Central Costanera, saw its share price rise to a premium of almost 20 per cent over its offer price on the first day of trading. In June, the government sold 45 per cent of YPF, the national oil company, raising Dollars 3.04bn. YPF, now the most active stock in Buenos Aires, initially showed a steep rise but it has now settled down to a trading range around Dollars 25, one-third above its flotation price. Speculators who made a killing in YPF are giving way to program traders playing the arbitrage market between New York and Buenos Aires. By one estimate, about Dollars 80m in YPF arbitrage takes place every day. The development of more adventurous derivative instruments is still being thwarted by a limited range of actively traded stocks, a poorly-designed market index and shortage of sophisticated players. And in spite of the market's steady growth, private companies are resisting the attractions of cheap equity funding. They prefer to raise equally cheap debt in overseas markets whenever possible. As in most other Latin countries, Argentine companies remain famously averse to opening up to outsiders.</p>

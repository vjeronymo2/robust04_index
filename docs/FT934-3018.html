			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone drops to Pounds 0.4m but relief lifts shares 9p Hartstone Group, the hosiery and leathergoods company which is in refinancing talks after breaching banking covenants this summer, suffered a sharp drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 428,000 in the first half. The return was struck on a 14 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 185m (Pounds 162m), partly due to acquisitions. Profits were also depressed by a Pounds 179,000 currency loss, against a Pounds 3.4m gain previously. The shares rose 9p on the news of the results, which were prepared on a going concern basis, to close at 42p. The dividend is passed. Earnings fell from 6.7p to 0.3p. Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman appointed by banks in June, said refinancing talks were well advanced. He expected to make an announcement before the January 16 deadline for the standstill agreement. He would not comment on details of the talks. However, it is thought that Hartstone is already negotiating the sale of part of its business with potential buyers as part of the refinancing. A debt for equity swap is believed to be unlikely. The company, which grew rapidly via acquisitions in the US and Europe, suffered from severe competition in the European hosiery markets in the first half and supply difficulties arising from its financing problems. Mr Dowling said Hartstone had improved significantly since August by ceasing promotional activity, improving supply to supermarkets and pushing its three brands, Bear in the UK, Marie Claire in Spain and Well in France. The leathergoods division was fuelled by strong growth from Etienne Aigner, which improved margins from 32.9 per cent to 39 per cent. COMMENT The shares rose yesterday on relief that Hartstone had just squeaked by with a profit and even appeared more confident about its survival than in recent months. There is also likely to be a faint attraction on the dividend front for shareholders when and if the refinancing is concluded. But it is still too early to allow Hartstone off the speculative list. The refinancing is not complete and questions remain over how much Hartstone will have to sell to get off the hook. Furthermore, the price war in hosiery is far from over in continental Europe and the grim comments from Courtaulds Textiles leave many wondering how the struggling Hartstone can buck the trend. Forecasts range from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m pre-tax for a multiple of between 13.5 and 16. Which ever way one looks at it, this is not a stock for the faint hearted.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Rebels snub PM's call to concede: Chance of permanent split between government and nine Tories The prospect of a permanent split between the government and nine Tory Euro-rebels suspended from the parliamentary party was raised for the first time yesterday after the group rejected Mr John Major's demand for an end to the rebellion. As the Commons rose for the Christmas recess, senior ministers said Mr Major would stand by his insistence in a Financial Times interview that the rebels must back the government for several months to regain the party whip. But Mr Tony Marlow, a key organiser of the group, advised the prime minister to declare a Christmas truce. 'If he does not do that there is a risk that the momentum of circumstances will almost formalise the split,' he told BBC radio. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said it was time for Mr Major to end the suspension, imposed after eight of the rebels voted against higher UK contributions to the EU. A ninth MP resigned the whip shortly afterwards. 'The grown-up thing to do is for the teacher, in this case John Major, to say 'that is enough',' Mrs Gorman said on BBC radio. 'It is for John to say to us that we have gone past that particular incident.' The increasingly hard tone adopted by the rebels was interpreted at Westminster as a signal that they are determined to act as a separate group within the Conservative party in the hope of forcing the prime minister to negotiate. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary and a leading cabinet Euro-sceptic, sought to play down the split, insisting there was 'no doubt at all that we shall fight the next election as a united party'. However, other ministers said Mr Major would not back down because of the fear that an early reconciliation would be seen as weakness that would prompt further indiscipline. Conservative whips hope the government's unambitious legislative programme for the remainder of the parliamentary session will deprive the rebels of the opportunity of further revolts. Mr Marlow's comments followed a blistering attack on Mr Major by Mr Michael Carttiss, the MP for Great Yarmouth, who accused the prime minister of abandoning manifesto commitments to curb European Union spending. In a further embarrassment for ministers, Mr William Cash, the MP for Stafford, in a letter to The Times, delivered a swingeing attack on the government's handling of the rebellion. Mr Cash, one of the most prominent Eurosceptics to have retained the Tory whip, strongly defended the loyalty of the rebels and accused the government of repeated errors. Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, accused the opposition of 'dirty tricks' after Labour released copies of a speech in which Mr Major allegedly admitted to party workers the the government was 'at a low ebb'. Labour later accepted Mr Hanley's assurance that the speech was a forgery.</p>

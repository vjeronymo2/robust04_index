			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / End of recession insight, says Major MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, insisted yesterday that Britain was emerging from recession after a bleak day for job loss announcements. Mr Major's view appeared to be supported by a new Confederation of British Industry survey which suggested that manufacturers may be starting to reap the benefit of sterling's devaluation and lower interest rates. The announcement by Imperial Chemical Industries of 4,500 job cuts in the UK was followed by 2,400 job losses at British Gas and 6,500 redundancies in the British army under the second phase of the Options for Change plan. In Washington, Mr Major said after meeting President Bill Clinton that Britain was moving out of recession. He blamed the recession's 'painful kickback' for yesterday's spate of job losses. However, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's shadow trade secretary, warned it was 'a serious possibility that within this parliament the government could end up with more people out of work than are employed in manufacturing industry'. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, yesterday urged the government to develop urgently an industrial policy to restore the UK's economic strength. He attacked previous Conservative governments for 'sidestepping' the issue of industrial policy during the 1980s. It was a 'myth' that services could generate the wealth the country needed to survive, he said in a speech to the Executive Association of Great Britain. The CBI's latest monthly industrial trends survey found that manufacturers' order books, though still depressed, were at their best levels for 2 1/2 years. Manufacturers reported improved output expectations for the fourth month running in January, indicating that the easing of UK monetary conditions since September was enhancing their competitiveness. For the second consecutive month, manufacturers indicated that they expected to increase output in the next four months. Export orders also improved compared with January, suggesting that the devaluation may now be helping to raise demand from foreign customers. A separate survey of worldwide business opinion by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, found a marked jump in optimism about profits and sales among UK executives while optimism in France, Germany and Japan slumped.

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / What is left of the British 'economic miracle'? IN the midst of the current recession, all that talk of four years ago about a 'British economic miracle' seems a delusion, one triggered by a powerful economic drug, easy credit. But a recent survey, published by the Treasury, suggests that neither the euphoria of a few years ago nor the despair of today is entirely justified.* The 1980s did see creditable achievements, but ones that were in part thrown away. The years 1979 and 1989 were the peaks of two successive cycles. Between those years, UK gross domestic product grew at 2.2 per cent a year, less than between 1960 and 1973, when growth was 3.2 per cent, but more than the 1.5 per cent achieved between 1973 and 1979. UK growth in the 1980s was marginally more than in the EC as a whole, though less than in the US, which managed 2.8 per cent, and in Japan, which achieved 4 per cent. Productivity growth in the whole economy shows a similar picture. The UK's 1.8 per cent growth of labour productivity between 1979 and 1989 was up with European levels and ahead of the US, which achieved a mere 1.1 per cent a year, but behind Japan's 2.9 per cent. Again, what was remarkable was the deterioration of others; Japan's annual rate of productivity growth had been 8.1 per cent between 1960 and 1973 and Italy's 5.8 per cent. Not to fall further behind was an achievement of a kind, but no cause for ecstasy, but in manufacturing, where labour productivity was (and is) still further behind levels achieved in more successful economies than elsewhere in the British economy, the UK started to catch up, as shown in the top chart. Labour productivity in manufacturing rose 4.8 per cent a year between 1979 and 1989. This was not only vastly better than the 1.1 per cent registered between 1973 and 1979, but also better than the 3.4 per cent of 1960-73. UK performance was behind that of Japan, which managed 5.4 per cent, but well above Germany's 1.8 per cent (no Wirtschaftswunder here), France's 3.2 per cent and Italy's 4 per cent. What caused the improvement? Not investment, it appears, nor closure of inefficient capacity. What mattered most was greater flexibility and efficiency in companies. Just how much that can mean is shown in the second chart. Notice in particular how the overmanned and slothful public enterprise behemoths, most now privatised, increased labour productivity by 70 per cent between 1979-80 and 1988-89. UK manufacturing did become fitter, but output rose by only 12.3 per cent, from peak to cyclical peak. Yet one would expect a sector enjoying a global market and achieving a high rate of growth of productivity to grow quickly, absorbing a high proportion of investment in the process. UK manufacturing did not. From 27 per cent of business investment in 1979, its share declined to 19 per cent in 1989. Presumably, manufacturing did not grow more because it was not profitable enough. Profitability was ground between the nether millstone of rapid rises in real wages, averaging 2.7 per cent a year between 1979 and 1989, and the upper millstone of international competition. Lower growth in the real cost of labour would have raised the return on capital and stimulated more - and more - labour-absorbing investment, both of which were needed in a high unemployment economy. In the 1990s, productivity growth needs to flow more strongly into profits, which still appear low by international standards. Remarkably, in view of the recession, labour productivity in manufacturing rose 5 per cent between the third quarter of 1990 and last July, but the rise in real earnings, still more than 2 per cent a year, has eroded much of the benefit for profitability. Similarly, there will be no contribution to competitiveness from last month's depreciation of sterling if it is offset by another wave of wage inflation. Productivity growth is excellent, but higher growth of output depends on the course of wages and profits as well. * Supply Side Performance in the 1980s, Treasury bulletin, summer 1992.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.</p>

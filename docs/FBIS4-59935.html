			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh </F> Na'im Qasim by unidentified CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Correspondent] How does Hizballah view recent  developments in the Christian arena in general, and specifically  the detention of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Ja'ja'?    [Qasim] The files that were opened recently--files that had  to do with the party behind the Sayyidat al-Najat  explosion--were justified by the circumstances that almost  disrupted civil peace and did a great service to the Israeli  enemy. We are not in a position of authority that would allow  us to opens other people's files. We do not think anyone in the  authority can distanced himself from these old files; once  opened, these files will involve everyone without exception. I  do not think that it is proper to do this at time when the civil  war has ended and peace is returning. I think that there must  be a distinction between a specific incident or group of  incidents that pose a threat to modern Lebanon and things that  happened years ago. The files of these years have been closed.  Opening them would have a negative effect and will not achieve a  sound result, in my view.    [Correspondent] Some people say that lifting the  international cover of the Lebanese Forces will also lead to  lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly the Syrian and Iranian  protection, because of the party's links to the foreign hostages  issue. What is your reaction to that?    [Qasim] The circumstances that made eyes focus on the  Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only  local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the  Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not  apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the  Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread  peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did  not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it  got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the  blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause,  but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free  people in the Arab and Muslim worlds.    Hizballah cannot be the object of a decision that some  official makes behind his desk on a personal whim. Hizballah's  roots at the popular and political levels, its relations at the  local and regional levels, and its sincerity in confronting the  Israeli enemy give it a kind of organic immunity that prevents  anyone from gambling with it. We are not a bunch of isolated  partisan offices; we are a deeply-rooted popular movement known  to all responsible leaders in this country.    As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in  the  past that we have absolutely no connection with that file.  There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled  the ramifications of that issue at the time. The files that  should be opened are those hot issues that concern the citizens,  including social services, preventing sedition, the right of the  opposition express its views, and freedom for the media. These  files should be opened instead of files from the past that could  confuse things or seek to settle accounts with some people.    As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover  for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether  the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been  lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with  Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from  the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the  international level, because we do not tolerate the continued  occupation of our lands.    [Correspondent] How does Hizballah view the hangings and  the recent executions in Lebanon?    [Qasim] Islamic shari'ah says that a killer should be  executed if he murders deliberately. This is to deter  criminals. We in Hizballah back the idea of executions, of  hanging premeditated murderers until the criminals are deterred  and in order not to make crime an easy option.    [Correspondent] Some believe that things will get worse if  the domestic situation keeps on its current course. How does  Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files?    [Qasim] We understand the meaning of balances of rights and  duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we do not  understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with the  guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same measures that  were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have been taken  against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That horrible  act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have to pay  the price for harming people, violating a place of worship, and  terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But opening files  in every direction is not an objective measure; it ruins  Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public peace  must be punished. But settling accounts or seeking to control  things one way or another under the banner of the authority or  anything else is totally unacceptable.    When, after members of the Lebanese Forces were arrested on  charges of blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, the Lebanese  Forces party was dissolved and the decision made to suspend  radio and television newscasts, we said this was a mistake and  futile, short-sighted measures because taking vengeance on the  audiovisual media and settling accounts with the opposition on  the pretext of punishing those who blew up the church reflects a  narrow-minded outlook and a domineering tendency to silence  every opposition voice in the country. Such a measure can never  succeed. We are the only state in the region that is accustomed  to responsible and candid freedom of expression. We back any  political practice that refrains from using force to impose some  party's views on others. Let us all compete to win grassroots  support. Whoever manages to apply the available peaceful  methods assumes a certain status and plays a certain role in the  service of the Lebanese citizen, provided that force is not used  to disrupt security or impose one's views on others as a way of  putting pressure on the masses.    The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have  to  do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The  bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as  part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties  dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led  to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration  among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular.  Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in  Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation  requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis  of actual developments. These developments require an  Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.</p>

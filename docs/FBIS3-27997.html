			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 2 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei Kono  urged Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [2 February]  to implement a 15 trillion yen economic stimulus package. Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that  Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), explained  his party's economy-spurring program adopted Tuesday.    Hosokawa replied that he will try to reflect the LDP's ideas  as far as possible in the government's stimulus package his  cabinet is to approve Thursday, Takemura said. The additional  economic program is expected to amount to 15 trillion to 16  trillion yen, becoming Japan's largest pump-primer ever.    Earlier, Kono told reporters after emerging from talks with  the premier, "I emphasized it would be a disaster if meaningful  and substantial stimulus steps were not taken this time," he  added.    During the 90-minute meeting, Hosokawa and Kono agreed on  the  need for a successful Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on  February 11, Takemura said. Hosokawa will meet U.S. President  Bill Clinton to assess progress in stalemated bilateral trade  talks.    Although the LDP chief pressed a demand for a large-scale  income tax cut to breathe new life into the stagnant economy,  there was no discussion on how to offset the tax reduction,  Takemura said.    The government and ruling coalition parties are making  last-ditch efforts to reach a consensus over whether to link a  major income tax cut to a future hike in the consumption tax.    Hosokawa was accompanied by Foreign Minister and Deputy  Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and  Takemura.    Kono attended the meeting along with Ryutaro Hashimoto,  chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs Research Council.    Hosokawa and Kono concurred they will hold informal talks in  the future, as the need arises, Takemura said.    The premier said he would like to meet again with Kono after  returning from the United States to discuss the results of the  meeting with Clinton, according to the chief cabinet secretary.  Kono gave no clear response, Takemura said.    The LDP leader told reporters he will hold talks with the  premier if he thinks it will be "meaningful," adding he has no  plan to meet with Hosokawa on a regular basis.    Whether he will meet again with the premier, Kono said,  depends on how much the LDP's economic stimulus program is  reflected in the government's package.</p>

The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and  Human Rights in South Korea in a statement charged that after  seating himself in the "presidential" chair, Kim Yong-sam has  refused to dismantle the "Security Planning Board," a  suppressive machine, and kept the fascist laws including the  "National Security Law."    Television No. 2 of France said that the present South  Korean "regime", under the mask of "civilian politics,"  continues repressing the people as under the military fascist  rule.    The Cuban magazine BOHEMIA said:    "The South Korean people demanded that Kim Yong-sam restore  democracy, end the fascist rule, clean up all manner of  corruption and fling open the door of reunification. But he  refused to do so and he is not a man fit for such things".    The Rwandan Committee for Supporting the Reunification of  Korea in a statement said the South Korean authorities showed  that the present government under the "civilian" veil was a  military fascist "regime" when they let loose the repressive  force and blocked the fourth pan-national rally.    A delegate of the International Association Against Torture  demanded that the South Korean authorities immediately scrap the  "National Security Law" and unconditionally release the innocent  people.</p>

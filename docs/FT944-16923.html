			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Argent to redevelop landmark office site Argent Group yesterday announced plans to redevelop a 120,000 sq ft office site in the City of London in a Pounds 17.4m deal. Midland Bank, which owns the freehold to the site and rents the building - Suffolk House in EC4 - at Pounds 1.25m a year from Argent, is to pay the sum to free itself from the 40-year lease. Argent said the price represented a 35 per cent increase on the amount it paid for the lease 18 months ago. Argent has also acquired, for a nominal Pounds 1, an option to buy the freehold on the site from Midland, which no longer occupies the building. Mr Michael Freeman, Argent's joint chief executive, said the company would 'almost definitely' be proceeding with the purchase and development if planning permission were granted within the next few weeks. 'There is only one other building of Grade A office space over 100,000 sq ft left in the City. The race is on to provide this kind of accommodation. I doubt if any building of this grade will come in at a rent of below Pounds 40 per sq ft in 1997.' Mr Freeman said that even at only Pounds 37.50 per sq ft and a 6.5 per cent yield, the development would be worth more than Pounds 70m. Argent is to repay loans of Pounds 10.4m secured on the Suffolk House lease. The net cash addition from yesterday's deal will come to Pounds 7m. Analysts agree that rent rises have started to stick for high-quality central London office space, but disagree over how quickly sustained growth will come through. Recent evidence from the Investment Property Databank suggests that an excess of available space continues to hang over the property market and is likely to limit rental rises if not depress them, at least in the short-term. On the other hand, surveyors Richard Ellis and Jones Lang Wootton are forecasting rental growth coming through more strongly next year.</p>

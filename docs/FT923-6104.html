			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC Yesterday's interim figures from the Hongkong Bank underline that strong Pacific operations are likely to set it apart from the pack. Asset growth in the Far East is running at an annual rate of 13 per cent, and the return on assets remains respectable. There are still some lingering doubts about the extent of provisioning for Olympia &amp; York, but loan losses across the group appear to be under control despite the influx of new business in Hong Kong. Even so, pro forma consolidation of Midland shows just how dilutive the acquisition will be: earnings per share fall from 21p to 14.4p on consolidation, and the tier I capital ratio drops from 9.4 per cent to 6.4 per cent.</p>

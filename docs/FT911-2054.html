			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / IMF/World Bank Washington 1991: Developing countries warned on arms spending DEVELOPING countries have been given a clear warning that excessive spending on arms could count against their obtaining financial support from the industrialised world, Peter Norman writes. For the first time, the contentious issue of high military spending in the third world was included in the final communique of the Development Committee, which brings together industrial and developing countries to advise the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on development issues. The communique said the committee 'emphasised the need to re-examine the possible reallocation of public expenditures, including excessive military expenditures, to increase their impact on poverty reduction.' In practice, this convoluted form of words means that bodies such as the IMF and World Bank will examine closely the level of military spending when discussing economic support programmes with third world nations. Mr Barber Conable, World Bank president, admitted that security matters raised issues of national sovereignty and that military spending was not a fiscal issue in the strict sense. But he added that excessive military spending did have fiscal consequences and this justified the bank raising the question. He was especially concerned by cases where military spending in developing nations exceeded outlays on health and education. 'Quite frankly, that raises interesting questions about their long-term development potential if they are neglecting the human resources element in the interest of such excessive military spending,' he said. Mr Conable will soon step down as World Bank president. But his forthright remarks echoed a rising tide of concern following the Gulf war about the arms build-up in third world countries. During Tuesday's committee meeting, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, said all arms exporters must now adopt a responsible approach to the supply of arms overseas. In a paper prepared for a World Bank conference on development economics last week, Mr Robert McNamara, the former World Bank president, highlighted instances where developing countries had spent far more on the military than on health and education.</p>

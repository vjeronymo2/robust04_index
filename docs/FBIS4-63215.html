			<p>BFN     [Text] Col-Gen [Vladimir] Semenov, commander in chief of  ground forces, said the recent talks in Moscow on the Karabakh  conflict must be regarded as abortive as the Azerbaijanis have  failed to sign the final document. A similar assessment was  already made by Col-Gen [Yevgeniy] Podkolzin, commander of  airborne forces. He also believes airborne forces cannot be  dispatched to the region without the consent of Baku  authorities. However, according to the SNARK agency, Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev does favor the dispatch of  Russian forces to the Karabakh region.</p>

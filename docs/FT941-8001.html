			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Planner warns against 'loosening green belts' Guidelines to strengthen the green belts of rural land encircling some of the largest cities were published yesterday by the government. The consultation document was greeted warily by environmentalists, who fear that the proposals could encourage more development. Mr Tony Burton, senior planner at the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said: 'The government's tinkering with these rules risks loosening the green belt.' Green belts are areas around cities in which permission for new development is tightly restricted. Local authorities are obliged to take the government's guidelines into account when preparing development plans. Mr David Curry, planning minister, launching the revised draft of the planning policy guidance on green belts yesterday, said: 'The changes we have made to the original guidance note are designed to . . . (make) greater allowances for environmental and economic factors and to (address) practical difficulties in operating it.' Mr Curry added that research conducted for the Department of the Environment last year concluded that the rural appearance of land within the green belts was being upheld. Publication of the document follows an attack by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, on 'urban sprawl' and the construction of new shopping centres outside towns. The consultation paper wants 'to permit existing buildings in the green belt to be re-used, whether or not they are redundant, subject to stringent safeguards'. It also recommends that local authorities be allowed to re-use 'pre-war factories and power stations'. The CPRE fears this could open the door to more development of derelict sites in rural areas. It also accused the report of drawing green-belt boundaries too loosely around urban areas. Mr Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said: 'The government's failure to bring in a register of contaminated land, coupled with uncertainty (among bankers, insurers and developers) about the exact situation on liability for pollution means that people have no encouragement to develop derelict land in urban areas.'

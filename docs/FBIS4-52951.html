			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, may 14 KYODO -- The largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will soon submit a no-confidence  motion against Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet, LDP  President Yohei Kono said in an interview published Saturday [14  May].    The once-dominant LDP will submit a no-confidence motion  onto  the floor of the House of Representatives "as the current  administration controls only 40 percent of the House of  Representatives' total seats," Kono told the ASAHI SHIMBUN  newspaper.    Kono, whose LDP lost its 38-year lock on power last August,  said the party will table the motion shortly after the passage  of the long-overdue fiscal 1994 state budget program, now six  weeks behind the start of the new fiscal year. The budget is  widely expected to pass the Diet by the end of June.    The current Diet session ends June 29.    Kono said the LDP, which has 206 seats in the 511-member  chamber, needs the support of its archrival the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan], which has 74 seats, to push the  motion through the lower house with a necessary majority of 256  votes.    "The LDP does not single-handedly have the majority, so it  needs the cooperation with a multiple number of political  parties to exert a decisive influence," he said.    "The LDP wants to collaborate with the Social Democratic  Party... to scuttle the current administration if our two  parties' perceptions of the current power balance coincide," he  said.    However, Kono acknowledged in the interview that there is a  deep gulf between the policies and ideologies of the two  longtime archrival parties.    "Yes, there is a large gap. We need to hold further  discussion within the LDP concerning the advisability of  immediately initiating talks (with the SDP) for reconciling  policy gaps," he said.    Kono said the current political situation would give a  definite advantage to the LDP in what he sees as an imminent  general election, adding that his party prefers to contest it  under the new single-seat constituency system, the daily said.    Kono predicted, however, that Hata may respond to the  motion's passage by disbanding his cabinet en masse and then  having a new premier from the coalition call a general election  under the single- seat constituency system, which first requires  passage of an electoral redistricting bill.</p>

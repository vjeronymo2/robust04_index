			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Tokyo to lose five international listings THE Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) suffered a serious loss of face yesterday when five international companies, including General Motors, Philips Electronics and News Corporation, formally applied for delisting from the exchange. Each of the five companies said a Tokyo listing was too costly to maintain, and complained that trading in their shares, and those of most foreign companies, has fallen over the past two years. The announcements by GM, Philips, News Corp, Avon Products, the US cosmetics and toiletries manufacturer, and FPL Group, the Florida-based utility, dismayed TSE officials, who hoped more foreign companies would consider a Tokyo listing to be necessary to their international profile. 'It's very disappointing. We are not sure whether other foreign companies will delist. We know that some new companies are interested in listing,' said Mr Tsutomu Hirabayashi, director of the TSE's office of listing supervision. The TSE fears that the delisting of such high profile companies will prompt some of the other 119 listed foreign companies to withdraw. Japanese brokers said they were aware of several companies considering an application. GM criticised the cost of maintaining a Tokyo presence, and said the delisting, to take effect at the end of this year, was part of a cost-cutting campaign and 'a result of the very low interest in GM stock' in Tokyo. 'The extraordinary administrative burdens and costs associated with the TSE listing are due primarily to the unique form of reports to be filed under Japanese law and the necessity for preparation of annual reports, quarterly reports and proxy material,' GM said. Mr Paul Mandry, assistant general counsel for Avon, said the annual cost of the Tokyo listing was about Dollars 150,000, though the initial annual cost to the company had been nearer Dollars 500,000. 'This decision is one of a number of cost-cutting measures that Avon has implemented,' he said. Avon also had no plans to raise funds in Tokyo in the near future and did not expect its trading volume to rise. Several of the companies complained of the costs involved in translating documents into Japanese and presenting reports according to Japanese Ministry of Finance specifications, even though their local disclosure requirements are more stringent. However, the collapse of Tokyo stock prices and the resulting decline of investor interest in foreign issues is the most important cause of the delistings. The total of foreign shares traded in Tokyo peaked in 1987 with an average of 2.76m shares traded each day. Daily volume this year is down to an average 475,000 shares. The five companies have also reported a sharp decline in their local shareholders. In GM's case, the number has almost halved since the 3,521 of 1987, and the company said yesterday that the remainder account for 0.02 per cent of all its shareholders. Trading of foreign stocks was permitted in Tokyo in 1973 and, apart from tapping the Tokyo market for finance, companies presumed that a listing would heighten awareness of their products in Japan. The announcements are also a setback for Japanese brokers, which hoped to arrange the listings of foreign companies.</p>

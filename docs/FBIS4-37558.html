			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Ghaylan Accuses Northern </F> Delegation of Evasion To Gain Time"]    [Text] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- In a statement to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil al-Ghaylan, member of  the South Yemen delegation, has accused the Sanaa delegation of  coming to Cairo to waste the UN envoy's time, to gain time, and  to give world public opinion the impression that it is  responding to dialogue.    Al-Ghaylan commended AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, saying that it was  right when it its front-page headline on the eve of the "Cairo  dialogue" said "Collapse of Dialogue Between Two Parties," as  though it is reading the Yemeni war like an open book.    Concerning what the southern delegation conveyed to the UN  envoy, al-Ghaylan, who was Yemen's ambassador to Cairo when the  war broke out, said: We stressed to Brahimi that the main  mission is to discuss a cease-fire in compliance with Resolution  924, which stipulates two points: an immediate halt to the  fighting and then engaging in negotiations without any  conditions. When Brahimi called for dialogue he was seeking to  achieve this.    He said: But the brothers in the north said that the current  dispute is within the framework of the Arab Republic of Yemen  and thus a solution should be within this framework, and that  the military committee should be within the same framework that  existed before the war, or if it is to be expanded, this  expansion should be on a limited scale by accepting the  participation of both Syria and Morocco. He said that he and  the UN envoy believe that there is no point in its [the northern  delegation's] presence, and in addition there is the fact that  the northern delegation to Cairo makes it a condition that  negotiations be held within the framework of the Constitution of  the Republic of Yemen.    Ambassador al-Ghaylan revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the  head of the northern delegation submitted a memorandum from  Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah containing these points,  saying that the north is willing to respond to the Security  Council resolution within the partisan coalition framework that  existed before the war. That is, a solution should be within  the framework of the Republic of Yemen. He adds: The southern  delegation's reply in this context was that the delegation came  to Cairo to sincerely work to secure an immediate halt to the  fighting. But it seems that the north has no desire to bring  about an end to the fighting, and that the aim of their  agreement to attend the meeting is to waste Brahimi's time so  that his report would be delayed.    Ambassador 'Abd-al-Jalil al-Ghaylan said that throughout his  stay in Cairo Brahimi tried to persuade the north that the Arab  Republic of Yemen question can be addressed at a later stage,  and that this is not the time to address it, especially as he  had called for the Cairo meeting to discuss two points: to draw  up a mechanism to halt the fighting and to initiate a dialogue  and negotiations. But the northern delegation did not listen to  Brahimi and submitted Basindwah's memorandum to him.    Concluding his statement, al-Ghaylan said: The outcome of  the Cairo meeting is that the northern delegation refused to  negotiate the terms for a cease-fire and the southern delegation  agreed to halt the fighting first and then engage in a dialogue  and negotiations.</p>

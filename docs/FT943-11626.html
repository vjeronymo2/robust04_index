			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Home loans up 11%, say banks New mortgage lending by banks rose last month, figures from the British Bankers Association showed yesterday. However, the figures suggest that the market is relatively flat compared with last summer. Although the figures do not amount to overwhelming evidence of a strong recovery in the housing market, the association was confident that they were a sign that recent tax rises had not put people off buying homes. The statistics show that new net lending totalled Pounds 888m in June compared with Pounds 535m in May. But after seasonal adjustments, the increase in lending is a more modest 11 per cent - from Pounds 596m to Pounds 664m. Both the adjusted and unadjusted figures are lower than in June last year. Gross loans made last month were slightly higher - at Pounds 1.75bn - than those made last June (Pounds 1.72bn) and than gross lending in May (Pounds 1.58bn). There was also an increase in the number and amount of new mortgages approved in June compared with May - an important forward indicator of loans likely to be made in the coming weeks - but the June figures were broadly in line with those for last year. Last month 33,568 mortgage loans - with a value of Pounds 1.76bn - were approved compared with 30,300 worth Pounds 1.58bn in May. The equivalent figures for June last year were 36,409 loans approved, amounting to Pounds 1.73bn. Mr John Ecklin, director of statistics, emphasised that the percentage increases in new mortgage lending were slightly higher than those reported by building societies last week. He said that although there was a seasonal element to the upturn, 'it now seems reasonably clear that customers and prospective customers have not been deterred by the recent tax rises, as was possibly feared with the weak April figures'.</p>

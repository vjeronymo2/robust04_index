The commission, set up by the president after the October  1993 revolt in Moscow, will inform him about human rights abuses  in the country, commission chairman Sergey Kovalev said on  Thursday.    The commission plans to finish a national human rights  programme by the end of May. The programme has been developed  in cooperation with the Russian Foreign Ministry. The  commission also handles complaints about violations of civil  rights.    Kovalev, who has been appointed by the State Duma a  commissioner on human rights, said that a draft law regulating  the status, rights and duties of the commissioner on human  rights is now being discussed in the Duma Committee for  Legislation.    He believes that after the law has been adopted, the  commission on human rights will have to continue working in  order to keep the president informed about human rights in  Russia.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Molson sale nets Foster ADollars 50m FOSTER'S Brewing Group will realise a pre-tax profit of about ADollars 50m (USDollars 33.5m) on the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Molson Breweries, its Canadian joint venture with Molson Companies of Toronto. The sale, announced in North America on Thursday, is part of a three-way deal between Australia-based Foster's, Molson Companies and Miller Brewing, the Milwaukee beer company owned by the Philip Morris food and tobacco group. Foster's said it would receive CDollars 169m (ADollars 192m) for the 10 per cent stake in Molson Breweries. Miller is buying a further 10 per cent stake from Molson Companies, leaving the joint venture partners with 40 per cent each. The deal gives Miller the marketing and distribution rights to both Foster's and Molson beers in the US. Foster's said Miller had undertaken to increase marketing efforts for both companies' beers. Mr Ted Kunkel, Foster's chief executive, said the deal was a response to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which liberalises trade between the US, Canada and Mexico. He said he would be 'disappointed' if the deal failed to bring about a 'significant' increase in Foster's US market share of about 1 per cent. Mr Kunkel said the deal would reduce Molson's contribution to Foster's net profits in the short term, but he was confident that royalty payments from Miller would exceed the lost profits in the medium term. Foster's is attempting to restructure itself as a pure brewing operation, but has been unable to dispose of many non-brewing assets.</p>

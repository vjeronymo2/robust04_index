They are important missions facing governments  at various levels. Leading comrades at various levels must be  of one mind, must be concerned with the overall situation, and  must resolutely restrain [kong zhi 2235 0455] price indices  within the prescribed targets for 1994.    Arriving at the Hunan Lounge of the Great Hall of the People  this morning as a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC]  from Hunan Province, Zhu Rongji joined all Hunan NPC deputies in  a group discussion on Premier Li Peng's "Government Work  Report." While earnestly listening to the speeches of more than  10 deputies, he constantly interrupted and exchanged views with  them. His cheerful and humorous remarks enlivened the  atmosphere of the meeting.    Zhu Rongji fully affirmed Hunan Province's achievements in  1993, particularly its work in eliminating "IOU's" to peasants,  in reducing peasants' burdens, and in rectifying "the rush to  establish development zones." Later, he made specific remarks  on issues concerning stabilizing the market and prices which are  of the greatest interest to the deputies. He stated: Prices  began to rise in some localities in China in November 1993, and  gradually price increases spread across the country. The party  Central Committee and State Council noticed the situation,  promptly took effective measures, and stopped prices from rising  too rapidly. However, the problem has not been resolved once  and for all. Since the beginning of 1994, the broad masses of  people have been generally concerned with the tendency that  prices have been rising monthly.    Zhu Rongji said: Some people attribute the current price  increase to reform measures introduced this year. It is a gross  misunderstanding. He pointed out: Inflation, which started  before reform measures were introduced and which was an  inevitable result of the excessive money supply in circulation  in the first half of 1993, has had little to do with this year's  reform measures. After reform measures were introduced for more  than two months in the beginning of 1994, the national economy  has shown an unexpectedly good performance. First, government  revenues increased more than 30 percent in the January-February  period of 1994 over that of the same period in 1993. Second,  the money supply in circulation has been under effective control  and has been reduced to a prescribed range in accordance with  macroeconomic regulation and control. Presently the reduction  of the circulating money supply has been progressing favorably.  Seventy percent of the extra money supply provided prior to the  Spring Festival has been retracted; the rest is expected to be  taken back by the end of March. Third, simultaneous reform in  foreign currency transactions has been progressing smoothly.  Exchange rates between reminbi and foreign currencies have  remained stable, and China's foreign exchange reserve has  increased quite considerably. Fourth, the supply of market  commodities is extremely abundant, and most commodities are  oversupplied. The overall national economy is much better than  that of 1993. It shows the results of macroeconomic regulation  and control facilitated by the party Central Committee with  Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the State Council. It also  proves this year's reform measures are feasible and very  effective.    Zhu Rongji stressed: The major reasons for the currently  rising market prices follow: Many departments, localities, and  enterprises have been maintaining excessive psychological  expectations on growth rates and investment scales, and have  misunderstood the meaning of "market economy." They mistakenly  thought that under a market economy, the government will totally  let go of prices, and enterprises can increase prices at will.  Therefore, the main reason for the current unstable market is  not an imbalance between supply and demand. As long as we take  correct measures, we can curb price increases. Therefore, the  party Central Committee and State Council have decided to take  the following four measures: First, we will strictly "restrict  expansion in two aspects," including excessively increased  investments in fixed assets and overly expanded consumption  funds. In 1994 we will not, in principle, introduce new  construction projects. All projects which are to begin urgently  must be under overall state programs. No bank loans shall be  given to any project not listed in overall state programs,  including projects which have been broken down into smaller ones  from previously larger undertakings. Organs at various levels  and various institutions and enterprises shall not  indiscriminately increase wages, wantonly issue awards and  bonuses, or sell public housing units at low prices. We should  facilitate tax revenue reforms and social security systems to  resolve uneven income discrepancies among various people and  trades. Second, governments at various levels should earnestly  and properly handle agricultural and "vegetable basket"  projects; should stabilize grain-producing acreage, grain  output, and grain storage; and should also ensure the supply of  non- staple food for residents. We should regard the work  progress in these tasks as the main criteria of evaluating the  work performance of leaders at various levels. Third, the  government should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control over market prices. Governments at various levels should  conduct a general inspection of commodity prices in the near  future; should oppose indiscriminate price increases under the  pretext of heavier tax burdens; and should oppose excessive  profits and price-fixing under monopolistic practices. We  should pay attention to checking prices of means of production  which are important and transacted under monopolistic systems,  including steel, electricity, coal, oil and chemical fertilizer;  prices of consumer goods which concern the national economy and  the people's livelihood, including grain and edible oil; and  prices of public utilities and services. We must specify that  even under a market economy, the state cannot abandon its  functions in price management, nor can it refrain from  subsidizing public welfare undertakings. The government cannot  pass the commitment of giving subsidies, which it should rightly  shoulder, in the form of a financial burden to the common  people. We should make proper arrangements for people's  livelihoods, even at the expense of funding a smaller number of  construction projects. Fourth, we should expeditiously take a  series of economic measures in the near future to curb price  increases. To check price increases on certain commodities  which are temporarily in short supply in the market and which  contract excessive price increases, we should use the state  inventory, increase the supply, and publicize price reduction  while supporting enterprises to produce such commodities at full  capacity.    Zhu Rongji stated at the end: So long as the entire party  comes to a common understanding, helps one another,  realistically undertakes actual tasks, and refrains from  rhetoric, we definitely have the confidence to stabilize market  prices; to properly perform various tasks in 1994; and under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, to achieve greater accomplishments  in reform and development.</p>

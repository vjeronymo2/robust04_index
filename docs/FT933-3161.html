			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / NatWest picks CIN chief to run investment arm MR Paul Whitney is quitting as chief executive of CIN Management, manager of British Coal's pension funds, to join National Westminster Bank as a managing director in charge of investment management. The appointment will be followed by a radical reorganisation of NatWest's fund management operations. Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets, said the group's diverse investment management businesses would be brought together into one centralised operation under Mr Whitney. County NatWest Investment Management, the bank's main investment arm - which will be renamed NatWest Investment Management - has suffered departures of senior executives in recent years, undermining its ability to attract UK pension funds according to pension consultants. Mr Whitney was first approached by NatWest two months ago. He said yesterday he decided to join the bank because the new job is potentially far bigger than his current one. CIN manages Pounds 15bn of funds. 'NatWest has up to Pounds 30bn,' he said. However, at the moment this is divided between five different parts of the bank. Mr Owen said NatWest took the decision several months ago to bring its fund management operations together. The bank then decided to search for an executive to manage the process. In the past two years, NatWest has adopted a similar strategy with its other commercial and investment banking operations and has put all of them into NatWest Markets under Mr Owen. According to data from pension consultants William M. Mercer and Co, CNWIM's average UK pension fund portfolio underperformed the market median from 1987 until the middle of 1992. Increasingly, CNWIM has marketed itself as a 'quantitative' fund manager incorporating both passive index-tracking techniques and 'active' mathematical stock and asset selection processes. Mr Whitney has been at CIN for 10 years. The investment decision of which he is proudest was the sale for Pounds 800m of the group's US property portfolio during 1988 and 1989, before prices collapsed.</p>

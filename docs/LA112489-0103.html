			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WEST LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Pamela Holmes' painted hydro-stone wall reliefs strongly evoke space-program  photographs of Earth. Almost radiant, the biomorphic shapes -- colored with  rich earth tones and blues -- suggest the iridescent purity of the planet as  seen from outer space. Holmes adds some welcome layers of metaphor to many of  the pieces by making shapes suggest sprouting seeds or portions of the human  body. Some strong pieces suggest human organs: hearts, lungs or wombs. A few  like the phallus/esophagus/sprouting seed-shaped "Untitled 5" are infused with  a strong libido. This layer of sexuality, inferring that the planet is a body  capable of giving and sustaining life, reads as a buoyant declaration of  existence.  </P> <P> Tied in spirit and process to Symbolist thought, where art reaches for the  spiritually infinite, these abstracted land and body organics cast our  planetary pebble in space as an intimate, physical phenomenon. Holmes may have  a Romantic base but her content, which brushes only lightly against parallels  between mysticism and science, has distinct appeal for a modern psyche grown  comfortable with considering the entire cosmos within a single drop of water.

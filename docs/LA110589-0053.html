			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREQUENTLY ACCURATE  </P> <P> Dan Nelson did not touch on two questions I have:  </P> <P> 1. Does not the appraiser deliberately "low-ball" his estimates because he is  employed by the mortgage lender and not the buyer/sellers? That has been my  experience and also others with whom I've spoken.  </P> <P> 2. Mr. Nelson's description of how he arrives at an estimate would seem to have  an obvious flaw. Namely, when demand is pushing prices up, his technique of  setting a value purely on what has previously transpired flies in the face of  reality.  </P> <P> LEO E. BURKE  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

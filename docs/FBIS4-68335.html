And commercial, economic, and science-related tasks are  clearly on the rise, while purely military jobs are being cut  back.    At present, all the space vehicles operating to meet the  ground's needs -- satellites, stations, modules -- are being  placed in orbit by expendable launch vehicles developed 30-40  years ago -- the Soyuz, the Kosmos, and the Proton. Plans are  also calling for their use in handling the tasks associated with  the Federal Space Program for the period up to 2000-2005.    But what's next? The development of new launch systems  requires 10-15 years. So the question has to be answered today.  If another five years or so goes by, the gap between us and our  competitors will become insurmountable.    So, based on worldwide statistics, the cost of using  expendable launchers to place 1 kg of payload into a low Earth  orbit 200 km high is $8,000-$10,000. The principal expenses are  associated with the loss of the launch vehicle structure and  with the use of expensive launch complexes that are serviced by  a multitude of technicians. Moreover, the situation with the  environment is becoming more acute, with the ground and space  being polluted by the remnants of launch vehicles and  unrecoverable space vehicles. And if the traffic between ground  and space grows even more (in the world today, it's growing 5-7  percent a year), all those problems will snowball, requiring,  among other things, a further buildup of the industrial  production of expendable rockets.    There is only one way out -- develop and build reusable  space  transportation systems for the purpose of cutting the cost of  transporting cargoes by 5- to 10-fold and eliminating virtually  all the drawbacks associated with expendable rockets.    The scientific-research and experiment work, Orel, which was  begun in 1993 by the Russian Space Agency, is devoted to that  very problem. In 1995, the report on the Orel must formulate the  principal areas of development of Russian space transport.    A significant place in the Orel operations is held by  engines. Of course, as test pilots used to say, even a toilet  could fly if you put a motor on it. The head organizations for  "motors" in the Orel project are the Central Institute of  Aviation Engine Building (TsIAM) and the Scientific Research  Institute of Thermal Processes.    TsIAM is studying what is perhaps the most "avant garde" of  all of today's versions of space cabs. There, they are  developing prototypes of engines for aerospace planes --  vehicles that take off from an airstrip and ascend into space,  using only atmospheric oxygen as the jet-engine oxidizer during  their flight in the atmosphere, just as nonspace planes do. But  the gas in the combustion chamber of such engines moves at  supersonic speeds --four to five times faster than the speed of  sound. And there's no turbocompressor that compresses that air  -- it shoots directly into the combustion chamber from the air  intake. Hence the name of these engines -- hypersonic ramjet, or  scramjet.    In providing considerably better performance at high speeds  of flight -- speeds that are 6-16 times greater than the speed  of sound -- the scramjets also have their drawbacks: more  precisely, they create certain problems for the designers. In  order for a scramjet to start working, the airplane must first  be accelerated by traditional turbocompressor or rocket engines,  and, upon leaving the atmosphere, it must again switch engines  -- to rocket engines that do not need outside air.    Thus, an aerospace plane requires the use of a combined  propulsion system that employs all of the best and the advanced  in aviation-and rocket-engine-building. By comparison with an  expendable launch vehicle, an aerospace plane lifting the same  payload mass will have one-third to one-half the launch mass and  will be able to take off and land at any time and at any place  on the globe and will be able to enter orbit with any  inclination.    Russia in the early part of the next century will witness  the  take off of its Tu-2000 -- a distant cousin of the supersonic  Tu-144, a single-stage experimental aerospace plane, and a  "pioneer" in the field of hypersonic aerospace transport.    TsIAM and 14 co-implementer/organizations are performing  simultaneous design operations and tests of prototypes of  engines -- stand tests and flight tests. Near Moscow right now,  in Turayev, renovation is about to be completed on the largest  test stand in Europe for studying scramjets. New structural  materials and software are being developed and put on line.  Flight tests got under way in 1991.    It was a long road to the world's first flight of a scramjet  vehicle -- about 15 years. And the fact that the event finally  took place is to the great credit of the officials and  scientists at TsIAM and their colleagues from the experimental  design bureau and the testing services.    At one of the rocket testing grounds in the vicinity of Lake  Balkhash, the Kholod hypersonic flying laboratory -- a fairly  small axisymmetric scramjet with its own control system and  hydrogen tank -- was mounted the top of an Angara S-200  antiaircraft rocket. As the rocket gained the necessary speed --  three to five times the speed of sound -- it switched-on the  engine, which initially operated with a subsonic stream in the  combustion chamber and then switched to the scramjet mode. In  the second set of tests in November 1992, the engine operated  with the gas in the combustion chamber flowing at a supersonic  speed for 15 of 37 seconds of functioning.    Foreign specialists displayed a lively interest in the  Balkhash tests. "The Russians are roughly two years ahead of the  United States in the development of the scramjet," declared  American expert David Bebb late last year. The French firms that  joined the consortium HYPERSPACE paid 1 million French francs  (nearly $180,000) for the right to participate in the second set  of flight tests in 1992 -- in order to study the results that  were produced. Using Russia's experience, Aerospatiale,  Dassault, SEP, Onera, and Snekma are counting on saving  considerably on the flight-related debugging of future vehicles.    And the fact is that in the context of the Orel program, the  TsIAM people, together with the designers and producers, are  ready to launch, by 1998, the winged flying laboratory IGLA  (Russian abbreviation for "hypersonic research vehicle"), which  will be capable of flying at a speed that is 14 times greater  than the speed of sound. The building of such a hypersonic  flying laboratory is expected to make use of a decommissioned  ballistic missile and involved total spending over a five-year  period of about 40 billion rubles, at the prices for the first  quarter of this year. By comparison, when the Americans allocate  $60 million this year for their X-30, that is generally  considered simply a civilized form of closing the program.    International cooperation is a special issue. The Chinese  and  the Germans, the Americans and the French -- all of them want to  fly "the Russian way." To test promising systems on the unique  Turayev stands. To get data from the flight experiments. But the  most important thing still is to deal with the "domestic"  problems involving future space launchers and high-level  technologies. To get our bearings with the wings of Orel.</p>

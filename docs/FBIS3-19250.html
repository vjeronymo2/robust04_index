Thus begins the campaign  platform of those Greens who at one time had lined up in  opposition to the "established" parties, both inside and outside  the parliaments, but most assuredly without having any sort of  governing responsibility.    In many land governments, this is now nothing more than  yesterday's dogma. The party--including all its factions--is now  trying with all its might to get to the cabinet's table in the  Chancellor's Office. That this will come about is seen by many  as probable. The weakness of the Kohl government, they say, and  the "right" image that SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  Chairman Scharping has prescribed for his party, have opened up  great opportunities for a left-wing party.    The Greens want to avail themselves of these opportunities.  The platform approved by them over the weekend does reaffirm  their old goals, to be sure, but at the same time it qualified  them dramatically: Not one of the demands contained in the  campaign platform could be cited as a justification for causing  a failure of coalition negotiations with the SPD, neither by the  Green fundamentalists nor by the Social Democrats. Likewise, of  the points of controversy that arose between the "realists" and  the leftist "fundamentalists" at the party congress over the  weekend, all lend themselves to negotiation, for the party is  bent on gaining power. After 14 years in an opposition role and  an apprenticeship in a number of land governments, the Greens  finally want to help shape politics in Bonn.    The Greens as a party of the "sixty-eighters" have grown  older. Like all other parties, it now has a youth organization.  But not only aging has caused the Greens to become wiser, the  country's reunification, as well, changed them in many ways.  "Alliance 90/The Greens"--this is not only a new name. Even  though the courageous GDR civil rights proponents of 1989/90 are  of little consequence numerically, they did lastingly change the  face of the party that had been unified only a year earlier.  Especially in the area of foreign and security policies, many of  the civil rights campaigners successfully called into question  traditional positions, ranging from the use of military force to  save people in Bosnia to the debate on the Bundeswehr. To be  sure, the "realists" have so far been unable to gain a  "structural" majority, yet the party's left wing felt compelled  prior to the party congress in Mannheim to give the assurance  that it had "never" demanded in the recent past that the  Bundeswehr must be abolished "immediately." The word now is that  this will be a long-lasting "process"--in view of the very real  budgetary concerns, it is now easier than it was before to  convince people that this process has already begun.    Before the Greens could gain access to a Federal Government,  they would of course have to return to the Bundestag. In the  last elections, the west German Greens had not managed to do  this--contrary to all expectations. And so they associate with  German unity the memory of their greatest defeat. Because they  conducted an unrealistic ideological campaign in 1990, they did  not receive the required 5 percent of the votes. "Green"  parliamentary work at the federal level has since been carried  out by the successful civil rights campaigners of the Alliance  90 from the east.    Those responsible learned from this bitter experience. The  party congress over the weekend was marked by real concerns of  the voters--jobs and a secure future. Ecology was in last place.  In its program, the party is pinning its hopes on a solidarity  alliance of the materially satisfied middle class, which is  willing to make financial sacrifices for more quality of life  and environmental protection, also for socially weaker persons.  But that will not suffice for the "basic social security" which  provides for circa 1,300 German marks [DM] per month for  everyone. For that reason, the party wants to tax the "huge"  capital and land holdings of the rich at a substantially higher  rate than in the past. Following the pattern set by West  European neighbors, also heirs are to share their "unearned"  gain with the "poor."    With these leftist redistribution maxims and its resolutions  calling for a drastic reduction of working hours, the party is  more radical than the SPD, and yet is not too far distant from  it. At the same time, the Greens' former criticism of capitalism  has become more muted. Even though they denounce the alleged  failure of the market economy in the reconstruction of the east,  they nevertheless want to exploit the forces of the marketplace  in the ecological tax reform. Here it is even difficult to find  differences from the new "ecological and social market economy"  of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union].    And so the controversy between the party's fundamentalists  and the realists basically turned only on the question of how  sharply the Alliance 90/Greens, as a left-wing party, is to  distinguish itself in its election platform from what is alleged  to be an SPD that has moved to the right--and how honestly one  plans to say that "everything is negotiable."    Despite their clear coalition statement, the Greens are  under  no illusions. Even though polls currently show them to be the  third strongest party: Only the results of the election in the  fall will show whether they can "force" the SPD to adopt a  "reform policy," or whether Scharping must seek his salvation in  a different, perhaps grand, coalition. For the Greens know that  the SPD chairman is not exactly an enthusiastic supporter of  "red-green." What Scharping would probably like most of all is  to play the Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] off  against each other in a "traffic-light coalition."    The Alliance 90/Greens is less enthralled by such a  prospect.  For that reason, the party is now offering its services as the  best guarantee to avoid the nightmare of a grand coalition--it  plans to offer itself to the voter as the "sole left-wing  party." A professional campaign management team is to help the  party achieve its goal, a party that is as united and motivated  as never before.</p>

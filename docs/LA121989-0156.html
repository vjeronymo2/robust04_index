			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SCHAYES TO UNDERGO SURGERY  </P> <P> Denver Nuggets center Danny Schayes will undergo surgery to remove bone spurs  from his right ankle, which will likely sideline him for three to four weeks.  </P> <P> Schayes, hindered by either injury or foul trouble throughout this season, has  played in only 12 of 23 games. He has undergone bone scans and X-rays in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> Schayes attempted to practice Monday but quit in pain after about 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Surgery is scheduled Wednesday.  </P> <P> Asked if he might miss the entire season, Schayes said, "I don't think so. Not  from what the tests show."  </P> <P> Schayes said doctors might also perform arthroscopic surgery on his left foot.  "They might scope it to clean out all the debris," he said.  </P> <P> Schayes' problems began with an injury to his left ankle. He said he might have  overcompensated and put too much stress on his right foot.  </P></p>

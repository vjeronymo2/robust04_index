			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Germany gives construction equipment lift GERMANY IS likely to lead growth in the European construction equipment market over the next few years, and could account for almost 30 per cent of unit sales by 1995, according to a review by London-based Corporate Intelligence Group (CIG). The prediction underlines the impact of unification on the German market, Europe's largest, which accounted for 18 per cent of European unit sales in 1989 and 24 per cent last year, when the five new states were included for the first time. 'Europe is now a region of great contrasts; the UK and Scandinavian countries are particularly weak, while the now unified Germany is showing a buoyancy which nobody could have predicted two years ago,' says the study. Equipment sales in Germany rose by 25 per cent last year from 19,275 units in 1989 to 24,273, due to a long-awaited revival of the housing market. This was caused by cyclical factors and the arrival of large numbers of people from the former East Germany. Demand was particularly strong for wheeled loaders and mini-excavators, but the report singles out 'the gallant backhoe loader salesmen who, after years of struggling in the west (of Germany) against wheeled excavators, went east and struck gold - about 400 units sold.' The study says infrastructural improvements in the east are bound to come and the potential there is enormous. It forecasts a slight dip in units sold this year in Germany, to 22,700, but predicts sales will reach 29,200 in 1995, out of a total for Europe of 104,692. The picture is less bright elsewhere in Europe. Unit sales fell 5 per cent last year to 100,775 and CIG believes they could be as low as 93,700 units this year. One reason for the decline is the enormous number of machines bought during 1987-89, leaving fleets relatively young, and more than sufficient for current workloads. Another factor, says the study, is the generally unhealthy economic climate across Europe; inflation and interest rates have hit governments' spending plans badly, and large projects have either been cancelled or postponed. But the study believes 1991 will be a watershed year, and equipment demand will start to firm up by the middle of 1992. This should set the tone to the middle of the decade, by when demand should have almost recovered to 1989 levels.</p>

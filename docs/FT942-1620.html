			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life diversifies into health insurance Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, is to diversify into health insurance with the purchase of Prime Health from Municipal Mutual, the local authority-owned insurance company, for an undisclosed amount, writes Alison Smith. Prime Health policies cover some 250,000 people. Last year it had gross premium income of Pounds 54m making it the fifth largest health insurer in the UK. The move is Standard Life's first venture outside life and pensions policies. Mr Scott Bell, managing director, said the acquisition would allow the group to move quickly ahead in the rapidly growing health insurance market. Standard Life will lose an important element of its UK distribution next year, when Halifax Building Society ends its agreement to sell Standard Life policies and sets up its own life subsidiary. Prime Health is the latest in a string of subsidiaries to have been sold off by MMI, which transferred most of its continuing local authority business to Zurich Insurance.</p>

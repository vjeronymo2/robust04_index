			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 15 RIA--The leadership of Russia  believes that the beginning of Russia's peacekeeping operation  in Abkhazia will accelerate the settlement of the conflict  situation in the region, Georgian Ambassador to Russia Valeryan  Advadze declared in an exclusive interview given to a RIA  correspondent.    As is known, on Tuesday the Russian president took a  decision  on the start of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. In  accordance with the presidential decree the peacekeeping action  begins today and will be carried out by the efforts of units of  the Russian forces deployed in Transcaucasia. It is expected  that during this week they will take up positions on the line of  disengagement from both sides of the Inguri River.    "All this once again confirms that the main key to solving  the Abkhazian problem lies in the hands of Moscow, which head of  the Republic of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze has repeatedly  asserted," noted the Georgian ambassador. In his opinion, the  fact that in Russia both the politicians and the military have  got down to the settlement of the conflict is evidence of the  peacekeeping potential of Russia in terms of solving conflict  situations on the territory of the former USSR.</p>

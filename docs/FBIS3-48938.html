			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- The presidency of the  Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] and Depos [Serbian Democratic  Alliance] demand that the Serbian Government immediately fulfill  the Kolubara miners demands, a SPO Presidency statement,  forwarded to TANJUG today, says.    In its message of support to the miners, the SPO says that  "the disgraceful truth is that in todays's Serbia loiterers and  criminals get rewarded while miners cannot afford a crust of  bread."    "The SPO and Depos resolutely support the view that the  authorities who cannot secure at least two things: That no one  in Serbia is hungry and that every citizen's salary is enough to  feed himself and his family, must be removed," the statement  says.    The Civic Forum's [nonnationalist intellectual group]  statement, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that "the latest  events show that the authorities are trying to provoke the  introduction of a state of emergency."    "The strikes by public services of vital importance for the  functioning of our state and for citizens' lives, such as  electricity supplies, railroads and local transportation, show  that the authorities have decided to use these events to justify  the introduction of a state of emergency," the Civic Forum's  statement says.</p>

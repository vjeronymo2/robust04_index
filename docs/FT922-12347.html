			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Agents set to call in assets of more than 3,000 Names AGENTS at the Lloyd's insurance market are likely to begin calling in funds lodged by Names in the troubled Gooda Walker and Devonshire syndicates next week, following a High Court judgment on Thursday. Mr Andrew Pincott, of solicitors Elborne Mitchell, which represented 76 Lloyd's agents in a case brought against them by 820 Names, said: 'The cash calls will go ahead. There is no doubt about that.' The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting at the market - were seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down the deposits which Names must lodge when they join the market. Few expressed surprise at the court's decision. 'We only ever thought there was a modest chance of our legal action succeeding,' said Mr Alan Porter, deputy chair-man of the Devonshire Action Group. More than 3,000 Names on four syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency are worst affected. Managers of the syndicates have made little progress in collecting Pounds 101m - called for at the beginning of March. The money is needed to pay insurance losses incurred in the 1989 and 1990 underwriting years. The Names, represented by Mr Michael Freeman, argued that the cash calls were 'improper'. But Mr Justice Saville ordered them to be paid. Mr Freeman said the Names took heart from the fact that Lloyd's - which joined the members' agents as a second defendant - was refused costs. An appeal was unlikely, but the case would now be transformed into a 'substantive action for damages and loss'. Mr Pincott described the ruling as a benchmark verdict. 'It establishes that calls will proceed unless they are dishonest or made for improper purposes,' he said. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, welcomed the judgment: 'The primacy of this principle 'pay now, sue later' has been upheld.' Nevertheless, the decision will not prevent other efforts to obtain injunctions. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said last week that he would take action before the end of the month. Separately, another group of Names - organised by US lawyer Mr Andrew Grossman - is seeking injunctions on the grounds that the loss-making spiral reinsurance contracts entered into by Names could contain flaws which enable Names to apply to have them set aside. Names who have suffered said yesterday that they were not surprised by the High Court ruling, and would step up the work of action groups which could start legal proceedings for breach of contract and negligence. As for the final outcome, Names affected by the cash calls are generally realistic about their chances. Mr Richard Platts, a retired university lecturer and a member of the troubled syndicates, said: 'We are fairly confident that there will be some sort of market settlement but the people who have been slaughtered will not be rescued.'</p>

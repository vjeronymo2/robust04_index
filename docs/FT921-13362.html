			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: The true worth of dividends FT-SE Index: 2543.4 (-1.5) Some anniversaries are best forgotten - but it is worth recalling that it was just a year ago when M &amp; G's controversial strictures on UK dividend policy were thudding on to boardroom desks. Mr Paddy Linaker, M &amp; G's boss, insists it would have been tedious to repeat the message in his most recent 12 monthly missive to chairmen of companies in which his unit trust group holds a significant stake. But it is perhaps appropriate that he has not. M &amp; G's views may not have changed, but the fact that the only mention of dividends this time round is to thank those who have maintained or increased payouts in difficult times seems symbolic of a wider realism which has crept into institutional thinking. It would be wrong to conclude that the City is always more forgiving. Trafalgar House and British Steel, whose share prices both fell 30 per cent in the immediate wake of dividend warnings late last year, would presumably testify to that. Companies, moreover, will no doubt do their damndest to avoid an action which inevitably gets interpreted by investors as a lack of confidence in the future and tends to invite the interest of unwanted predators. Having said that, those boards now forced by recession and the slowness of recovery to contemplate the previously unthinkable are more likely to get a sympathetic reaction than they were a year ago. This is long overdue. US academic research suggests the market value of a company is not normally increased by a generous distribution policy. Businesses, moreover, ought to be able to take advantage of the flexibility of equity capital in a downturn and to adapt payouts to a new level which looks sustainable over the medium term. Lonrho's results tomorrow may provide an indication of boardroom thinking, but a clearer picture will not emerge until the Spring when the likes of, say, Wimpey and Tarmac will be sure to give a lead to the distressed contracting sector. There are bound to be some nasty surprises - but with only seven FT-SE stocks yielding more than 10 per cent the worst shocks could be among the second liners.</p>

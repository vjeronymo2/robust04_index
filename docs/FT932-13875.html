			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Jobs: The hoped-for sparklers fail to show - Advertised demand remains on the downpath for most types of executive staff in Britain WHEN it comes to conjuring up mental visions of terror, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge had few equals let alone betters. As an example, witness the picture he draws, in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, of: . . . one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having once turned round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows, a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. All of which suggests the horror Coleridge must have felt at the spectre of his country being run by a certain set of people. Those he had in mind - and beside whom, he said, 'the worst form of aristocracy would be a blessing' - were 'a contemptible democratical oligarchy of glib economists'. Fortunately, although economists have bred copiously in Britain since his death in 1834, they haven't quite taken full control of the country yet. In the meantime, however, Brits who believe their economy is now recovering from recession might like to ponder the implications of a lesser spectre: that of industry and commerce eventually being run by computing specialists in harness with sales and marketing folk. After all, portents of said development are to be found in the table alongside. As on previous occasions, it gives the results over the past five years of the MSL International consultancy's counts of jobs for managers and higher-ranked specialists which are advertised in the United Kingdom's weightier journals. Each post so offered is counted as just one, no matter how many times the ad for it appears in various organs. The upper part of the table focuses on the 12-monthly period to March 31, showing first the number of advertised openings in eight broad categories of executive-level work, then the total. Below that come the all-categories tallies for each quarter of the period. Now in all the years I have been reporting MSL's figures, I'd never been keener to see the latest three-monthly count. The reasons were twofold, the first dating back to six months ago. It was then that, after what seemed like ages of unrelieved decline in every niche of the advertised market, a bright spot suddenly appeared. Demand in the sales and marketing category, having repeatedly plumbed ever lower depths, rose by comparison with the 12 months before. The next tally which came three months ago showed not only that the said rise was continuing, but that it had been joined by an upturn in computing. With those two improvements in the bag, my second reason for being eager to see the latest figures lies in the seasonal pattern the counts have taken since the consultancy began them in 1959. Almost always, January-March has been the best quarter for demand in the calendar year. So I was expecting to find plus-signs also sparkling beside further categories of work. Alas, as may be seen, they have not appeared. Hence, if UK industry and commerce are emerging from recession, they are evidently doing same without need to advertise for increased supplies of any executives except computing, and sales and marketing types. That has not stopped MSL's chief executive Garry Long from greeting the count with glad heart. Focusing on the jump between the two latest quarters, from 2,936 posts of all types in October-December to 3,955 in January-March, he says: 'These figures are particularly encouraging because they signal an increase in recruitment at managerial and executive level - a sure sign of investment for growth.' I fear I disagree. True, the quarter-to-quarter jump is marked. At 34.7 per cent, it compares with an average rise of 20.3 per cent between those same two quarters over the years since 1980. But the 3,955 is still 2.5 per cent down on the 4,058 jobs advertised in January-March a year ago, a period when the market seems likely to have been depressed by employers' anxieties about the forecast Labour win in the April election. If so, then the at least short-term relief when the Conservatives prevailed may have released pent-up demand and distorted the seasonal pattern for 1992. Accordingly, in an attempt to adjust for same, I have traced back to 1980, comparing the January-March periods with the average for all three preceding quarters of the year before. By that yardstick, the latest 3,955 does not represent a jump of 34.7 per cent, or indeed one of marked degree at all. It works out at 14.8 per cent against a 13-year average of 14.5. Even so, while computing and the sales area may be the only beneficiaries of an upturn in the advertised market, there may still be a rise in recruitment of other types by different means. After all, as a result of wholesale sackings, many able executives have signed up with agencies which keep registers of available staff. So it may be that employers are filling their needs from such sources rather than by advertising until the agencies' stocks run low.</p>

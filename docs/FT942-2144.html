			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / CBI says London should be better run Weaknesses in the way London is governed are damaging its reputation as a centre of world business, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday, John Willman writes. In a a business plan for the capital, it says London lacks a 'board and management' that could create a vision for the future and implement the decisions necessary to sustain London's role as a world city. There are 'fundamental weaknesses', the CBI says, in 'the complicated and unco-ordinated way policy is determined, services are delivered and taxpayers' money is spent'. The CBI report has been submitted as the business contribution to the London Pride prospectus, being drawn up at the government's request by London First, the business-led organisation to promote the capital. It says that London's aim should be to become the most successful city in Europe for business by the year 2020. The report includes 120 steps needed to achieve this vision, including the CrossRail line, a high-speed Channel tunnel rail link, more bridges over the Thames and improvements in public transport. London already contributes a Pounds 10bn surplus to the UK's balance of trade, said Mr Ian Reeves, the CBI's London regional chairman. 'But instead of receiving the investment it needs, it is being stripped of its assets,' he added.</p>

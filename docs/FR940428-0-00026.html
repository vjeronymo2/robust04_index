			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rule in view of the comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Commander (mps), Eighth Coast Guard District, at the address under ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The request should include the reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentation will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The drafters of this regulation are LTJG Stephanie Spunt, project officer for the Captain of the Port, New Orleans, Louisiana, LT Verne Gifford, project officer, Eighth Coast Guard District Marine Safety Division, and CDR D. G. Dickman, project attorney, Eighth Coast Guard District Legal Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. Many barge fleet breakaways have occurred outside the currently regulated area that are a direct result of inadequate mooring practices that are addressed by this regulation. Current high water conditions in the amended regulated area have exacerbated the problem. Continued high water conditions are expected in the regulated area throughout the spring and summer months. Immediate action is needed to limit the number and effect of barge breakaways and to protect the environment, especially during high water conditions. For these reasons, the Coast Guard for good cause finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3), that notice, and public procedure on the notice, before the effective date of this rule are contrary to the public interest and that this rule should be made effective in less than 30 days after publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recent barge fleet breakaways on the Mississippi River within the Captain of the Port New Orleans zone show that there are a statistically significant higher incidence of barge fleet breakaways between miles 127 and 240 above Head of Passes, which is outside of the current regulated navigation area. Coast Guard fleet inspectors have found that many fleeting operations located between miles 127 and 240 do not currently conform with the mooring regulations that apply to fleets operating within the current regulated navigation area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Casualty investigations have indicated that a majority of the breakaways occur as the result of a passing tow or deep draft vessel striking the fleet. Additionally, barge fleet breakaways are also caused by large wakes from passing deep draft vessels. Both of these causal factors increase during high water conditions as faster currents and increased debris result from the high water conditions. This contributes to more collisions and to more incidents from large vessel wakes. Most often, in these cases, barge moorings outside the current regulated area have been determined to have been weak or inadequate to withstand these foreseeable increased forces. High water conditions currently exist and it is expected that higher than normal river stages will continue to exist during the spring and summer of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing regulations establish general procedural and equipment requirements for mooring of barge fleets on the Mississippi River between miles 88 and 127 above Head of Passes. These regulations further outlined additional specific fleeting requirements during periods of high water. High water is specified in the regulations as existing when the Carrollton Gauge stands at 12 feet, or when the Carrollton Gauge stands at 10 feet, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers forecasts the Mississippi River will rise to 12 feet and the District Commander determines the conditions to be hazardous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has determined that extending the regulated navigation area to include the area of the Mississippi River between mile 88 and mile 240 above Head of Passes will improve the management and mooring procedures for the bare fleets in this area and will reduce the number of breakaways as well as create a safer environment for the entire maritime community in the Captain of the Port New Orleans zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11034); February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. section 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential impact on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 33 barge fleeting operations outside of the current regulated area that will be required to comply with the increased mooring and supervision requirement as a result of the expansion of the regulated area. Operators of barge fleets often share locations and some operators have multiple locations both within and without the current regulated area, meaning that the businesses affected will be less than the number of fleets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

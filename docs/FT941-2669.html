			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Opencast guidance sparks fears Government draft guidance on opencast coal mining is likely to perpetuate the practice in areas where it is unacceptable to local communities, the Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group said yesterday. According to a campaign report, the government draft Mineral Planning Guidance 3 fails to give local councils adequate powers to deal with the 'flood' of opencast proposals likely to follow privatisation of the coal industry. It describes as unworkable the proposal that local councils should identify in advance potential opencast sites. The campaign says the guidance gives no encouragement to local authorities to negotiate community benefits as compensation to residents who are affected by opencast sites. The campaign also says that the new guidance 'still introduces 'national interest' considerations in favour of opencasting'. This, it says, should be deleted to avoid bias in considering opencast proposals. The Department of the Environment said the new guidance would introduce a more environmentally conscious regime than its predecessor. It welcomed the campaign's contribution to the consultation. Under the previous version of the guidance, issued in 1988, local councils have found it difficult to resist opencast proposals that cause what they consider to be unacceptable environmental damage.</p>

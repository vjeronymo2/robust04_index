			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Personal View: Down to earth, not distant visions Deep divisions over the future of Europe were revealed during the ratification process of the Maastricht treaty - not only in Denmark and the UK but also in France and Germany. In order to heal these divisions, the member states of the European Union are turning to a new pragmatic agenda that promises tangible benefits rather than distant visions - one that focuses on implementation rather than on new initiatives. In the short run the agenda is already crowded. First and foremost, there is the need to complete successfully by mid-December the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations - without which there will be an immediate crisis in the Union. Second, membership negotiations with the European Free Trade Association applicants - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden - should be concluded in spring next year. This is necessary to show that the Union is not an exclusive club dividing rather than uniting Europe. Third, there is the re-casting of the economic agenda to focus on the micro-economic changes needed to improve Europe's economic performance relative to the rest of the world. This does not depend on Community transfers and new regulatory initiatives, but on getting rid of state aids, enforcing competition within the single market and opening up those sectors where state monopolies have led sheltered lives. Fourth, in respect of macro-economic policy, this means discarding the artificial deadlines for monetary union and emphasising instead the convergence objectives of reducing budget deficits so that less burden is placed on interest rates. Fifth, there is a redefinition of the concept of 'social Europe' away from its equation with new regulatory burdens on business or new financial burdens on governments towards comparisons of 'best practice' in meeting social objectives and towards harnessing private finance. Sixth, the two 'pillars' of the Maastricht treaty (foreign security policy and home affairs) must be shown to work despite the tarnishing effect of events in former Yugoslavia. Last, but not least, the Nato summit in January should see progress in reformulating the purposes of the Atlantic alliance and extension of security links eastwards. This new pragmatism will be welcomed by many, not least by the business community. Business would like to see the commission and other bodies focus on their administrative and managerial tasks rather than the endless invention of new legislative initiatives or visions for which there is no clear path to attainment. At the same time, this healthy turn towards pragmatism has to be guided by an informed view of the longer-term development of the European Union. The question of the kind of European Union we wish to see develop will not go away. There will be renewed debate next year during elections for the European parliament and in 1996 when the next intergovernmental conference will be held. Meanwhile, proposals for the next round of discussions on the future shape of the European Union are being forwarded by a group of independent academics and think-tanks from across Europe, known as the Constitutional Group. Their report avoids terms which merely add to confusion, such as 'federal' or 'confederal', 'integrationist' or 'intergovernmental'. Equally, it avoids simplistic and often self-interested assertions that development of the Union simply involves giving more powers to central bodies such as the commission or the European parliament. Instead, the report addresses the basic questions Europe faces. How do we structure a union that will embrace all democratic countries in Europe and promote the interests of both the smaller and larger member states? How do we redefine the role of the nation state and its institutions within the Union? How do we entrench rule-based procedures rather than discretionary powers in the Union? What are the fundamental values we should try to enshrine in the development of political union? No one should pretend there are easy answers. But if there was one lesson from Maastricht it was the dangers of governments getting out of step with their electorates. Closer union is in the interests of all. But it cannot be imposed. It must rest on consent. Whether there will be consent to further union may depend on whether governments can first demonstrate tangible benefits of union from the successful pursuit of their new pragmatic agenda.

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Progress in Tokyo airport row A PARTIAL settlement was reached yesterday in a 25-year dispute between the Japanese government and protest groups which have blocked the construction of the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita. The continuing Narita protests and the opposition of local farmers' groups have succeeded, to the embarrassment of the government, in crippling plans for two runways and a high-speed railway link from the airport to central Tokyo. At a meeting yesterday, the government agreed to halt preparatory work on the two runways and withdraw applications to seize land which residents have refused to sell. In return, an influential protest group, Atsuta, will join a forum to plan the final stages of the airport's construction. The agreement does not include two other farmer-backed protest groups which still own land in the path of the proposed runways. One of those groups insists that the entire Narita project, including the buildings already completed and open for business, must be scrapped. However, the government hopes those groups will join Atsuta in the forum, due to be established late this year. Mr Ihei Ochi, the transport minister, hailed the agreement as a 'new beginning', but it still remains unclear as to when the dispute will come to an end.</p>

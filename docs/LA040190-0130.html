			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FAST DEAL WITH MEXICO UNLIKELY  </P> <P> A free-trade agreement between Mexico and the United States is one of those  ideas that looks great on paper but could be very hard to make work in the real  world. But it's good that the two governments have agreed to talk about it.  </P> <P> Reducing the many trade, investment and labor barriers between Mexico and the  United States, in theory at least, makes a great deal of sense. Mexico is poor,  with a young and fast-growing population. It needs the investment and  technology the United States has to offer. The United States needs the oil and  other natural resources Mexico has, including cheap labor. And a nearby market  of 100 million Mexicans eager to buy U.S.-made goods sounds exciting, too.  </P> <P> That's why it was big news last week when the Bush Administration revealed that  top U.S. officials have met privately with their Mexican counterparts to  discuss the possibility of negotiating a U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement  similar to a pact signed with Canada in 1988. But how even that tentative  announcement was greeted in each country is very revealing.  </P> <P> U.S. newspapers played it on the front page, befitting the importance of a plan  that could create a common market of 350 million people from the Arctic Circle  to Yucatan. Mexican media played it up too, but with a decidedly different  spin: Their stories featured comments from Mexicans denouncing the plan, like  the intellectual who warned that "our way of life is at stake."  </P> <P> You don't have to be an expert on Mexico to know that kind of rhetoric means  trouble for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. While many Mexicans like and  even admire their powerful northern neighbor, they genuinely worry about their  economy, even their very culture, being overwhelmed if Mexicans buy all the  American blue jeans, Coke and rock records they can get their hands on. And  these are not just leftist intellectuals in Mexico City: Some conservative  Mexican businessmen don't relish the thought of competing with U.S. companies,  either.  </P> <P> To complicate matters further, Mexico could fairly ask for things under a  free-trade agreement that would drive many U.S. citizens up a wall, such as an  open border Mexicans could cross at will to look for jobs in the United States.  Law-enforcement officials and labor unions, to mention just a couple of  not-insignificant interest groups, would howl in protest over that one.  </P> <P> With all the similarities of language, culture and economic development between  Canada and the United States, it took three years to hammer out a free-trade  agreement, and it'll take another 10 to phase it into full operation. Given the  greater disparities between the United States and Mexico, a similar agreement  may take decades. So we'll have plenty of time to debate its merits. And it  will be debated -- widely and loudly -- in both countries.  </P></p>

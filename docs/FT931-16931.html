			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Good prospects From an external investor's point of view, the good prospects in US Treasury bonds, and to some extent shares, are gilded by the likely rise of the dollar. By purchasing power measures the dollar is still cheap against European currencies, and improving US growth is likely to increase the dollar's attractions. With a strengthening currency and rising asset prices, the US still looks fairly attractive. The German economy is a much less pretty picture. High interest rates have finally tipped the economy into recession, and the risks are that the contraction will accelerate. Estimates of the cost of unification are still rising and the policy stalemate between the fiscal and monetary authorities seems likely to continue. At the same time there is a world surplus of capital goods which form the backbone of Germany's exports. Inflation pressures at home and devaluations by some of Germany's trading partners have also made German goods less competitive. What makes the German bind so tight is that inflation and strong monetary growth have proved persistent. As a result monetary policy has been kept tight by the Bundesbank, despite the deepening recession. The key to German  -and indeed European - investment performance this year will be the timing of eventual German interest rate cuts. And in the absence of tax increases or a sudden slowing in the growth of the money supply, the risk is that the Bundesbank will move more slowly than the market currently hopes.</p>

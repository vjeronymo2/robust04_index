			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Guinness Peat turns in Pounds 7.75m for 15 months GUINNESS Peat Group, the UK investment vehicle of New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley, yesterday reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.75m in the 15 months to December 31 1992, on total operating revenue of Pounds 34.2m. Sir Ron said the results reflected the group's efforts to restructure itself and restore its corporate image. GPG, which is currently considering making a cash bid for Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business, returned to the Stock Exchange last November after a two-year suspension imposed because it was considered a 'shell' company with no underlying business activity. The restated accounts for the year to September 30 1991, showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 27.4m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.7m made to conform with new UK accounting guidelines on the treatment of goodwill.</p>

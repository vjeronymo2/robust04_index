			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK flock's Chernobyl legacy HALF A MILLION British sheep are still affected by the restrictions imposed on farms in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear accident seven years ago, the government has admitted. The restrictions still cover as many as 631 British farms with a combined land area of well over 400,000 acres. Wales is the worst affected region, accounting for more than half the affected farms and animals. The radioactive cloud caused by the accident passed over Britain on the weekend of May 3-4, 1986, upon which the public was advised not to drink fresh rainwater. In mid-May, caesium levels in lambs started to build up leading on May 20 to a three-week ban on movement and slaughter of 4.2m sheep. This week's admission came in a written answer from Mr David Curry, junior agriculture minister in reply to a question from Mr Llew Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent.</p>

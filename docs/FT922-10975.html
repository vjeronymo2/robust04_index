			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Rank It would be ungracious not to give Rank some credit for its decision to sell its UK hotels. The company's leisure interests were never going to generate enough cash to reduce gearing much below its present 64 per cent. The hotel sales may allow it to lop as much as Pounds 300m off a net debt which now exceeds Pounds 1bn, creating leeway to develop the mass market activities that Rank understands best. That said, the market is probably right to be suspicious about how soon the sales will be completed. Though Rank's price rose by nearly 2 per cent yesterday, volume was a mere 708,000 shares. The provincial hotel market, into which Rank is trying to sell 1,146 rooms, is awash with unsold properties. Business in London, where it has put over 2,000 rooms on the market, has still not recovered to 1990 levels. Rank may thus have to work hard to extract satisfactory prices. Given that the hotels collectively made little more than Pounds 15m last year, each disposal should enhance earnings. The mistake would be to expect much effect before next year. Arguably, too, Rank is selling at the wrong point in the cycle. Its hotels offer recovery scope in a portfolio that has otherwise proved relatively recession-proof. One cannot assume that any recovery in big-ticket consumer spending prompted by the Tory election victory will do much for bingo or Butlin's. Maybe growth will come from the US, where Universal Studios could be contributing handsomely to earnings later in the decade. That, however, remains a rather distant prospect.</p>

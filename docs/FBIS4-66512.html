Abdelhak Bouhafs, director general of Sonatrach [National  Company for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons],  announced on National Radio's Network 3 the day before yesterday  that revenues from hydrocarbon exports this year were expected  to be on the order of $8 billion, based on an average price of  $15 per barrel of Algerian crude.    That forecast is down sharply from the definitely more  optimistic figures set by the government in drawing up the 1994  budget, when it was expecting an average price of $18 per barrel  and, therefore, export revenues on the order of $9.5 billion.  That revision of revenue forecasts for 1994 will drastically  alter the government's calculations and make it necessary to  draft a supplementary budget to put the state's accounts back in  balance and hold the budget deficit at the 125 billion dinars  originally established.    Above all, such a level of revenues is going to complicate  Algeria's financial situation with respect to the rest of the  world. It had been expected that export revenues would at least  cover reimbursement of the debts falling due this year ($9.5  billion). Now that revenues of $8 billion are being expected,  Algeria finds itself in a very tight spot as far as its foreign  partners are concerned, especially since the government is  engaged in tough negotiations with the IMF to obtain new payment  facilities in exchange for adopting a program to adjust its  economy.    But at the end of last December, during a lecture before an  audience of diplomats and journalists at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, Bouhafs had professed optimism regarding an improvement  in crude oil prices on world markets.    At the moment, however, the fact remains that while the  prospect of a standby credit agreement with the IMF for a few  hundred million dollars to be used during a transitional  period--the figure of $800 million is being  mentioned--represents only a relative injection of fresh money,  it gives reason to hope for gestures of good will from Algeria's  creditors.    Algeria will then have to negotiate with its "bankers."    The fact is that the European capitals have stated, and are  continuing to state, that they are willing to help Algeria  provided that it reaches an agreement with the IMF.    But that should in no way keep us from taking advantage of  this breathing spell granted by the IMF to put in place a number  of mechanisms of a social nature--an unemployment fund and  unemployment insurance, among other things--since doing so would  make the effects of the structural adjustment more bearable for  the most underprivileged.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter An Hui-chang] </F>   [Text] North Korea is calling for reunification through  the confederal system and is urging our youth and students to  carry out "the reunification struggle" from the beginning of the  new year. In his New Year address, Kim Il-song emphasized that  "the only method for reunification" is through the confederal  system. Also, from 1-7 January North Korea concentratedly  discussed the reunification issue on 24 occasions through press  statements by its high-ranking authorities and special articles.    Kim Pyong-sik, DPRK vice president and chairman of the  Korean  Social Democratic Party, emphasized on 4 January: "All fellow  countrymen in the North, South, and overseas must transcend  differences in ideology, ideas, political views, and religion  under the banner of the 10-point program of great national unity  to firmly unite as one so that they can all vigorously launch  into the work to found a pannational reunified state through the  confederal system method."    In the 3 January special article aired by Pyongyang radio it  emphasized: "The South Korean youth and students, who are  enthusiastically patriotic and who have a strong sense of  justness, must firmly unite with the people from all walks of  life in the new year to vigorously carry out the struggle to  achieve reunification through the confederal system method."    In particular, North Korea is instigating our youth and  students by saying that "there is nothing to expect from the  current South Korean Government." North Korea is denouncing our  government by saying that there is no progress in the  reunification issue because of the South side's dependency on  outside forces and the promotion of its confrontational policy.    Such moves by North Korea is related to the fact that North  Korea is working to make 1995 "the first year of reunification."  This implies various significance.    It is not known exactly when but there are rumors by the  North Korean people that "1995 will be the year of  reunification." This was also shown when the North Korean  people unhesitatingly told the members of our delegation of such  moves who went to Pyongyang from 1990-1992 to participate in the  South-North high-ranking talks. However, it is not clear whether  North Korea officially set such a date for reunification.    At the 7 November 1988 combined meeting of party organs,  Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam had emphasized: "We must work to  make the year 1995, the 50th anniversary of national division  and 50th anniversary of the fatherland's liberation, as a  historical year in completing the sacred cause of reunification  without fail." Through propaganda media toward South Korea such  as the South Korea National Democratic Front, North Korea  frequently said "1995 is the first year of reunification."    The government views that such moves by North Korea are to  unconsciously make the "South and North Korean people" realize  that "reunification will be achieved in 1995." Thus, this is  viewed as a strategy to make a more favorable condition to form  a reunification front. In particular, from last year North  Korea has been promoting on a full scale the preparation work to  strengthen the reunification front. Such work is "the 10-point  program of great national unity" announced by Kim Il-song, and  the appointment Kim Pyong-sik and Yu Mi-yong (wife of Choe  Tok-sin) who are from the South and overseas fellow countrymen,  and Kang Chu-il who was in charge of operations of the  pro-Pyongyang Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, as  directors of the party reunification front.    We can view that there are some strategic intentions based  on  advance work for North Korea to strengthen propaganda on the  reunification issue from the beginning of the new year. In this  connection an official of the National Unification Board said:  "When considering the fact that next year will be the first year  of reunification is widely spreading among the people, it seems  that the priority goal of North Korea is to seek unity at home  and abroad by turning the interest of the people to the  reunification issue."    He added: "Another intention of North Korea is to lure the  antigovernment struggle through the reunification issue.  Therefore, it seems that this year North Korea will work to  actively improve its relations with the United States, while  carrying out a multifaceted offensive against the South based on  the reunification front strategy."</p>

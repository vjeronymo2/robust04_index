			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / International Company News: Suez increases stake in Victoire SUEZ, one of France's largest industrial and financial holding companies, has increased its controlling shareholding in the Victoire insurance group by 10 per cent. It has acquired stakes previously held by two other insurance companies, Baltica of Denmark and Dai-Ichi of Japan. The acquisition, which raises Suez's interest in Victoire to 63 per cent from 53 per cent, comes at a time when the subject of Victoire's ownership is in the spotlight following months of wrangling between Suez and Union des Assurances de Paris. UAP owns a 35 per cent stake in Victoire and a significant holding in Suez. UAP, chaired by Mr Jean Peyrelevade, former head of Suez, is keen to swap its Victoire holding for a controlling position in Colonia, the German insurer run by Victoire. However, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, recently broke off negotiations after a disagreement over the price of the deal. Mr Peyrelevade has since been manoeuvring to increase UAP's influence over Colonia and Victoire, while Suez has been taking pre-emptive steps to try to prevent such a move. As a result, when Baltica put its Victoire shares up for sale earlier this year, Suez agreed to buy them. It is paying FFr1.2bn (Dollars 222.2m) for the 5 per cent stake. Similarly, Suez was receptive to Dai-Ichi's suggestion that it swapped its 5 per cent holding in Victoire for shares in Suez. The French company is issuing convertible bonds to Dai-Ichi so that the Japanese group can raise its stake in Suez to 3.5 per cent from 1.4 per cent.</p>

Three Muslim Brothers were detained in the past few  days. They are Jamal 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Ashri, from al-Kunayyisah;  Majdi 'Azzuz, from Imbabah; and Shawqi Ghazi. The latter was  given electric shocks, sustained brain damage, and is still  being treated at a mental hospital. The three were subjected to  frightful torture at the hands of the state security  investigation officers of the Jabir Ibn-Hayyan department,  particularly Colonel Muhammad al-Dib, Major Sahrif Sirri, and  'Adil 'Abd-al-Rahman.    The latest act of torture involved Jamal 'Ashri last  Wednesday and Thursday. He was arrested after an exhibition on  Bosnia-Herzegovina was canceled. He was slashed and sensitive  parts of his body were shocked. The officers torturing him  asked him to work as an informer for them and provide them with  information on the number of Muslim Brothers and their activity  in al-Jizah. They threatened to hold him in custody if he  refused to respond to these demands.    'Ashri reported the incident to the Egyptian Human Rights  Organization.</p>

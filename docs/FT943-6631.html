			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Advice was nonsense I own my house in Bristol. There is no outstanding mortgage. I have two years to go before I retire and it had been my intention at the end of that time to sell up and move down to Devon. A friend has offered to sell me his flat there at a good discount to the market price. It has been suggested, however, that if I do buy the flat but continue to live in my present house for more than six months, I will, when I do sell up, be faced with a CGT bill on the full difference between the original price and the final sale price. What you have been told is nonsense. Ask your tax office for the free leaflet for owner-occupiers, CGT4. While this leaflet tends to over-simplify the arbitrary rules laid down by parliament, it is a useful starting point for talks with the solicitor who will (presumably) be acting for you in the purchase of your friend's flat. As a solicitor will be able to explain (provided that you choose a reasonably competent firm), it should be possible - by means of judiciously timed main-residence notices under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 - to escape CGT, not only upon the sale of your present home but also upon any eventual sale of the flat. NatWest Registrars was employed to administer the Northern Ireland Electricity 1993 share offer by the Department of Economic Development, Belfast, and not by the company, as we stated last week. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

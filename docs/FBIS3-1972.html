Hainan Island is the country's largest special economic  zone.    The outline of reform was announced yesterday by Governor  Ruan Chongwu to deputies attending the second session of the  first provincial people's congress.    In his report of governmental work, the governor demanded  that a manager responsibility system with a board of directors  as the supreme authority should operate in all enterprises, and  that all enterprises should be freed of subordination to  administrative bodies.    While promising enterprises full freedom in employment  matters, the governor also pledged that workers would be given  more freedom in changing jobs between enterprises of different  ownership or in different places.    In his report, the governor said the province would seek to  reform its allocating method of import and export quotas and  licences, hinting that a tendering system might be established.    The province will also seek to attract more overseas  investment in improving its tourist and agricultural  infrastructures, and in developing its rich tropical  agricultural resources and ocean resources, the governor said.    According to the governor, the province will further develop  its insurance service in pensions, industrial accidents,  unemployment and medicine.    Besides employees of enterprises, the report said, such  insurance networks would be extended this year to employees of  government bodies and self-employed people.    In relatively rich villages, a medical insurance system that  aims to cover farmers against risks of serious diseases would be  established on an experiment scale, the report said.    Seeking to further improve the province's infrastructure in  1994, Hainan will invest seven billion yuan (805 million U.S.  dollars) in 24 key projects, including an international airport  in Sanya city, an expressway running along the east side of the  island, an airport for the provincial capital, and three power  plants.    By all these means, the governor said, the province aims to  produce a GDP [gross domestic product] value of 27 billion yuan  (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994, which would be 18 percent  higher than in 1993.</p>

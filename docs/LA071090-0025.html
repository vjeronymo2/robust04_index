			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> 'Monday Night Live' Downtown-Bound: Those infamous star-studded Monday night  jam sessions at the China Club in Hollywood are no more.  </P> <P> The house band for the jams, Jim Ehinger and the Nasty Survivors, has moved its  base to Vertigo in downtown Los Angeles. While not specifically knocking the  accommodations at the China Club, band publicists said that the move will  provide "musicians and guests easier access, a larger room in which to listen  and play" and "a courteous approach at the front door." They added that the  sound and light system at Vertigo was superior to the China Club. Elton John  and Sting have played in previous China Club jams. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / The Lex Column: UK stock market The argument over how to overhaul SEAQ, the Stock Exchange's share trading system, is coloured by the Taurus debacle. The choice is again between a solution engineered by the Exchange and proven technology bought from elsewhere. Having sunk so much cash into the Taurus electronic settlement system without result, big securities firms can hardly be blamed for doubting the exchange's ability to manage similar technology projects. Whichever solution is chosen, the current system of market making could do with some fine-tuning. The liquidity of SEAQ's quote-driven market since Big Bang has attracted business, but market makers have not earned a consistent return on capital. The Securities and Investments Board is not helping market makers by declining to relax rules on public disclosure of large trades. Without that, the choice is between edging towards an order-driven system on the model of European markets or relaxing the market-making obligations of dealers. The Exchange's choice of technology could determine the outcome. Since it has no guaranteed monopoly of share trading, though, the wishes of big securities firms cannot be ignored. The role of the Exchange as a provider of settlement services has already been called into question. It can ill afford another dust-up.</p>

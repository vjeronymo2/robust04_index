Europartenariat is a twice-yearly event which will next be held in Thessaloniki in northern Greece on June 22-23. More than 300 Greek companies in fields from construction to food processing are listed in the event catalogue. Non-Greek participants submit a list of companies they would like to meet and the organisers fix up appointments.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Inauguration of the President: Clinton enthusiasm invades US public - George Graham finds support for the president in Pennsylvania POLITICIANS and press pundits in Washington have already declared the honeymoon over: President Bill Clinton stood accused of breaking promises before he had laid a hand on the Bible at noon yesterday for his oath of office. Further afield, however, the Americans who voted him into the White House - and a surprisingly large number of those who did not - are willing to give the former governor of Arkansas more of a chance to prove himself. Despite media criticism of his slowness at forming an administration, his backtracking on promises to cut taxes for the middle class, and his policy reversal on Haitian refugees, 71 per cent of voters hold a favourable opinion of Mr Clinton, according to a poll conducted by Mr Ed Goeas and Ms Celinda Lake, a Republican-Democratic polling partner ship. In the rolling hills of southern Pennsylvania, generally Republican territory, many seemed this week to agree with Mr Clinton's campaign slogan that it was time for a change. 'I think the country needs a change. I just hope Clinton's the right guy,' said Ms Elaine Wolf in the town of East Berlin. Even those who are not sure they like his brand of change said they will reserve judgment until he has had a chance to prove himself. 'I wish him well and I pray for him to that end, because there are certainly a lot of things that need to be put right. I hope he can do it without upsetting the apple cart,' said 69-year-old Mr Bob Slater, a Democrat for much of his life but now with the Republicans. He runs a furniture shop in the town of New Oxford. Up the road at Gettysburg, where 130 years ago a Union army fought to a standstill a southern invasion under the command of General Robert E. Lee, Mrs Joan Baltzley went further and confessed she was enthusiastic about the new president. 'I kind of hate to say this, because I didn't vote for him, but I do feel enthusiastic. This is a good thing happening to our country - young blood and new ideas,' she said. Mr Clinton does not seem to have raised too many eyebrows by edging away from some of his campaign pledges, but voters have low expectations of politicians. 'No matter who would have gotten the position probably would have backed down on some things,' said Ms Wolf. It is the supporters of Mr Ross Perot, the unpredictable Texas billionaire who reaped a strong anti-establishment vote in the presidential election, who are the least forgiving of any frailties Mr Clinton may show. 'We will see how much of a man he is when he has to deal with Baghdad. He has already broken his promises to the middle class,' said Mr Kevin Collins, in Mechanicsburg. For Mr Collins, Mr Clinton's lavish inaugural festivities, replete with symbolism of his bonds to the American people, may have backfired. 'He's spending Dollars 30m on this what do you call it, and I'm not even invited,' he complained.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Konovalov report: "New Ideas for Our Peasants, Or </F> the New Way Is the Completely Forgotten Old Way"]    [Text] IZVESTIYA has received a package of documents that  have been prepared for signing. They are an edict of the  president, a government decree, and statutes on reorganizing  agricultural enterprises and breaking them up into smaller  units. The draft documents have been initialed by many top  leaders involved in agrarian problems and privatization. One of  the drafts has been referred back for revision, while others  have apparently already been fully agreed and will be published  in the near future.    What do they mean for agrarian reform and the peasants? The  main idea is to break farms up into smaller units, which is a  fairly popular idea among rural reformers at grassroots level.  For instance, my close acquaintance Viktor Gulov, a peasant  whom we have often written about, is convinced that it is  possible to arrive at real private farming from our kolkhoz  reality by a simple arithmetical path -- by dividing farms up  into as small units as possible, thus getting down to family  farming. The mechanism for this kind of division into the  smallest units has been provided by the Nizhniy Novgorod  experiment of collective farms being redivided into joint-stock  enterprises. It is no accident that the Russian Federation  government decree on the practice of agrarian transformations in  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast occupies a very important place in the  package of documents.    All the indications are that the idea of breaking farms up  into smaller units as a method of fighting the kolkhoz system  has also inspired the Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy  under the Russian Federation President's Administration. It was  from this center that the aforementioned draft documents were  issued.    It is a thankless task to explain what is in the draft  documents, since they are being subjected to revision, further  work, and so on, and even complete changes of meaning. I will  merely note that there is a principle of compulsion in these  documents. If an agricultural enterprise does not want to be  broken up into smaller units, then, according to the draft  edict, this will be done for it.    It is pointless to dispute the idea of breaking farms down  into smaller units. First of all, this has already happened.  And the kolkhozes which were made smaller did not stop being  kolkhozes. Second, what is there to dispute: Of course, a  smaller collective is more mobile, and it is better suited to  the market. But it would be more convenient for it to solve the  problem of its own size than to have this done on orders from  Moscow.    And what is to happen now to the agricultural enterprises  which have already been turned into joint-stock enterprises and  which see themselves as proprietors, even major proprietors?  Why should they be subjected to the dictates of the capital and  be divided up if they do not want this? Of course, on a broad  level, the breaking up of agricultural enterprises may be  advantageous. However, for the course of agrarian reform and  for the peasants, the future documents may also prove to be a  destabilizing factor.    The countryside is waiting for something entirely different.  A law on agricultural cooperatives, the organization of a land  market, a system of mortgage banks, a targeted financial policy,  and so on. Instead, a new wave of reorganization is  approaching, maybe with some sense to it, but in no way  replacing the changes which the Russian countryside is expecting.</p>

Sevastyanov, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, </F> twice Hero of the Soviet Union, and USSR State Prize laureate,  by Valentina Nikiforova: "Once He Told a Parable"; first  paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] Vitaliy Ivanovich Sevastyanov -- twice Hero of the  Soviet Union, USSR pilot-cosmonaut, and USSR State Prize  laureate. Little mentioned, but such dear, splendid titles. And  a recent title -- people's deputy of Russia. And the current  title --candidate for people's deputy of the Federal Assembly,  and together with G. Zyuganov and V. Ilyukhin, he is heading the  list of the preelection association, the Communist Party of the  Russian Federation.    PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you saw with your own  eyes the tragic end of the Supreme Soviet. And once again,  you're going into politics. Why? Because of dissatisfaction with  your personal life and your social position, or because of a  desire to be high profile?    Sevastyanov: I'll tell you frankly: out of a sense  of social responsibility. And four years ago, which I plunged  into my first preelection campaign, I was doing it with that  same sense. I didn't have any experience in politics, I just  learned it as I went. I knew this: the most important thing is  to be honest. Now after three and a half years of work in the  Supreme Soviet, I feel an acute need to use the platform of the  highest organ of representative authority to explain to the  people where we're being taken and what lies ahead.    PRAVDA: You could explain without being a member  of parliament. You have fame and authority.    Sevastyanov: But the possibilities are  considerably fewer. And the main thing is that in parliament,  you can have a direct effect on the fate of Russia, that is, the  actual possibility of either adopting or rejecting a given law.  And just look at how many harmful laws we've managed to reject!  For example, when they were discussing the legislation on  jurors, I told a parable. One great visionary brought to his  country a sundial, and the people learned what time it was. They  began to appreciate time, they worked better, and the country  flourished. The people idolized the dial and decided to erect a  temple to it. They raised the walls, and then imbricated the  cupola. The sun went away, the shadow disappeared, and the dial  didn't work. The people lost track of time and again became  disorganized -- devastation came, and the country fell apart.    The parable was timely. Seven percent voted for the law on  jurors. There it is -- with a majority you can make sensible  decisions. The parliament, after all, is not simply a publicist  platform -- it's a platform for unification and for promoting a  sense of social responsibility for the future of the country  among deputies of varying political persuasion.    PRAVDA: What would you like to start your work in  the State Duma with?    Sevastyanov: With a reform of the government. I  don't know when the Duma is to assemble, but that has to be done  right away. Second, the course of the reforms has to be adjusted  in order to stabilize the economic and political situation.  Otherwise, a social explosion is unavoidable. And third,  perhaps, is parallel to the first two steps -- restore the  Fundamental Law (the Constitution) and the laws that were  adopted by the Supreme Soviet. The state is the law. If there's  no law, there will be repression.    PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, do you still have ties  with NPO Energiya?    Sevastyanov: Of course. I'm still in the cosmonaut  corps. I work as an instructor and as an experimenter-cosmonaut.  We have these slots: a plain cosmonaut, an  experimenter-cosmonaut, and a researcher-cosmonaut. In terms of  work experience and length of service, there are cosmonaut  candidate, cosmonaut, and cosmonaut instructor. And since I've  long been an experimenter in the cosmonaut corps, I hold an  instructor's position.    PRAVDA: Has the political and economic instability  also had an effect on the space program, a sector that is so  favored by the public, is prestigious, and is, in fact,  profitable? Has it affected the Energiya association. Or have  they noted no changes there -- things going the way they always  did? I mean, our people are still going aloft. Could it be that  the talk of difficulties is just a matter of habit, to get a  little more from the state for the growth of the sector?    Sevastyanov: What? No changes? The funding for the  space program has been cut by more than 60 percent. The funding  difficulties have forced us to let go several thousand of the  most skilled specialists from the enterprise.    PRAVDA: Several thousand?    Sevastyanov: Yes, several thousand. In our sector,  38 percent of the candidates of science and doctors of science  have been let go; they went to commercial structures or went  abroad. The Mir station, which has already worked through three  service lives, exists and operates to this day as a result of a  colossal repair-and-restoration program. But it can't last  forever. And they haven't put up a new station -- there's no  money. And if the funding isn't opened up in the near future,  our consistent work in space will cease.    PRAVDA: And that's why it is with such sadness  that we recall past records and feats. You, after all, went into  space for the first time in 1970, right?    Sevastyanov: With Andriyan Nikolayev. Aboard  Soyuz-9. We were aloft for 18 days. At that time, after the  five-day missions, that was the first long-duration mission; it  was an absolute world record for three and a half years, and, in  that class of spacecraft, it is a world record to this day. The  second time I went aloft was with Petr Klimuk, aboard the  Soyuz-18, in 1975; we docked with the Salyut-4 orbital station.  We saw the Soyuz-Apollo docking -- we were 110 kilometers above  them. And then we returned to the ground after them.    PRAVDA: You were born in the Urals and finished  school in Sochi. What brought about such a change in location?    Sevastyanov: In December 1945, my father was  demobilized, and he took me and my mother to Kuban. At first we  lived in Maykop, and then in 1948 we moved to Sochi. My parents  stayed there. My father died five years ago, and my mother  didn't want to move away.    PRAVDA: Did your father ever tell you stories  about the front?    Sevastyanov: Of course. He left on the third day.  And spent the entire war in the same 150th Separate Tank Brigade  of the High Command Reserve. He fought on several fronts -- near  Konev, near Zhukov. He finished the war in Prague.    PRAVDA: Did he hold a high rank?    Sevastyanov: He was an ordinary enlisted man --  senior sergeant. He drove a tank the whole war. He had the full  set of enlisted man awards. That's the history of my father and  his fellow soldiers, and I won't allow it to be defiled. That's  why I've volunteered to defend the CPSU in the Constitutional  Court.    PRAVDA: Vitaliy Ivanovich, you're being asked  about a lot of things in the preelection meetings. But I would  like to ask about the logo of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation in the elections: a crisp, elegant drawing of the  hammer and sickle is surrounded by the words "Russia. Fairness.  Labor. Power to the People."    Sevastyanov: The person behind the logo is the  science-fiction artist Andrey Sokolov. I've known him for some  25 years, since he first entered the cosmonaut corps, in which  Aleksey Leonov worked. The logo is rectangular. You won't get it  mixed up with any other.</p>

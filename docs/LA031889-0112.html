			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UKRAINIAN EASTER ART SHOWCASED  </P> <P> Tucked away in a down-at-the-heels 1926 vaudeville/movie house in a  less-than-spiffy part of Melrose Avenue, about 20 women were gathered recently  around tables painting Easter eggs. Not your average pink, blue and yellow with  transfer designs, these eggs have ancient, intricate designs in bold colors --  works of art carefully placed on the brittle surface of an eggshell. They're  special for their artistic quality, and they're special for their historical  significance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Folk Art  </P> <P> Much of this activity is in preparation for Sunday's open house, where a  selection of things Ukrainian will be on display and for sale from noon to 5  p.m.  </P> <P> Visitors can view hundreds of decorated Easter eggs, ritual breads and  watercolors of folk scenes, some by San Francisco artist Katerina Krychevsky  Rosandich, as well as other displays, demonstrations and cold buffet foods  traditionally served in Ukrainian homes at Easter time. The center is at 4315  Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 668-0172.  </P> <P> The front of the building says: Ukrainian Cultural Center; the upstairs rooms  are occupied by the Ukrainian Art Center.  </P> <P> Founded in 1980 and incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1986, the  center was established not only to "preserve and develop Ukrainian folk arts .  . . but to focus on artists of Ukrainian origin -- those who have developed  their art abroad as well as those who live, train and work in America."  </P> <P> According to Daria Chaikovsky, an executive-board member, there are about  20,000 Ukrainians in the area from Ventura County to Orange County, though only  about 5,000 are active in Ukrainian pursuits.  </P> <P> The eventual goal is to establish a permanent home for Ukrainian arts on the  West Coast. Run completely by volunteers, the center is supported by a core  group of 105 members.  </P> <P> However, it is not just a showplace for art; it's a place for hands-on  experience, such as creating beautiful eggs at Easter time.  </P> <P> "We have four distinct programs a year," Chaikovsky explained. "The first one  is the egg painting (pysanky), which ends with the Easter holidays. In May, we  start the embroidery program, which ends with an exhibit. In September, we have  the ceramics course, and in November, we begin the Christmas ornaments." There  are future plans to have culinary classes, music and film programs and possibly  folk dancing.  </P> <P> Recently, Adrianna Wrzesniewski taught the beginners in pysanky in one room and  her mother, Zenovia, lectured in a smaller room as she kept an eye on her  advanced egg-painting class.  </P> <P> "The tiny designs have come (about) with our more sophisticated equipment. The  kystka (which holds the wax that lies on the design) was originally a small,  hollow bone. The original designs were simpler too -- suns, reindeers for food,  etc. to give to the gods in spring. The colors also were simpler and more  faded. The (symbolism on the) eggs, whose origins go back to pagan times, were  then absorbed by the Ukrainians when they accepted Christianity in 988, and the  pagan designs took on religious meanings."  </P> <P> The eggs are done during the Lenten season and are presented during the year  for different occasions: births, Christenings, weddings, illnesses and even  deaths. Far from being just decorative, the eggs contain a whole message from  decorator to receiver. Wrzesniewski explained: "They are a talisman, a wish.  Every line means something; every color represents something different."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Painting Process  </P> <P> The first design placed on an egg, from end to end, is the "everlasting line";  it has no beginning and no end and, according to Wrzesniewski, "It puts your  soul and the receiver's soul into eternity."  </P> <P> Flowers stand for beauty, leaves for growth, pine cones or pine needles for  tears of love; the pine tree itself stands for health. Any part of an animal  depicted stands for wealth (antlers or ram's horns frequently are used) and the  more the design is repeated, the more wealth.  </P> <P> As for the colors, yellow (usually the egg is dipped first in the egg-coloring  process) represents good harvest, white is purity, red is love, green is for  growth (spiritual, physical and mental, as well as plant growth), blue is regal  and represents water and the sky, and black is for remembrance.  </P> <P> Wrzesniewski insisted that it takes only two or three eggs to get a handle on  this very delicate work, and a few days' steady work to finish one egg  utilizing several colors. Of course, the bigger the egg, the longer the time,  up to a week for intricate work on an ostrich egg. The process of coloring is  much like batik. As the egg is dyed, brightest colors first, wax is laid over  them to keep them from being covered over by succeeding colors, with black, of  course, being the last color used. The dyes themselves are alkaline and  developed especially for this process. Then the wax is melted off, and  underneath lies the glory of a pysanka.  </P> <P> Bernice Boddie of Los Angeles smiled when asked why she took up such  painstaking work. "You do have to have patience," she said, "but this is  different and it's fun. Anything to do with my hands, I want to do it." Martha  Haber from Long Beach agreed: "It is fun -- and I love eggs. I've done egg  crafts for several years."  </P></p>

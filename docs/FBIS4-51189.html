			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, 5 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Hong Hu,  vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring Economic  System, talked recently about the issue of establishing a modern  Chinese enterprise system in Shanghai. He said that a modern  enterprise system is an enterprise system with Chinese  characteristics. Modern technology and management methods can  be introduced from other countries, but the modern enterprise  system cannot be introduced from other countries. It is  necessary to proceed from China's own national conditions, fully  absorb and adopt things of universal character in this country,  and make explorations and creations according to successful  experience.    Hong Hu said: China's modern enterprise system should take  public ownership as the mainstay, with various economic elements  developing together; take the distribution of income according  to work as the main form, with various forms of distribution  existing side by side; and ensure the role of party  organizations and workers' democratic management.    He pointed out that the modern enterprise system is the  orientation of enterprise reform under different ownership  systems, but it is mainly the orientation of the state-owned  enterprises.    Hong Hu said that the modern enterprise system is an  enterprise system under the socialist market economic structure,  but it is not the only enterprise system.    Hong Hu said: A modern enterprise system is the foundation  of the structure of China's market. According to the essential  requirements of the modern enterprise system, reform should  mainly be carried out by governments, but enterprises also have  to do a great deal themselves.</p>

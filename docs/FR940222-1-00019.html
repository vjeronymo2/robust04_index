			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The passive business and the small business concern are both obligated on the note evidencing the SBA guaranteed loan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The collateral for the financial assistance includes a lien on the property and an assignment of the lease (including options exercisable by the small business concern) between the passive business and the small business concern, and such lease has a remaining term at least equal to the term of the SBA guaranteed loan; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Each person who is a principal as defined in this paragraph (e) must provide a personal guarantee, and &sect;120.103&hyph;2(c) (relating to collateral) is applicable to all persons enumerated therein who are associated with either entity; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) For purposes of this paragraph (e), a person is a ``principal'' if he or she is the legal or beneficial owner of at least 20 percent of both the passive business and the small business concern to which the passive business intends to lease real or personal property. If the passive business exists in the form of a trust, the trust's grantor or trustee would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern, and a beneficiary of at least 20 percent of the trust's assets would be a ``principal'' if he or she also owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern. If members of the same family (father, mother, son, daughter, wife, husband, brother or sister) meet the 20 percent ownership requirement in both the passive business and the small business concern they would be considered to be the same ``principal'' for SBA purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 16, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Erskine B.

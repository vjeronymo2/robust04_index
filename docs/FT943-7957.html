			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Crockfords bets on Woodcock One of Britain's top casinos has recruited one of Britain's top bobbies to keep an eye on things. Sir John Woodcock, 62, a former chief inspector of constabulary, is joining the board of Crockfords, owner of one of London's most profitable casinos. Crockfords, which came to the stock market last year through a reverse takeover of TV-am, is keen to be regarded as the blue chip company in the gambling sector. Sir John's appointment as a non-executive director is designed to help fulfil this ambition. He is a former chief constable of both North Yorkshire and South Wales and was a principal adviser on policing matters to the Home Secretary between 1990 and 1993. The Home Office has always taken a close interest in Britain's gaming industry because of concerns that the huge sums of cash passing over casino tables would attract criminal elements. Gary Nesbitt, 51, Crockfords' chairman, said that Sir John will bring the number ofnon-executives to five and thus mean that the non-executives are in a majority on his board.</p>

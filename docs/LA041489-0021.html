			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAT TO GO ON PROWL FOR SAN DIEGO AUTO THIEVES  </P> <P> Faced with dramatic increases in San Diego auto thefts, anxious motorists have  gone to great lengths to protect their vehicles.  </P> <P> Expensive alarms, identification numbers etched on car windows and hidden  ignition kill switches are some of the anti-theft measures.  </P> <P> Now, add one more method.  </P> <P> San Diego police unveiled a plan this week that may give vehicle owners an  innovative and cheap way to thwart auto thieves: a highly visible yellow decal  affixed to the auto's rear window and a promise by its owner not to drive  during the hours of 1 and 5 a.m.  </P> <P> The voluntary program, dubbed CAT -- for Combat Auto Theft -- officially begins  Saturday, according to Deputy Police Chief Mike Rice, who unveiled it Wednesday  during a news conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Started in New York  </P> <P> A duplicate of a program in New York that started in 1986, CAT was embraced by  San Diego police officials after they heard of its success. The curfew between  1 and 5 a.m. was chosen because most vehicles are stolen during that time, Rice  said.  </P> <P> By enrolling in the program and signing a waiver, the owner consents to  investigative stops by police during those hours.  </P> <P> "The impact of them (the decals) is police officers will be seeking these  stickers out, and they will be vigorously stopping cars with them," Rice said.  </P> <P> According to statistics from the New York Police Department, the program there  has cut auto theft about 40%, Rice said. Although the program has been lauded  as being ingeniously frugal, some civil libertarians have raised questions  about a signed consent form that waives the Fourth Amendment right of illegal  search and seizure.  </P> <P> The Automobile Club of Southern California is underwriting the program and has  printed 10,000 decals and 20,000 brochures, said Daniel Beyer, assistant claims  manager of the San Diego branch. Thus far, $2,200 has been spent on the  program's materials, he said.  </P> <P> To participate, vehicle owners fill out a registration form -- kept by police  -- stating that they do not drive between 1 and 5 a.m.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inviting a Stop  </P> <P> If they or anyone they lend the vehicle to drives at those hours, they  understand that they will be subject to a stop if the police spot the decal,  which bears a picture of a cat and the registered serial number on file with  police. The form also keeps a record of the year and make of the vehicle, phone  numbers to reach the owner and the vehicle's identification number.  </P> <P> Enrollment will be handled by the 10 community relations offices in the city.  </P> <P> Lt. Charlie Grimm, of the department's auto theft detail unit, said on average  there are about 60 vehicles stolen each day in San Diego. In 1988, auto thefts  soared 32% from the 18,583 reported in 1987 to 24,470, although the unit has  seen a drop in the first quarter of this year.  </P> <P> Grimm said the department recently formed a strike unit to reduce auto thefts  by zeroing in on chop shops (where stolen vehicles are altered and stripped)  and series thefts by organized groups.  </P> <P> "The problem has been so great, I haven't concentrated on a certain area,"  Grimm said.  </P> <P> Besides enrolling in the CAT program, Grimm recommended that vehicle owners  install some type of alarm. He said owners should take as many precautions as  they can.  </P> <P> "I don't know how anyone can go out and buy a new car today without investing  in some type of alarm. They've got to be crazy."  </P></p>

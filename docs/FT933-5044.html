			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / People: Bodies politic Bridget Bloom, formerly agricultural correspondent of the Financial Times, has been made a part-time commissioner of the Forestry Commission. The appointment comes as the future of the Commission is being reviewed by an inter-ministerial committee, with privatisation an option. Bloom, 56, was the FT's Africa and later its defence correspondent, before taking up the agriculture beat. She retired from the paper last year and is a part-time commissioner of the Meat and Livestock Commission. While writing for the FT she was strongly critical of government forestry policy, until the abolition in 1988 of tax concessions that had encouraged wealthy individuals to invest in large-scale tree-planting. Seven of the 11 members of the Forestry Commission, its board of directors, are non-executive. The performance of the non-executives is strongly criticised in a submission by the Institute of Chartered Foresters to a government review. The Institute said it suspected that improvements in the running of the Commission had been 'achieved in spite of the non-executive commissioners, not because of them'.</p>

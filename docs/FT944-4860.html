			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Derivative users 'lack refined controls of risk' Only a minority of companies and institutions using financial derivatives to hedge risks has adopted the most sophisticated risk management techniques recommended by banks and derivatives traders, a survey has found. The survey by the Group of Thirty, a Washington-based group of bankers that has been influential in the debate on derivatives, found that derivatives users such as industrial companies still lag behind banks in risk controls. Only 8 per cent of the 149 'end users' surveyed reported using 'value at risk' methods of portfolio valuation, and 42 per cent subjected their derivatives portfolios to 'stress tests' to measure their value in volatile markets. The survey found that derivatives dealers such as banks and investment banks had tightened standards since the G30 issued recommendations 18 months ago. Senior managers of derivatives dealers were better informed about derivatives risks. The survey follows legal action by companies against Bankers Trust, the US bank, over sales of leveraged interest rate swaps, and is likely to add to debate over whether institutions that buy derivatives are aware of their financial risks. Despite a G30 recommendation that all users should set up an independent risk management function, only 39 per cent of companies managed market risks of derivatives independently, while 50 per cent managed credit risks independently. Mr Charles Taylor, executive director of the G30, said that some derivatives users might not need such sophisticated risk management methods because they had relatively small and simple portfolios. However, Mr Taylor said the G30 had 'some ongoing concern' about the relatively low use of 'value at risk' methods, the lack of stress testing and 'some big gaps' in financial information disclosed by dealers. Mr Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, executive vice president of Deutsche Bank, said at a briefing in London that his bank intended to improve disclosure standards by setting out its overall market risk position in its 1994 annual report. The survey found improvements in dealers' practices. The proportion using stress testing rose from 19 per cent before the G30 recommendations in July 1993 to 54 per cent, with another 39 per cent planning to do so within a year. There was greater monitoring of derivatives' activities by senior managers of banks. The proportion of dealers whose senior management reviewed controls had risen by 25 percentage points since July 1993 to 99 per cent. The 'value at risk' method of calculating how much of a dealer's capital is at risk from future market movements was used by 43 per cent of dealers, with a further 37 per cent saying they would adopt it within a year. Ms Gay Evans, chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, said that she was 'very happy' that the survey confirmed anecdotal evidence that dealers were tightening risk management controls.

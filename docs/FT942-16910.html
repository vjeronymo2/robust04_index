			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei further improves as regional markets rebound The sharp upturn on Wall Street and the yen's slight retreat against the dollar moved the Nikkei 225 average moderately higher yesterday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index added 133.53 at 19,696.74 after a day's low of 19,636.33 and high of 19,878.28. Institutional investors and foreigners were seen buying, while the overnight advance on the Chicago futures market also prompted arbitrage-linked purchases. Technical selling ahead of tomorrow's option settlements eroded some of the gains. Traders said some investors were still nervous about fluctuations on the New York stock market, while the domestic political situation also kept some people away. The opposition Liberal Democrats have been heightening calls for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to clarify his dealings with Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company alleged to have loaned him Y100m. In the latest twist of events, Mr Hosokawa was quoted as saying he wanted to resign on Tuesday, causing an uproar within the coalition and the opposition parties. Volume rose to 340m shares from 223m, with increased participation from overseas investors returning to the market after the Easter holidays. Advances led falls by 743 to 285, with 144 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks gained 11.58 at 1,600.41 and the Nikkei 300 put on 1.91 at 292.99. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.47 to 1,310.81. Some speculative favourites gained ground on individual buying: Sumitomo Coal Mining moved ahead Y48 to Y903 and Honshu Paper Y40 to Y788. Machinery makers, seen as laggards recently, were firmer. Okuma rose Y21 to Y821 and Amada Y60 to Y1,160. Textiles were also higher, Toyobo adding Y19 at Y470 and Toray Industries Y30 at Y695. Continued concern over its call rate rise hit Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which declined Y6,000 to Y900,000. Earlier this week the cabinet raised worries over the possible negative impact of the planned rise in a number of public utility rates on the sluggish economy. Foreign selling hurt Fuji Photo Film, which weakened Y50 to Y2,130. Some high-technology issues were lower on profit-taking, with Sony losing Y10 at Y5,990. Toyota Motor receded Y10 to Y1,990 and Honda Motor declined Y40 to Y1,660. In Osaka, the OSE average closed 277.36 higher at 21,963.79 in volume of 17.6m shares. In spite of the rise in the index, Aoyama Trading, the men's suits retailer, shed Y200 to Y5,390 on profit-taking. Roundup Wall Street's overnight rally provided the impetus for sharp rises in markets throughout the region. HONG KONG rallied sharply on a technical rebound, although profit-taking pulled prices off the day's highs. The Hang Seng index ended 204.40, or 2.3 per cent, up at 9,234.31, having been 346 points ahead at the morning peak. Blue chip property shares closed mixed after being propelled by strong bargain hunting early in the day. SHK Properties rose HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 54.50 and Cheung Kong added 25 cents at HKDollars 39.75. AUSTRALIA moved firmly ahead at the opening, the All Ordinaries index testing the 2,100 resistance level for the first time in a week, before the market edged back to finish 34.1 higher on the day at 2,084.1. BHP surged 38 cents to ADollars 16.74 and CRA gained 28 cents at ADollars 16.76, while News Corp pulled back from a day's high of ADollars 9.37 to close 3 cents ahead at ADollars 9.15. SINGAPORE was broadly higher, although late profit-taking left prices off their peaks as an uncertain mood continued to prevail. The Straits Times Industrial index gained 54.08, or 2.6 per cent, at 2,115.57. KUALA LUMPUR rose 2.7 per cent, the composite index adding 25.20 at 964.51, although doubts were expressed about the rally being sustained. TAIWAN traded higher as demand by domestic trust funds for electronics issues intensified in late business, on expectations of good results to come, although interest in other sectors was limited. The weighted index rose 60.88 to 5,481.86 in turnover that expanded to TDollars 50.02bn. MANILA surged at the close on a technical rally which took the composite index 47.33, or 1.8 per cent, higher to 2,680.01, although volume was very low. SEOUL continued the technical advance which began on Monday, although trading remained slow in the absence of fresh factors. The compos-ite index closed 2.57 stronger at 863.04. NEW ZEALAND rebounded from Tuesday's low for the year, the NZSE-40 capital index moving forward 73.49, or 3.6 per cent, to 2,122.66. BOMBAY was mildly higher on speculative demand triggered by hopes that foreign investors and Indian mutual funds would soon return as buyers. The BSE 30-share index finished 30.57 firmer at 3,842.72. KARACHI bounced, prompting expectations of a further rise today. The KSE 100-share index gained 19.83 at 2,432.90.</p>

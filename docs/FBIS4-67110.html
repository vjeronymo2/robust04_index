Al-Ruwayli is considered one  of the most dangerous drug traffickers and gun smugglers across  Arab borders. He uses drug smuggling in striking arms deals and  smuggling these arms to Arab states.    It is feared that this smuggler was involved in supplying  weapons to extremist groups to carry out terrorist acts.  Members of these groups in Jordan were arrested recently.    According to Arab sources, this smuggler is now charged with  smuggling drugs and arms in many Arab states including Yemen,  Algeria, and Egypt. [passage omitted]</p>

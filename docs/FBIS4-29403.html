			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 16 (YONHAP) -- The United  States held an informal meeting Thursday afternoon with the 10  non-permanent members of the UN Security Council to discuss a  draft resolution on sanctions against North Korea.    U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright  told  reporters that although North Korea had signaled reconciliation  in talks with former American leader Jimmy Carter, President  Bill Clinton instructed her to continue discussions with the  council members on sanctions against North Korea.    Asked how the new offer by North Korea would affect the push  for sanctions, she said she could not disclose it as the U.S.  Government was studying the proposal.    In view of remarks by Assistant Secretary of State Robert  Gallucci that Washington would consider holding a third round of  talks with Pyongyang, the members of the Security Council are  expected to slow down their sanctions deliberations.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Santa Barbara's City Council voted 6 to 0 to reject further city youth program  contributions from the local Elks Lodge because of the group's recent rejection  of two black membership applicants. Elks leaders insist the lodge does not  condone racism and blamed the rejections on a few members, noting that it takes  only three to turn down an applicant. Woody Wodarczak, the local exalted ruler,  said the Elks donated $24,000 last year for disabled children.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter from V.V. Kadannikov of the All-Russia </F> Automobile Alliance group: "Two Billion Reward for Information"]    [Text] Blood was spilled yet again in Moscow 7 June.  Three shots, three terrorist acts, cost the lives of several of  our fellow citizens, and dozens of Russians received wounds.  The victims were a driver, a nurse, a worker, a housewife, and  the president of a company -- the criminals spare no one.  Especially those who carry out practical transformations in the  Russian economy and defend people's right to a dignified life.    Boris Berezovskiy, general director of the All-Russian  Automobile Alliance, was wounded 7 June. It was pure chance  that one of the initiators of a major Russian project in which  millions of Russians have put their faith and invested their  savings survived. His comrade standing nearby was killed.    It has become clear once and for all that a parallel power  of  criminals and murderers is arising in Russia.    Those who support the president and the government, who are  trying to revive the economy, demand that a stop be put to the  existing mayhem forthwith. Both organized crime and the state  executive apparatus must finally understand: Enough is enough!    We demand that emergency measures be adopted to ensure the  safety of Russian citizens. If the law-enforcement organs need  extraordinary powers to do this, they must be given them; if  additional material and financial resources are needed, they  will be provided.    Our demand is that the criminals be found. We accordingly  announce that anyone who provides information leading to the  exposure of the instigators and perpetrators of the terrorist  act perpetrated against the leadership and staffers of the  All-Russia Automobile Alliance will be paid a reward of two  billion rubles. We guarantee confidentiality.</p>

Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), said, "it is hard to tell whether  Japan's economy is at this stage capable of rapidly recovering.  We have problems like the yen's surge and asset deflation."    Referring to reports that the United States may revive its  Super 301 trade legislation, Hiraiwa said, "I hope the U.S.  will not take such punitive measures against Japan." He said  that instead "Japan needs to carry out practical and concrete  steps...to stimulate domestic demand, relax various government  regulations, and open up its markets."</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / The Afghan Crisis: Guerrillas no longer a joke as Kabul falls - The taking of the capital DURING the long years of civil war, the Afghan mujahideen guerrillas have often been ridiculed for incompetence. But the speed with which they have taken over the country in the past two weeks - and the capital Kabul on Saturday - indicates a well-conceived and executed operation. Kabul fell like a pack of cards. At daybreak, the army and the paramilitary forces still had control, although the reality of power had slipped from them as the regime made clear its willingness to hand over power to an interim mujahideen administration. The guerrillas started to slip into the capital in large numbers from Wednesday night. That day, a long column of Mr Ahmed Shah Masood's Jamiat-i-Islami fighters headed for the capital. He now says that he moved more rapidly than he had intended because he feared a coup attempt involving his rival mujahideen leader, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. He accuses the latter, leader of the most fundamentalist of the Islamic guerrilla groups, Hezb-i-Islam, of conspiracy with Mr Raz Mohammad Pakteen, interior minister, and with General Manukay Mangel. All these are hardline Pushtun, who dominate in the south of the country, opposed to hegemony over Afghanistan by non-Pushtun minorities. By Friday night, all the main mujahideen groups had smuggled heavily armed guerrillas into the capital with the tacit support of the security forces. They broke cover on Saturday morning, shortly after the announcement from Peshawar in Pakistan of an agreement on an interim administration. The different guerrilla groups competed for control of key installations. Apart from the interior ministry, the Hezb gained control of the foreign ministry, parts of the president's palace, and districts of Mekroyan where the Russian supporters of the outgoing regime used to live. The Hezb also won a national guard post in the centre of the city where they unlocked the armoury and distributed weapons. But the Hezb were easily outnumbered by the Mr Masood's Jamiat and other groups supporting him. At the army's arsenal in Kabul, the Jamiat arrived before the Hezb. 'We got here first. The Hezb came and left,' said Mohammad Tahirr, a Jamiat commander, grinning with pleasure. At the Afghan television station, officials in charge had called in the Jamiat and General Rashid Dostam's Uzbek forces - mainly mercenaries who have been in a loose alliance with Mr Masood's guerrillas - to maintain control. Almost everywhere the army and security forces handed over control immediately and then stopped to chat with the newly arrived mujahideen. By mid-afternoon, the streets were almost empty. Mujahideen began hijacking a few cars and trucks, hoisting the green Islamic flag and touring the town crying jubilant slogans. Some vehicles carried portraits of the late Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. Mujahideen set up check-points in different parts of the city. There were areas where nerves were strained. Opposite the interior ministry, where the Hezb were in command, the Jamiat had taken over the headquarters of Khad, the secret police. The Hezb kept watch with their fingers on their triggers. When driving towards the defence ministry, my car was turned back by a guerrilla who threateningly pointed a rocket-launcher at it. For all that, it was open day in the Afghan capital in a way probably never seen before. I walked into the Khad hospital to find the the director and two of his colleagues terrified by the sudden turn of events. At an anti-aircraft centre in the south of the city, a smiling air force commander had just handed over to a group of guerrillas, the Shia Whadad group made up of Hazaras from central Afghanistan. At nightfall, the city was tense and in the hands of heavily armed guerrillas, many of whom had never been to the capital before. At about 7.30 pm, tracer fire signal flares began to light the sky, tentatively at first and then in a crescendo of celebration. For much of the night, Kabul echoed to machine-gun and artillery fire, while red and yellow flares hung overhead.</p>

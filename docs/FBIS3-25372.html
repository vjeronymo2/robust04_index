			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Good evening. The negotiators are holding lengthy  talks in a bid to find common ground concerning the general  principles for national reconciliation. At this stage, the  mediators virtually have no idea of how to approach the third  version of the general principles because the National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to say no to  discussing legal issues.    After this afternoon's session, sources reported that there  were many areas of agreement. There are no agreements yet  concerning general national reconciliation principles because  UNITA does not want to discuss the legal side of the dossier.  Both the government and the mediators believe that the dossier  should be discussed both along political and legal lines.    The mediators and the observers have undertaken to work with  the UNITA team this evening in a bid to settle the problem.  They will attempt to persuade UNITA to accept discussions that  can always fall back on the country's existing legal framework.    A source said that if the mediators manage to get UNITA to  agree to that, perhaps there might be an agreement on the  general principles of national reconciliation by tomorrow. That  source noted, that the issue of the general national  reconciliation principle is just the first part of the dossier.  In a clear reference to the issue of the ministerial portfolios  and specific national reconciliation principles, that source  said that heated talks are on the way. They will try to do away  with possible loopholes to avoid any complications when those  principles are implemented. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has made the following  statement: The Government of the Republic of Yemen has been  eager to deal with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924 out of  its desire to end the rebellion in our country and spare the  pure Yemeni blood. It emphasized on more than one occasion that  its acceptance of this stems from the letter and spirit of the  resolution, which was issued in accordance with the provisions  and principles of the UN Charter, which guarantees the  sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all  states. Accordingly, the Government of the Republic of Yemen  pursued all possible means to entrench the cease-fire and thus  prevent the rebels and those standing behind them from  prolonging the conflict, shedding more Yemeni blood, and  internationalizing an internal problem. Our people have  encountered this problem and our valiant Armed Forces have  foiled its aims.    Out of its concern to put an end to those desperate  attempts,  the Government of the Republic of Yemen made a fourth attempt to  entrench the cease-fire. The Yemeni members of the military  committee, formed by the brother chairman of the Presidential  Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces before the  rebels exploded the military situation in preparation for their  secessionist announcement, were instructed to entrench the  cease-fire. Despite that sincere initiative, the secessionist  rebels immediately rejected it and shamelessly demanded  international observers in the country, to be appointed by the  UN Security Council. They have thus disregarded the fact that  the Government of the Republic of Yemen has on more than  occasion categorically rejected this.    Concluding, the source said: News media reports said our  country has accepted a proposal the rebels presented to brother  Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's fact-finding envoy.  This proposal was immediately rejected in part and parcel  because it is in spirit and content a flagrant violation of UN  Security Council Resolution No. 924; it also conflicts with it  in letter and spirit. The source added that the maximum that our  country has expressed readiness to accept is to discuss the  possibility of reactivating the entire joint military committee,  formed upon a decision by the brother chairman of the  Presidential Council and the supreme commander of the Armed  Forces.    It is noteworthy that the joint military committee mentioned  in the statement consists of six high-ranking Yemeni Armed  Forces officers, five Jordanian officers, five Omani officers,  the American military attache, and the French military attache.</p>

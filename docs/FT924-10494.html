			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities mixed as investors ignore data Wall Street US SHARE prices were mixed in heavy trading as investors shrugged off bad economic news and the latest opinion polls on the presidential race, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.13 at 3,246.27. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also little changed at the finish, up just 0.72 at 420.85. Secondary indices, however, fared better because of stronger demand from investors for small and medium-sized stocks. The Amex composite closed 2.29 higher at 381.29, and the Nasdaq composite, which performed best of all, finished up 4.43 at 605.82. Turnover on the NYSE was high at 206m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 959 to 772. The day's economic news - an 8,000 rise in weekly jobless claims - had little impact on investors. Although the rise in claims was bigger than expected, it was not enough to unsettle the market. Similarly, investors chose to pay little attention to reports that the gap in opinion polls between Governor Clinton and President Bush has narrowed. The polls have become extremely volatile in the final week of the campaign, and the uncertainty over the result - even if the President's chances of re-election look brighter - is proving more of a hindrance than a help to market. Among individual stocks, the final batch of third quarter corporate reports continued to trickle in. General Motors eased slightly in early trading but finished unchanged at Dollars 31 3/8 in busy trading after the troubled motor manufacturer announced a quarterly loss of Dollars 752.9m, an improvement from the loss of more than Dollars 1bn at the same stage a year earlier. The figures were in line with analysts' forecasts. Ford, which reported its earnings earlier in the week, fell Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 37 1/4 after the securities house Lehman Brothers downgraded its 1992 and 1993 profits estimates for the company. Chrysler was slightly firmer, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 27 1/8 . Data General dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 10 7/8 in turnover of more than 1m shares after the company reported net income of just 1 cent a share, down sharply from the 53 cents a share earned in the same quarter of 1991. US Surgical fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 3/8 after the company told analysts that October sales were below expectations. The stock was also damaged by negative comments about sales by the broking house Hambrecht &amp; Quist. Canada TORONTO stocks closed steady in another day of extremely active trading. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose just 1.30 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 3,336.01. Advances led declines 329 to 242, volume of 45.2m shares was below the previous 49.9m shares, and trading value was CDollars 359.8m against CDollars 495.6m. The 14 stock groups were evenly split between winners and losers.</p>

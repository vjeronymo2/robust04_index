			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Unilever to shed five business units UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, has put up for sale most of its agribusiness interests. The decision will result in an extraordinary charge of about Pounds 60m after tax against 1991 fourth-quarter profits. The disposal plans cover five business units with 4,000 employees and total annual sales of about Pounds 500m. Unilever said the planned disposals were in line with its policy of focusing on core activities. It was in talks with prospective buyers for several of the businesses and was actively seeking other bidders. The businesses to be sold are: BOCM Silcock, the UK's leading animal feeds supplier, with about 18 per cent of the market. The business, which includes Paul &amp; Vincent, an Irish animal feeds company, and several smaller interests, had sales of Pounds 320m in 1990. Industry analysts estimate its operating profits at about Pounds 20m in 1990. Marine Harvest International, Scotland's largest salmon producer, accounting for about a quarter of total production. The company also has fisheries in Chile and prawn farming operations. It had 1990 sales of Pounds 50m and is estimated to have lost about Pounds 15m that year because of falling Scottish salmon prices. Marine Harvest, which employs 600 people, said its performance in Scotland improved sharply last year, and it expected to benefit from better salmon prices this year. Barenbrug, a geographically diversified group of 10 grass-breeding companies. Unilever has a 60 per cent stake in the group, which it has offered to the other shareholder, Barbelle of the Netherlands. The group has annual sales of about Pounds 50m. The other interests on sale are Malta Clayton, a Mexican animal feeds operation, with annual sales of Pounds 80m, and a 76 per cent stake in AMI, a small Italian corn hybrid breeder. The Pounds 60m charge, arising from the write-off of goodwill and expected losses on some of the assets to be sold, will almost exactly offset a Pounds 63m extraordinary fourth-quarter gain from Unilever's disposal of the 4P packaging group last year. Unilever, which had agribusiness sales of Pounds 797m in 1990, plans to retain its Cambridge-based plant breeding operation and its tea and palm plantations. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Observer: Oiling the rungs Oil explorers are not normally the politest bunch. Hence there is some surprise at the remarkable civility of Enterprise Oil's hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo. Both sides have been busy dissecting each other's record and cost of finding oil, and have avoided getting into personal slanging matches about the size of the chairman's expense account, etc. This may all change in a week or two. However, there is a possible explanation as to why Enterprise's criticisms of Lasmo management, a key part of its offensive, have so far been relatively muted. Could it be that Graham Hearne, Enterprise's chairman and chief executive, may try to rally flagging City support for his bid by offering Joe Darby, Lasmo's chief executive, the same position in a combined company? That would be a bit tricky if he had trashed Darby's reputation in the battle. Stranger things have happened. After all, Hearne is 11 years older than Darby and his reputation in the City would be enhanced if he agreed to split his own role as chairman and chief executive. And no doubt the problem of what to do with Lasmo chairman Rudolph Agnew could be solved with a handsome cash settlement.</p>

It was the first meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint  Economic Committee since its activities were suspended in 1988.  A joint statement was issued at the end of the meeting.    According to Chinese officials who took part in the meeting,  the successful convocation of the meeting was of positive  significance in narrowing the differences in economic  cooperation between the two countries, opening up broad  prospects for economic cooperation, and improving and developing  Sino-U.S. relations.    The Joint Economic Committee was established on the  agreement  between Deng Xiaoping and then U.S. President Carter during  Deng's visit to the United States in January 1979. The  committee, as a center of Sino-U.S. economic exchange and  cooperation, aims to coordinate and supervise the orderly  development of economic relations between the two countries.    It convened seven sessions from 1980 to 1987. The resumed  session today was convened upon the proposal of the U.S. side.    Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli and the head of U.S.  delegation and Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen cochaired the  meeting.    After reviewing the Sino-U.S. relations in economic  cooperation, Liu Zhongli said: China and the United States  share broad mutual interests. The two countries are strongly  supplementary to each other in economy, trade, and many other  fields. The potential is great and the prospects are broad for  developing mutually beneficial cooperation.    Bentsen said: The United States welcomed the progress China  has achieved in its market-oriented economic reforms. An open  and vigorous Chinese economy will not only promote the  prosperity and stability of Asia, but provide important  opportunities for American businesses and help create jobs for  Americans as well.    The two sides exchanged views on such issues as China's  reentry into GATT, the MFN issue, and the implementation of the  three memorandums of understanding with regard to intellectual  property rights, prison products, and market access, as well as  the issue of multilateral development organizations.    During the session, delegates of both sides delivered  speeches on special topics such as finance and taxation,  banking, foreign trade, and external investment. The speakers  on the Chinese side included Liu Jibin, vice finance minister;  Chen Yuan, vice governor of the People's Bank of China; and Gu  Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation.    During the session, the two sides also agreed that the ninth  session of the joint economic committee would be held next year  in Washington D.C.</p>

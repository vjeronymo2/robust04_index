			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSIDER MOVING SITE OF MOTOCROSS  </P> <P> The recent Azusa Planning Committee meeting was asked to consider public  nuisance charges against the Eagles Lodge motocross, which included noise,  pollution and sanitation violations. In defense of the (motocross), a former  mayor of Azusa implied that because the neighbors are of the  "Johnny-come-lately" variety, they had no right to complain. This from a person  one would expect to head a welcoming committee for new citizens.  </P> <P> First there was a denial of violations of time limitations. When such  violations were proven, the (motocross advocates) claimed they were unaware of  their existence. They claimed the operation is for the benefit of children to  keep them out of trouble with drugs, alcohol, etc.  </P> <P> I suggest there are religious groups who would be happy to provide a copy of  the Ten Commandments, which would teach them to tell the truth and respect  their neighbor. With respect to noise, I would like to have someone tell me of  a sport (hockey, football, baseball, basketball) that requires play-by-play  description over an excessively loud P.A. system for spectators who are able to  see the action. Certainly neighbors within a quarter-mile radius have no  interest in race results.  </P> <P> A suggestion with which I heartily agree was to study the possibility of having  the events removed to a rural area, which is what this area was when permission  was first granted.  </P> <P> BERT GUENTERT  </P> <P> Azusa  </P></p>

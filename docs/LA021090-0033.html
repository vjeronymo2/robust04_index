			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> (TA'YER) OPENS HIGHWAYS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The multicultural performance collective, (Ta'yer), opened Highways'  2-month-long Sex, God &amp; Politics Performance Festival on Thursday evening  with a program called "Love and Revenge." Composed of artists whose levels of  competence vary widely, the event seesaws between the naive and the  sophisticated, with honors for charm and talent going to Betty Gonzales Nash  and Luis Alfaro.  </P> <P> Nash, a fiery actress/dancer, co-wrote and performed with Alfaro a funny,  touching exploration of how gender and role expectations interfere with genuine  expressions of love. Both begin the piece in identical gorgeously pleated,  black-and-red costumes, later shed to reveal a black lace dress on Alfaro and  toreador drag on Nash. Titled "Relationships," the writing of the piece lacks  specificity, but the performances are remarkable in their complexity and range.  </P> <P> The yoke between sex and politics was firmly established decades ago in the  revolutions of the '60s. Thus Mary Ann Tamaki's preachy, treacle-sweet "What  Time Is It?" proved an anachronistic embarrassment. She distributes sprays of  flowers to audience members, urging them to become the "we generation," as a  home movie of downtown street life flickers on the wall behind her.  </P> <P> Salvadoran guitarist Luis Lopez plays and sings Latin American love songs for  "a time of war" in his appealing fusion style. Colombian architect/writer  Fernando D. Castro offers "Mark's Poem," a baffling exercise about sex, drugs  and violence in a gay Latino community. Here, too, Alfaro's sequinned presence  is a treat, though his role is unclear.  </P> <P> The program, to be repeated tonight and Thursday, Friday and Saturday, closes  with "Valentine Confessions," aggressively amateur, by ensemble members.

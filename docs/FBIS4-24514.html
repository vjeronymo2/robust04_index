			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- Taiwan may ask Japan and  South Korea to adhere to a self-imposed limit on car exports to  the island after Taiwan opens its car market to foreign  countries, economic officials said Monday [30 May].    Taiwan, in a bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs  and  Trade, is planning to open the car market by lowering tariffs,  abolishing local content rate requirements and canceling  existing bans on imports from certain countries.    But Taiwan will follow the example of the United States and  the European Union and seek to reach "tacit agreements" with  Japan and South Korea, asking them to voluntarily set quotas on  their car exports to the island,    The officials explained that to ask a country which enjoys a  surplus to sign such a voluntary restraint agreement is not in  violation of the spirit of GATT. Japan had a trade surplus of  U.S.$15 billion last year, while South Korea's was U.S.$1  billion.    The government, in the meantime, will consider allowing  foreign carmakers to set up production here in a bid to "force"  the 11 local makers to streamline operations. Poorly performing  local makers then would be phased out in the face of stronger  competition brought in by the newcomers, they said.    The officials revealed that three foreign makers have  contacted the ministry on the possibility of setting up plants  in Taiwan.    According to an earlier assessment by the ministry, local  makers' market share will fall to 30 percent from the existing  50 percent after Taiwan enters GATT.</p>

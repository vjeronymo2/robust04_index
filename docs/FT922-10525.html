			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Bitter-sweet win awaits Labour: The battle for control of a city council ENTERPRISE and local government are hardly bedfellows, but things are changing. Gloucester City Council has moved, mayor and all, from the ancient Guildhall to an industrial warehouse on the edge of its now-defunct docks. The council paid Pounds 1 for its new home; it let the Guildhall for Pounds 3m - and in the process helped make the dockland a business and tourist magnet. Gloucester's docks symbolise Labour's trauma in middle England. They closed a few years after the defeat of the city's last Labour MP in 1970, and the city has had a Tory MP ever since. Yet Labour is the largest party on the city council - on which no party has overall control - and in next week's local elections looks set to make the single gain needed to take overall control. For Mr Kevin Stephens, leader of the Labour group on the council, it will be a bitter-sweet triumph: as the party's general election candidate, he was more than 6,000 votes behind the Tory. Why do the Tories enjoy national success but local failure? 'It's national factors: poll tax, cuts and the like,' says Mr Michael Pullon, Gloucester's Tory leader. 'Every year's local elections offer a chance to protest.' The Tory collapse has been steep and rapid: they ran the council until 1989, and in 10 years have dropped from 23 to 10 councillors (out of a total of 33). The election is taking a now-typical course: Labour almost unchallenged on the council estates of Matson, Tuffley and Coney Hill; the Tories competing with them in more 'mixed' areas; and a separate Tory-Liberal Democrat contest in the leafy groves of Kingsholme and Hucclecote. The Liberal Democrats' seven seats were all gained from the Tories. 'It's a secure but narrow base', says Mrs Mary Gould, the Liberal Democrat group's leader. The political battle on the council has an unreal quality. There are divisions aplenty, and real bitterness two years ago over plans by the outgoing Tory administration to hand the council's entire housing stock  - 6,200 tenants - to a housing association. Yet reacting to government policy - and working within its constraints  - is the main preoccupation of all three parties. All supported a poll tax (Pounds 309) at the government capping level - arguing mainly about how much should go to voluntary organisations. All are relieved that the city's manual-labour contracts were won by its own workforce. Furthermore, all are ardent supporters of the 'historic cities group', campaigning for the restoration of unitary county boroughs in cathedral cities. 'We have little in common with the rural parts of the county - 10 per cent of our population are from ethnic minorities, for a start,' says Mr Stephens. Were the group to succeed and education pass from the county to the city council, battles over Gloucester's four grammar schools might ensue. But with two opted-out and the others likely to follow, even there scope for intervention is contracting. Housing policy highlights the tensions graphically. For all the opprobium he attracted for his housing association plan, Mr Pullon is critical of government-imposed restraints, particularly the refusal to allow local authorities to use capital receipts for social housing. On having sunk Mr Pullon's housing association venture, Labour and the Liberal Democrats are now launching one of their own. The city council is proposing to grant land and development rights to Oxbode, a new association of whose 15 directors three will be from the council. If it secures registration, the association will use council land and funds from the Housing Corporation and private lenders to build social housing. Mrs Gould is candid: 'Oxbode was really seen an escape route for us if the Tories won - and we need it now if there is to be any new low-rent housing at all.' It is a similar picture with council services. 'Quality, accountability and efficiency are our watchwords', says Mr Stephens. If Labour takes over, he plans customer contracts, an autonomous ombudsman to deal with complaints, and proper redress for failures. On compulsory tendering, his fear is that white-collar employees are not showing 'as great a realisation as the blue-collar unions of the impact - and the need to respond'. The three leaders unite on another theme: the growing difficulty in finding people willing to stand for election, and the need for salaried councillors. 'We've got a Pounds 34m annual turnover: you've got to pay the going rate to get good managers,' says Mr Pullon. CONSERVATIVE councils will force pupils to 'pay as they learn', the Labour party said yesterday. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow education secretary, campaigning for next week's local government elections, said free state education was under threat and parents would have to pay more and more for their children's schooling because of government spending limits. The elections would be about 'higher standards in schools, better value for money and a rejection of the Tories' policy of 'pay as you learn',' he said. He said one Kent school, which he refused to name, was already charging pupils Pounds 12 each to buy essential books. A report last year found parents were paying Pounds 50m a year for classroom essentials. Mr Straw said other Conservative local education authorities were being forced to cut budgets to meet government spending targets. Many were leaving teacher vacancies unfilled and were planning new staff cuts.</p>

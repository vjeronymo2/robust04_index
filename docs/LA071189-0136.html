			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARRIOTT CORP. TO SELL AIRLINE CATERING DIVISION  </P> <P> Hotel and food service company Marriott Corp. said today it has agreed to sell  its airline catering division, Marriott In-Flite Services, to a group of  private investors for an undisclosed price.  </P> <P> The group, Caterair International, is led by Daniel Altobello, a Marriott  executive vice president, Frederic Malek, a Washington merchant banker and  former Marriott executive, and several members of the division's senior  management, the Washington-based company said.  </P> <P> Marriott said it will have an undisclosed financial interest in the business,  which had 1988 revenues of $800 million. It will continue to operate under the  Marriott In-Flite Services name.  </P> <P> The company said proceeds of the sale, which is expected to be completed by the  end of the year, will be used to repay debt.  </P> <P> Marriott said assets involved in the sale include an airline catering kitchen  owned by its Host International division. But it added that it "has no plans to  sell Host."  </P> <P> Later this summer, Marriott said, Host will move its headquarters from Santa  Monica, Calif., to Marriott's headquarters in suburban Washington.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say the airline catering division has suffered from thin  profit margins and has been vulnerable to uncertainties in the airline  business.  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Justice department may drop BCCI case THE BUSH administration may decide on health grounds not to go ahead with the prosecution of Mr Clark Clifford, the 85-year-old former defence secretary who was indicted in July on criminal charges related to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Mr Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his law partner and protege, were indicted in New York on charges of accepting bribes, conspiracy to commit fraud and misleading federal bank regulators. The Justice Department in Washington brought lesser charges of misleading regulators about the secret ownership by BCCI of First American Bankshares, the Washington bank. Although federal and state prosecutors have agreed that the New York trial should be held before Washington moves, a heart specialist has said Mr Clifford might suffer a fatal heart attack were he to stand trial. The Justice Department has said it might decide not to prosecute Mr Clifford for this reason. A senior US investigator noted, however, that the Justice Department's medical consultant had reviewed Mr Clifford's past medical records rather than Mr Clifford himself.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Oleg Padenko: The fact that yet another  nuclear submarine is being dismantled at the Zvezda Works was  immediately known in the Maritime Kray. After all, the question  immediately arose as to what to do with the water from the  submarine, polluted with radiation, since the notorious TNT-5  tanker, like others, is full to overflowing with  life-threatening waste. This is in the center of the Bolshoy  Kamen town, quite near to Vladivostok. [video shows port  facilities, vessels, residential buildings nearby]    Nor is there any protection against the impending disaster.  Local projects to treat the waste are unrealistic and the  Japanese assistance is hanging in the air.    It is precisely for this reason that the interdepartmental  commission working at the Zvezda Works made a sensational  decision on the necessity to discharge the liquid radioactive  waste into the Sea of Japan, as was done before, because nothing  else can be done.    Ahead is the dismantling of a further number of nuclear  submarines, more than 40.</p>

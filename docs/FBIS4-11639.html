			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi received Phalangist Party  leader Dr. George Sa'adah yesterday. Sa'adah said al-Hirawi  briefed him on the reasons prompting the government to postpone  granting permission to radio stations to broadcast news and  explained the recent suspension of newscasts. He said: I was  convinced of some reasons and now I am convinced of the others.  No one can bargain over the issue of freedom in Lebanon, he  said. He voiced his hope that the Council of Ministers will  settle this issue quickly.    Dr. Sa'adah spoke of the possibility of links between the  bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and the  Phalangist Party headquarters, expressing his confidence in the  Lebanese judiciary and urging patience.</p>

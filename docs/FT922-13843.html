			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Kinnock urges rejection of Tory 'failure' LABOUR leader Mr Neil Kinnock last night made an eve-of-poll appeal to voters to reject a 'Tory future of insecurity, rundown and division' and to allow a Labour government to build a Britain capable of becoming a 'pacemaker in Europe'. Mr Kinnock rounded off the campaign in his Islwyn constituency by pledging to his supporters that Labour would not only win today's election but would be re-elected at the next general election. He promised an end to the 'switch-back of boom and bust' and offered a future of steady advance. Earlier yesterday, Mr Kinnock told a rally in Barry, south Wales, that Britain wanted a government that pulled the country together and pushed it to greater achievements. He said the election would not be won as a result of three weeks' campaigning but because of the government's long record of 'failure and fracture'. The Labour leader said: 'The Tories cannot escape their own record. Tomorrow they will not escape the verdict of the people. People want rid of them.' Mr Kinnock said his government would immediately begin the task of getting Britain out of recession. The need to reconstruct its industries, sciences and skills was urgent, only eight months before Britain was forced to compete in the world's biggest single market. He highlighted Labour's programme for increased investment in education and in the National Health Service, and said a priority for Labour would be the building and repairing of homes so that families did not have to suffer 'the misery and insecurity of bad housing, overcrowding and homelessness'. Mr Kinnock accused the government of concentrating power in its hands and of becoming 'frenzied with deregulation in standards of safety and probity'. They had been hyperactive in cutting top tax rates and slicing bottom-rate benefits. Their failure to build up the economy and invest in the nation's future had been a matter of conviction and doctrine. Mr Kinnock said he wanted Britain to celebrate the coming millennium with something better than a big New Year's Eve party.</p>

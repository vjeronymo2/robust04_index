			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here today that Russia opposes the  Bosnian Serbs' attacks on Gorazde, but NATO air strikes against  the Serbs would escalate the violence in the former Yugoslavia.    Kozyrev told the INTERFAX news agency that the Serb attacks  on Gorazde "go far beyond reasonable military necessity" and  "the international community has the right to end the criminal  actions."    However, Kozyrev said, "massive NATO air strikes, I think,  will lead to an escalation of the conflict."    NATO issue an ultimatum in Brussels earlier today, ordering  the Serbs to stop offensives against the Muslim enclave of  Gorazde and pull their forces three kilometers away from the  center of the town by 02:01 local time on Sunday (0001 GMT), or  they will face NATO air raids.    The NATO also demanded the Serbs to grand access to the  United Nations peacekeepers and medical teams to the embattled  city of Goradze.    Russia had stressed time and again a diplomatic solution to  the Bosnian conflicts, complaining that NATO's previous air  strikes on the Serbs undermined the peace efforts.</p>

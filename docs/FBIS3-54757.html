			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shelikhov, deputy general director </F> of the Russian Federation Federal Postal Communications  Administration, by Ruslan Ignatyev; place and date not given:  "Subscription-94 Results Summarized"]    [Text] The subscription campaign for newspapers and  magazines for the first half of 1994 has ended. ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA correspondent Ruslan Ignatyev asked Vladimir Shelikhov,  deputy general director of the Russian Federation Federal Postal  Communications Administration, to talk about its final results.    Subscriptions for the first half of 1994 amounted to over  61.5 million copies of various publications. This represents  73.5 percent of the figure for the first half of 1993. In the  opinion of Russian Communications Ministry specialists, the  crisis of the press is over and it is not anticipated that  subscriptions will fall to a low level in the future.    The structure of the present subscription is interesting.  Over half the present total circulation figure is accounted for  by newspapers -- 43.6 million copies. As we expected, readers  have shown great interest in local publications -- the latter  account for 25.2 million copies. The circulation of central  newspapers is 18.1 million. Local publications have virtually  maintained their 1993 circulation. Central publications have  lost one-third of their subscribers. The circulation of  magazines continues to decline. The level of subscriptions  there is 95.6 percent of the level for the second half of 1993.    Now let us cite figures for subscriptions to the most  popular  publications (leaving aside PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and some  others for which figures will be provided later).    ARGUMENTY I FAKTY -- 5.5 million    TRUD -- 1.5 million    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- 1.03 million    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA -- 871,000    IZVESTIYA -- 435,500    PIONERSKAYA PRAVDA -- 134,500    MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI -- 120,000    LITERATURNAYA GAZETA -- 81,500    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA -- 29,000    SEGODNYA -- 15,600    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA -- 15,500    OBSHCHAYA GAZETA -- 13,000    VEK -- 3,000    [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's front-page new year greetings to  readers  includes the information that "The number of subscribers to the  newspaper has increased 12-fold and its circulation will now be  600,000."]</p>

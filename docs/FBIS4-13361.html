			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 16 Apr (INA) -- Ozdem Sanberk, under  secretary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, left Baghdad today  after a three-day visit to Iraq.    In a statement to INA, the Turkish official said the talks  that he and his delegation held with a number of Iraqi officials  were positive and friendly because they were based on the  historical relations binding the two neighboring countries.    The Turkish Foreign Ministry official said that an agreement  has been reached with Iraq that commercial ties must be restored  to their status before the blockade was imposed. He indicated  that it has been agreed to make available the requirements for  the resumption of these relations, and that Turkey has started  the required steps for the resumption of commercial relations as  soon as the blockade is lifted.    He stressed that Turkey's current role is to help the  international community lift the blockade imposed on Iraq and  end the suffering of its people. He stressed that contacts  between officials from the neighboring countries' Foreign  Ministries will continue.</p>

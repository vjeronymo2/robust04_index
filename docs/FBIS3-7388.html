Yi wrote in the KUKJONG SINMUM, an administration newspaper  for public servants: "The combat ability as well as performance  of equipment of the South Korean military are superior to those  of the North Korean military. And our scientific war  performance system overwhelms the North Korean one.    "Even if North Korea misjudges the situation and provokes a  full- fledged war, it will taste only miserable defeat. The  joint South Korean and U.S. forces will win a decisive victory  after all."    The government's overall policy, however, is to deter North  Korea's development of nuclear weaponry while preventing war and  solving the nuclear problem peacefully, although security on the  Korean peninsula is subject to increasing tension.    "For the survival of the nation, we must keep the North from  developing nuclear weapons. Moreover, the military should adopt  a perfect defense posture to immediately meet any situation that  might arise if the North Korean nuclear problem is not solved in  a peaceful way."    On a promising note, he said the military has not found any  signs of an imminent North Korean attack on the South.    "The reason why the North is threatening the South is that  it  wants to control the North Korean people, who are agitated over  the economic crisis. The North is also trying to obtain the  maximum concessions from the United States and disturb the South  psychologically."    Yi added that the South Korean military has prepared a  water-  tight defense posture.</p>

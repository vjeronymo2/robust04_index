			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich in </F> Washington by Razi Barqay -- live]    [Text] [Barqay] Professor Rabinovich, can we get a  response from you to the report in Syria's TISHRIN newspaper  attacking Prime Minister Rabin's remarks that Syria is the one  not prepared for a peace accord with Israel; its call on United  States to fulfill its role of an honest broker; and that if it  fails, the Syrians expect the United States to take partial  responsibility for the failure? Have we a ready-made reaction?    [Rabinovich] I do not see the point of such a debate. One  of the points of symmetry with the Syrians is that their media  is official. When TISHRIN publishes a report or a commentary it  can be viewed as a sort of official view. Nevertheless, I still  do not think we should argue with the Syrian press or argue  whether it is right for the so-called Syrian media to attack the  prime minister. I believe that if the Syrian leadership has  something to say it can do so on its own.    [Barqay] Then let us argue with President Mubarak, who said  that he has a promise from Yitzhaq Rabin to come down from the  Golan Heights. His remarks were taped by journalists who met  with him. You know the prime minister's response: It is utter  nonsense.    [Rabinovich] If you want to bring another element into the  issue, then go ahead. In reference to the Egyptian position,  the only third element active in the negotiations between us and  the Syrians is the United States. You referred to them as a  mediator. The U.S. role is not exactly that of a mediator, but  rather what they call an intermediary [preceding word in  English], because the word mediator implies somebody who makes  his own bridging proposals, which is not the case in these  negotiations. Egypt is not a mediator between us and Syria, and  does not act as an intermediary, therefore the Egyptian  Government cannot have a deep knowledge of what is taking place  in these negotiations.    [Barqay] I understand. Now tell me, are the Syrian  negotiations really stuck?    [Rabinovich] The negotiations with the Syrians are not  moving at this moment. The secretary of state is prepared to  come to the region once more, but he is not prepared to come for  nothing. The main diplomatic activity in Washington at present  is in an attempt to find out if there is any purpose in the  secretary coming. The address is first and foremost Damascus.  The Syrians must make it clear that there is a point to an  additional mission to the region by the secretary of state. The  harsh reaction by TISHRIN can be attributed to the Syrian  feeling that there is a general conception that the ball is in  their court and they are trying any way they can to get it  across the net.    [Barqay] What will move the negotiations, which are  deadlocked, along? What will make one of the sides move forward?    [Rabinovich] In reference to the TISHRIN report, it can  immediately be discerned that it is a legalistic and formal  approach, which states that Israel must first implement the UN  resolutions and give its representatives a commitment, etc.  That approach is legalistic and formal and not one for  political negotiations. Political negotiations are talks  between two sides who want to reach a joint purpose, who present  their interests and outlooks, and then together -- sometimes  with the assistance of a third party, which in this case is the  United States -- take note of the points where their outlooks,  starting positions, and interests meet. That is the fertile  ground where negotiations can progress. What the Syrians must do  is move away from the mentality of a legalistic approach and  take a practical political approach to the negotiations.</p>

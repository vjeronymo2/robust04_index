			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 BOOGIE DOWN PRODUCTIONS "EDUTAINMENT" JIVE/BMG: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> When you hear a rap song on the radio that disses Socrates for biting from  Egyptian philosophers, you can be pretty sure that it's time for a new album  from KRS-One and Boogie Down Productions, the conscience of rap.  </P> <P> KRS-One is the Dylan of the South Bronx, a rapper with a hard-core reputation  who was the first to take on drugs, homelessness, black-on-black violence.  </P> <P> His Stop the Violence movement galvanized the rap community into political  action. Last year's "Ghetto Music" went platinum, even though its hit single  was a somewhat obscure genealogy of biblical figures; another hit off the album  was called "My Philosophy." He's pretty much single-handedly given intelligence  street credibility.  </P> <P> On "Edutainment," KRS-One takes on misguided teachers, the government, crooked  cops and meat. Hamburgers, to hear him talk, are a drug as addictive as crack,  and worse for you. There's a devastating narrative about the short, brutal life  of a drug dealer. And the beats, which seem to get rawer with each of his  major-label albums, are minimal and tough, also supremely danceable. This is  bound to become one of the most controversial rap albums of the year. JONATHAN  GOLD  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. EPA Modeling for the OTC&hyph;LEV Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will use the MOBILE5a emission factor model to quantify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HC, CO, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions associated with the OTC&hyph;LEV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. MOBILE5a incorporates the latest technical information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available on both the expected certification and in-use performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles meeting LEV standards. MOBILE5a uses emission factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equations for each OTC&hyph;LEV exhaust standard, and the proportion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles meeting each of these standards necessary to meet the fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average NMOG standard for each model year, to calculate the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of each model year of the LEV program in any calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA anticipates emissions reductions for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and CO, as well as NMOG,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to the lower NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and CO standards required for vehicles in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OTC&hyph;LEV program. The emissions factor equations are derived from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering analysis of the performance of vehicles meeting existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust standards and of the effect of new emission controls needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the OTC&hyph;LEV standards. The emission factor equations for LEVs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also take into account differences between certification fuel in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California and the federal fuel which will be used in the OTR. Also,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate the need for the LEV program to maintain the NAAQS, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to model emissions well past the attainment deadlines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission factors from MOBILE5a are multiplied by vehicle miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveled (VMT) in order to create emissions inventories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this analysis, EPA will be comparing projected mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventories in future years with and without the OTC&hyph;LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will follow the same guidance EPA has given the States when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projecting future VMT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MOBILE5a has the ability to model a LEV program which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes a ZEV sales mandate or a LEV program without a ZEV sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate, both meeting the same NMOG fleet average requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To properly quantify the emissions impact of the OTC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation, EPA will require information on the extent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which ZEVs will be required, as well as information on ZEV usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns and on their effect on power plant emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of other programs designed to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from highway vehicles, including federal reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel, control of refueling emissions, and transportation control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures (TCMs), that are either mandated by the Clean Air Act in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all or parts of the OTR or are programs that the States may opt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into as part of a SIP. EPA intends to quantify the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions of the OTC&hyph;LEV program, taking into account all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory measures and other regional measures that the OTC has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified. The timing of reductions could be accelerated if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States were to adopt schemes to accelerate fleet turnover. But  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these schemes would likely have to be drastic to significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the reductions that the LEV program would generate by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2005.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, EPA believes that evaporative emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California and federal vehicles will be the same, under a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel and inspection regime. This assumption is reflected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MOBILE5a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One current development that may affect EPA's modeling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the OTC&hyph;LEV program is California's decision as to whether to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require onboard refueling vapor recovery systems (ORVR) as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its motor vehicle emission program. See CARB Mail-out  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 94&hyph;08,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workshop Notice (Feb. 9, 1994). Should California receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver from EPA which would permit them not to require ORVR, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would seem inappropriate to include any emissions benefits from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ORVR in modeling the benefits of the California LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given that the OTC&hyph;LEVs would have to meet identical standards as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the California vehicles and that the OTC could not require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``third vehicle,'' the OTC&hyph;LEVs could also have no requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onboard systems. The lack of an onboard refueling requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the OTC&hyph;LEV program could affect the emission benefits of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEV program. The issue is related to section 184(b)(2)'s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that Stage II vehicle refueling provisions, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions capable of achieving comparable emissions reductions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be implemented in the OTR. EPA requests comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect that a California's decision not to require ORVR would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have on EPA's action on the OTC recommendation implications which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this would have for Stage II exemption levels and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "From the Party Program: </F> Environmental Policy"]    [Text] Worldwide environmental destruction has meanwhile  reached a scope that might endanger mankind's survival. The  destruction of the natural bases of life, however, also destroys  the future of coming generations and thus any hope. In the  interest of the continued existence of mankind and of our  people, the global and regional protection of the environment in  order to ensure the preconditions for existence is an  outstanding international and national task.    Even though Germany, as an industrial state, is one of the  world's technically most highly developed countries and  certainly has the necessary means, it is still engaged in  environmental cosmetics instead of environmental policy. The  degree of industrialization and the high density of the  population produce growing tension with the justified and  necessary ecological demands.    The preservation of an environment that is worth living in  for the coming generations of our people is, however, more  important for us Republikaner than a short-sighted striving for  profit and prosperity. The German people's bases of life can,  however, be ensured only if the population density does not  increase further. Therefore, one must put an end to the further  immigration of foreigners to Germany.    Successful environmental policy can be implemented only  together with a sensible population policy!    We Republikaner demand:    -- Anchoring the protection of the German people's bases of  life as a priority task in the Basic Law, in a way that leads to  actionable claims for damages and claims to compel someone to  refrain from doing something in case of environmental damage, in  line with the polluter-pays principle.    -- Legal definition of the common welfare mentioned in  Article 14 of the Basic Law in the sense of safeguarding our  people's bases of life in the long term.    Short-term national economic interest must no longer justify  environmentally harmful interference in private property!  Environmentally conscious behavior must already begin in  childhood and is to be included more intensively in school  curricula.    Air, soil, water, fauna, and flora form a densely interlaced  network. In addition to pollution from the air, this network is  seriously affected by waste disposal and by emissions from  households, traffic, industry, and agriculture. Immediate  measures, including legislative, are necessary to protect it.    Therefore, we Republikaner demand:     -  Industry and  consumers are to be stimulated to act more economically.    -  The  minimum life expectancy of industrial goods and the recycling of  used raw materials are to be increased drastically.    -  The legally  permitted introduction of partly untreated industrial waste  water into waters of all kinds is to be rescinded.    -  In  agriculture, the area-related introduction of nitrogen must not  be higher than the consumption of nitrogen so as to protect the  ground water. Therefore, strictly area-related husbandry and  tax incentives for using mineral fertilizers less generously are  to be implemented without any further delay.    -  The use of  agricultural chemicals is to be reduced further in a similar  manner. They are an essential reason for the dying of species.  Under the precondition that this is safeguarded effectively by  means of foreign trade, it would also be possible for the  farmers to receive higher prices for their products again while  yield per hectare would be lower all over the country.    -  Not least  because of the unbraked mass immigration, one needs more and  more living space and usable space. Construction projects are  to take into consideration more intensively the concerns of  soil, water, and landscape protection. The transformation of  arable land into areas for roads or housing construction is to  be limited to the unavoidable minimum.    -  In case of industrial and  public building projects, natural areas must be created in  compensation.    -  Surface waters are to be increasingly fed into the  ground water.    -  The ground water strata are to be preserved in  construction projects.    Environmental offenses are no minor offenses! We  Republikaner therefore demand the strict punishment of  environmental criminals.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> TEACHERS, DISTRICT AT IMPASSE, UNION SAYS  </P> <P> The president of the teachers union in Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Elementary  School District said at a news conference Wednesday that union and district  officials have reached an impasse in contract negotiations.  </P> <P> Ina Lea Parker, president of the Pleasant Valley Education Assn., said a  mediator has been appointed by the state.  </P> <P> "Teachers have been sinking lower and lower compared to neighboring districts'  salaries, while student test scores have consistently ranked in the top 10% in  the state," Parker said in a prepared statement. "It's just unfair."  </P> <P> The district's 300 teachers are in the final year of a three-year contract.  Negotiations began in October.  </P> <P> Parker said teachers are seeking an 11% annual raise and full funding of health  insurance benefits, but that the district is offering a 5.1% increase and $500  a year toward health expenses.  </P> <P> Officials of the 6,400-student district could not be reached for comment.

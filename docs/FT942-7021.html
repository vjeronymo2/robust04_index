			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Council for City snubbed by PM Mr John Major has rejected a request from the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, for legislation that would allow an extension of the electoral franchise in the Square Mile. The corporation, which is locked in an electoral feud with Smithfield Market tenants, has been told there is no prospect in the foreseeable future of a parliamentary bill to give limited companies a voice in the way the City is run. Mr Major wants to avoid potentially controversial legislation because of his small Commons majority. Tory MPs who have suffered heavily as a result of the recent losses in the Lloyd's insurance market may be unsympathetic to a City-sponsored bill. The decision, relayed to the corporation by Mr Graham Bright, the prime minister's parliamentary private secretary, confirms that there has been a significant cooling in relations between the government and the City since the 1992 general election. The two sides have resolved disputes over the corporation's anti-terrorism strategy - traffic control measures are almost certain to become a permanent fixture after the withdrawal of a formal objection by neighbouring Tower Hamlets - and over the proposed CrossRail underground rail link. But leading City figures believe Mr Major is generally unsympathetic to the role the Square Mile plays in promoting London as a world financial centre and providing substantial assistance to other local authorities. The City has been seeking a change in its constitution to prevent the Smithfield traders manipulating its archaic voting arrangements to win seats on the corporation's general council. It also believes that the City's limited companies - by far the largest contributors to the Pounds 700m it collects each year in rates - can no longer be reasonably denied a say in the way the Square Mile is run. In January the Smithfield traders, who are fighting a sharp increase in rents to help pay for a Pounds 60m refurbishment of the market, won two seats on the council. Only residents, partnerships and sole traders are allowed to vote in City elections. The meat traders believe that low turnouts in individual wards - the number of votes cast can be as low as 100  -mean that they can win many more seats on the general council simply by establishing offices in more wards.</p>

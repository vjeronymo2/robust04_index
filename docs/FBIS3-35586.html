			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 January -- A programme of military  cooperation between NATO and the Russian Defense Ministry for  the current year was signed in Moscow today. It includes mutual  visits by the highest command corps and military experts, joint  exercises and training, and the seconding of Russian officers to  units and training establishments in NATO countries--some 50  measures in all.    An ITAR-TASS observer was told at the Russian Defense  Ministry that the problems involved in settling the crisis  situations in CIS flashpoints were discussed during a two-day  visit by a delegation from the North Atlantic alliance. Mutual  understanding was found with regard to many crucial problems.  NATO's military structure is ready to provide help to the  peacekeeping forces of Russia and the Commonwealth countries,  specifically regarding the training of specialists who are to  work as observers in regions of interethnic conflict. In the  opinion of NATO representatives, it is not a matter of the  participation of the organization's military subunits in  settling the conflicts on the fringes of the former Soviet  Union. Just the exchange of experience and help with  specialists, they think. But "rear support" is not denied --  specifically, with communications and observation means.  According to NATO officers, their organization cannot operate  outside the community without a UN mandate.    At the same time, representatives of the North Atlantic  alliance think that it is only under UN auspices that Russian  peacekeeping forces too should operate in the CIS' flashpoints.  This, in their view, would give rise to greater trust in them,  specifically, in Tajikistan.</p>

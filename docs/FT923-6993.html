			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / When gloom shades into depression: Emma Tucker finds that rules of thumb are the only guide through a vague area of economics NEWS yesterday that gross domestic product, excluding oil and gas extraction, rose 0.1 per cent in the second quarter signalled the technical end to the recession in non-oil output. But few will dare trumpet yesterday's statistics as evidence that good times are here again. According to a definition borrowed from the US it takes only two successive quarters of falling GDP to take an economy into recession and only one of rising output - however slim - to mark the end. Some economists, however, suggest that the length of this recession, and the poor outlook for growth, qualify it as a depression. There is no technical definition of a depression. The Pocket Economist, an A-Z guide, says: 'If recession continues, at some imprecise point it becomes a depression.' It fails to clarify the point. The Central Statistical Office has no official definition but a spokesman offered a joke: 'A recession is when you lose your job. A depression is when I lose mine.' It is generally accepted that a depression represents a recession of exceptional depth or duration. The usual association is with the economic downturn of the early 1930s, the only depression to affect the UK in living memory. GDP fell 0.11 per cent in 1930 and 5.49 per cent in 1931, followed by growth of less than 1 per cent in 1932 and 1933. Unemployment rose to 15.3 per cent in 1932 before resuming a downward path the following year. Prices fell almost 8 per cent and did not start to rise again until early 1934. The current recession has a long way to go before its depth matches that of the inter-war years. GDP has fallen 4.2 per cent over eight quarters, with an upward blip in the third quarter of last year. Non-oil GDP has fallen 4.3 per cent over seven consecutive quarters. Prices are still rising, although asset prices have fallen significantly. Retail prices rose 3.7 per cent in the 12 months to July and producer price inflation was 3.4 per cent over the same period. Unemployment was 9.7 per cent in July, but the number of people out of work and claiming benefit is climbing every month. Many forecasters expect it to reach 3m next year, taking the rate of unemployment to 10.6 per cent. Although the figures show that the current recession is not as deep as the 1930s depression, or indeed as deep as the recession in the early 1980s, the economy faces constraints that did not exist to hold back the recovery in the 1930s. In 1931, when Britain abandoned the gold standard, the government was able to cut interest rates. Britain's commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism means that the government is prevented from doing so now. The effect of high real interest rates is compounded this time by the high levels of consumer debt, particularly in the depressed housing market. Unless real interest rates fall soon the economy is unlikely to produce anything more than sluggish growth over the next two years, taking the current downturn nearer to 1930s proportions. Professor Robert Skidelsky, historian and biographer of John Maynard Keynes, says this means we may be nearing a second depression. He says: 'Obviously if the situation continues and there is no output recovery for another year and unemployment keeps on increasing, you would be perfectly entitled to talk about this recession as a depression.' Even if growth does resume, it is unlikely to return to its long-term trend of a little over 2 per cent a year for a while yet. So it would be possible to have growth, and a technical end to the recession, in an otherwise depressed economy. This may well be the scenario facing the UK. GDP fell 2.4 per cent last year and is forecast to fall 0.5 per cent this year. Even if growth resumed trend levels next year, it would be at least 1994 before the output lost in this recession was recovered. It could be that neither slump nor recession are fair characterisations of the current situation. It is not a slump, because the fall in output and the level of unemployment do not yet compare with the high levels of the 1930s. But it is more than a normal recession because output remains depressed, there is no strong recovery in sight and unemployment is likely to remain high for longer than would normally be expected. Perhaps Britain in the 1920s provides a better comparison. In the 1920s unemployment hovered between 7 per cent and 10 per cent with, on the whole, feeble growth. Similarly the UK, because of its adherence to the gold standard, was locked into fixed exchange rates and was unable to lower base rates to protect sterling. Prof Skidelsky says that Keynes had a term to describe the situation - a semi-slump. This time the government will be hoping for more than a semi-recovery.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special reporter Eduardo Rodriguez-Baz] </F>   [Text] Windhoek, 20 Jan (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina denied media reports noting that his  country would send troops to Angola if it detects foreign  intervention there. In exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA,  Robaina described these reports as clumsy, ill-intended  maneuvers.    Cuba fully respects the negotiations that are under way  between the Angolan Government and National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola in Lusaka, Zambia, in the search for a  peaceful solution to the Angolan conflict, Robaina emphasized.    The Cuban delegation is very much aware of the absurd nature  of this maneuver. The issue was discussed from the beginning,  and our position of nonintervention was clearly established. Our  stand, however, is being distorted precisely at the place where  the talks are being held.    The foreign minister noted the fact that the topic was  discussed with the Angolans themselves, and the fact that Havana  clearly established its position of nonintervention in their  internal affairs should attract the attention of many people.    Cuba maintains full respect for the inter-Angolan dialogue  and this position was even stated to President Jose Eduardo Dos  Santos, he concluded.    Robaina began a two-week tour that included Ghana, Angola,  Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia on 9 January.</p>

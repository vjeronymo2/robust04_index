Government  Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez and Defense Minister Rafael  Pardo Rueda both made statements to that effect. Defense  Minister Pardo Rueda said the executive branch can guarantee  that elections will be held thanks to the implementation of the  "Democracy Plan." Effective today, at least 52,000 members of  the Colombian Armed Forces will participate in the "Democracy  Plan" to reinforce security at all strategic locations,  political campaign headquarters, and public buildings. Many  parts of the country that have experienced public order problems  in the past few weeks will be given special protection.    Minister Villegas urged Colombians to vote, noting that "the  best way to face violence is by going to the polls, which will  strengthen democracy."    The Army, Air Force, Navy, and police force will participate  in the "Democracy Plan."    Defense Minister Pardo Rueda said "the rebels are not  capable  of stopping the elections. They are only trying to cause alarm  and make their presence known through their barbaric actions."  Pardo Rueda added that guerrilla actions during the past few  weeks, such as placing mines in agricultural areas, "have been  irrational." The defense minister admitted that the kidnapping  of congressional candidates, mayors, and other leaders, along  with clashes in some parts of the country, have disrupted public  order. Nevertheless, the government "has not had to postpone or  cancel elections anywhere in the country," he added.    Colombians will go to the polls on 13 March to elect 163  representatives and 100 senators.    In addition, the Liberal Party will hold a consultation to  choose its candidate for the May elections among seven  presidential hopefuls.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Morrison Construction falls MORRISON Construction, the privately-owned Scottish construction company, increased turnover in the year to March 31 by 8 per cent to Pounds 208m, but saw pre-tax profits decline 32 per cent from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 3.3m. Nevertheless, Mr Fraser Morrison, chairman and chief executive, described the results as 'quite outstanding' against a background of the 'worst trading conditions I can remember.' Earnings per share were 150p (284p). Gearing at the end of March was 51 per cent. Morrison Construction is largely owned by the Morrison family. In 1989 it increased its size two and half times when the family acquired the outstanding 80 per cent of the company from Charter Consolidated. Mr Morrison pointed out that few UK construction companies were reporting good profits and many were incurring losses. The group was helped by the fact that it does not operate in south-east England. In 1989 Morrison was the only British company to win emergency repair orders in Kuwait after the Gulf war from the US Corps of Engineers. This work has now been completed, but Morrison is carrying out work for private clients in Kuwait and has won a contract In Bahrain. Yesterday it was announced that Morrison was part of a consortium of international construction companies formed to build the second Forth road bridge in Scotland. The consortium, Forth Link Group, includes Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine, John Mowlem, Dragados of Spain and Monberg &amp; Thorsen, the Danish bridge builder. A number of other consortia have been formed and have expressed interest in building the bridge. Mr Morrison said that a Stock Exchange flotation was 'very much on the agenda as an option we hold open' but no date had been identified.</p>

Activities under this proposed priority include, but are not limited to: 1) a computerized user-registration process; 2) circulation of captioned films and videos; 3) development or updating of a catalog of captioned films and videos in the collection; and 4) outreach activities. This proposed priority would provide students and other eligible individuals with disabilities with captioned films and videos so they may benefit from the same educational media used to enrich the educational experiences of students and other individuals who do not have disabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Priority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be considered for funding under this proposed priority, the project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Develop strategies and procedures to be implemented in operating a distribution system, consisting of local and regional centers including depositories, and one central general interest and educational films/video center.

The current computerized system configuration may be used as a basis;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Develop and implement criteria and procedures for replacing irreparable films/videos;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Prepare, update, and distribute copies of a catalog listing all captioned films/videos available under this project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Convene an annual meeting of depository managers, librarians, and audiovisual and other personnel from local, regional, and State educational agencies for the purpose of training, planning, sharing, brainstorming, and other activities related to improving the access of eligible individuals to audiovisual materials. The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will be the site of the meeting;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Implement outreach activities, especially activities that reach out to local school systems to make them aware of the open and closed captioned materials that are available to them under this program and from other sources; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Submit quarterly progress reports to the grants and project officers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Absolute Priority 4_Recorded Audio Cassettes for Visually and Print Disabled Students <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed priority would support recording, producing, duplicating, and distributing 15/16 ips (inch per second) four-track cassette versions of textbooks and other educational reading materials for students (elementary, secondary, postsecondary &amp; graduate) who are visually or print disabled. These cassette tapes will help provide equal educational opportunities to target students and lessen some of the barriers they face in classrooms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Priority:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be considered for funding under this priority, the project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Handle all requests for materials, including confirmation of eligibility by disability;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Arrange for use of copyrights from publishers of supplied textbooks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Record or duplicate the books on 15/16 ips (inch per second), four-track cassettes of one hour per track recording time.

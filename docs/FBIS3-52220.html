On a  motion moved under Rule 194 by Professor Khurshid Ahmad and the  leader of the opposition, Mr. Mohammad Ali Khan, the house  adopted a substantive resolution on Indo-Pakistan negotiations  on Kashmir. The resolution expressed deep concern over the  repressive measures by the Indian occupation forces against the  Kashmiris struggling for liberation of occupied territory and  atrocities let loose against the innocent people. The  resolution also demanded release of political leadership of the  Kashmir liberation movement and bringing an end to violations of  human rights and repression against the people of Jammu and  Kashmir.    The resolution called upon the government to hold  negotiations for a final solution of the Kashmir dispute in  accordance with the UN resolutions and commitment of the  government of India and that of Pakistan. The resolution  further said that unless the Kashmir dispute, which is the main  issue between India and Pakistan, is decided, negotiations on  other issues, like normalization of relations, economic  cooperation, Siachen, and Wular Barrage, would be tantamount to  sidetracking the real issue. Those who participated in the  debate on the motion besides the movers are: Federal Minister  for Special Education Dr. Sher Afghan, Raja Mohammad Zafarul  Haq, Manzoor Ahmad Gichki, Hafiz Hussain Ahmad, Syed Mohammad  Fazal Agha, Syed Fasih Iqbal, retired Justice Zakiuddin Pal, and  the leader of the house, Malik Mohammad Qasim.

The chairman of the Senate will decide about the  composition of the committee. The committee will monitor  violations of human rights and atrocities being committed by the  Indian forces in the occupied Kashmir to mobilize world opinion  in support of the cause of the Kashmiris as well as stand of the  government of Pakistan.

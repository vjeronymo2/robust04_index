Bolotina, Surgery </F> Department of the Moscow Medical Institute; UDC  616.379-008.64:617.58-002.4]:615.246.2+615.38]    [Abstract] Recent studies showing the important role of  hemostatic and hemorheologic impairments in the pathogenesis of  diabetic angiopathy and the development of purulent necrotic  lesions in the lower extremities in diabetic patients prompted  an examination of the efficacy of hemosorption in treating  diabetic gangrene patients and an attempt to ascertain its role  in correcting the hemostatic disorders of blood circulation. To  this end, 159 diabetic patients with trophic and purulent  necrotic foot and calf lesions were observed, and 18 male and 12  female patients were examined. Diagnostic tests were used for  analyzing the hemostatic system. Extracorporeal hemosorption was  conducted together with conservative therapy which included  carbohydrate metabolism correction by means of subcutaneous  insulin injection and hemo- and rheocorrector treatment,  antibacterial and immunotherapy, etc. Hemosorption facilitated  an increase in the anticoagulant and fibrinolytic plasma  activity and improved peripheral circulation, making it possible  to expand indications for ``minor'' foot amputations and lower  the number of high amputations to 13.3%. On average, the  use of  complex therapy with hemosorption shortened the diabetic ulcer  preparation by 5-7 days. Figures 3; references 8: 7 Russian, 1  Western.</p>

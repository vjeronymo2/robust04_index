			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bank Profits Recover in Quarter: Earnings at commercial banks bounced back to  $6.2 billion in the first three months of 1990, despite spreading problems with  real estate loans, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. report. That  was a big improvement over the preceding two quarters but still marked a 14%  decline from a record $7.3-billion profit in first quarter 1989. Banks earned  only $2.1 billion in fourth quarter 1989; that was revised down by $590 million  from an earlier report after banks acknowledged more problem loans.  </P></p>

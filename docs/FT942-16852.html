			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Irish rail union calls strike vote Ireland's main rail union yesterday called a strike vote in a dispute over modernisation and working practices. Irish Rail is losing over IPounds 70m a year, and wants to spend an estimated IDollars 800m to bring the rail network up to modern standards. Staff last month rejected the state-run company's proposals, after three years of talks, but Irish Rail decided to push ahead with its plans and began suspending staff who refused to be trained in new technology.</p>

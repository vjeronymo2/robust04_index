			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / New credit fall shown: Borrowing figures contradict pre-election economic upturn theory DEMAND for credit by consumers was weak in the first quarter, according to government figures released yesterday which did little to support theories about economic upturn before the general election. According to the Central Statistical Office, consumers repaid a net Pounds 270m on credit agreements between January and March, the largest quarterly repayment since records began in 1975. In the final quarter of last year there was a seasonally adjusted repayment of a revised Pounds 16m, while in the previous quarter net new borrowing came to Pounds 234m. The period between October last year and March marks the first time since 1975 in which consumers have made net repayments on this type of credit for two consecutive quarters. The figures underline the weakness in the economy that was behind the government's decision last week to reduce interest rates by 0.5 of a point to 10 per cent. However, the Conservatives' election victory may have provoked a spurt in economic activity that has yet to show up in statistics. Yesterday's figures apply to virtually all forms of consumer credit except mortgages. On March 31, Pounds 52.8bn was outstanding on such credit, compared with Pounds 53.07bn at the end of last year. In the first quarter, consumers repaid loans on bank personal accounts worth Pounds 249m, the first quarter since records started to have shown a repayment. Between October and December last year, net new loans on personal accounts came to Pounds 100m. Net new borrowings in the first quarter on credit cards came to Pounds 125m, little changed from the Pounds 133m registered in the final three months of last year. A breakdown of the data shows that in March consumers repaid Pounds 69m on the so-called narrow measure of credit - which accounts for about 60 per cent of all credit and fails to include bank loans on personal accounts, and loans on credit cards outside the Mastercard and Visa systems. It also excludes loans from insurance companies and retailers.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Treasury considers trying out a newer model: Peter Marsh on moves to update software for economic forecasting AFTER London Zoo and the Royal Family another well-loved British institution is under threat. The Treasury model - a set of computer programs depicting how the UK economy works - could be replaced by rival software under one option being considered by government officials. The demise of the 20-year-old model would have a big effect on how the Treasury prepares its economic forecasts. The Treasury model has entered the spotlight partly because of the inadequacies of the Treasury's recent forecasts, which in common with many private-sector projections failed to spot either the 1986-88 boom or the seriousness of the recession before it was too late. Although the model can hardly take the full blame for the poor predictions - other important factors include the judgments made by Treasury economists and the political 'spin' imparted to projections by ministers - Treasury officials concede the software in the model has not been kept sufficiently up to date. They have asked academic experts from Strathclyde University and Warwick University to improve aspects of the model concerned with labour markets and consumer spending. In the US the job of preparing economics forecasts on behalf of President Bill Clinton's administration is shared by the so-called 'economics troika'  -the US Treasury, the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers. All use private-sector models. A senior administration official said: 'Contracting out modelling gives us greater flexibility. It also improves our credibility because people know we are using independent economic analysis.' Mr Bob Dennis, assistant economics director at the Congressional Budget Office, said: 'By piggybacking on work done outside the government we get the best of whatever expertise is available.' Massachusetts-based DRI, the world's biggest economics consultancy with annual sales of about Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.90), and McKibbin Software Group, a small modelling company in Washington DC, are among several US groups which supply models to the US agencies. DRI charges about Dollars 20,000 a year for its software, including help in forecasts and monthly updating of the computer code to allow for economic fluctuations. DRI and McKibbin have indicated interest in supplying the UK Treasury with their own versions of modelling software for the UK economy. DRI economists outlined their thinking to the Treasury at a meeting in January. From the UK, Business Strategies, a small London-based economics consultancy, would 'definitely be interested' in selling the UK Treasury modelling software, according to Mr Charles Burton, joint managing director. The Treasury is also evaluating UK models run by the London Business School and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research as candidates for internal use, possibly in conjunction with the existing Treasury model. Mr Warwick McKibbin, founder of McKibbon Software Group, thinks that whatever the result of the review at the UK Treasury, it should buy other models to use alongside its own. 'Anyone interested in the economy should have access to two or three models because they all have their own strengths and weaknesses,' he said. The Treasury model, which runs on desk-top computers, is used to simulate how a set of policy actions such as changes in interest rates affect variables such as consumer spending or jobs vacancies. It comprises more than 100 mathematical equations linking variables such as unemployment, inflation and budget deficits. It is tended by a team of 30 Treasury economists. They are answerable to Mr Alan Budd, who is the department's chief economic adviser. Dozens, if not hundreds, of models are used worldwide to simulate activities in specific economies. They differ from each other largely in the way their equations link up variables and how easy they are to use. Any decision to scrap the Treasury model and rely entirely on the private sector would come after the Treasury finishes its modelling review at the end of the summer. Mr John Watts, the Tory MP who is chairman of the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee, supports the use of a greater range of models. Referring to the Treasury's recently-appointed committee of outside economic advisers, Mr Watts said: 'There would be an advantage to the Treasury having more than one model. It's already got seven wise men, so why not seven wise models?' It could also open the door to a number of companies in the US and UK which would like to sell their own economic models to the Treasury.</p>

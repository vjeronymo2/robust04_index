			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Zhao Renfang (6392 0088 2455): </F> "China Successfully Issues $1 Billion in Bonds Worldwide;  Wonderful Opportunity for International Low Interest Rate,  Bright Future for Domestic Economy"]    [Text] New York Special Dispatch -- On 2 February, the  Chinese Government issued $1 billion in bonds in the world's  major bond markets, which sold out the same day. Relevant  observers believe that this is further proof that investors  throughout the world are optimistic about the China market, and  about the strongly emerging Chinese economy.    Jin Renqing [6855 0086 1987], Vice Minister of Finance, who  came to New York from Beijing especially to attend the issuance,  said that this "is the largest quantity of bonds issued by the  Chinese Government in international capital markets to date.  They were sold separately and simultaneously in Asian, European,  and U.S. capital markets, with trading carried out over a 24  hour period."    In his introduction, Jin Renqing stated that the U.S.  dollars  amassed through the issue of these global bonds by the Finance  Ministry as China's representative would be used to develop such  fundamental facilities as transportation, energy, and  telecommunications, etc., to ensure that China's economic  development would have more staying power. Meanwhile, through  issuing bonds, it was also letting world investors learn more  about China, provide international investors with investment  opportunities, and associate the Chinese economy more closely  with that of the world. Specialists believe that the successful  issuance of $1 billion in global bonds proves that international  investors have great interest in China's economic development  and investing in China, and that they are fully confident of  China's future.    The principal executive bank for the bond issuance is the  well-known U.S. Merrill Lynch Securities Corporation. On the  afternoon of the 3d, officials of China's Ministry of Finance  and Merrill Lunch's people in charge of this business held a  press conference in Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters. At  the press conference, Merrill Lynch International's Chairman of  the Board Winthrop Smith said that investors showed very strong  interest in China's bonds, and he hoped by this cooperation to  introduce more investment opportunities to the world, and bring  closer the relationship between China's economy and world  investment markets. Merrill Lynch Corporation announced that  although the final figures were not in from the sole marketing  group, 60 percent of the bonds the corporation was in charge of  selling had been sold in the United States, 20 percent had been  sold in Europe, and the remaining 20 percent in Asia.    It has been reported that at the end of 1992, China had a  total of $69.3 billion in foreign debts. Therefore, a  correspondent asked whether rapid economic development and the  arrival of a great deal of capital could possibly create such  problems as inflation and an increasing burden of payments. Jin  Renqing replied that the capital collected in this bonds  issuance would be uses to develop construction of fundamental  facilities and resolve "bottlenecks" that are hindering economic  development. So, issuing bonds will spur economic development  but not cause inflation. According to international regulation,  in general, a country's debt payment rate should be 20 percent,  but China has kept this strictly within 15 percent, and the  practical rate of payment is only 7.3 percent. Therefore, Jin  Renqing stressed that it was absolutely no problem with China's  debt payment ability. Jin Renqing pointed out that the  objectives of this bond issuance were: one, to amass capital for  fundamental construction at lowest possible cost by taking  advantage of the favorable opportunity presented by lower costs  in the current international capital market; two, to publicize  to the world by means of the world capital market China's  achievements by reform and opening; and three, to set a standard  line for Chinese financial organs going into the world's capital  markets, especially the U.S. market.    On 4 February, Jin Renqing, as the representative Chinese  authority, officially signed the sales agreement with Merrill  Lynch Corporation for issuing $1 billion in global bonds in the  international capital market. The interest rate of the bonds is  6.5 percent yearly, with expiration in ten years.    China has been preparing for this successful issue for  nearly  one year. Last year, the Ministry of Finance invited the  well-known U.S. Rating Corporation to rate China's authorized  foreign debt credit, and the results showed that China had a  very good reputation. Moody's Investor Service of the U.S.  raised Chinese authorized foreign credit rating from the Baa1  level to the A3 level, while Feiji //phonetic// Corporation has  rated China's authorized foreign debt credit as A-. All these  paved the way for Chinese bonds to enter the European, Asian,  and global market. In addition, before issuing the bonds, the  Ministry of Finance organized delegations to the international  financial markets of Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Zurich,  Frankfort, London, Chicago and New York to carry out publicity  activities and answer questions related to China's economy,  politics, and international relations. This also had a definite  effect on this successful bond issuance.    Before issuing the bonds, the Ministry of Finance had at one  time or another issued in the European market Japanese Yen bonds  worth 30 billion Japanese Yen, and had issued $300 million in  "dragon debts" in the Asian-Pacific region, and all were  successful. Relevant persons expressed the view that China would  in the future continue to vigorously and cautiously collect  capital throughout the world in accordance with the demands of  its economic development and construction and the conditions of  international capital markets.</p>

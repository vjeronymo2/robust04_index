			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos has suffered liver failure and  the prognosis is "extremely poor," a hospital administrator said. "Mr. Marcos  is semi-comatose, his condition has worsened and he's not recognizing friends  or family," said Eugene Tiwanak, assistant administrator of St. Francis Medical  Center in Honolulu, where the exiled former leader has been hospitalized five  months. Marcos suffered heart, lung and kidney failure late last month, and he  has been on life-support equipment since. Marcos, 71, and his wife, Imelda,  have lived in Hawaii since a 1986 popular revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to  the presidency, ending his 20-year rule.  </P></p>

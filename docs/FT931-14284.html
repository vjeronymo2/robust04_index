			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading INCREASED tension in the Middle East, along with continuing worries over the UK economy, led to a lack of activity in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. On the Liffe, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE Index opened at 2,789 and demand from several US houses soon sent it to 2,794. The positive mood faded as fears of further activity in the Gulf emerged and the gilts market performed poorly. By 11.30am, the contract had fallen to 2,766. March drifted for the next few hours before talk of a cut in interest rates led to renewed buying. This was curtailed by con-firmation of an attack in the Middle East as the early buyers used the unease over the news to turn sellers. March closed at 2,769, down 16 from its previous close and 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash, which yesterday fell to 9. Turnover was a poor 4,981 contracts, just over half Friday's total. Traded options were equally dull and turnover reached a meagre 17,541 lots. Some 4,759 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, while the Euro FT-SE 100 option only traded 626 lots. Lonrho was the most actively dealt stock option with a day's total of 1,842 lots. This was followed by Hillsdown at 1,720 and then by British Airways at 985, with the January 280 puts the most busy series.</p>

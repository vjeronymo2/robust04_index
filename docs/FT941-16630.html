			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead On Monday when Tomkins reports interim results the market will be looking for reassurance about trading conditions for Ranks Hovis McDougall which the conglomerate acquired a year ago. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 87m (Pounds 47.1m) for the six months to end-October giving a dividend of about 1.95p (1.805p) on fully-diluted earnings of 5.1p (4.87p), not adjusted for share issues to finance the RHM acquisition. The City will be particularly keen to hear the year-end results on Wednesday of First Leisure, the discos, bingo and bowling group. Its shares fell from 378p in March to 234p in November on fears of weak leisure spending by the public. The shares have recovered to 285p but the City is still looking for reassurance. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits of about Pounds 32m (Pounds 31.1m) for the year to October and a final dividend of 4.7p (4.26p). Rank Organisation reports preliminary results on Thursday amid speculation about the scale of the likely dent in the figures caused by the decision of its joint venture partner Xerox to cut its global workforce. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits around Pounds 264m (Pounds 230.1m). However, full-year results from TSB Group are likely to cheer the market. Figures are expected to recover on lower bad debt provisions. Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 260m-Pounds 280m for the year to October 31 compared with Pounds 6m, re-stated from Pounds 43m to comply with new accounting rules.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Cruz, 11 Jun (PRESENCIA) -- Acting President  Victor Hugo Cardenas said today that the country does not need  any kind of political deal or secret "agreement," as he would be  the first to report such cases.    Cardenas made this comment in reference to reports about a  tacit agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary  Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] by which  no charges would be filed against national MIR leaders for their  links with drug trafficking, in exchange for a harsh sentence  for Justices Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe Zubieta.    Cardenas rejected the validity of that report, saying that  there are no real elements to sustain the media reports of a  "dubious political scheme" between the MNR and the MIR regarding  the two issues. Cardenas asserted that the government wants to  do justice and not break it.    He said, however, that if a situation such as that reported  by the media emerges, "I would be the first to report it and  condemn it, as this type of agreement or deal can only hurt the  country and the democratic process that was so hard for the  country to recover."    President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada himself categorically  denied the media report before leaving for Colombia and the  United States, saying that "our struggle is against corruption.  We don't negotiate these cases, and although we don't want to  hurt anyone, our will is to enforce the law."</p>

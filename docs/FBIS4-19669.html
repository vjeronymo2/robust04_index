			<p>BFN     [Text] Ozker Ozgur, minister of state and deputy prime  minister, who also heads the Politbureau [not further  identified] and is one of the owners of the Elmaslar Company,  has conveyed several letters to President Denktas. These  letters can be described as memorandums calling for the  immediate signing of the package of confidence-building  measures. Ozgur's memorandums also upheld several views that  are in parallel with those that have been expressed by Greek  Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis; Joe Clark, the UN secretary  general's special representative; and Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative.    Ozgur leaked his letters through mediators to the Greek  Cypriot side in order to convey particular messages to the Greek  Cypriots. The Greek Cypriot newspapers reported on Ozgur's  memorandums shortly after they were conveyed to Denktas.    We acquired three of the letters, which can be described as  memorandums, some time ago. We urged those who promised to  establish a clear administration before the election in 1993 to  make them public. Denktas and Ozgur, however, preferred not to  do so.    So we decided to publish Ozker Ozgur's first memorandum,  dated 11 March 1994, today. In it, Ozgur opposes Denktas'  statement that he has lost confidence in Butrus Butrus-Ghali and  says that what Denktas has said is an obstacle to the UN  secretary general's effort. He opposes placing sovereignty on  the agenda and the effort made to hold talks on the essence of  the Cyprus problem before the package of confidence-building  measures is put into effect. Ozgur describes that approach as a  delaying tactic. Ozker Ozgur also opposes the inclination to  seek recourse in the Republican Assembly on legal changes. His  letter reads as follows:    TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] President Rauf  Denktas, Nicosia.    According to page one of the records of the 10 March 1994  meeting, we expressed the view that talks on the essence of the  Cyprus problem should not be held before all the necessary  procedures relating to the confidence-building measures package  are complete. But the work to repair Maras [Varosha] will take  five years. The international community will not agree to  suspend the work on the essence of the problem for that long.  We must realize that we must benefit from the situation created  by the existing conditions in our favor.    You have noted in the records that holding talks on issues  concerning a comprehensive solution, the issue of "sovereignty"  for example, will be useful when negotiations are held on the  confidence-building measures package. But considering that we  have agreed to hold talks on the confidence-building measures  package, an initiative to hold talks on a comprehensive  agreement may be seen as a delaying tactic. That could be used  against us.    The confidence-building measures package clearly states that  the sides will maintain their positions.    According to paragraph five, page two, we opposed the  proposal for the transfer of authority to UNTA to enable it to  enact or amend laws and suggested that the two sides be  consulted on any legal change that will be effected. But  reference to the parliaments of the two sides is unnecessary  within that framework. The main point, the right one, is our  insistence on holding consultations with the two sides. The  same paragraph also says that the communal leaders will be  consulted before any change is made.    We deem it useful to oppose the footnote on page one in the  draft. The UN secretary general has taken up a goodwill mission  in connection with the package of confidence-building measures.  Although we are convinced that you are justified in your  sensitive approach that the bounds of the UN secretary general's  goodwill mission must not be exceeded before the process is  complete, we believe that expressing a lack of confidence in the  UN secretary general in advance, that is, before it is confirmed  that the bounds of his goodwill mission have been exceeded, will  be wrong. It will harm our image as the side that cooperates  with the UN secretary general.    We draw your attention to the points we have mentioned in  this letter and convey our respects.    [Signed] Ozker Ozgur, leader of the Republic Turkish Party    [Date] 11 March 1994</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Underwriting fees for rights issues too high, says report Securities firms and fund managers earn excessive profits on their standing fee for underwriting corporate rights issues, according to a report drawn up for the Office of Fair Trading. The so far unpublished report, prepared by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School, concludes that the risks taken by securities firms do not justify the standard 2 per cent commission. The OFT commissioned the research 18 months ago as part of an inquiry into why all companies had to pay the same underwriting fee to sell new shares regardless of the widely different risks involved. The OFT has not decided whether it fully accepts the report's conclusions, and is currently seeking the views of City practitioners. The report draws no conclusions about whether the standard fee is the result of anti-competitive activity, and it is believed that the OFT has found no evidence of a cartel. However, OFT officials are said to be privately concerned about the possible operation of a 'complex monopoly'. It is expected that the OFT will publish the report within the next two months, with the intention of prompting debate between companies and underwriters. If companies find that they are unable to negotiate alternative fee structures, the OFT may refer the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for review. Together with the report, the OFT is expected to publish a summary of criticisms from securities firms and institutional investors who share underwriting commissions. A number of leading firms have told the OFT they believe that publication of the report is unnecessary and will damage the City's reputation. The London Investment Banking Association and the Institutional Fund Managers Association are among those organisations which have sought meetings with the OFT to express their concerns. 'It could appear that this is another City scam,' said one City figure who has had a meeting with the OFT. He argued that the report was flawed, partly because it did not take account of the cost of the capital which securities firms must provide to participate in underwriting. Moreover, he said that although underwriting commissions were standard, varying degrees of risk were reflected in the size of the discount at which new shares were offered for sale. The report analyses profits earned on a series of underwritten rights offerings, including the effects of the disastrous share offering for British Petroleum in October 1987. Even excluding the effects of that offering, which was said to have wiped out five years of UK underwriting profits, the standard 2 per cent commission offered higher returns than were justified, it says.</p>

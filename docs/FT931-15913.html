			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Lives risked by humanitarianism: You know where you are with realpolitik IT was the traditional marching song of British troops when fighting in some godforsaken spot about which they knew nothing and cared less: 'We're here because we're here.' Although no reporter has captured such a song on the lips of the British troops involved in Operation Grapple in Bosnia, this is probably only because it is too dangerous there to march in formation. Although the predicament of the US troops in Somalia is slightly less terrifying, I am equally sure that the privates or 'grunts' will be humming a similar tune in their prefabricated barracks around Mogadishu. Both the British and the US troops are at the painfully sharp end of a strange experiment in western foreign policy. This is the application of military force, and the inevitable spilling of western soldiers' blood, in regions where the west has no discernible strategic or political interest. Instead, we are told, there is a pressing moral need to intervene, to save one group of people or another from possible starvation and certain ruin. The Cold War, it is true, was always described by the west in moral terms - President John F Kennedy spoke of paying any price in the pursuit and defence of liberty - but the real motivation was not moral, but self-preservatory: the west believed, in my view correctly, that it was the intention of the Soviet Union to subvert its political systems and security. Similarly, the British declaration of war against Germany in 1939 is often seen as a moral crusade, whereas Britain entered the war with reluctance, when it was finally clear that Germany was bent on destroying the balance of power in Europe, the very basis of long-term British foreign policy. As for the US, like the USSR, it waited until it was attacked militarily, before entering the second world war. It would be similarly erroneous to imagine that the old Allies' reconstitution to fight Saddam Hussein was a decision determined by a scrutiny of its collective conscience. Britain, France and the US had supported the Iraqi dictator militarily, not because they did not know what he was doing to his own people, but because he was seen as a secular bulwark against the spread of Islamic fundamentalism. Then he made a grab for the world's most prolific oil fields, the ones we in the west most need to keep our cars on the road, and our airplanes in the skies. In this way, and only in this way, Saddam became, I think rightly, our enemy. Because the west still think the Iraqi dictator has ambitions in this direction, it is threatening him over a 'no fly' zone. It is an illusion to think that hearts in Foggy Bottom and King Charles Street are bleeding over the plight of the Marsh Arabs who live in the zone. But there is no practical argument behind the sending of British troops to Bosnia. Arguably, if all the west is after is security in the region, it should give the Serbs a free hand to carve out discrete ethnic areas in the former Yugoslavia, however repulsive their methods. The intervention is, as it claims to be, purely humanitarian, which is why the Foreign Office is so uneasy and hesitant in its handling of the affair: it has been dragged by a section of public opinion into a place where it would rather not be. I suspect the same attitude of misgiving must pervade the State Department over the exposure of 30,000 US troops in Somalia. But George Bush decided that food must get through to women and children who were starving. How were they starving? On peak-time US television, that's how. And where could John Major see the emaciated frames of Bosnians captured by the Serbs? On British television, that's where. So now we know what the British and American troops will be chanting in Bosnia and Somalia: 'We're here because the networks are here.' Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Coca-Cola falls into red after bad fourth period COCA-COLA Enterprises, the largest bottler for the American soft drinks company, yesterday reported a Dollars 82.4m loss after tax for 1991, compared with a profit of Dollars 93.4m a year earlier. However, the damage came largely in the fourth quarter, when CCE suffered a net loss of Dollars 125m, compared with a Dollars 11.1m profit a year earlier, after taking a Dollars 152m restructuring charge. CCE, in which Coca-Cola has a large minority stake, said that the charge covered a range of organisational changes. These ranged from standardising computer systems to severance and relocation costs resulting from corporate 'decentralisation'. The figures do not include any results for Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, the oldest and biggest of Coca-Cola independent bottlers which CCE acquired via a share swop deal in December - part of a general consolidation trend in soft drinks group's bottling operations. Yesterday, CCE said cash operating profits should show a 'healthy increase' in 1992, but increased interest and amortisation costs related to the Johnston deal would prevent this year's earnings per share surpassing 1991's, once non-recurring items were stripped out.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gartmore seeks Pounds 20m for country funds trust GARTMORE is attempting to raise Pounds 20m for a new investment trust, which will invest in single country funds in emerging markets, such as Latin America and south Asia, writes Philip Coggan. Although there are other investment trusts specialising in emerging markets, this is the first to concentrate on the country funds sector. There are around 160 emerging country funds worldwide, of which 53 have listings in London. Many of these funds stand at a substantial discount to their asset values and because of this Gartmore does not believe that shares in the new Emerging County Funds Trust will themselves be plagued by a discount. However, the managers have introduced two features to try to restrict the discount; warrants are being offered with the ordinary on a one-for-five basis, and shareholders will have the right to vote on the winding up of the trust, if the shares and warrants trade at a discount of over 5 per cent for 12 consecutive months. Gartmore is trying to place a minimum of 20m shares at 100p each.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Management changes at Bollore Technologies A management shake-up at Bollore Technologies, the diversified French industrial group, is due to be confirmed at the group board's meeting later today, following the news on Friday of a change in chief executive. Bollore Technologies clarified a leaked report on Friday that Mr Jean-Paul Parayre would be replaced by Mr Bernard Esambert as its president. However, the company indicated that the change - likely to be the result of the former's differences of opinion with Mr Vincent Bollore, chief shareholder in the group - was relatively amicable. An industrialist with long experience at Peugeot and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, Mr Parayre was only made head of Bollore Technologies in January. However, the group statement said that Mr Parayre had been able to carry out 'earlier than foreseen' the necessary restructuring required, among other things, by January's devaluation of the CFA franc in French Africa, where the group does much of its business. Mr Bollore and Mr Parayre therefore agreed the time had come to 'put a new structure in place'. Giving credence to this is the fact that Mr Parayre is not quitting the group, but swapping places with Mr Esambert as manager of Albatros, the holding company which controls the industrial group. Mr Parayre is also said to have turned around the group's performance, putting it into profit in the first half of this year after its FFr357m loss in 1993 as a whole, and selling assets to reduce its debt to FFr5.8bn. However, one of Bollore's main bankers is the hard-pressed Credit Lyonnais, which may be pressing its client in turn for further debt reductions. It may be thought that Mr Esambert, a banker by trade, will give more weight to financial considerations that his predecessor.</p>

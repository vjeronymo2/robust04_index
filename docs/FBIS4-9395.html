			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 25 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government and  secessionists freed 356 Moslem prisoners of war in the Bihac  pocket in northern Bosnia, the International Committee of the  Red Cross (ICRC) said here Monday [25 April].    Moslem secessionist forces led by Fikret Abdic, controlling  the north of the pocket, freed 280 prisoners, and troops loyal  to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in the south freed 76,  the ICRC said. The exchanges followed the signing of an  agreement between the two sides April 23.    ICRC representatives held discussions with each prisoner to  make sure they were happy crossing the front line to rejoin  their own side. The forces have clashed intermittently since  Abdic declared autonomy late last year for Bihac.</p>

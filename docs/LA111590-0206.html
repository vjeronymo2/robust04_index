			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ON PARADE: A nonstop, 16-hour procession of cement trucks will monopolize  Newport Boulevard in Newport Beach Friday night through Saturday morning,  transporting enough concrete to cover a football field 3 feet thick. . . . It's  for a foundation beside the bay and 6 1/2 feet below the water line. The  concrete must be poured continuously "so there are no seams that could leak," a  spokesman said. Northbound lanes in the area will be closed. Nancy Wride and  Herman Wong  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIZZI'S HONOR;  </P> <P> PURSUIT OF BASSOON LESSONS BROUGHT WOODWIND ARTIST TO L.A., WHERE HE PLAYS  STUDIO SESSIONS AND 'CASUALS' WITH EQUAL GLEE.  </P> <P> When Ray Pizzi, whose woodwind artistry has been tapped by such Oscar-winning  film composers as Henry Mancini, decided to move from Boston in 1970, some of  the forces propelling him to Southern California were obvious.  </P> <P> He wanted to see if he could make it in the musical major leagues.  </P> <P> But there was another reason for the move: Pizzi wanted to study the bassoon.  </P> <P> At the time, Pizzi, who received his BA from the jazz-based Berklee School of  Music and his MA in music performance from the Boston Conservatory, had been  teaching music in a secondary school near Boston for over five years.  </P> <P> And while he liked the work, and relished exercising his jazz saxophone chops  with some of Boston's best bands -- from Herb Pomeroy's big band to Gene di  Stacio's Brass Menagerie -- Pizzi believed he owed it to himself to take a shot  at the big time.  </P> <P> Plus he wanted to take lessons from Simon Kovar. Pizzi discovered from  associates that Kovar, a former second bassoonist with the New York  Philharmonic, was considered to be one of the finest teachers of the large  double-reed instrument -- along with former Los Angeles Philharmonic bassoonist  Frederic Moritz.  </P> <P> "I figured I had to either go to New York or L.A., so when I found out that  Simon lived in Los Angeles, I moved here," Pizzi said while standing in the  small guest house behind his Van Nuys home that serves as his studio.  </P> <P> In his almost 20 years here, he's played or recorded with the cream of the  crop: Dizzy Gillespie, Quincy Jones, Barbra Streisand, Frank Zappa, Shelly  Manne, Horace Silver, Bobby McFerrin. And Pizzi, who, like idol Sonny Rollins,  is rarely seen without a hat of one kind or another, has become a bassoon whiz.  </P> <P> In Kovar's hands, Pizzi -- who began on clarinet at age 5 and added tenor  saxophone at 14 -- showed a real talent for the instrument that he laughingly  admitted he "couldn't figure out how to put together" when he first got it in  1968.  </P> <P> "Simon was retired but he took me on, and really took an interest in me," said  Pizzi, dressed in a black sweat shirt, jeans and Panama hat. "I studied with  him three times a week. Sometimes the lessons ran three hours, and because of  his devotion to me, I really developed."  </P> <P> From 1980 through 1984, he was voted the Most Valuable Player on bassoon by his  studio session colleagues, the performing members of the National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences.  </P> <P> "That felt fantastic, to be chosen by your peers," he said in the kitchen of  the home he shares with his wife, Marilyn, and their two children, Alicia and  Michael.  </P> <P> In 1981, when Mancini was commissioned by the New American Orchestra to write a  piece, his opus was titled "Piece for Jazz Bassoon and Orchestra." It was  written specifically for Pizzi and premiered by him with the orchestra at the  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion that year.  </P> <P> "When I heard what he could do with it, his command of the instrument was so  awesome, I said, 'I gotta write this piece,' " said Mancini -- who first used  Pizzi on "The Mancini Generation" CBS TV show in 1972. "Bassoon is not an easy  instrument to play and to pick it up and play it like a flute or a saxophone is  quite an accomplishment."  </P> <P> Nowadays, Pizzi makes most of his public appearances on bassoon with the Wind  Syndicate, a trio that includes clarinetist Morton Lewis and flutist Miriam  Sosewitz, which was spotlighted at a recent Royce Hall concert with the New  American Orchestra and can be heard Jan. 24 at the Comeback Inn in Venice.  </P> <P> "I can't say enough about these people," he said. "They take those notes on the  paper and make it music. I haven't been this excited about a project of mine in  a long time."  </P> <P> "We've been playing together for three years, the regular classical  literature," he continued. "But since I came back from Germany, where I toured  for three weeks last May strictly as a jazz artist, I have been orchestrating  my originals for the group."  </P> <P> How does Pizzi describe his trio's music? "Oh, man," he said, stopping,  spreading his hands in frustration, searching for words. "I call it  third-stream jazz-classical. There are pieces that are kind of classical, kind  of jazz, some humorous, some passionate, with little improvising."  </P> <P> Though it might seem that bassoon is Pizzi's main instrument, he quickly begs  to differ. "Bassoon, saxophones, flute, clarinet, I love them all," he said,  "but if there is one main horn, the tenor saxophone would be that. All of the  hard work, the learning about music, came about on the saxophone. My personal  maturity is most evident on the tenor."  </P> <P> The tenor side of "Pizzaman," as Pizzi jokingly calls himself, is on tap at  Residuals in Studio City where he appears Sunday, and Jan. 25 at Alfonse's in  Toluca Lake with accordionist Frank Marocco, guitarist Al Viola and drummer  Paul Humphrey.  </P> <P> Behind closed doors, Pizzi remains active in the Los Angeles studio scene,  where recent assignments have included work with Mancini and with Jeremy  Lubbock, who used the multi-reedman in a big-band setting behind Madonna on the  score of the upcoming Warren Beatty film "Dick Tracy" and a couple of TV films  with Johnny Mandel, best known for his haunting ballad, "The Shadow of Your  Smile."  </P> <P> Asked why he has been so successful, Pizzi thought a moment, then said: "These  guys hire me to do what I do, to make it music. If a note needs an attitude, I  can give it. I play silly, I play funny, I play sad."  </P> <P> Like many top-flight session players, the 46-year-old Pizzi also works the  occasional "casual" -- musicians' parlance for private parties. He likes the  balance, not to mention the income, they provide.  </P> <P> "I'm versatile, so it never gets to be boring," he said, smiling. "Sure, it's  not busy all the time, but I do enough things that I'm not depending on one arm  of the business to keep me busy. I have done nothing but play my instruments  for the past 20 years. No day gigs. Not a one. And that's lucky. You can be a  fine musician but you still have to be lucky. Timing is everything.  </P> <P> "My thing, and this is what I've been trying to teach my kids, is that it's got  to be fun. If it's not fun, forget it. I'll play tunes for people at parties  who want to dance. Fine. I ain't that proud. If I'm playing good music and I'm  playing my heart, that's all I need to do."  </P> <P> As for career highlights, Pizzi listed the following: "Working with people like  Hank Mancini, Johnny Mandel, Dan Foliart, John Williams and Jack Elliot, who  have all been so loyal. Playing the Mancini piece at the Hollywood Bowl in  1987, with my mother in the audience. Getting in some hot tenor solos on the  sound track of 'Grease,' playing my bassoon in the score for that weird  nightclub scene in 'Return of the Jedi,' appearing at the Monterey Jazz  Festival with Bobby McFerrin and Toots Thielemans in 1987, and, of course, the  movie."  </P> <P> "The movie" is "End of the Rainbow," a short art film by Laszlo Papas and  Marino Colmano in which Pizzi stars as a down-and-out saxophonist, freezing in  a squalid London flat (it was actually shot in downtown Los Angeles). He  hallucinates and thinks he sees a rainbow, and this inspires him to pick up his  saxophone, walk to the fire escape and play "Over the Rainbow." But he can't  remember the bridge, the two-note-based middle portion that fits the words,  "Someday I'll wish upon a star, and wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  . . ." He's so depressed at forgetting the passage that he jumps from the fire  escape, and as he lies dying in the street, he opens his eyes and, in an ironic  twist, recognizes that the two notes of the arriving ambulance's swaying Klaxon  horn are the very notes that begin the portion of the song he had forgotten.  </P> <P> "That was probably the high point of my life," he said. "I was spoiled rotten  for seven days. The star of the movie. 'What would you like now, Mr. Pizzi?' An  unbelievable experience."  </P> <P> Pizzi, who goes to the Soviet Union to perform next May, said, pointing toward  his studio, "The great thing is from that little room, I've reached that far.  That's encouraging. I'll be happy with more of the same, quite frankly."  </P> <P>  Ray Pizzi will play tenor saxophone 9 p.m. Sunday at Residuals, 11042 Ventura  Blvd., Studio City (818) 761-8301, and 9:15 p.m. Jan. 25 at Alfonse's, 10057  Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake (818) 761-3511. There are no cover charges for  either sets.  </P></p>

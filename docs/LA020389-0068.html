			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LEGAL ADVICE BUDGET INCREASED  </P> <P> Due to a substantial increase in lawsuits, including several police brutality  suits, the Torrance City Council unanimously approved spending $25,000 more for  legal advice.  </P> <P> The additional money, approved Tuesday night, will go to the law firm of  Leibert, Cassidy &amp; Frierson, which advises the city on personnel matters,  particularly matters involving the police.  </P> <P> This is the second time in nine months that the city has increased the amount  of fees it will pay the firm. In November, 1987, the city signed a $10,000  contract with Leibert, Cassidy &amp; Frierson to provide legal advice. In May,  1988, those funds were spent and the city appropriated an additional $20,000.  </P> <P> City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the additional funds granted this week are  needed to pay for legal advice on an increasing number of suits, including nine  police brutality lawsuits filed against the city this year.  </P> <P> Last month, when the city's first-quarter fiscal report was released, city  officials expressed concern over the fiscal impact of police-related lawsuits,  saying legal fees will be high, as some of the cases are expected to be in  court for several years.  </P></p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Ulster talks stalled by infighting ROWS between Northern Ireland's Unionist and nationalist leaders last night appeared to have seriously - perhaps fatally - undermined the government's four-week-old attempt to resolve the province's political future by dialogue. In spite of a series of meetings with local political leaders during the day, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, seems to have failed to reach agreement on when to move to the next stage of the agreed talks schedule - the point at which the Irish government would take part. Instead, a sub-committee has been set up to try to resolve the dispute. The delay - which in effect means losing a week out of the 12 set aside for talks - and the apparent anger of Unionist and nationalist leaders, suggests that the initiative may not get any further. Nobody will want to be seen as the first to walk away from the negotiating table, however. The talks have concentrated on finding agreement on a devolved government in the province. The nationalist and Unionist positions have been so far apart, however, that little common ground appears to have been agreed. 'Strand two' of the talks - on relations between north and south - was supposed to start at Sir Patrick's discretion but 'within weeks' and once 'substantial progress' had been made. The two requirements have proved mutually exclusive. Negotiations on issues rather than procedure have lasted far longer this year than during a similar initiative last year, and the participants have largely maintained the promised confidentiality - a sign that some goodwill remains. Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, urged a swift move to strand two while Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, want to stay at strand one. Unionists have been horrified by SDLP proposals for a government in the province that would include commissioners appointed by the Dublin government and the European Community. The army was at the centre of fresh ill-treatment allegations yesterday after a clash with civilians in Londonderry. Police and army investigations have been launched into an incident in the republican Shantallow area on Monday.</p>

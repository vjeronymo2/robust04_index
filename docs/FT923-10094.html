			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Power to the parents / A look at the battle between central and local government over Britain's schools The battle for Britain's schools is about to begin. This week's education white paper marks the end of the phoney war between the government and local authorities. It signals the beginning of an all-out struggle for the hearts and minds of parents, who alone will decide whether their school should desert its local education authority and apply for grant-maintained status. Although schools in England and Wales have now had three years in which to opt out, only a tiny number have done so - 278, or 1.1 per cent of the 25,000 schools in England and Wales. They are almost exclusively concentrated in the home counties, among grammar schools or high-achieving comprehensives. This is ironic, given that a principal objective of the policy was to free schools from town hall bureaucrats in left-wing councils. It is Tory Kent that heads the list, followed by Essex, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Surrey. Liverpool and Lambeth, the ogres of Tory mythology, have a grand total of one grant-maintained school each. In the whole of Wales there are three grant-maintained schools. Why opt out? Mr John Patten's white paper makes autonomy the key argument. 'Autonomy is at the heart of the grant-maintained school idea', with governors of 'self-governing schools' enjoying a 'real sense of ownership'. Grant-maintained schools get their budgets direct from Whitehall: how they spend them is their decision. Governors of GM schools can also apply to change the character of their schools, in defiance of the wishes of their local authority. Local authorities and opponents of opting-out say the autonomy is a sham. Budget totals are fixed by Whitehall, and the new funding council to be established under the white paper will, they say, interfere just as much as local education authorities when it comes to matching supply and demand. As to the issue of selection, all schools are obliged to follow the detailed national curriculum, and for all the white paper's talk of 'specialisation', ministers are evidently unenthusiastic about a wholesale return to the 11-plus exam. Parents trying to make sense of the emotive arguments on both sides should pay particular attention to the funding implications for their school. At present, grant-maintained schools receive a grant equal to their previous local education authority (LEA) funding. They also receive a share of the LEA's central education budget, calculated at 15 per cent of the school's budget. This formula has, for the most part, enhanced the budgets of grant-maintained secondary schools at the expense of schools remaining with the local authority. Capital budgets for grant-maintained schools are fixed directly by Whitehall - and in practice they appear to be getting far more than their 'fair' share of such grants. All that will change from the 1994-95 financial year, by when the new funding council should be up and running. The government has to finalise the details, but the white paper envisages grant-maintained schools being funded thereafter by a formula related to the sum the government estimates the local authority in each area should be spending on its schools - the so-called 'standard spending assessment'. So, if your local authority is spending above its spending assessment on schools, you might be better off opting out; if it spends below, you could do best staying with the local authority. That fact alone is likely to encourage councils to spend up to or above their spending assessment on education, even if it means cutting other services in the process - as it probably will, since their overall spending is currently capped by the government. Since the government will nonetheless be keen to keep the opt-out momentum going, it may have to find some extra compensation. One prominent LEA whose spending may rise to keep in the game is Birmingham. Indeed, when Mr Patten introduced the white paper this week he singled out the city for particular attack, accusing it of being 'one of the worst education authorities in the country' and 'kidnapping' Pounds 55m from its education budget to spend in other sectors. What is the current position, and how is the city reacting to the grant-maintained challenge? The ornate, panelled chief education officer's office in Birmingham would, as Mr David Hammond, its occupant, admits, prove incongruously grand for the role of local education authorities envisaged in the white paper. But only three of the city's 420 schools are as yet grant-maintained, and the city council is confident it will remain a significant player. Birmingham's moderate Labour leaders angrily reject Mr Patten's 'kidnapping' allegation. There is no doubt that the city's education budget is currently Pounds 55m below the government's standard spending assessment. This has been the case for several years, with the gap between the assessment and the council's education budget once as high as Pounds 64m. Birmingham's leaders deny, however, that city is a low spender on education. They say that unlike most local authorities, many of their educational activities - further education, training services and libraries - are not run or financed by the education department, so comparisons between the education budget and the standard spending assessment convey a false impression. They claim that on total spending per pupil, Birmingham is ahead of the average for metropolitan authorities - Pounds 390 a year compared with Pounds 368. Sir Richard Knowles, the council leader, says the city is this year adding an extra 111 teachers and assistants to its payroll, and that pupils' performance 'bears favourable comparison' with other city authorities - the proportion gaining five or more GCSE passes at grades A-C increased from 18 to 24 per cent between 1988 and 1991. The argument between Mr Patten and Birmingham is, however, more than a discussion about definitions of local government expenditure. Mr Hammond is 'sure it was no coincidence that on the day of launching the white paper Mr Patten should have chosen to attack Birmingham on the standard spending assessment'. Members of Birmingham's opposition Conservative group have made similar points in the council chamber and - particularly since the poor physical condition of school buildings has been a big feature in several opt-out campaigns in the city - the prospect of extra funds for repairs could prove a powerful argument for the pro-GM lobby. Birmingham city council resolutely opposes grant-maintained status. Against the three schools which have so far gone, attempts by parents at two other secondary schools to leave the LEA have just been defeated in ballots. Some of the city's famous King Edward's grammar schools are expected to go grant-maintained before long. The city council is actively campaigning to keep its schools, aiming to convince parents, says Sir Richard, of the 'benefits for their schools and the communities they serve of staying in the local education authority family'. Curriculum support, the music service, home tuition for children with long-term illness problems, replacements for staff on sick-leave and the council's environmental studies centres are all presented as advantages. Some of the non-educational benefits are summed-up in a letter from one of the city's head teachers contained in recent education committee minutes. It thanks the council's engineers, insurance assessors and other specialists for their assistance after a fire at the school. 'We all appreciate the help and support we are receiving,' it concludes. 'So much for opting out.' The council has taken a carefully undogmatic tone in its approaches to parents, stressing that with the policy of local management, under which LEAs are obliged to hand most of their budgets direct to schools, head teachers 'can and do have the best of both worlds' - delegated powers over finance and staffing while staying in the family. Even if progress towards grant-maintained status remains slow in Birmingham, however, council officials expect that the government's proposed central funding agency will gain a foothold in the city's educational affairs within two years. This happens within an LEA's area when at least 10 per cent of an authority's pupils are in grant-maintained schools - a much easier threshold to reach than 10 per cent of the schools. Mr Hammond sees 'some sound proposals' in the white paper, for example its approach to the provision of education for children with special needs. 'However, it condemns us to another five years or more of chaos during which there could be three education authorities in the city - the council, the funding agency and education associations put in to take over the management of particular schools.' (Education associations are the task forces which Mr Patten proposes to send into schools declared to be 'at risk' by the schools inspectorate). Mr Hammond regrets the extent to which the white paper seeks to rule out a direct role for local authorities over much of the future education agenda, at a moment when 'other government departments are developing new ways of working with local authorities on policies like City Challenge and care in the community'. One of his deepest concerns is for the future of specialist services, some of which do not fall neatly into conventional budgets. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, last month launched her Health of the Nation strategy, which seeks to reduce teenage pregnancies, smoking, drinking and drug abuse among the young. Birmingham has an 18-strong health education unit in its education service which has won praise from the government and and Midlands health authorities. 'The unit is doing some of the best schools health education work in the country. Do we believe that, in a completely fragmented system of grant-maintained schools, that work will continue in the same way? Do we really believe it?' Parents may, of course, find themselves in an invidious position: keen to maintain city-wide bodies like the unit, but not in a position to influence the decision more than marginally one way or another by the decision they take over their particular school. Almost the only thing they can influence is the revenue of their school for the immediate few years ahead. The main impact even of that decision will be felt by the succeeding generation of children. Though, of course, by then the system may have changed again.  ----------------------------------------------               GREATER LONDON  ---------------------------------------------- Bromley       10    Croydon                1 Hillingdon     8    Hammersmith &amp; Fulham   1 Ealing         5    Kensington &amp; Chelsea   1 Sutton         5    Lambeth                1 Wandsworth     4    Newham                 1 Barnet         2    Southwark              1 Bexley         2    Tower Hamlets          1 Brent          2    Waltham Forest         1  ----------------------------------------------</p>

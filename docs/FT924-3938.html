			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Syltone profits warning SYLTONE, the transport engineering group which makes ancillary systems for trucks, warned yesterday that six years of steady profit growth were likely to come to a halt by the March 1993 year-end because of recession in the UK and Europe. Syltone shares fell 15p to 248p on the announcement. Although the group reported a 4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.22m (Pounds 1.17m) in the half-year to September, Mr Mike Clewes, finance director, said sales to Europe which had sustained Syltone through the UK recession, had dried up in the last quarter. Turnover amounted to Pounds 17.35m against Pounds 16.94m. Mr John Marsh, managing director, said: 'The current six months are going to be rough, but I've no problems about the future from then on.' The group's UK business was picking up and the devaluation of sterling would lift exports, he stated. The interim dividend is held at 3.15p from earnings per share of 8.25p (8.4p).</p>

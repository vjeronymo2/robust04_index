			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As the Technical Specifications permit pre-planned release even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an inoperable instrument, the margin of safety is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted by an extended surveillance interval provided that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument operability is verified prior to release. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also required by the Technical Specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(3) Low Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure Reactor Trip:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turbine Auto Stop Oil Pressure system be changed from every 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No credit is taken for a reactor trip from a low turbine auto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stop oil pressure signal resulting from a turbine trip. Rather,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the safety analysis assumes this reactor trip does not occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during full load rejection until an overpower delta T condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causes a reactor trip. In addition, no credit is taken for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system for turbine missile protection. Therefore, extending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval for this parameter has no impact upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As no credit is taken in the safety analysis for this trip, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility of a new or different kind of accident has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> created by extending the surveillance interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Past test results have not identified any failures. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to Generic Letter 91&hyph;04, it is reasonably expected that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this system will continue to function in an acceptable manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over an extended operating cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(4) 6.9 kv Undervoltage Relays:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the 6.9 kv  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undervoltage channel be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quarterly testing of these relays is required by Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications. The data from the quarterly tests of the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relays will be used to assure that drift does not exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected values. The quarterly tests provide a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining calibration within specified values, virtually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating any impact upon safety from an extended operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the quarterly tests assure that relay performance remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within specified limits, there is no possibility of creating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for a channel functional test each quarter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimizes any potential impact upon safety due to an extended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(5) Boric Acid Tank Level:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequence of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Boric Acid Tank Level instrumentation be changed from every 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> error resulting from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis limit provides assurance that plant protective actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than) Technical Specification limits, will provide protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased operating cycle will not result in a channel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the current Technical Specification limit and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary to assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits are not exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [(6) Vapor Containment Sump Discharge Flow and Temperature Channel:]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated will not occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the VC sump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge flow and temperature channel be changed from every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing Technical Specification and the licensing basis Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Analysis to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant increase in the probability or consequences of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident previously evaluated has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification and the Safety Analysis. Plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification limits, will provide protective functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Davenport Vernon sees decline Shares in Davenport Vernon, the multi-franchise motor group, plunged 20p to 132p yesterday, after Mr Ralph Denne, the chairman warned yesterday that profits for the six months to March 31 would be significantly below those for the same period last year. Mr Denne told the annual meeting that despite an overall rise in group sales of both new and used vehicles, there had been a falling profit contribution from the Japanese and Volkswagen Audi franchises. This followed manufacturers' changes in trading margins and bonus arrangements. In addition, the five new dealerships which began trading in 1993 had produced losses during their start up periods. The chairman said that the group was re-aligning costs to meet current conditions and, with a good performance from its volume franchises, he anticipated 'a return to normal levels of profitability in the second half'. Pre-tax profits in the year ended September 30 1993 were up 29 per cent to Pounds 2.11m.</p>

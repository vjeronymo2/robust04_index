			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China is considering  setting up a high-tech investment foundation in cooperation with  foreign financial bodies.    The total sum will be 120 million U.S. dollars, the State  Science and Technology Commission revealed today.    "China develops high technologies mainly on its own  strength,  but it also welcomes assistance from abroad," said Huang Qitao,  deputy director of the commission.    The country started building its high-tech industry in 1988,  under the "torch plan". Last year there were more than 10,000  high-tech firms nationwide, with 700,000 workers.    Among them, 4,000 are overseas-funded companies.    Domestic sales and exports of high-tech products will make  up  25 percent of China's gross national product and export volume  by the year 2000, according to the government blueprint.    The new materials, energy, biological technology,  electronics  and information industries, and environmental protection are  highlights on China's high-tech plan.</p>

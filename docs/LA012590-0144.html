			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOPES FOR DEMOCRACY DIM IN HAITI;  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN: A STATE OF SIEGE IS IN EFFECT. THIS HAS ALL BUT SPOILED CHANCES OF  FAIR ELECTIONS THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> Hope for democracy in Haiti has faded to a dim flicker after a harsh crackdown  by the country's provisional military government, Haitian and foreign analysts  say.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the president, used dictatorial powers last weekend to  declare a state of siege, impose censorship and persecute political and civic  leaders. Dozens have been arrested, some have been severely beaten, and at  least five have been deported.  </P> <P> Analysts say the government actions have all but destroyed the possibility that  elections scheduled for this year by Avril could be considered free and fair.  </P> <P> "He's looking like a dictator," said one foreign diplomat.  </P> <P> "I feel that things are spoiled," another said. "How can you trust that guy,  who imposes a state of siege for no real reason except to enforce his power?"  </P> <P> Avril is now under strong international pressure to end the repression and  guarantee open elections. U.S. Ambassador Alvin P. Adams met with the general  this week and "made it crystal clear that we deplore and are outraged by what  has happened here," Adams told foreign reporters Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We hope that ways can be found . . . to restore and enhance confidence in the  electoral process," the ambassador said.  </P> <P> But the consensus among other diplomats and Haitian analysts interviewed this  week was that any future democratic gesture by Avril probably would lack the  credibility needed for unfettered elections.  </P> <P> "I think that at this stage the best solution would be to get Avril out of  power," said a Haitian political scientist. Asked how, he said: "Pray to God."  </P> <P> On Wednesday afternoon, unconfirmed rumors of an army coup plot against Avril  circulated in Port-au-Prince. Some downtown stores closed early as fear of  trouble spread, but nothing happened.  </P> <P> Since the state of siege was declared Saturday, the city has been peaceful,  with no signs of rebellious military activity. Repression by the army and  police was severe over the weekend, however. By one diplomatic tally, security  forces detained nearly 80 people, later releasing most of them.  </P> <P> Presidential hopeful Hubert de Ronceray and Gerard Brun, another politician,  were among those beaten and deported. Some of the beatings reportedly took  place in the white-domed presidential palace where Avril lives and works.  </P> <P> Politicians have gone into hiding, and some who are overseas are unsure of  whether they may return. Avril decreed the suspension of several constitutional  guarantees, including one ensuring the right of Haitians to return to their  country without visas.  </P> <P> He also imposed censorship on radio broadcasts, the main vehicle for news in  Haiti. Independent stations suspended all news programs Tuesday because of an  official order requiring that news material be submitted to the government for  prior approval.  </P> <P> "We can't work. We can't say anything," a radio reporter said. "The threats are  getting stronger and stronger."  </P> <P> The radio news blackout was the most severe since the country was ruled by  President Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier. On Feb. 7, Haiti will mark the  fourth anniversary of the day that ended 29 years of dictatorship by Duvalier  and his father, Francois. The son stepped down and fled the country in 1986  after months of popular rebellion against him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Elections Pledged  </P> <P> Last September, Avril, who had taken power a year earlier, promised elections  for 1990. This month, he approved a calendar setting municipal elections for  late April, two rounds of legislative elections for July and August, and the  first round of presidential elections for October, with a runoff in November.  </P> <P> But signs of authoritarian excess by Avril already have been clear for months.  In November, authorities arrested and beat three major political figures,  refusing them medical and legal aid for several days.  </P> <P> "It showed that the guy was becoming meaner and meaner," one diplomat observed.  </P> <P> In November, gunmen with Uzi assault guns killed three partisans of former  President Leslie F. Manigat who were posting signs calling for Manigat's return  to power.  </P> <P> Knowledgeable diplomatic sources say hundreds of civilian security agents have  been recruited to work with the 1,200-member Presidential Guard, the main  fighting unit of the army, since last fall.  </P> <P> Some of the agents, called "attaches," are former members of the Tontons  Macoutes, the brutal political police of the Duvalier regime, the diplomatic  sources said.  </P> <P> While Avril was on an official trip to Taiwan this month, opposition  politicians issued an unsuccessful call for a general strike and said the  general need not return. A group called the Civic Society for the Defense of  the Constitution sent a telex to the government of Taiwan saying that any  agreements made with the visiting delegation would not be binding on the  Haitian people.  </P> <P> The opposition maneuvers and the telex, published in the Taiwanese press,  apparently infuriated Avril. To those who sent the telex, Avril said on his  return: "You are betraying the Haitian people."  </P> <P> On Friday morning, unidentified gunmen killed Andre Neptune, an obscure colonel  in the Presidential Guard, along with his wife and a servant. The Saturday  announcement of the state of siege alluded to that slaying and those of a radio  announcer, political party members and some foreign residents and businessmen.  </P> <P> "In view of this escalation of violence, the government, aware of its role as  the guardian of public security and peace, will take all appropriate measures  to end these destabilizing maneuvers that could compromise the democratic  process," said a communique from the ministers of interior and information.  </P> <P> Most independent analysts say the government crackdown is unnecessary and  counterproductive, however. It resulted in a freeze on plans by the United  States, Canada and France to begin resuming economic aid to Haiti, the poorest  country in the hemisphere. The United States suspended aid after an aborted  election in 1987.  </P> <P> No clear reason has emerged for the crackdown, but theories abound. One  speculates that it resulted from army infighting over graft and payoffs that  military men are known to receive in return for their loyalty to the  government. Neptune, the colonel killed Friday, is said to have been in charge  of distributing cash and privileges to members of the presidential guard.  </P> <P> Another says that Avril simply moved to consolidate his powers.  </P></p>

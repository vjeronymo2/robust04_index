			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 4 May (TANJUG) -- In his letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, Milan Martic, president of the  republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], welcomes Butrus-Ghali's  initiative for a new international conference on the former  Yugoslavia.    In his letter the RSK president writes that the war in the  former Yugoslavia and all its horrible consequences could have  been averted had there been more understanding and a better  insight into the historic causes of the crisis in former  Yugoslavia in 1990 and 1991.    "At that time Europe's most powerful countries unfortunately  supported the creation of an ethnic community's state on the  territory of other ethnic communities, so that the territories  of the new states on the soil of the former Yugoslavia  corresponded with the artificial states designed by Nazi Germany  in 1941," the letter states. It also notes that "in both cases,  old Serbian lands were incorporated into the states of Muslims  and Croats, while the Serbs were condemned to death,  persecution, and assimilation."    Martic recalls the European principles articulated by the  Badinter arbitration commission, which told the peoples of  former Yugoslavia that the international community would  recognize the new states, provided they met the following  conditions: they should have a territory, a population, and they  should exercise legislative authority on that territory.    "The Republic of Croatia was recognized, including the  territory of the republic of Serb Krajina, where Croatia does  not exercise legislative authority; nor does this territory  belong to the Croatian ethnic community. The population that  used to live there was not Croatian either," Martic adds.    The right to self-determination, however, has not only been  acknowledged as an exclusive right of the Serbian nation, the  letter to the UN secretary general says.    These facts were ignored in 1990 and 1991, as well as later  on in the work of the international conference on former  Yugoslavia, which, according to Martic, resulted in the  escalation of the war between the Serbs and the Croats, the  Serbs and the Muslims, and later between the Muslims and the  Croats.    Reminding the UN secretary general about the persecution of  the Serbs in Croatia during World War II, when some 1,250,000  Serbs perished, as well as about data on Serbs murdered in and  expelled from Croatia over the past four years, Martic stressed  he does not believe the secretary general and other officials in  the world could afford to ignore the republic of Serb Krajina.    "Serb Krajina must be included in the work of the new  international conference on former Yugoslavia, which you intend  to organize. The republic of Serb Krajina, albeit unrecognized,  is nevertheless a factor in international relations, and is  subject to international law. On 29 March this year it signed  an agreement with the Republic of Croatia and was thus  recognized as a warring side. It has the full right to take  part in agreements on setting up future relations between the  new states created on the territory of former Yugoslavia," RSK  president Milan Martic concludes in his letter to Butrus-Ghali.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Moscow] </F>   [Text] The North Korea-Russia forestry agreement to cut  logs in Siberia was automatically abolished as the agreement  expired on 31 December. Whether North Korea will withdraw its  20,000 workers and equipment from Siberia is a matter of concern.    Meanwhile, North Korea and Russia held its first forestry  meeting in Pyongyang in early December to sign a new agreement.  However, the meeting broke up because the sides had  significantly different views. They reportedly agreed to hold a  second meeting in Moscow. North Korea is expected to accept all  of Russia's demands.</p>

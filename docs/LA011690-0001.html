			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Baby Boss on the Way: Columbia Records and other sources close to Bruce  Springsteen confirmed Monday that the rocker's girlfriend/backup singer Patti  Scialfa is expecting, though no date for the blessed event is known. The couple  has reportedly been working lately on tracks for Scialfa's solo debut album and  possibly for a new Springsteen album, but -- as with the baby -- no release  dates have been announced. At the time of Springsteen's 1988 divorce from  Julianne Phillips, there was speculation that reluctance on her part to have  children so that she could concentrate on her acting career precipitated the  split, but neither party has commented on the matter publicly.

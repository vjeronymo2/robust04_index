			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 18 (AFP)--Hong Kong Governor Chris  Patten leaves here Tuesday [18 January] for London for a regular  review of British policy on the territory with renewed call for  China to resume talks on democratic reforms in the colony.  Patten angered Beijing by submitting parts of his controversial  reform package on electoral reform last month after 17 rounds of  talks on the issue between Britain and China failed to reach any  agreement.    He told reporters before leaving for London that "we hope  ...  that talks can be resumed." "If we're not able to resume  discussions as we would like then we will have to discharge our  responsibilities without there having been an agreement," he  said.    However, Patten, who will give evidence to the House of  Commons' foreign affairs select committee in London during his  visit ending Monday, said: "I think it's unlikely that we would  want to go ahead with the last stage of legislations while the  present bill is in the Legislative Council."    "I think ideally we'd want to see the Legislative Council  deal with that bill first and then move on to next one but ...  we need this bill in order to get on with drawing up the  register of voters in the spring, in April," he said.    The governor said he would be attending a meeting with other  ministers to consider the progress of the legislation on  political development in Hong Kong and the next steps to take if  China refused any further resumption of talks, while in London.  Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</p>

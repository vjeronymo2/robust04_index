			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 9 (CTK) -- The Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH), a government coalition party, is proposing that  a limit of ten million Slovak crowns ($300,000) be set on  political parties' expenditure during the present election  campaign. The media -- television, radio, the press as well as  billboard owners -- should be obliged to inform the Central  Electoral Commission immediately after the elections of the  amount each political party spent on advertising, Jan  Carnogursky said at a press conference today. The Slovak  general elections are scheduled for September 30 and October 1.    If party spending on the campaign exceeded the limit by ten  percent the state contribution to the party in question would be  cut by the according amount, he proposed.    Carnogursky said the KDH had found support for the motion  within the government coalition. He did not say when his party  would formally submit the bill to parliament. The proposal is  seen as being directed against Vladimir Meciar's party, the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), allegedly the richest  party after presiding over many privatisation projects while in  power. Meciar denies the allegations.</p>

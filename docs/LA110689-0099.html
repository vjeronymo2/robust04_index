			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA MAN KILLED, WIFE HURT AS FLEEING TEEN-AGER RAMS CAR  </P> <P> A Santa Ana man was killed and his wife critically injured early today when a  15-year-old wrong-way driver crashed into the couple's car as the teen-ager  tried to elude pursuing police, authorities said.  </P> <P> The teen-ager, who was not identified because of age, was traveling north in  the southbound lanes of Fairview Street at an estimated 80 m.p.h. in a stolen,  four-wheel-drive pickup truck, said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton.  </P> <P> He smashed broadside into the couple's car, which was heading west on 1st  Street. The truck struck with such force that both the man and women were  thrown from their car. Neither was identified by police pending notification of  relatives.  </P> <P> Helton said the incident began about 3:45 a.m. when a police officer noticed  the pickup truck being driven erratically while headed west on McFadden Avenue,  near Raitt Street. When the young driver apparently saw the officer behind him,  he abruptly turned into a shopping center and then headed north on Fairview  Street.  </P> <P> To further evade the officer, the youth turned into the oncoming southbound  traffic lanes and speeded up. The officer, Helton said, remained in the  northbound lanes as the pickup ran a red light at 1st Street and struck the  car.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old driver of the car was pronounced dead at United Western Medical  Center about two hours after the crash. The 33-year-old woman was in critical  condition at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana youth received only a minor cut on his head in the crash. He was  taken to Juvenile Hall where he was booked on suspicion of murder, grand theft  auto, possession of stolen property and evading a police officer.  </P> <P> The pickup had been stolen from Huntington Beach recently, he said.  </P></p>

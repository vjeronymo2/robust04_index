			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The fifth meeting of  the Sino-Libyan Mixed Committee for Economic, Trade, Scientific  and Technological Cooperation opened here this morning.    Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, and Fathi Bin-Shatwan, Libya's secretary for  industry and mineral resources, presided over the opening  ceremony.    Wu said that China is keen on developing trade and economic  relations with Libya, and recent years had seen a smooth growth  of these relations.    "We hope to further the relations considering the strong  complementary nature of the two economies."    Bin-Shatwan said Libyan-Chinese economic and trade relations  had developed quickly with great potential since the mixed  committee was formed in 1982.    He hoped that China would get to know the Libyan market  better and get further involved in Libya's economic development.</p>

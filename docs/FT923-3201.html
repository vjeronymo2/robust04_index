			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / French referendum to be a cliffhanger FRANCE'S referendum on European monetary and political union will be a cliffhanger right to the last minute, when the first results of the vote start to emerge from the interior ministry's computers next Sunday evening. Public opinion polls closed last Saturday at midnight, as they must do seven days before an election under French law, showing that the Yes camp has a slim majority, but that it has lost ground over the past week. The average of the five last polls before Saturday midnight gave a narrow 52.4 per cent in favour of the treaty  - of those who have made up their minds  - down from 54.2 per cent shown by a similar average the previous week, according to Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. Among the final batch, an extremely detailed BVA poll for the Liberation newspaper, gave a 50-50 split between those who have made up their minds. Paradoxically it indicated at the same time that 60 per cent of the electorate supported monetary union and 62 per cent supported external security co-operation, the main points in the treaty. Some 42 per cent said they saw the referendum as a chance to vote against the government. All this confirms the impression that French voting intentions are still clouded by domestic politics. 'The Yes campaigners are failing to give people strong personal reasons for voting for the treaty and have instead warned them of catastrophe if they vote against. The electorate could be getting tired of this message. The No campaign, by contrast, has focused on the specific personal worries inciting people to vote against,' said Mr Mercier. Better news for the Yes campaign came from a Sofres poll for TF1 on Saturday, which gave 52 per cent in favour of Maastricht and said that 73 per cent of those interviewed thought that the pro-treaty camp would win. According to Ifop, for Journal du Dimanche, the Yes camp had 53 per cent, two-and-a-half points up on an Ifop poll five days previously. Even the polling organisations agree that their results cannot be taken at face value. President Francois Mitterrand is more familiar to the vagaries of polls than most, since the polling organisations did not foresee his 1981 presidential election victory until the last minute. The small size of pollsters' samples, usually around 1,000 people, means that there is a margin of error of several percentage points when extrapolating the result to a national referendum. To complicate the outlook further, up to 29 per cent of the electorate does not know how it will vote, according to the most recent surveys. They could go either way or abstain on Sunday. For another thing, French opinion polls are notoriously volatile. The French are so intensively quizzed on political matters  - the Journal de Dimanche has a political poll nearly every week, even in quiet times  - that there is a temptation for people being polled to use the occasion to toy with opinions rather than express real views. But the polls are doubly volatile this time. When President Mitterrand called a referendum on 3 June, the day after the Danish No vote, opinion surveys indicated that nearly 70 per cent of the French electorate would give the treaty its blessing. But that majority steadily ebbed away through July and August as the anti-Maastricht lobby took the campaign initiative, pushing hard on the theme of sovereignty. The government's image at the same time received a battering from the truckers' strike, a scandal over Aids-contaminated blood and the latest twists in a long running controversy over allegedly illicit party funding. The sudden emergence of a small majority against the treaty by the end of August shocked a previously sluggish pro-Maastricht campaign into action. Since then, a flurry of meetings and interviews, culminating in Mr Mitterrand's marathon television debate on September 3 have given the pro-treaty vote a much-needed lift.</p>

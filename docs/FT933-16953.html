			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (8): Likely to be a long haul / Assessing expansion prospects for eastern Germany FINANCIAL services, from banking to insurance, are now firmly established throughout eastern Germany. But the expansion of these services depends on two factors: the extent to which the economy of the five new states will start growing, and the resolution of outstanding property rights. Western Germany's big banks, and the private banking sector, moved quickly into eastern Germany in late 1990. The expectations at that time were high, but they were short-lived. Eastern Germans rushed to spend west German marks exchanged for the largely worthless ost mark. But the consumer boom ended over a year ago. The east Germans are now beginning to save. However, what banks want to see is the expansion of the market - and that is not yet happening. There are two reasons why the market is not growing as fast as it should. First, eastern Germany's exports were dependent on the former Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe. Monetary union meant that these countries could not afford to pay hard currency prices for eastern German products. In turn, eastern German products could not compete on western markets. In short, any western German or foreign investor who decides to locate in eastern Germany now does so with the expectation of a long haul. No banker or investor expects to make quick returns - with the exception, perhaps, of the construction industry. This is a common view shared by the west German-owned mittelstand: the small and medium sized companies which are now setting up subsidiary companies in eastern Germany, and which formed the backbone of Germany's post-war development. Each mittelstand manager in eastern Germany has his or her own tale to tell. But all agree that these new companies have to find new markets - markets which are concentrated on the local region. High labour and transport costs, as well as low productivity, means that the mittelstand in eastern Germany cannot expect any advantages with regard to competitive labour costs. 'These small companies cannot cluster around large industry in eastern Germany, simply because this heavy industry and manufacturing base no longer exists,' explains Mr Georg Krupp, a member of Deutsche Bank's board and a specialist on the mittelstand in eastern Germany. 'These companies have to start from scratch. The memory and spirit of the entrepreneurial culture in eastern Germany has to be recreated,' he adds. This means that neither the banks nor the fledgling mittelstand in eastern Germany can expect quick returns on investments. Financial services will therefore be oriented towards the very long term, rather than the short term. The growth of financial services in the region will also be dependent on the levels of unemployment. Real unemployment - including part-time work and job creation schemes - now accounts for between 30 and 35 per cent of the labour force. This figure could increase with job guarantee contracts agreed between the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising eastern German industry, and those who bought firms from the agency end. The Treuhand has managed to secure 1.4m job places. An increasing reduction in consumer spending will have an impact on financial services. Another problem which dogs the eastern German economy: property rights. The unification treaty stipulates that any property seized by the Nazis between 1935 and 1945 can be reclaimed, or its original owners can seek compensation. The same rights apply to those whose property was seized by the communists after 1949, until 1990. But those whose land was expropriated by the Russians occupying eastern Germany in 1945-1949 can only seek limited compensation. Although the government has now made it easier for investors to purchase property - provided they are committed to creating jobs and investment - sorting out who owns what, and what level of compensation the original owners should be granted, has delayed both western German and foreign investment in eastern Germany. In eastern Germany there are over 1m claims involving more than 2m items of property - from houses and small shops to factories and tracts of land. In Berlin alone there are over 114,000 outstanding claims. In Leipzig, a thriving city in the southern eastern state of Saxony, the authorities have yet to process over 26,000 claims. Claims take time. In some cases the relatives or heirs cannot be contacted. Even if they can be found, and all the relevant documents are presented to the property rights offices in each city, constant disputes over the levels of compensation take place. There is also the emotional problem of reclaiming property in which some families have lived for decades. Efforts have been made to protect the rights of the latter, particularly if they acquired the property in good faith. But nevertheless, justice ministry officials in the eastern German states say that the whole question of property rights has slowed down investment. 'It is too late now. But we should have decided on one or the other - compensation or restitution. The law has pleased no one. But when it comes to property, I wonder whether any other decision would have pleased everybody,' a senior justice ministry official said recently. Outstanding property rights are expected to be resolved in about 10 years. But western German investors, bankers, and the business community agree that it will take at least 10 years for eastern Germany to create an infrastructure and an environment which will allow it to compete within the whole of Germany and the European Community. 'No matter what sector of the economy you talk about, we have to look to the long term. There is no such thing as a quick buck now in eastern Germany. It will be a long hard slog,' says Deutsche Bank's Mr Krupp.</p>

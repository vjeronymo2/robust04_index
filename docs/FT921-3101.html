			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Mather quits as head of troubled IEA think-tank MR GRAHAM MATHER has quit as general director of the troubled Institute of Economic Affairs, after a new row within the faction-riven rightwing think-tank. Mr Mather, 37, took his decision yesterday after details of a private agreement between him and the board, involving his departure at the end of the year, were leaked to the press. His resignation comes amid fresh evidence of renewed fighting between factions - Thatcherite loyalists in the Conservative party, represented by the anti-European Community Bruges Group, and forces more in tune with the approach to Britain's EC membership taken by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Supporters of Mr Mather, who took up the post in January 1987, believe he is the victim of a long-standing campaign to undermine him. Last year, Lord Harris of High Cross and Mr Arthur Seldon - two founder members - threatened to quit the board after Mr Mather endorsed publications backing a more positive attitude to the EC. In a compromise 'truce' between the IEA's two factions last September, it was agreed that Lord Harris and Mr Seldon would remain on the board and the general director would stay in his post. But controversy continued to dog the institute following Mr Mather's backing for new policy proposals, including the investigation of further proposed market-oriented reforms of Whitehall and Westminster. The revelation that Mr Mather planned to leave at the end of the year prompted him to give three months' notice. 'There is clearly no long term future for any think-tank riven by internal faction fighting,' he said last night. 'I do believe that the work for which I have stood at the IEA - the extension of market solutions to European political problems and the advance of markets into government itself - is worthwhile and has a future.' Mr Mather, a solicitor who first came to national prominence as head of policy at the Institute of Directors, plans to start a new think-tank, the London Institute for Economic and Policy Studies. It will take a positive view of a decentralised EC, look at constitutional reforms of the machinery of government and the extension of market principles into public services and examine the economic powers of regulators.</p>

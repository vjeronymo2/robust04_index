			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / China tries to win control of HK chamber CHINA has stepped up its 'united front' activities in Hong Kong and is taking steps to gain control of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, the colony's leading business association, and the one which so far has resisted its blandishments. The moves came as a group of 49 Hong Kong personalities flew to Beijing yesterday to receive letters of appointment as so-called 'advisers' to China on Hong Kong affairs. The appointment of businessmen, politicians and former civil servants are seen as yet another attempt to flout the authority of Britain in the face of a growing row over democracy in Hong Kong. Officials of the Xinhua News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, have visited leading members of the chamber to instruct them how to vote in forthcoming elections to its general committee. Xinhua has told 'patriots' - its term for Chinese resident in Hong Kong - that there is no distinction between business and politics. Many companies fear their business prospects in China and Hong Kong will be adversely affected if they do not support Beijing's candidates. At least two seats on the general committee need to be filled by the end of April, due to the retirement of directors. Xinhua has told some leading member companies that they should support Mr James Tien, a Shanghai-born industrialist. The other candidate is believed to be Mrs Nellie Fung, a partner of Arthur Anderson, the accountancy firm, who is responsible for its China practice. The chamber elects one member to the colony's Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's 60-member law making body, and the move by Xinhua is seen as an attempt by Beijing to gain influence over who the chamber promotes as its candidate for the colony's 1995 elections. Mr Jimmy McGregor, who is a vocal supporter of Mr Chris Patten, the governor, is currently the sitting member for the chamber. He won a contested election for the chamber's 'functional' constituency in 1991, defeating Mr Paul Cheng, the head of Inchcape, the UK trading house. China already controls three business-related seats in LegCo - Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong Federation of Industry, and Chinese Manufacturers Association - and the addition of the Hong Kong chamber would increase its hold over the legislature. In Hong Kong on Wednesday night Mr Patten said the government was still happy to hold talks with Beijing but negotiations would be difficult. 'Britain and the Hong Kong government would be very happy to see talks starting tomorrow,' but the difficulties over the last couple of months suggest 'talks would be anything but a pushover,' he said. Mr Patten was leaving for a trip to Britain where he will review policy with Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. The Hong Kong governor said Britain had repeatedly tried to start talks with Beijing since October 'on exactly the same basis that we've been talking for the last decade.' On China's efforts to set up a working group which critics fear could become a 'shadow authority' fuelling conflict before 1997, Mr Patten said: 'If China wishes to make administrative arrangements to try to help it discharge responsibilities from the middle of 1997 more effectively, then so be it. I hope the arrangements that it makes enable it to do its job more conscientiously and more competently than would otherwise be the case.' He said the Hong Kong government would not make a decision until after Easter on when to send postponed legislation to the colony's legislature . 'We're responsible for Hong Kong while the 1994 and 1995 elections take place and we can't duck out of that responsibility,' he said.</p>

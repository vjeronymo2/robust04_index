Although most electoral districts still face a second round  and the names of the new Supreme Council deputies will at best  be known 10 April, two conclusions can be drawn now.    The first is that today the republic is to all intents and  purposes split. On the one hand, the western oblasts are the  bastion of Ukrainian "independence," where most voters voted for  Rukh and other "patriotic" movements. On the other hand, you  have the east, which leans toward Russia and where candidates  advocating rapprochement with Moscow celebrated their success.  The results of a poll conducted in Donetsk Oblast showed the  mood of inhabitants of the eastern regions today. According to  preliminary figures, 87 percent of the oblast's residents were  in favor of Russian being recognized as the second official  language and 85 percent were in favor of Ukraine fully entering  into an economic union with Russia.    Both these demands are unacceptable to the  "national-democratic" parties which won a decisive victory in  the west of the republic. There is a real threat that the future  parliament, torn between two irreconcilable political forces,  will be unviable. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil stated  unequivocally that he will be unable to find a common language  with former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who is "entirely  Russia-oriented." However, it is Kuchma who is deemed the  favorite in the coming presidential elections. He confirmed his  popularity 27 March: In Chernigov Oblast, which borders Russia,  Kuchma's candidacy won the support of over 90 percent of the  voters.    The second conclusion concerns Crimea. Eighty percent of the  peninsula's inhabitants who took part in the poll of the  population answered "yes" to two questions that Leonid Kravchuk  has declared unconstitutional. As Kiev feared, the people of  Crimea voted in favor of dual citizenship (Ukrainian and Russia)  and greater autonomy from Ukraine.    The outcome of the ballot not only threatens a fresh crisis  between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities but may well  affect relations between Moscow and Kiev. [Crimean] President  Yuriy Meshkov is making no secret of his plans: Based on the  will of the people he will demand that the Crimean parliament  adopt the appropriate laws. Aware that Kiev takes an extremely  adverse view of this, the Crimean president is deliberately  heading for a conflict, relying "on himself, on his  administration, and the help of the Black Sea Fleet."    For their part Ukrainian radicals are urging Kravchuk to use  force to impose order on the peninsula. And although the  Ukrainian president will hardly take their advice, the threat of  armed confrontation is looming large. Especially if the Black  Sea Fleet responds to Meshkov's appeals and backs him in  violation of the Russo-Ukrainian accords. It is no coincidence  that in a recent television interview Kravchuk spoke of the  possibility of another Karabakh.    Russian diplomats are giving assurances that Moscow's plans  do not include exacerbating the situation in the Crimea. Russia  is primarily interested in Kiev's nuclear disarmament, which may  be suspended if a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity  arises. On the eve of the Crimean poll the Russian authorities  took an emphatically neutral stance, reluctant to interfere in  the sovereign state's domestic affairs. Nevertheless events are  largely developing contrary to Kiev's wishes. No matter how  Yeltsin and Kozyrev urge restraint on Meshkov, the Crimean  president is considerably closer in spirit to other Russian  politicians. It is no coincidence, according to REUTER, that in  one of his interviews he spoke of his enthusiastic view of  Zhirinovskiy.    If the crisis in Ukraine worsens while relative stability at  least is preserved in Russia, separatist aspirations will  receive a fresh boost -- and not just in Crimea. In that case  Moscow may find itself involved against its own wishes in the  maelstrom of events in the neighboring country. And even if  Yeltsin takes a moderate stance, it is unlikely that the Duma,  dominated by communists and nationalists, will resist the  temptation to play the Crimean card and, in the future, the  Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk cards....    A foreign diplomat accredited in Moscow admitted that during  private conversations Russian officials have already begun  testing the water in an endeavor to find out how the West would  regard the dismemberment of Ukraine. At the moment these  hypotheses are no more than that. At any rate Yeltsin's  entourage has no intention of forcing the process. Annexing the  Crimea would not improve the economic situation in Russia and  would hardly strengthen its international position. The Russian  Federation itself has enough trouble spots, is it worth adding  another?    The Kremlin has opted for wait-and-see tactics with regard  to  Ukraine, weighing up all the "pros" and "cons" and leaving the  Kiev authorities themselves to unravel knots that are growing  tighter by the day.</p>

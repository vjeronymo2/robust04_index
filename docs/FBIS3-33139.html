			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edna Dantas from the Rio de Janeiro bureau] </F>   [Excerpts] Cardiologist Eneas Ferreira Carneiro, 55, might  become the PRN (National Reconstruction Party) candidate in the  presidential race. PRN President Daniel Tourinho told FOLHA DE  SAO PAULO on 14 February that he is forging a coalition with  PRONA [Party for the Redefinition of the National Order], Eneas'  party. Tourinho stressed: "He is the physical antithesis of  [former President] Fernando Collor and he is a good candidate."  [passage omitted]    Confirming that he will contend in the presidential  elections, Eneas said: "I already have been a candidate for  five years." According to Eneas, the PRN would be one of the  alternatives to make his candidacy viable. According to the new  electoral legislation, PRONA cannot field a candidate of its  own. In general elections like those for choosing a president,  only those parties with 3 percent of the total number of  deputies may field a candidate. The PRONA barely has one  representative in the Chamber of Deputies, Deputy Regina  Gordilho (RJ [Rio de Janeiro State]).    The PRN, with a bloc of four deputies, may, as established  by  law, field a candidate of its own because it received the  support of more than 3 percent of the constituency in nine  states in the 1990 elections.</p>

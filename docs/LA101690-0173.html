			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RULING PERILS N.H. UTILITY SALE  </P> <P> In a ruling that could derail a plan by a Connecticut utility to take over  Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, a judge late Monday overturned a  $500-million bond issue that was to have partially financed the deal.  </P> <P> Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn., is taking over PSNH in a $2.3-billion  plan to bring the New Hampshire utility out of bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The plan is to be partially financed through the sale of pollution control  bonds, about half of them tax-exempt, issued through the state's Industrial  Development Authority.  </P> <P> PSNH is the lead owner of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, and the bonds would  nominally finance pollution control projects at Seabrook.  </P> <P> But the bond issue was challenged in a lawsuit by Robert Cushing of the  Campaign for Ratepayers Rights and other Seabrook opponents, who charged that  the IDA was misusing its authority by approving bonds that would actually be  used to finance a corporate takeover.  </P></p>

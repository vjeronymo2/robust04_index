According to Taiwan newspapers, the Taiwan procurators in  Taoyuan also instituted proceedings yesterday against Zhang Hai,  Han Shuxue and Li Xiangyu, who also hijacked mainland planes to  Taiwan last year, and demanded imprisonment of over 12 years for  them.    Previously, some Taiwan media and public figures had urged  that the hijackers should all be sent back to the mainland,  where they should be sentenced to death or life-long prison  terms without probation, according to China's laws.</p>

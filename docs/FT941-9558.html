			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: New York After its bout of nerves for most of last week, the bond market will have plenty of new economic data to feast on in the coming days, culminating in January consumer price inflation figures on Thursday. Judging by data released on Friday, though, investors will still have trouble deciphering whether inflationary pressures are on the rise again. Producer price inflation in January, at 0.2 per cent, was below many estimates. After the upward drift in bond yields which followed the Fed's move to tighten rates the week before, this came as a relief. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell back to 6.4 per cent by the end of Friday. However, one component of the producer price numbers - a 0.6 per cent rise in capital goods prices - prompted some concern. This Tuesday will bring figures on the growth in industrial production in January (generally expected at about 0.7 - 0.8 per cent, broadly in line with the previous two months) pushing capacity utilisation up from December's 82.8 per cent to over 83 per cent. Consumer prices are expected to show a rise of around 0.4 per cent for January (0.3 - 0.4 per cent excluding food and energy). That may be a bigger advance than in recent months, but would still bring the year-on-year rate down to 2.6 per cent.</p>

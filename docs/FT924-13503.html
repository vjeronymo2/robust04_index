			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Presidential eligibility and fairy-tales Sir, In response to the statements emanating from the Bush bivouac regarding Mr Clinton's 1970 trip to Moscow ('Bitter prelude for US debate', October 12) I would just like to say it's about time. Perhaps we should take this one step further and propose a constitutional amendment stating something along these lines: 'No person except a natural-born citizen, or Citizen, of the United States . . . shall be eligible for the office of president . . . nor shall this person have visited at any time a country that the US government deems inappropriate or one in which the average rainfall in the month of November is more than 6 inches . . . nor shall this person fall under the astrological sign of Scorpio . . .' By the way, has Mr Bush ever visited Disneyland? Why of course he has] Just look at his fairy-tale domestic economic policies] Eileen M O'Connor, 20 Edgewood Road, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, US</p>

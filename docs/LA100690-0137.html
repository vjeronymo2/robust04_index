			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 128 FAVORED BY 2-1 MARGIN IN O.C., POLL SHOWS  </P> <P> A new poll of Orange County voters shows that they favor Proposition 128, the  Big Green initiative, by more than a 2-to-1 margin, a much broader base of  support than among voters statewide.  </P> <P> Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine professor of social ecology who authored the  survey, said that 58% of Orange County voters said they would vote for  Proposition 128, 27% said they opposed it and 15% were undecided.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Times poll taken late last month showed voters statewide favored  the measure 44% to 42%, with 14% undecided.  </P> <P> Baldassare said he believes the strong local support for Proposition 128 shows  a population fed up with air pollution and shaken by the 394,000-gallon oil  spill in Huntington Beach on Feb. 7, which tarnished miles of Orange County  coastline.  </P> <P> "This has been a year of unprecedented concern about the environment,"  Baldassare said. "What we have here is an electorate very interested in  environmental issues close to home. There was the oil spill, and people are  also hearing an awful lot about the bad quality of the air. It bothers them."  </P> <P> The survey polled 1,016 adult residents by telephone from Sept. 5 to Sept. 21.  Of those surveyed, 833 were registered voters who were asked questions about  initiatives on the Nov. 6 ballot, including Proposition 128. The margin of  error for the sample of voters is plus or minus 3%.  </P> <P> Baldassare said he would not be surprised if local support for Proposition 128  declines when Orange County voters, who have repeatedly spurned ballot measures  that would have raised taxes or imposed higher fees, learn more about how it  will affect their pocketbooks.  </P> <P> "You have two very strong competing forces here: the concern about the  environment and Orange County's historically deep resistance to taxes and  higher spending," he said.  </P> <P> Local support for the proposition on Election Day may also be weakened by  voting patterns that traditionally find higher turnout among older voters than  among younger ones, Baldassare said. His survey showed that only 38% of those  55 and older supported Proposition 128, while support increased to 58% among  those 35 to 54 and 73% among those 18 to 34.  </P> <P> The Times Poll from Sept. 20 to 25 showed that support for Proposition 128 was  suffering because of the negative public image of its sponsor, liberal  Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). Baldassare said respondents were not  asked about Hayden or his association with the measure.  </P> <P> Respondents in the Orange County poll were asked: "If the election were held  today, would you vote yes or no on Proposition 128, called by some the Big  Green Initiative, which would include provisions to regulate and phase out some  pesticides, phase out chemicals that may deplete the Earth's ozone layer,  require reduced emissions of gases contributing to global warming, limit oil  drilling off the California coast and require oil spill prevention plans,  create the elected office of environmental advocate and authorize $300 million  in bonds to purchase ancient Redwood forests?"  </P> <P> Proposition 128 drew solid majority support from both sexes in Orange County,  although women backed it by a bigger margin than men, with 63% of women and 51%  of men supporting it. In The Times statewide poll, men opposed Big Green by a  gap of 10 percentage points.  </P> <P> The measure found stronger support within political parties locally than  statewide. In Orange County, Democrats supported it by a 4-to-1 margin (68% in  favor, 16% opposed and 16% undecided), compared with 2-to-1 statewide.  Republicans back it locally (52% in favor, 33% opposed and 15% undecided), but  oppose it by more than a 2-to-1 margin statewide.  </P></p>

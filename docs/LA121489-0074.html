			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY SOUFFLE IS QUICK, EASY, ELEGANT DESSERT  </P> <P> Talk quick and easy cooking and the mind doesn't exactly eye a souffle. Too  bad, it could.  </P> <P> You are just too busy this time of year, even if you do think a high-rise  dessert is exactly what holiday guests would like to finish off dinner at your  house. Too bad, you could do it.  </P> <P> Even when I have the tree to trim, gifts to wrap, kids to talk to, cookies to  bake and company coming, my mind doesn't mind eyeing the idea of serving  individual Chocolate-Espresso Souffles for dessert. I know, I've done it.  </P> <P> I've baked them for Christmas, for New Year's Eve, for Tuesday's dinner, for  important guests, for children, for big people and just for me. It's that  simple and delicious.  </P> <P> The secret is, because these souffles don't depend on fragile stiffly beaten  egg whites for success, they can be mixed several hours ahead of time and  refrigerated until ready to bake.  </P> <P> Each souffle gets a light dusting of sweetened instant espresso powder as soon  as it comes from the oven. If you've a mind to bake them before the holiday  season ends, you might want to perch a holly leaf atop or alongside each  souffle to add a seasonal touch.  </P> <P> You could say the recipe is a piece of cake if it weren't a souffle.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE-ESPRESSO SOUFFLES  </P> <P> 1/3 cup espresso coffee  </P> <P> 6 ounces semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 5 eggs  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 8 ounces cream cheese, cubed  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon powdered sugar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon instant espresso powder  </P> <P> Combine espresso and chocolate in small saucepan and place over low heat until  chocolate is melted, stirring to blend. Remove from heat and cool slightly.  </P> <P> Combine eggs and cream in food processor or blender and process to mix. With  machine running, slowly pour in cooled chocolate mixture. Add cream cheese, few  cubes at time and process until smooth. Pour into 6 buttered and sugared  6-ounce souffle cups. (At this point, souffles can be covered and refrigerated  up to several hours.)  </P> <P> Bake on center shelf of oven at 350 degrees about 20 minutes or until edges are  set but centers are still slightly soft. (If souffles were refrigerated, bake  additional 5 minutes.)  </P> <P> Meanwhile, combine powdered sugar and espresso powder. As soon as souffles are  done, remove from oven, place each on individual dessert plate and shake some  sugar-espresso mixture through sieve on top of each souffle. Serve immediately.  Makes 6 servings.  </P></p>

(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the Exchange. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange proposes to amend Paragraph 703.21 of its Listed Company Manual (``Manual'') regarding the listing of Equity-Linked Debt Securities (``ELDS''). ELDS are intermediate-term (2&hyph;7 years), non-convertible hybrid instruments whose value is based, in part, on the value of a highly capitalized, actively traded common stock or convertible preferred stock. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change would (1) provide alternative minimum capitalization and trading volume requirements for the security underlying an ELDS issue, and (2) allow the listing of ELDS linked to non-U.S. securities. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, NYSE, and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved the listing and trading of ELDS on January 13, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33468 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3387 (January 21, 1994) (``Exchange Act Release No. 33468''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NYSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to make two changes to the Exchange's listing standards for ELDS. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  The first change to the ELDS listing standards is to provide alternative market capitalization and trading volume criteria for the linked security, that is, the security on which the value of the ELDS is based. Currently, such a security must have a market capitalization of at least $3 billion and a trading volume of at least 2.5 million shares in the preceding year. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The proposed rule change will provide, as an alternative to that standard, the ability to list ELDS linked to a security that has a $1.5 billion market capitalization and a one-year trading volume of at least 20 million shares. The Exchange believes that this will provide additional flexibility in the listing of ELDS, while ensuring that the linked security is highly capitalized and that there is adequate liquidity in the market for the linked security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that an ELDS which satisfies the criteria set forth in the proposed rule change must also satisfy the other listing criteria for ELDS set forth in Paragraph 703.21 of the Manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second change to the ELDS listing standards would allow the issuer of the linked security to be a non-U.S. company if certain criteria are met. Under the proposal, the issuer could be a non-U.S. company (whose securities are traded in the United States either as ordinary shares or as American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')) if one of the following conditions is met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Exchange has in place with the primary exchange for the security (and in the case of an ADR, with the primary exchange in the home country of the security underlying the ADR) an effective surveillance information sharing agreement; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The United States is the primary market for the security (determined in the manner discussed below); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The staff of the Commission otherwise agrees to the listing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining whether the U.S. is the primary market for the linked security, the combined trading volume of the security (including the security itself, any ADR overlying the security (adjusted on a share equivalent basis) and other classes of stock related to the underlying security) in the United States for the three month period preceding the date of listing must be at least 50% of the combined world-wide trading in such securities. The U.S. trading in the security would include only those U.S. self-regulatory organizations included in the Intermarket Surveillance Group <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  and linked through the Intermarket Trading System. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ISG was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things, coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The members of the ISG, (and accordingly, of the U.S. market) are: The American Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.; the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the NYSE; the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Because of potential opportunities for trading abuses involving stock index futures, stock options and the underlying stock and the need for greater sharing of surveillance information for these potential intermarket trading abuses, the major stock index futures exchanges ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade) joined the ISG as affiliate members in 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ITS is a communications system designed to facilitate trading among competing markets by providing each market with order routing capabilities based on current quotation information. The system links the participant markets and provides facilities and procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation information at each participant market, so that brokers are able to determine readily the best bid and offer available from any participant for multiple trading securities; (2) efficient routing of orders and sending administrative messages (on the functioning of the system) to all participating markets; (3) participation, under certain conditions, by members of all participating markets in opening transactions in those markets; and (4) routing orders from a participating market to a participating market with a better price. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

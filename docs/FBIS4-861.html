			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Belgian contingent of the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda is returning home tomorrow. [passage omitted]  Now government troops are saying that the Belgians are helping  the Rwanda Patriotic Front in the war. They claim that the bomb  that hit the Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines [RTLM]  was the work of the Belgians. All these are pretexts. It has  been clear all along that the dictatorship has been defeated, so  in return they massacred people. [passage indistinct]</p>

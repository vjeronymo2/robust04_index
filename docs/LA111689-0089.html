			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S STANCE  </P> <P> President Bush campaigned as an environmentally concerned candidate, but his  present stance (Times Editorial Oct. 30) belies that concern.  </P> <P> Instead of advocating stronger protection for the public against toxic  ingredients, he seeks to lower the standard of protection.  </P> <P> Because health care accounts for one of the largest shares of the national  budget, it behooves those who oversee government agencies to err on the side of  caution. The care for one single cancer victim is astronomical.  </P> <P> The image President Bush has portrayed since taking office is a far cry from  the "kinder, gentler" person he professed to be during his campaign.  </P> <P> Gwen Kozman  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

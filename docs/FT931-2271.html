			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: One guarantee covers all IS THE guarantee covering 90 per cent of the first Pounds 40,000 of a married couple's joint account with a building society the total guarantee? Are other investments with the same society included in that total, such as guaranteed equity bonds, Pibs and Tessas? Therefore, should one limit one's total investment with each society to Pounds 40,000? The protection afforded by the Building Societies Act relates to all the investment of each person in the same society, so that the limit of Pounds 40,000 for joint investors would apply to the totality of their investments, whatever their nature. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

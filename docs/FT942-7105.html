			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: W German inflation below 3% The inflation rate in west Germany sank below 3 per cent in May for the first time in more than three years, the federal statistics office reported yesterday. The provisional figure of 2.9 per cent for the annual rate of increase in consumer prices in the west confirms a steady trend which has seen the rate come down from 3.4 per cent in January and February, to 3.2 per cent in March and 3.1 per cent in April. The figure is the lowest since April 1991, when it was 2.8 per cent. Since then it has been fuelled by a series of high wage rises, reaching an average of 4.2 per cent for 1993 as a whole, the highest rate since 1982. Economists now expect a continuing decline during the year, thanks to a series of moderate wage increases in the latest pay round. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, has forecast that it will fall below 2 per cent early in 1995. Quentin Peel, Bonn Finland's central bank yesterday adjusted its tender rate, the key rate governing commercial banks' borrowing with the central bank, to 5.1 per cent from 4.92 per cent. The rate was last changed on May 9, when it was lowered to from 4.95 per cent. Italian wage inflation stood at an annual 2.5 per cent in April after 2.4 per cent in March, the national statistics office said. The April rise compares with an annual growth of 4.1 per cent in consumer prices the same month. Norway's registered unemployment rate fell to 4.8 per cent in late May from 5.1 per cent at the end of April, the country's labour directorate reported.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: One-liners - Ballot Box Barbara Follett, the woman responsible for getting the Labour party into smart double-breasted suits, has come up with the 'Biteline' to help provide zip to Labour's campaign. She has written to writers and comedians of known left-wing leaning inviting them to send by fax any appropriate or witty one liners that can be used to pep up speeches. The first request is looking for witty comments about the budget or the economy, but writers will be sent regular updates of new engagements and themes as the campaign develops. How about Spike Milligan's old line: 'Please excuse the mess, we've had the Conservatives in'?</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Controversy about St Petersburg development achieved only by a manipulation of the facts Sir, Colin Amery's article, 'A monster that may ruin St Petersburg' (December 13) is a regrettable example of journalistic licence which only presents selected facts to fit a distorted image. The illustration of the tower which he used was a product of Lennilprojekt - one of St Petersburg's design institutes. Moreover, the illustration which you published is not of the latest model. The concept has been around for at least 20 years, and is purely home-grown. Wilson Mason's involvement is as project-managers and as designers of certain aspects of the building which will affect its letability, eg, the core. We have had a team in St Petersburg for several months now, in close co-operation with Lennilprojekt, the city architect and authorities, in order to ensure that neither local sensibilities nor an architectural heritage second to none are trampled on; how dare this one-day wonder assert otherwise? Far from hanging our heads in shame, we are extremely proud to be associated with a project which can only benefit St Petersburg by keeping rampant commercial development out of the city centre and which will attract incoming investment. We note that even the FT itself is aware of the need to locate its buildings, in one instance at least, away from the City. What would Mr Amery have made of a photograph of the FT's printing plant juxtaposed, however innocently, beside one of St Pauls? Architects also recognise the beauty of the historic parts of St Petersburg. However, the fact that the proposed tower is to be built on the extreme edge of the city and cannot be seen from the centre is an inconvenient fact far from his viewpoint. I wonder what our Russian friends would make of Mr Amery's cerebral observation that 'St Petersburg should advance slowly'? Would he prefer them to live some kind of limbo existence in a giant theme park? If Mr Amery has set out to be controversial, then he has only succeeded by a manipulation of the facts in this instance. His pious posturing is pure humbug.

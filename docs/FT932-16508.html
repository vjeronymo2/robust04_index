			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Move to speed up energy sector aid already in pipeline THE official aid announced at the Vancouver summit for Russia's energy sector is an attempt to speed up assistance promised but slowed down by political and economic obstacles. Western oil companies have been frustrated by constantly changing and increasing taxation, the lack of a clear decision-making process and political instability. Reformers in the Russian government are trying to improve matters. This involves trying to centralise exports to reduce theft and to create the right incentives for domestic companies and a suitable environment for foreign investors. In the meantime, multilateral organisations and export credit agencies have had problems finalising arrangements which are meant to encourage private companies until the investment environment becomes more attractive. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister responsible for finance and economics, has asked for and received a list of suggestions from western oil companies on building a suitable tax and legal regime. The companies are for the first time acting together on this front through a Petroleum Advisory Forum (PAF), which includes 20 integrated oil companies and 23 service companies. But there is also considerable resistance from parts of the bureaucracy to giving foreigners a free hand to strike deals with Russian companies. 'The central government does not yet understand that their only role in the industry should be to regulate and take tax revenues from it,' said one western banker. He also pointed to deep-rooted psychological barriers prevalent among some bureaucrats in the fuel and energy ministry and the finance ministry. 'What it boils down to is that Russians can't understand why foreigners should make a profit from taking Russian minerals out of the ground.' With western banks reluctant to put more money into Russia when they are having to reschedule old debts, multilateral organisations see themselves as vital catalysts for encouraging private capital. This is not to say that western companies are not rushing to explore those opportunities already on offer, the biggest being a tender to exploit some of the gas reserves off Sakhalin Island. 'Sakhalin is a bellwether for the industry,' says Mr Don Schaefer, the PAF chairman, who is also commonwealth area manager for Shell, one of the five companies included in a consortium bidding for the project. The consortium, which at first grouped just US companies McDermott and Marathon, plus Japan's Mitsui, went through much torment to be awarded just the feasibility study last year. Part of the problem was the conflict between the federal and local authorities on which rival group of companies should get the contract. Another was demands by local authorities that western companies should finance new infrastructure not required by the project. Now the companies are hoping for a Russian decision this month or next on whether they will get the contract to develop the reserves. Mr Schaefer suggests that the contract which is finally awarded should be scrutinised by the industry at large, putting pressure on the Russian authorities to come up with terms that will make this Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn) project an encouraging example. One smaller project which will be watched and perhaps even speeded up as a result of the summit is the Chernogorskoye joint venture, between Chernogorneft, a Russian oil enterprise, and independent US oil company Anderman Smith. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has already committed Dollars 33m to the project and a Dollars 40m loan from Morgan Grenfell, the British merchant bank, is to be guaranteed by the US Eximbank. But the latter's own slowness in processing the project, attributed in part to its small travel budget, is one example of a western bottleneck that may be cleared by President Bill Clinton's promise to accelerate support already promised.</p>

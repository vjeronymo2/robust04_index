			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There were signs of growing disagreement among  leaders of Malawi's Aford [Alliance for Democracy] opposition  party, which came second in last month's elections won by the  United Democratic Front [UDF] of President Bakili Muluzi.  Yesterday, on this program, one of Aford's founder member,  Victor Ndove, criticized the party's leader, Chakufwa Chihana,  both for his personal style and for his handling of negotiations  with the UDF over the formation of the new government. He even  accused the Aford leadership of holding talks with the ousted  Malawi Congress Party, the MCP. On the Line to Mangochi, Chris  Greene asked Aford's Secretary General Dr. (Mucky Mtewa) how he  responded to Victor Ndove's criticism.    [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] First, of course, on a personal  note, I have tremendous respect for my good friend Victor Ndove.  In responding to the concern of the good founder, is that, of  course, the position taken by President Chakufwa Chihana, on  behalf of this party, in wanting to preserve the integrity of  his members in parliament, and of course, definitely, the  intricate structure of consultation within the Alliance for  Democracy, was to make sure that everything else, as much as  possible, was democratically conducted and that we were giving  away the party or delivering our members in parliament to the  UDF government, without knowing precisely the conditions and  terms which would be acceptable to our members within the party.    [Greene] But, in fact, you failed to negotiate yourselves  into the governing coalition and you are now just a minor  opposition party.    [(Mtewa)] No, that is not...[pauses] I think I must have  said  about 48 hours ago that the negotiations and the talking still  continue and nothing has been terminated yet, contrary to those  perceptions.    [Greene] Is it true that you are also negotiating with the  former ruling MCP party?    [(Mtewa)] Negotiating would be the wrong term. I am not sure  what we are negotiating about. I think we are talking to all  individuals in the country, as Malawians, given the (?need for)  the preservation of the delicate balance of democracy in this  country. On matters of common interest, should those happen to  coincide at all in the debate on legislation introduced by  government, we will be expected to consult and talk to those  other members of the other party on how best to approach those  issues of common interest. Talking now, of course, is purely a  matter of friendship. They are both friends and that they were  never enemies. They just happened to be members in the  government at the time, as, I am sure, the UDF gentlemen  happened to be members of that government for many years.    [Greene] That is a very conciliatory language from you,  given  the sorts of things that Chakufwa Chihana said after he came out  of prison?    [(Mtewa)] Definitely, also conciliatory in terms of the  personal life of this secretary general. For the record, of  course, both my parents are crippled by the Malawi Congress  Party government. I think you can say, at least, in politics we  grow fast and we learn the hard way. [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 16 KYODO -- The foreign share of  Japan's semiconductor market is expected to have fallen below 20  percent for the final quarter of 1993, a Japanese Government  source said Wednesday.    "It seems difficult" for the share to reach the 20 percent  level because there is no room for U.S. suppliers to export  because the American economy is strong, the source said.    Under a 1991 agreement on semiconductor trade, Japan and the  United States agreed to a 20 percent goal for foreign market  share by the end of 1992.    In the final quarter of 1992, the foreign share exceeded  that  goal, but has been on the decline since.    The foreign share of Japan's microchip market has been a  major source of contention between Washington and Tokyo, as the  20 percent share is viewed as a commitment by the United States  but as a nonbinding target by Japan.</p>

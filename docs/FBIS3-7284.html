			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by President Kim Yong-sam at joint news </F> conference with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held  at the State Guesthouse in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] Dear reporters, I, first, thank Prime Minister  Hosokawa and Mrs. Hosokawa for their warm hospitality and for  their thorough preparation for our successful visit to Japan.    During my visit, I have met with the major Japanese leaders,  including Prime Minister Hosokawa, and have frankly exchanged  views with them regarding the direction in which the ROK and  Japan should move to promote their friendly relations amid  rapidly changing international trends.    Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have agreed that both the ROK  and Japan, as neighboring countries jointly pursuing freedom,  democracy, and the market economic system, should cooperate anew  on leading the Asian-Pacific era. Toward this end, both the ROK  and Japan must establish multilateral friendly relations as soon  as possible. Also, we have agreed to practically strengthen  cooperation to promote these relations.    Peace and security on the Korean peninsula, located in the  center of Northeast Asia, are very important in maintaining  peace and security in that area. For the stability of the  Korean peninsula, first, North Korea must dispel the suspicion  of its nuclear development and North-South dialogue must be  earnestly carried out.    Despite our efforts to peacefully resolve the North Korean  nuclear issue through dialogue, the nuclear issue has been  finally referred to the UN Security Council because of North  Korea's insincere attitude. I think it is very regrettable.  The North Korean attitude is an important factor. If North  Korea changes its attitude even at this moment, we will take  corresponding steps.    Regarding this, during these talks, the ROK and Japan have  agreed to further strengthen their close cooperation to  immediately resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, including  cooperation in the UN Security Council.    Prime Minister Hosokawa and I hope that the ongoing reform  in  political, economic, social, and all other areas -- both in the  ROK and Japan - will be successfully carried out, and we are of  the same opinion that the reform will ultimately consolidate the  new relations between the ROK and Japan.    The conclusion of Uruguay Round negotiations and the  beginning of the new world economic order are expected to  aggravate the trade competition among countries.    In the recent talks, the ROK and Japan have agreed to make  joint efforts for continuous development of Asian-Pacific  economic cooperation and to closely cooperate with each other to  cope with the new trade round [saeroun tongsang raundue  taeunghame issoso].    We also agreed to break the trade imbalance between the two  countries and try to restore balance by expanding economic  relations through close economic cooperation.    The two countries also promised to make joint efforts to  further develop mature [songsukan] ROK-Japanese relations, which  began to ripen last year, with the inauguration of the ROK  civilian government and Prime Minister Hosokawa's ROK visit as  momentum.    If the ROK and Japan deepen mutual trust for the bright  future with a correct understanding of these promises, the road  for a good-neighbor relationship will open wide.    Next year will be significant because it will mark the 30th  anniversary of the normalization of ROK-Japanese diplomatic  relations. I expect the peoples of the two countries will make  efforts to further mature ROK-Japanese relations on this  occasion.    I am sure my visit to Japan will serve as an important  turning point in establishing mature ROK-Japanese relations  extending toward Asia and the world.    Thank you.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: London exchange questions link-up plan PLANS to establish electronic links between investors and brokers to make international securities trades easier have been thrown into doubt by the London Stock Exchange. The exchange has had second thoughts about building links between its own electronic trade confirmation system, Sequal, and two others from rival suppliers. Such links are an important element in the planned network through which investors would be able to confirm trades with each other. The exchange's apparent change of heart has provoked a sharp reaction from institutional investors and others, and brought a threat that it could be dropped from a list of recommended suppliers. The exchange was one of three suppliers picked by a group of investors and brokers a year ago to develop trade confirmation systems. It was made clear at the outset that bridges between the three were an important element in the initiative. Now, though, the exchange has said that it wants more time to study the business case for building the links before proceeding. This has aroused suspicions that it sees the links as a threat to its own future, since they could form the basis of a network on which investors could deal directly with each other. In a note to other investors who jointly commissioned the three systems, Mr Alistair Reid, a director of Morgan Grenfell's fund management arm, warned that the exchange risked being 'removed from the initial list of vendors.' He added, though, that he was encouraged that the exchange has now decided to bring forward its cons-ideration of the business case to its December board meeting. The exchange said yesterday that more time should be given to determining what demand there was for electronic trade confirmation before the three suppliers embarked on the next step of building the links.</p>

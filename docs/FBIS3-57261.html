Rakhman Mustafazade, in an interview with Interfax, accused  Armenia of causing delays in the peace process within the  framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe.    He said Azerbaijan's position fully conformed to the idea of  the presidents of Russia and the United States as stated in  their Moscow declaration, namely that the conflict must be  resolved within the CIS framework and on the basis of  international law principles, such as respect for the  independence and existing borders of the new states on the  territory of the former Soviet Union, including Azerbaijan and  Armenia.    As Azerbaijan's principal conditions for the settlement of  the conflict, Mustafazade named the withdrawal of Armenian  troops from the territories they were occupying and security  guarantees for the Armenian and Azeri population of  Nagorno-Karabakh; abrogation by Armenia of all its legislative  acts declaring Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia; and an end to  Armenia's "policy of destroying Azeri historical and cultural  monuments" in Nagorno-Karabakh.    Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Elchin Guseinbeili  described peace plans recently proposed by some foreign  political scientists as "not serious." He said the plan for  "security zones" and "humanitarian corridors" for  Nagorno-Karabakh would lead to the annexation of the "occupied  territories" both within Nagorno-Karabakh and outside it.    At the same time, he said humanitarian corridors could be  used to enable Azeri refugees from Armenia's southeastern  regions to return home.</p>

The radiation exposure for the test (Chernobyl)  group was an order of magnitude or more higher than for the  control (Kiev) group. The external _g_-background radiation  exposure in the special 30-km vivarium at the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant fluctuated between 70 to 100 mkR/h. Internal  radiation exposure was effected by means of radionuclides  inhaled or otherwise ingested by the mice. Crossbreeding of mice  three to five months old was done at the Kiev vivarium  (Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics of the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences) within three days after exposure. The  effect of the radiation exposure was studied by testing for the  incidence of embryonic mortality in the offspring of the  experimental and control groups. Pregnant females were dissected  on the 16th, 17th, or 18th day of gestation, and the incidence  of pre- and post-implantation mortality was determined from the  number of yellow masses in the ovaries and from the intrauterine  implantation and live embryo locations. A consistently high  incidence of pre-implantation mortality was found in the  offspring of three generations of female mice and of two  generations of male mice from the Chernobyl population, an  obvious consequence of the mutagenic effect of low doses of  combined radiation on the gametes. This finding was further  corroborated by the normal incidence of pre-implantation  mortality among the offspring of the F3-males from  the Chernobyl population, which were allowed to reach sexual  maturity without exposure to radiation.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "World News" program] </F>   [Text] A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement says China  conducted an underground nuclear test on Friday [10 June].    The statement says China believes in a complete prohibition  and elimination of nuclear weapons, as well as a comprehensive  nuclear test ban.    The Foreign Ministry says China has exercised great  restraint  in conducting nuclear tests over the years.    The statement says China fully respects and understands the  position and concern of many non-nuclear weapon states on the  question of nuclear testing.    Right now, China is actively participating in negotiations  on  a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.    The Foreign Ministry statement says China calls on other  nuclear weapon states to stop the policy of nuclear deterrence  and commit themselves to the prohibition and destruction of  nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPROAR OVER TWO FLAG EXHIBITS  </P> <P> In response to "3,000 Protest Chicago Exhibit of Flag on Floor," Part I, March  13:  </P> <P> The outcry over Scott Tyler's exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago is so  great that I had to write. He is displaying the flag on the floor with a ledger  above the display inviting comments. People are invited or forced to walk on  the flag in order to write their thoughts in the ledger.  </P> <P> Scott maintains that he has a constitutional right of free speech, and has the  right to display the flag in that manner. I would like to tell Scott that he is  very much mistaken. The flag is not art. It is a symbol of our nation. It  represents ideals, including free speech.  </P> <P> When someone desecrates the symbol, then he makes a mockery of the ideals of  that symbol. Scott is a hypocrite because he mocks the very ideal he says he  has a right to. That ideal is free speech.  </P> <P> When you value rights, you should not be so quick to desecrate the very symbol  that gave them to you. So, Scott, swallow your pride and close your exhibit;  you made your point, as weak as it was.  </P> <P> MICHAEL S.P. von BEHREN  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 10 (CTK) -- The most realistic and  democratic solution to the present political crisis in Slovakia  would be to form a government without Prime Minister Vladimir  Meciar, Frantisek Miklosko, vice-chairman of the opposition  Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), told reporters today.    He said Meciar had placed his party, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), before two alternatives: Either a  referendum on the expulsion from parliament of the "maverick"  HZDS deputies or early general elections in June 1994. The  first alternative is undemocratic, the second unrealistic, he  said.    The increasingly united opposition also has two choices in  his view: Either a government without Meciar, for which one  parliamentary vote would be lacking, or early elections but it  is unlikely the opposition alone would succeed in passing the  necessary constitutional law, Miklosko said.    KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky said Meciar was the only  politician it was impossible to agree with. In the course of  time Milan Knazko, Rudolf Filkus, President Michal Kovac,  Lubomir Dolgos have all fallen out with him, he said, adding  that Roman Kovac and Jozef Moravcik also were defectors.    The various parties of the opposition, however, were able to  agree on solutions to Slovakia's problems, voting together for  instance on the law on large privatization, he said.    Carnogursky said it would not be responsible of the  opposition to use the crisis situation in order to attempt a  vote of no confidence in the government.    When asked if the opposition parties would arrange "round  table" talks in the near future, Miklosko said "everything  depends on today's results of the HZDS talks" in  Casta-Papiernicka, west Slovakia.</p>

Reacting Sunday to  Mr Mandela's warning in the [Orange] Free State on Saturday [5  February] that the right wing's threatened "limited violence"  would be met with unlimited violence from the African National  Congress, Mr Kriel said this was just terrorism in another form.  "Mr Mandela's proposed cure of further unlimited violence  will...be far worse than the illness itself and could incite  random attacks on innocent people and unleash a new cycle of  violence." The only way to combat the attacks -- including  several bombings of ANC offices -- apparently being carried out  by the right wing was to infiltrate their terrorist cells. This  was a time-consuming process but was the only way, said Mr Kriel.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Pressure mounts for bill on disabled Ministers were yesterday under mounting pressure to reconsider a bill that would outlaw discrimination against the disabled as Labour MPs pressed to bring the legislation before parliament for the second time in a fortnight. The bill, which would force companies to provide facilities for disabled employees, was again the focus of angry scenes in the Commons after Labour MPs claimed that the government was trying to ensure that it could not be debated. Ministers have opposed the private member's bill, arguing that it would cost industry around Pounds 17bn in capital expenditure, with an additional Pounds 1bn in annual running costs. However, Labour and Tory MPs said yesterday that there was clear public backing for the reforms after disabled groups held a vivid demonstration outside parliament. Disabled people threw themselves from their wheelchairs into the road and handcuffed themselves to buses in an angry anti-government protest that blocked Whitehall. The civil rights (disabled persons) bill ran out of parliamentary time when it was first presented to the Commons 10 days ago, after more than 80 amendments had been tabled by Tory backbenchers. Last week, Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security minister, admitted that he had misled the Commons by claiming that the government had played no part in framing those amendments. He has since resisted calls from Labour for his resignation. The bill is now due to be considered on Friday. But Labour MPs said yesterday that a 'stack of amendments' had been tabled to the three preceding bills to ensure that there would be no time to debate the civil rights plan.</p>

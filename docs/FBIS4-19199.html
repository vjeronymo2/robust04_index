			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- [no dateline as received] In  addition to the expansion of bilateral relations with Poland,  Germany wants to advocate with all its strength this country's  accession to the European Union [EU]. "Europe without Poland  would be a rump," Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated in Bonn on  Thursday [14 April] after a talk with Polish head of government,  Waldemar Pawlak. A united Europe without Poland is unthinkable,  Kohl said.    In addition to economic relations, Pawlak's first visit to  Germany as Polish prime minister focused on European integration  and Poland's accession to the EU, which is desired by both  countries. Pawlak stressed his government's interest in reducing  artificial barriers for Polish export products with in the EU.  Poland's negative trade balance with Germany must be balanced  in the future, Pawlak said.    After his talk with the 34-year-old head of government, Kohl  spoke to journalists in the chancellor's office and stressed  that the quality of relations between Germany and Poland is also  vitally important for Europe. Regardless of the generation gap  between him and his guest, both of them know how important it is  to learn from history and to turn bad experiences into good  policy, Kohl said. The chancellor envisages the goal of shaping  goodneighborly relations with Poland along the lines of  German-French relations. Perhaps it is a new image of Germany  for Poland that the FRG in particular supports Poland's desire  for EU membership so emphatically. Pawlak and Kohl want to take  specific measures soon to reduce the long waiting times at the  German-Polish border crossings to a tolerable level.    Kohl wants to use Germany's presidency of the EU Council  during the second half of this year to present proposals to the  partners in the EU about how Poland's path toward final  membership can be paved. Kohl paid tribute to the Polish reform  policy and expressly welcomed that the country has joined the  NATO partnership treaty.    As has been heard from Polish delegation circles, economic  relations in particular between the two states should be given  more substance. German investors are still too hesitant. Given  an overall volume of foreign investment in Poland at $3 billion,  German investment is only 400 million German marks, it was said.  Pawlak will conclude his two-day visit to Germany in Stuttgart  on Friday.</p>

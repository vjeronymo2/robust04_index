			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS TO SHOW NEW OFFENSIVE LOOK;  </P> <P> FULLERTON MOVES WENTWORTH FROM DEFENSIVE ASSIGNMENT  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton football team will have its third offensive look in  three years next season.  </P> <P> Coach Gene Murphy has moved assistant Bill Wentworth to offense, where he will  coach the quarterbacks and be involved in designing the Titans' offense.  </P> <P> Wentworth, 31, coached the defensive backs last season. Before coming to  Fullerton, he coached the offensive line at Idaho for two seasons. He also has  coached at Indiana and Louisiana State.  </P> <P> Mike Heimerdinger, the Titans' offensive coordinator last season, resigned to  become the offensive coordinator at Rice. Heimerdinger replaced Jerry Brown,  who left after eight seasons to become an assistant with the Minnesota Vikings.  </P> <P> In other staff changes, Titan assistant John Miklesh is resigning to move to  Fresno State as defensive line coach.  </P> <P> Miklesh, 37, leaves after six seasons, during which he was responsible for the  outside linebackers and special teams.  </P> <P> "I've long respected Gene Murphy's program and I feel like they've always  played excellent defense against us and the rest of the conference," Fresno  State Coach Jim Sweeney said in a release. "John Miklesh is a totally prepared  defensive coach with proven ability."  </P> <P> Fullerton is left with two openings for assistants.  </P> <P> Ed Donatell, who coached the secondary at Idaho the past three seasons, is  expected to replace Wentworth as secondary coach, sources said, and a search is  under way for a replacement for Miklesh.  </P> <P> Under Donatell, 32, Idaho set several records for pass interceptions. He also  has coached at Pacific and Washington.  </P></p>

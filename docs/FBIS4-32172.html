			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and  Slovakia have agreed to abolish the old clearing account,  containing commercial debts which arose before the currency  separation in February 1993, and have decided that companies  themselves will cover exchange rate differences that have since  arisen.    "Companies themselves will decide what exchange rate they  will use to settle their debts on the account. It is untenable  that differences from changes in the exchange rates be paid from  the state budget," Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said on his  return from the economic forum in Crans-Montana, Switzerland,  where he also met Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus.    The possibility of companies paying the differences, on  which  both premiers agreed, is only one option. "Companies can agree  on compensation through supplies of goods, or each paying half  the difference," Moravcik said. He admitted that Slovak  companies would be the losers.    The account's abolition must be approved by both countries'  parliaments. Moravcik said it could take effect as of August 1  if sufficient legislation is found to serve as a basis for the  step. He admitted that the account might be abolished after the  autumn Parliament elections in Slovakia, because in contrast to  the Slovak Parliament, the Czech one will be holding its last  session in July.    Moravcik said that he considered it important that the Czech  side had promised it would not "begin any initiative" to abolish  the mutual clearing account from the customs union. That does  not mean that mutual payment agreements could not be improved if  either side wants to change something, he added.</p>

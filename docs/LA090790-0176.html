			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHAMPAGNE GRAPE PRICES RISE  </P> <P> Champagne grape prices for the 1990 harvest have been set 20% higher after a  30-year-old accord between growers and producers fell apart earlier this year.  </P> <P> The Champagne Producers Bureau, based in Epernay, said in a statement today  that a reference grape price for this year's harvest, beginning Monday, has  been fixed at $6.10 per 2.2 pounds.  </P> <P> This year is the first time the Champagne region's grape growers and houses  that produce the famous sparkling wine have negotiated a free market price.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a 30-year-old system of fixing a six-year fixed price for  Champagne grapes fell apart under pressure from growers keen to cash on in  rapid growth worldwide in Champagne consumption.  </P></p>

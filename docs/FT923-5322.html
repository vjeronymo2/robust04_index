			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Review of fines for late VAT CUSTOMS and Excise has launched a review of its default surcharge system for companies that do not pay value added tax contributions on time, after criticisms of its operation. The review comes as part of a wider examination of the VAT penalties system announced earlier this year. It will examine the effectiveness of the system of progressive penalties - designed to encourage timely compliance. The system has been criticised as indiscriminate, providing insufficient warning before fines are incurred, and for being particularly hard on small businesses.

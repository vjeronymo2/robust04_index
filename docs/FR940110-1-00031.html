			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> INS projects that $18.7 million will be carried forward in the Examinations Fee Account from fiscal year 1993 to fiscal year 1994 (Line 1). Revenue of $314.7 million is anticipated in fiscal year 1994 at the fee levels currently in place (Line 2). The sum of these two amounts is $333.4 million, which is the total amount projected to be available for the Examinations Fee Account for fiscal year 1994 in the absence of a fee increase (Line 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> INS projects that the costs of Examinations Fee Account programs for fiscal year 1994 will be $331.5 million (Line 4). Because of the impossibility of predicting precisely the number of applications and associated revenue and workload in any given time period, and in order to ensure that there are sufficient resources to adjudicate applications, including those currently in process, INS has determined the need to retain a balance equivalent to one month of costs, or $27.6 million (Line 5). The remainder of that amount, if any, would be carried forward to the next fiscal year to continue processing applications. The existence of a carryforward balance is consistent with INS' past practice. As explained below, technical adjustments were applied to the fee base for some forms to ensure fair distribution of costs among users. The net effect of those adjustments is subtracted so that they will have no net impact on the aggregate INS fee revenue requirement (Line 6). The algebraic sum of these three amounts is the total revenue requirement of $356.9 million (Line 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtracting the revenue requirement from the funds available shows a revenue shortfall of $23.5 million (Line 8). Dividing this shortfall by the revenues projected under the current fee schedule produces the percentage by which the fees must be increased, 7.5 percent (Line 9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Computation of the Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed fees for most Immigration and Naturalization forms were calculated by applying the increase of 7.5 percent to the current fee, and rounding the result upward or downward to the nearest $5.00. Fees adjusted in this manner are shown on Exhibit 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were two exceptions to this computational procedure. One exception is a consequence of forms consolidation actions affecting the Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker,  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> I&hyph;129, where procedures and charges have been altered in response to experience with the consolidated forms and suggestions from users. The new charges associated with the I&hyph;129 are described below, and presented in Exhibit 6. The other exception is associated with technical adjustments to the computational base for certain forms, as described below and shown in Exhibit 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Petition For a Nonimmigrant Worker, I&hyph;129  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 4, 1991, INS published a proposed revision of Form I&hyph;129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (56 FR 50350). This revision consolidated a number of separate application and petition processes that had previously been handled on separate application forms, each with separate fees. To the extent possible, the new form retained the original fee structure, which was based upon the costs associated with each separate adjudication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the consolidation of Form I&hyph;129, INS received a number of comments and questions regarding the I&hyph;129 process. As a result, INS proposes to revise Form I&hyph;129 to incorporate several additional processes created by the Immigration Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;649) and the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;232), and to simplify the application procedures in response to public comments. For example, INS proposes to revise procedures in instances where an employer is filing for one worker to allow the worker's dependents to be included in the petition instead of requiring separate applications. In addition, INS would no longer require separate petitions for groups where the members will be applying for visas at more than one consulate or for visa-exempt workers applying for admission at different ports of entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current Form I&hyph;129 Fee Structure:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker consists of a base fee of $70 plus either:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _$10 per worker if requesting consulate or port-of-entry notification for visa issuance or admission;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _$80 per worker if requesting a change of status; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _$50 per worker if requesting an extension of stay.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Form I&hyph;129 Fee Structure:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed fee for a Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker is $120 per petition plus $10 for each dependent if filing for one worker, and $100 per petition plus $20 for each worker if filing for more than one worker. The changes simplify the application process and more fairly distribute the costs of processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because INS has consolidated actions which were previously separate, data are not yet available for establishing a fee based upon actual cost experience. Therefore, the proposed fee is based upon estimates of these costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Technical Adjustments to Computation Base for Certain Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before undertaking the percentage computations to arrive at the fee schedules proposed in this rule, INS reviewed the cost information supporting the current fee schedule. The information on processing times and related costs, the costs of FBI name and fingerprint checks, the costs of naturalization ceremonies conducted by United States Courts, the costs of INS immigration document and card production, the indirect costs and the surcharge were examined. (Copies of this analysis are available upon request.) Some differences were found between the current fees and the statistical information on the associated costs. The differences are small, and probably result from data corrections after the fees were computed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure fair distribution of costs among users, INS adjusted, upward or downward as necessary, the current fees for forms where differences were identified, before computing the proposed fee increase for those forms. INS ensured that this process had no net effect on the total revenue increase proposal by deducting the revenue increase that would be caused by the technical adjustments from the total revenue requirement before calculating the percentage fee revenue adjustment that would be applied to all forms. As previously noted, this deduction appears on Line 6 of Exhibit 4, where the fee revision requirement is calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IRA BOMBS KILL 6, HURT 27 IN SPREE OF REVENGE ATTACKS  </P> <P> The IRA took bloody revenge today for the shooting of one of its top gunmen,  killing six British soldiers and injuring 27 other people in bomb attacks on  Northern Ireland security posts.  </P> <P> Adopting a deadly new tactic, Irish Republican Army guerrillas forced civilians  to drive vehicles loaded with primed explosives to security checkpoints in  Londonderry and near the border town of Newry.  </P> <P> The posts were devastated by the blasts.  </P> <P> The man who drove the bomb-laden car to the Londonderry checkpoint was missing  and feared dead after the blast, police said.  </P> <P> A third similar operation near an army camp at Omagh failed when a man, who had  been strapped to the seat of the car by IRA gunmen and forced to drive it to  the target, wriggled free.  </P> <P> The detonator went off but failed to trigger the main bomb in the car.  </P> <P> The predawn attacks inflicted the heaviest casualties this year in Northern  Ireland on British forces and amounted to a major coup for the IRA.  </P></p>

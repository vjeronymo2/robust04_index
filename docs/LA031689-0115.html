			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS ON MYSTERY BEAM FIND IT A SIGNAL ANNOYANCE  </P> <P> Hundreds of homeowners in the east San Francisco Bay Area are being confounded  by uncooperative automatic garage door openers, thanks to an unspecified  government agency transmitting radio signals from a mountaintop, officials  said.  </P> <P> "We know it's a government agency," Tom Hora, a spokesman with the Federal  Communications Commission in Livermore, said Tuesday, "but we can't say which  one."  </P> <P> He said that residents who cannot tune the openers to another frequency can  expect the problem to persist through May 2.  </P> <P> Garage door companies have been swamped with complaints since Friday, when  homeowners discovered nothing was happening when they pressed the buttons on  the devices that normally save them the trouble of manually opening and closing  the doors.  </P> <P> Brian Cross of Cross Overhead Door Co. in Hayward, aware that automatic garage  doors operate on radio signals, said he telephoned the FCC to demand an  explanation for his sudden increase in service calls.  </P> <P> Cross said the FCC told him that government transmissions were "saturating"  some garage-door receivers. He said he was told that the signals were being  transmitted from Mt. Diablo, which overlooks much of Contra Costa County.  </P> <P> Brian Carr, salesman at Contra Costa Door Co. in Concord, said he has received  up to 400 calls. "All we know is that there's radio interference in the air  from some source -- we do not know why," he said.  </P> <P> The difficulty has been reported in Concord, Orinda, Walnut Creek, Lafayette,  Moraga, Danville, San Ramon and Livermore.  </P> <P> Hora said the public was not forewarned because garage door openers are  considered "unprotected devices," although they operate on radio frequencies  used by the government and other authorized users.  </P> <P> "We're not obligated to do anything," he said. "Normally, though, if anyone  were to contact us, we would let them know what the situation is."  </P></p>

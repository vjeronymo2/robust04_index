			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Navistar out of red as demand increases Navistar International, the Chicago-based manufacturer of International brand trucks, diesel engines and school bus chassis, has benefited from a sharp increase in demand for heavy trucks and engines. It yesterday unveiled third-quarter income of Dollars 20m, or 17 cents a share, a turnround from last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 312m, or Dollars 9.99 a share. Excluding the special accounting charge that led to last year's quarterly loss, Navistar recorded 1993 third-quarter earnings of Dollars 6m. Sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.25bn, up from last year's Dollars 1.13bn. The company delivered 23,800 heavy and medium trucks and school bus chassis in the quarter, up 15 per cent from last year. Sales of mid-range diesel engines to other truck assemblers rose 23 per cent to Dollars 157m, on shipments of 35,100m units. Sales of service parts grew 11 per cent over last year's third quarter, to Dollars 178m. Robust demand has prompted Navistar to boost its annual projections for industry-wide sales of heavy trucks in North America to 204,000 units, up 23 per cent from 1993's 166,400 units, and 5 per cent higher than the company's previous forecast of 195,000. To meet growing demand for its engines, the company took on 650 production workers during the quarter, and added extra shifts to its mid-western diesel engine factories. For the first nine months, Navistar had net income of Dollars 59m, or 50 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 3.78bn.</p>

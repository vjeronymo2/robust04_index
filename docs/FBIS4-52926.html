			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A Chat Thai Party MP has sponsored an urgent  motion for the Lower House to debate the Thanong Siriprichaphong  marijuana smuggling case.    Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said the motion was  submitted by Sisaket MP Chamnong Phothisaro and was accepted for  the House meeting agenda.    Whether the motion would be moved up for debate at the Lower  House's next meeting would depend on the opinion of the majority  of the Lower House members, Mr Thawin said.    Fellow lawmakers said yesterday that Mr Thanong should know  what course of action to take because he is the one embroiled in  the scandal.    Phalang Tham Party [PTP] founder Chamlong Simuang said as an  MP, Mr Thanong should know best what step he should take as a  result of the scandal.    Maj. Gen. Chamlong said, however, that in the interests of  justice and fairness Mr Thanong's position should also be heard.    The PTP de facto leader denied that the United States'  accusation against Thanong was part of a plan by PTP to ruin  Chart Thai's chance of joining the coalition. He also said that  was no reason for PTP to try to discredit Chat Thai.    "I believe the people know Khun Thanong's problem. MPs are  grown-up people and they should set themselves up as models for  others to obtain the public's trust. We all know what Khun  Thanong should do," Maj. Gen. Chamlong said.    Commenting on the issue, Deputy House Speaker Thawin said he  believed the Nakhon Phanom MP possessed "political spirit" and  knows what he should do. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US aluminium industry looks to Clinton - Producers argue western aid should be used to encourage the CIS to cut exports They say that President Clinton understands the economics of the aluminium industry very well. In the early 1980s, as governor of Arkansas, he pleaded with Reynolds Metals, second-largest of the US aluminium producers, not to close both the smelters in his state. But the smelters - Jones Mills and the Patterson - had been made completely uneconomic by the steep rise in energy costs and were permanently shut down in 1985 despite his pleas. Reynolds closed two other smelters at about the same time, the San Patricio in Texas and Listerhill in Alabama, taking a total of 462,000 tonnes of high-cost US capacity out of production. Mr Richard Holder, now chairman of Reynolds, remembers those difficult meetings with the president-to-be. He feels sure Mr Clinton remembers them too and this will stand the US aluminium industry in good stead in its current fight for survival and the efforts it is making to prevent itself being burried under a deluge of metal exported from the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, the US Aluminium Association, where Mr Holder is also currently chairman, will have to work hard to educate some of Mr Clinton's officials in the ways of the industry before December 2, when crucial meetings with government representatives from the CIS and the western world's other big aluminium producing countries take place in Washington. Senior aluminium industry executives have been invited to sit in at those talks as advisers to the US government. Before the December meeting the US association will put to its government a plan which will almost certainly suggest that the CIS producers be encouraged to cut output in return for financial and technical help from western countries. Some of the aid the US is ready to give to the CIS to help smooth its path towards a market economy should be linked specifically with programmes to modernise the former Soviet Union's heavily-polluting aluminium smelters, Mr Holder suggests. He says that, if the industry's proposals are accepted by government officials, he would be very surprised if they did not go to the president's desk for a final decision. There is little more the US industry can do to help itself except close a great deal more production capacity at the cost of many more jobs. US anti-trust legislation makes it virtually impossible for the country's aluminium producers to get involved in joint discussions about actions that might lead to the production cuts needed for higher prices. This is why the US industry must rely on its government to do the talking and, if necessary, take action to stem CIS exports. Convincing the government will not be easy, given that the US places the highest priority on supporting the political changes taking place in Russia and would not want to disturb those changes by heavy-handed action in the aluminium sector, which analysts reckon has been earning the CIS Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.5bn a year in foreign currency. Mr Holder says something must be done because there has been yet another surge in CIS exports to the west this year - exports that were running at 200,000 tonnes in 1990 are likely to reach 1.6m tonnes in 1993, according to his association's estimates. This compares with western consumption of about 15m tonnes. This helped to drive stocks on the London Metal Exchange to a record 2.3m tonnes and prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms, so that most smelters are not even covering their cash costs of production. Mr Holder says: 'I believe CIS exports have cut 10 to 15 cents a lb off the aluminium price.' If the price continues to drift down to 45 cents a lb, described by some analysts as 'a crisis level', there will be big casualties and 'I'm afraid that some of the companies that will suffer do not deserve to suffer'. The western industry must find a formula to persuade the CIS producers to cut exports, he suggests, and the only sure way that can be done is for output at the smelters to be reduced. Some ideas have already been contributed by individual members of his association in response to a US government's request. One suggestion is that work should begin immediately to modernise some of the CIS smelters, doing away with the out-dated Soderberg technology, which would take about one-third of the capacity of each plant selected for upgrading temporarily out of production. This idea is put forward by Alumax, a subsidiary of Amax and the US's third-largest aluminium producer. Alumax says the upgrading would take five years, during which the aluminium industry's situation would improve markedly and 'thus allow for the orderly re-introduction to western markets of Russia's exportable surplus aluminum. It would be, essentially, a new, efficient and environmentally acceptable source of supply.' Alumax suggests the first smelters to be dealt with should be the biggest and the worst polluters: those at Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk in south central Siberia. It points to a Metallegesellschaft study which indicates that these two plants alone emit more than 24 times the maximum safe levels of fluorine. Irkutsk, in the same general area, is also a prime candidate, according to Alumax, because it is near Lake Baikai, a sensitive environmental area. The Volgograd smelter to the west should also be modernised. The US group proposes that output at three old, highly-polluting smelters near the Kola Peninsula, on Finland's border, be cut by half but they should not be upgraded. All this would take about 600,000 tonnes a year out of production, it calculates. 'This, together with strong controls on legal and black market exports, would improve fundamentals of the world aluminium market significantly within 18 months to two years.' The big difficulty with this approach is the cost of upgrading the smelters  -up to Dollars 6bn. Alumax says, however, these projects could be financed via government-to-government aid, supplemented by the expertise of various western aluminium producers. Repayment could be in the form of aluminium for government aid assistance, and in either aluminium or equity shares for participating western producers. Kaiser Aluminium, in its proposals to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, suggests that CIS aluminium exports be restricted to 800,000 tonnes a year - 520,000 tonnes to pay for the CIS industry's imports of essential raw materials and 280,000 tonnes to be held in trust in secure western warehouses. This metal would be used to pay for priority projects to improve environmental, health and safety standards. Kaiser says that because of the time taken for modernisation, on average this metal in western warehouses will be off the open market for two years from the start of each programme year. In addition, warehoused metal could be used as collateral for money borrowed by the CIS smelters to cover part of the rouble production costs of the metal held off the market. Loans could run for three or four years and would be repaid from the sale of metal remaining after payment for capital projects. Financing could be supplied by private international banks or trading companies or, more likely, provided or guaranteed by individual governments, or it could be arranged through one of the multilateral financial institutions. Mr Bond Evans, Alumax president, says the western industry has cut output substantially already and, in spite of the recession, demand for aluminium has held up remarkably well. The western market would be in balance were it not for CIS exports. This metal is available because of the virtual collapse in domestic demand in the CIS. Mr Evans says this makes it logical for the next production cuts to be made in the CIS but, more importantly, 'it is senseless to shut efficient, clean plants in the west to make way for inefficient, polluting plants in the CIS.' He suggests the logic is so compelling that the multilateral government efforts now under way will result in a logical outcome - cuts in CIS production - in a few months time. 'Otherwise it will be Darwinism inverted  -the strong will go to the wall and the weak will survive.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US ALUMINIUM SMELTERS Capacity in '000 tonnes per year  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Company            Location            Capacity  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Reynolds*          Longview                204  2 Vanalco            Vancouver               115  3 Reynolds*          Troutdale               121  4 Northwest Al       The Dalles               62  5 Noranda            New Madrid              204  6 Reynolds           Jones Mill              125  7 Reynolds           Arkadelphia              68  8 Alcoa              Anderson City            15  9 Alcoa*             Rockdale                320 10 Reynolds           Lake Charles             36 11 Alcoa              Pt Comfort              159 12 Reynolds           Corp.

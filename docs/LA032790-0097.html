			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: NBC TINKERING WITH SATURDAY SCHEDULE  </P> <P> TV or not TV. . . .  </P> <P> SPRING FEVER: NBC is playing around with its important Saturday lineup,  anchored by "The Golden Girls." Carol Burnett and Robert Mitchum are a couple  of the prominent players.  </P> <P> Mitchum's new sitcom, "A Family for Joe," gets a crack at the important 8 p.m.  leadoff slot this Saturday. He portrays a homeless man who poses as grandfather  to four orphans to keep them together. There was a preview at 8:30 p.m. last  Saturday.  </P> <P> As for Burnett, her new comedy series, "Carol &amp; Company," has the first of  two tryouts right after "The Golden Girls" Saturday at 9:30 p.m. It's a nice  spot -- usually occupied by "Empty Nest."  </P> <P> Along with the Cosby-led Thursday lineup, Saturdays keep NBC No. 1 -- so any  tinkering is watched closely.  </P> <P> The two nights are also great launching pads for new series -- to see if they  have the stuff that hits are made of.  </P> <P> RERUN HEAVEN: "Moonlighting" followed by "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" on  Lifetime cable last Saturday.  </P> <P> The perfect TV package.  </P> <P> And apologies to Bruce Willis -- I never really appreciated how good he was as  "Moonlighting's" David Addison.  </P> <P> Just the right flair as David lets fly about his brother:  </P> <P> "Waiter, take this man back to the kitchen -- he's not completely cooked."  </P> <P> And Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes:  </P> <P> "You see one guy in his socks, you've seen them all."  </P> <P> David to Maddie, at work: "You always this much fun early in the morning?"  Maddie: "You're gonna die wondering."  </P> <P> On April 6, by the way, Lifetime airs a behind-the-scenes look at "Molly Dodd,"  followed by the first of the season's new episodes.  </P> <P> GOING IN STYLE: Really charming season finale for ABC's "Anything but Love"  Wednesday as Hannah (Jamie Lee Curtis) marks her 30th birthday with bittersweet  memories -- and the realization that she loves Marty (Richard Lewis). Will the  series be back next fall? Well, let's put it this way: If ABC blows it and says  no, it's another great candidate for Lifetime.  </P> <P> AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT. . . : Let's not hear even the slightest thought that ABC  might not renew the Peabody Award-winning "China Beach" for next season. Still  another great candidate for the female-oriented Lifetime, where, we should add,  yet another ABC series (which got canceled) -- "Spenser: For Hire," with Robert  Urich -- looks better and better as time goes by.  </P> <P> MATCHED SET: Nice job by Arsenio Hall Friday with guest Jessica Tandy ("Driving  Miss Daisy"). He even looked touched when she said that he was better known  than she. But we can sure live without his other side -- that tasteless  expression he uttered on another show last week, which was reported by several  offended readers. A Paramount spokeswoman said that Hall is allowed to be "free  and clear," and studio executives declined to comment. In short, he's getting  good ratings.  </P> <P> CORRALLED: Look, if CBS scored potently with "Lonesome Dove," its tale of a  cattle drive, and a new movie version of "Gunsmoke" that ranked No. 7 in last  week's ratings, shouldn't the network be thinking of a real, traditional  Western series? CBS' "Paradise" was an amiable entry but not a genuine, bang-up  frontier epic.  </P> <P> SILVER LINING: Amid the early ratings wreckage of its three-hour, prime-time,  nightly news, KCAL Channel 9 should be taking a close look at the work of  newcomer David Jackson, who's quick on his feet and agreeable. But the  station's new sports report is so pathetic that the bonehead decision to fire  Scott St. James seems more absurd every day.  </P> <P> STAR: If you tuned in Steve McQueen in "Bullitt" on superstation TBS Saturday  night, you were watching him on what would have been his 60th birthday. He died  10 years ago. And, oh my, was he ever trim and tough and every inch a Hollywood  prince in "Bullitt," backed up by Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Vaughn -- and  seeming almost part of his car in that sensational chase through San Francisco.  </P> <P> IT'S MAGIC: Can't wait for next Tuesday's CBS movie "Laker Girls," about the  cheerleaders for our favorite dribblers. Do you think they'll love it in  Boston?  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE: So there's Candice Bergen as the TV news hot-shot in "Murphy  Brown," telling a secretary: "Please, don't feel you have to make a fuss or  give me any special treatment because you see me on TV every week." Secretary:  "I don't have a TV. I have a life."  </P> <P> MOMENTS IN TIME: Judy Holliday shuffling her cards in the gin rummy scene of  "Born Yesterday" on the Comedy Channel. . . . Gary Cooper dancing with the  exquisite Suzy Parker in "Ten North Frederick" on American Movie Classics. . .  . Lucy and Desi doing a knockout "Cuban Pete" dance number on KTTV Channel 11  -- somehow making us understand what attracted them to each other in the first  place.  </P> <P> DATEBOOK: "Tour of Duty" has been an honorable series for CBS, and the Vietnam  drama keeps on reaching for something special -- on April 14, it deals with the  spraying of Agent Orange.  </P> <P> BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN WARSAW: Wonder if the folks who make Fred Sands' TV real  estate program saw this ad in Sunday's Times: "POLAND-WARSAW Studio apt. 380  sf. Nr dwntwn. $20K or make ofr." Well, as any broker will tell you --  location, location, location.  </P> <P> BEING THERE: "Sometimes I just wish I were Ozzie Nelson. He'd just say, 'Go to  college' -- and that would be the end of that." Who said it? Howard Cunningham  (Tom Bosley) to son Richie (Ron Howard) in "Happy Days."  </P> <P> Say good night, Gracie. . . .  </P></p>

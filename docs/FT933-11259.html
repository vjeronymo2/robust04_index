			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Wiring boost for the smaller car - Worth Watching An innovative form of car wiring harness, claimed to be 30 per cent lighter than conventional wiring, is to be incorporated in a small car to be launched by Nissan next year, writes John Griffiths. Called 'flexible flat circuit', and developed in partnership with Mitsubishi's cables subsidiary, it is stamped out of flat conductive material and covered with insulation to form a sandwich-like board - in essence, an adaption of printed circuit technology. The circuitry is cheaper to produce and install than conventional wiring looms, which are assembled from single wiring strands that often have to be pre-heated to be bent around the car's operating mechanisms.

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Management: George Orwell's 1994 - Simon Gibson explains why the language that a company uses can have a direct effect on its financial performance A company's fortunes are expressed by its figures, but its future is caught in its language. While numbers are merely red or black, the words that a company uses in its corporate speeches, articles and annual reports open up a window on the way that management is thinking. Indeed, they show whether it is thinking at all. Companies today are required to communicate more regularly than ever before, both to internal and external audiences. Many cope admirably, many others fail. All too often executives resort to management-speak rather than using clear and original expression. The struggle against the corruption of the language goes beyond the concern of the corporate communications director - it is a business issue. Indeed, one can argue that the language that a company uses can have a direct effect on its financial performance. The enemies of clear expression are not unique to the world of business. They are language's common foe, given new clothing. In one of the great essays on this subject, Politics and the English Language, George Orwell listed a number of 'bad habits which spread by imitation', which he believed were signs of the corruption of political thought at that time. These bad habits included: pretentious diction, meaningless words, dead metaphors, hackneyed phrases, cliche and jargon. It is a list that one could level at today's business communications with equal legitimacy. Perhaps the most obvious villain is jargon. The language of business is full of it: empowerment, downsizing, proactive, business re-engineering, networking. These are just a few of the jargon words that are trotted out at innumerable business meetings. The argument is not specifically against industry coining technical words to describe its processes, but rather against the misuse of such technical terms. Indeed, certain industries have built up their own vocabulary of technical words that when used are quite precise. Frequently, the problem occurs when words are borrowed from other activities in an effort to mystify the business of business. For example, 'downsizing the headcount' sounds more cerebral, worthy and expensive than 'giving people the sack'. Equally, it seems that everyone who has been given the sack recently has not been made redundant, but has become a consultant. Consultants are often the worst offenders when it comes to the use of jargon, presumably in the vain attempt to remain part of the corporate club. Some will see these accusations of the corruption of language as a crusade against Americanisation. It is not. Silicon Valley may be responsible for some of the worst excesses of techno-babble, but these are only injurious when misused. Again 'downsizing' is a good example. When applied to computers it is a forgiveably neat way to describe the migration from mainframe to client-server technology; applied to people it is simply dehumanising. Nor is the argument an elitist one, part of an effort to protect the purity of our culture in the way that the French establishment is currently attempting. The argument is simply against the use of language without meaning or with false meaning. Too often meaningless words or phrases are used simply to indicate that the speaker belongs to the middle management club. 'Vision', 'challenge', 'short-termism', 'whither', 'I hear where you're coming from', 'we need to manage change', 'think global, act local' are all typical examples. Describing business partnerships as 'getting into bed with' someone was another common example of this trait; often heard in the 1980s it has fortunately gone out of fashion. Another feature of this language of acceptance is what one might term the proposition of the indisputable. For instance, phrases such as 'people are our most important asset', 'I'm with Cadbury on that one' or 'we are committed to giving our shareholders a sound return on their investment', are all so palpably blessed with holy oil that no one would dare argue against them. Anyone caught using them is probably begging as many questions as they are attempting to answer. When was the last time you can remember someone daring to question a speaker who extolled the values of 'total quality management' or of being 'market-driven'? Yet phrases such as these are frequently misused and most often employed by people who have not thought sufficiently about quality or the marketplace. They are merely camouflage. Without them, without cliche, jargon and other dead language, most businesses would work better. So what should govern the way that companies and those in business express themselves? Prescriptive lists are always dangerous. Language is far too individual to be shackled by too many rules. However, there are good guidelines. Orwell suggested the following: Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print. Never use a long word when a short one will do. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out. Never use the passive where you can use the active. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent. Break any of these rules rather than say anything that is outright barbarous. These guidelines are still sound. If a company were to banish the bad habits and take up Orwell's principles, managers would have less camouflage to hide behind. Employees would be more likely to think for themselves. In the process some startling things might be discovered: for example, that people may not be the most important asset of the company or that shareholder value may not be the only golden rule for senior management. Above all, clear language both encourages and reflects clarity of thought and, in business, isn't that the only real asset a company can depend upon?</p>

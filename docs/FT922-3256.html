			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Pilkington Pilkington's first dividend cut in its 22-year history as a public company is a bleak comment on the outlook for its markets. It is hard to see when the cut will restored. Profits this year may be no higher than last, even without the burden of exceptionals. In that case, the dividend will again be uncovered by earnings. Again, too, it looks like being paid not out of operating cash flow but from disposals. It is in cruel contrast with Pilkington's proud record of long-term investment that even a cut payment has to be funded by the partial dissolution of the company. At yesterday's 129p, the shares are on 23 times historic earnings before exceptionals and yield only 6.2 per cent. There seems nothing to stop them falling further.</p>

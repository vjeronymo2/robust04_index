			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI directors top the pay league THE DIRECTORS of Thorn EMI, the electrical and entertainment group, have paid themselves on average more than the board of any other quoted company reporting during the past year, according to the latest issue of the Performance Rankings Guide issued yesterday. Average remuneration for directors earning more than Pounds 20,000 in the company was Pounds 850,000 for the year to March 31 1992. Next highest was the board of Tiphook, the freight container and trailer leasing group, which awarded the average director Pounds 616,000 in its most recent financial year, followed by Lonrho, the international conglomerate, which paid an average Pounds 597,000. The figures come from a quarterly guide published by Hemmington Scott, the corporate information supplier, which analyses dozens of trends revealed in the most recent annual reports released by 1,802 UK-quoted companies. Lonrho has the largest differential between the average amount it pays its directors and that paid to its employees. The difference is 165 times, with the average director receiving Pounds 597,000 and the average employee Pounds 3,630, explained in part by Lonrho's large African operations. It also has the highest paid director, Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, at Pounds 1.6m in the year to September 30 1991. Five other directors received more than Pounds 1m a year in their most recent reports: at Hanson, SmithKline Beecham, Tesco, Glaxo and BOC. However, the greatest absolute increase in salary of a director was Mr Mike Hennessy of Kalon, the paint maker. His remuneration rose by Pounds 618,000 to Pounds 784,000 in the year to December 31 last year, thanks to a performance-related bonus. The highest average pay for employees was Pounds 70,100 at Candover, the investment trust. It was lowest at Inch Kenneth Kajang, which grows oil palms in Malaysia, at Pounds 150 a year. Sterling Trust, the USM-quoted financial services company, covered its liabilities by assets by the highest ratio, at 28.3 times, while the lowest was Jermyn Investment, the shares and property investor, at 0.04. Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group, had the greatest liquidity - measured by the proportion of capital employed in cash and current asset investments - while Erskine House, the office equipment services company, had the highest gearing - or ratio of debt to equity - at 17,531 per cent. The largest growth in earnings per share over the past five years was at Vodafone, the mobile telephone company, at an average of 291 per cent a year. A separate publication also released yesterday by Hemmington Scott, called the Company Guide, shows that 52 companies have been removed from a Stock Exchange quotation during the four months period from April to June, and 11 new ones joined. Ten quoted companies were acquired during the quarter, and 22 changed their names. Among professional advisers, Cazenove and Rowe &amp; Pitman are the stockbrokers which have both the most quoted clients by number and those making the most profit. Rowe &amp; Pitman and de Zoete &amp; Bevan have the clients with fastest growth in pre-tax profits and earnings per share (which meant the smallest decline for the period). For solicitors, Slaughter &amp; May and Linklaters &amp; Paines have most quoted clients and those making most profit. Slaughter &amp; May and McKenna have both the fastest earnings and profits growth. Among financial advisers, SG Warburg has the largest number and the most profitable clients, followed by Lazard Brothers and Schroders respectively. Robert Fleming and Barings have those with fastest earnings and profits growth. For auditors, Coopers &amp; Lybrand has clients making the most profit. KPMG Peat Marwick has the most stock market clients by number, and Ernst &amp; Young the clients with fastest pre-tax profits growth. However, Robson Rhodes - which is only the 14th largest firm by fee income - had the quoted clients with fastest earnings growth. Hambro Company Guide. Pounds 99 per year. Performance Rankings Guide.

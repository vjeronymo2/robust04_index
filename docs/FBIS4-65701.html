			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fiori Will Pass Judgment on </F> Alitalia Plan Within Days"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 17 -- The new transport minister,  Publio Fiori, today promised to pass judgment within four or  five days on the restructurization plan drafted for Alitalia by  the management team led by managing director Roberto Schisano,  who moved to the loss-making Italian flagcarrier airline three  months ago from Texas Instruments.    Ahead of a meeting with Alitalia senior executives scheduled  for Thursday [19 May], Fiori cautioned, "The government does not  intend to throw more money into the well of public companies."  "If the plan is credible and is aimed at revival and the  recovery of quality and rests not only on job cuts,  recapitalization -- with interventions which can be diverse and  provide also for a bond issue -- will be no problem and it will  be possible to bring in private investors as well," added the  minister.    Speaking at the end of a meeting with union representatives,  Fiori said the policy of the new government will be to "reduce  state financial interventions to a minimum. If there is a  public company in crisis, it is more correct to go to the  market, with a bond issue guaranteed by the state, for example,  if the European Commission allows it."    The minister said he was confident of an EU [European Union]  go-ahead "if the plan is credible and the unions allow it. In  parallel, this will make Alitalia shares more tasty and there  can be thinking on the entry of private capital in the company,"  he added with reference to the airline controlled by the  Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale [Institute for  Industrial Reconstruction] public holding company.    Fiori's comments came one day after unidentified ministry  sources talked of a bond issue and opening Alitalia's doors to  private investors to generate the 1.5 trillion lire (932 million  dollars) needed to carry out the recovery plan.    On ways and means to cut up to 4,000 jobs, for the purpose  of  reducing operating costs by 12 percent, Fiori today said the  early retirement scheme could be extended beyond the 800 flight  personnel but that the government will attempt to assure that  "no pockets of unemployment" are created. "A system of social  shock absorbers will have to be found and problems of management  and fares will have to be looked at," he added.    After saying that for any privatization plan, he "favors a  golden share maintained by the state," the minister voiced his  confidence in the airline's management. "I have no doubts about  their capabilities; I just have the duty to verify."    Fiori said he will meet the union side again after he has  given the restructurization plan further study.    Last week, Alitalia reported first-quarter losses of 190  billion lire, compared to loss for all of 1993 of 345.6 billion  lire (215 million dollars) and 16.8 billion in the red for 1992.  Total losses as of the end of the first quarter this year  accounted for more than one-third of Alitalia capital.    Aside from job cuts, according to the Alitalia board, the  main points of the new restructurization plan are aimed at  improving service, overhauling the entire network of regional  connections and schedules, looking north and turning the Milan  airport into a major hub for European flights, management  reshuffles at the group's subsidiaries, cost cuts and new rules  for flight crews.    The board attributed the poor results of 1993 to a  four-year-long global slump in the airline industry and to fare  wars for intercontinental routes. Operating losses amounted to  80 billion lire (50.3 million dollars) last year compared to  profits of 155 billion lire in 1992.    Union representatives, speaking for the CGIL's [Italian  General Confederation of Labor] FILT [Italian Federation of  Transportation Workers], FIT [Italian Transportation Federation]  of the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] and the UIL  [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] transport union, were  generally non-committal at the end of their talk with the  minister but said Fiori promised to roll back United Airlines'  management of their own ground services at Rome's International  Leonardo Da Vinci Airport.    "Fiori took on the commitment to examine a legislative way  which takes account of job guarantees," said Sandro Degni of the  UIL with reference to union worries about job losses which could  result if the recent agreement between United Airlines and the  Aeroporti di Roma, which runs the Rome airports, is expanded to  bring in other carriers.    Paolo Brutti of the FILT said the government's opinion of  the  Alitalia restructurization plan is "fundamental. Ownership has  to bet on the future of the company, otherwise, it will be  difficult for the workers to do so. Then if fresh capital  arrives from sell- offs and bond issues, this does not interest  us."    The FIT's Salvatore Frisella said recapitalization is a  "duty  within the civil code, if for no other reason." On trimming  jobs, this union official said his side would be willing to  discuss non- productive areas but "is not in agreement with cuts  deriving from the curtailment of services."    Silvano Barberini of the FIT, said that according to rumors  ahead of the resignation tomorrow of the Aeroporti di Roma  board, the new managing director could come from Texas  Instruments, the company whose European operations were led by  Schisano, and that Schisano may take over the chair.    Named as a likely deputy chairman is Renato Cassaro, the  present managing director of Fintecna, the IRI company which  holds 40 percent of Aeroporti. The union official said these  changes at the top, in line with the recent shake-up in the  senior management of Alitalia, show that Aeroporti di Roma will  not be put up for sale "but revived. And on this, the unions  can only be in agreement."</p>

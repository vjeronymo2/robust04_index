			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAPITAL COVERAGE OF MAYOR'S ARREST HAS SOMETHING EXTRA  </P> <P> If only for a day, the nation's capital had an afternoon newspaper Friday.  </P> <P> "BUSTED," said the 2 1/2-inch headline above the lead stories in a special  edition of the Washington Times that chronicled the arrest of District of  Columbia Mayor Marion Barry on drug charges. Most of the 24-page edition was  devoted to Barry's arrest at a downtown hotel Thursday night.  </P> <P> Not since the Washington Star folded in 1981 had residents of the area seen a  local afternoon newspaper.  </P> <P> The "EXTRA!" was sold by hawkers outside the rival Washington Post; the  District Building, Washington's city hall; the Vista International Hotel, where  Barry was arrested, and at downtown subway stations, said Linda Clark, a  spokeswoman for the Times, a morning paper published Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> The lead stories outlined how Barry was apprehended as part of an FBI sting  operation, contained information concerning his arraignment and had comments  from a news conference held by U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens.  </P> <P> Also, the special edition contained comments from elementary school students  and residents of the city along with an editorial and a column on Barry's  arrest.  </P> <P> The newspaper called its afternoon edition "Special Report: The Barry Crackup."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the news of Barry's arrest made the front pages Friday of all major  newspapers in Bogota, Colombia, the center of the world cocaine trade.  </P> <P> El Espectador, a newspaper that has long crusaded against the drug trade and  was bombed by traffickers several months ago, ran a photograph of Barry at the  top of its front page with the caption: "Drug-Addict Mayor."  </P> <P> Another photo inside showed Barry along with former New York Mayor Edward I.  Koch and Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana at an anti-drug mayors' meeting last  June.  </P> <P> The other major Bogota daily, El Tiempo, ran a front-page story under the  headline: "Black mayor of Washington arrested buying cocaine."  </P></p>

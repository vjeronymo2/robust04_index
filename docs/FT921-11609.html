			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Inco drop 81% INCO, the world's largest nickel producer, suffered a fourth-quarter loss and an 81 per cent drop in earnings for 1991. The setback was due mainly to lower metal prices and higher production costs. The company spent USDollars 31m in after-tax severance costs last year. Earnings for the year were Dollars 82.6m, or 74 cents a share, down from Dollars 441.2m, or Dollars 4.18, in 1990. Revenues fell to Dollars 3.05bn from Dollars 3.34bn. The fourth-quarter loss was Dollars 5.8m, compared with earnings of Dollars 72.6m a year earlier. Sales and other revenues dipped to Dollars 710.3m from Dollars 870.3m. ***** Unisys and Motorola have expanded their collaboration in chip technology development, manufacturing and design by entering a semiconductor technology alliance, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. Motorola, the largest US semiconductor manufacturer, is a main supplier to Unisys, the US computer group. Under the agreement Unisys and Motorola will jointly define new chip production process and design technologies for customised chips for Unisys mainframe computer systems. Unisys said it would phase out its last chip-making operation, in California, making the it the largest computer manufacturer to rely entirely on outside sources for its semiconductor supplies. ***** A DECLINE in advertising revenues, especially in classified advertisments, was yesterday cited by Knight-Ridder, the third largest US newspaper chain, as a key reason for the 11.4 per cent decline in its 1991 net income, to Dollars 132.1m, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The net profit, struck on total 1991 revenues 2.9 per cent lower at Dollars 2.2bn, reflected the US recession, according to Mr Robert Singleton, Knight-Ridder's chief financial officer. The last quarter of 1991 saw an improving trend, with net profits 10.4 per cent higher at Dollars 46.4m, on unchanged revenues of Dollars 588.5m. ***** RECORD fourth-quarter and year-end results were reported by McDonald's, the world's biggest chain of fast-food restaurants, writes Our Financial Staff. Net earnings for the final three months of 1991 increased to Dollars 200.4m, or 54 cents a share, from Dollars 186.2m, or 51 cents, in the same period of 1990. This lifted the year's earnings to Dollars 859.6m,or Dollars 2.35, from Dollars 802.3m, or Dollars 2.20, in 1990. Full-year revenues increased to Dollars 6.7bn from Dollars 6.64bn. ***** NINE Canadian telephone utilities are forming a new company to co-ordinate their move into international markets and to oversee research and marketing of domestic telephone services, writes Bernard Simon. The new company, Stentor Resource Centre, comprises all but one of the shareholders of Telecom Canada, the alliance which administers Canada's domestic long-distance system. Stentor is expected to start operations next January with about 2,500 employees. ***** ASARCO, one of the leading integrated producers of non-ferrous metals, has recorded a steep fall in its 1991 net earnings, writes Barbara Durr. Lower prices for the company's principal products of copper, lead, silver and zinc brought the results down. They also suffered from lower prices for specialty chemicals. Earnings in 1991 fell to Dollars 46m, or Dollars 1.12 per share, from Dollars 149.1m, or Dollars 3.60. Sales were Dollars 1.9bn, down from Dollars 2.2bn in 1990. The decline prompted the company to halve its quarterly dividend.</p>

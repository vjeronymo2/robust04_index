			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPURS' ROBINSON MISSES A MATCHUP AGAINST DIVAC  </P> <P> An anticipated meeting of pro basketball centers of the future didn't take  place as expected Friday evening at Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs and Vlade Divac, the Lakers' newly  signed rookie from Yugoslavia, were supposed to face one another in the Summer  Pro League. But the Spurs withdrew from the tournament, saying that they had  accomplished what they wanted to in the league and that they had seen enough  progress from Robinson, the former Navy star who until recently has been  fulfilling his military obligation.  </P> <P> In five summer league games, Robinson averaged 25.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and  4.2 blocks. Robinson's best scoring game was Wednesday night when he had 36  points.  </P> <P> Before Friday, Divac had played in two games, getting 15 points, 12 rebounds  and a blocked shot against Milwaukee, and 20 points and 18 rebounds against  Denver-Sacramento. He also has had a total of 14 turnovers in those games.  </P> <P> The Spurs were replaced in the tournament by the NBA Stars, a team with several  NBA players, among them Reggie Theus and Reggie Miller.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Constitutional Court has invalidated the head  of state's appointment of the former justice minister, Yves  Yehouessi, as Supreme Court president. The reason given was  that the term of office of the incumbent president of the  Supreme Court, Frederick Houndeton, had not yet expired.  President Nicephore Soglo has accepted the court's decision.  Theodore Holo, the Beninese Government spokesman, speaks on the  issue to Herman Gnani:    [Begin Holo recording] We live in a state of law, where the  Constitutional Court has annulled a presidential decision. You  know that the government and the head of state, who respect the  rule of law, have accepted this decision. This does not mean  that this decision, which cannot be appealed, does not deserve  to be analyzed and commented upon by the citizens of our  country, who can appreciate its quality. You know that the law  is a living organism which evolves; it is not an exact science.  Even the Constitutional Court can make mistakes.    It is true that today's errors may be corrected tomorrow.  This does not mean; however, that this decision will stand for  all eternity. I regret this particular decision because of the  reputation -- and our personal attachment for -- the  Constitutional Court. The Court must prove, through the  relevance of its decisions, that it is a body which correctly  interprets the Constitution. This is all the more true since  the person called into question in this situation is former  Minister Yehouessi, who we owe a great debt to for his work in  bringing ethics to our country's public life. Do not forget  that he was one of the great artisans of the Cisse trial, and if  it is in this manner that the nation intends to reward him, then  I think we are going to dissuade a lot of initiative from those  who want to engage in the fight for improving the moral quality  of public life.

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Egyptian reactor deal for Argentina THE Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority has awarded a contract to build the country's first nuclear reactor in more than 30 years to the Argentinian company Investigaciones Aplicadas (INVAP). Egypt's only existing nuclear plant, built by the Soviet Union in 1961 at Inshas (55km north-east of Cairo), is to be dismantled. INVAP won the tender for the 22-MW research plant over rival bids from General Atomics, the US group, Atomic Energy of Canada, and a Franco-German consortium of Siemens and Framaton. Mr Maher Abaza, Egypt's minister of power and electricity, said the five-year project will cost Dollars 44.47m (Pounds 25.1m), plus Dollars 16.6m for sub-contracted construction and locally-manufactured components. Work on the first phase will begin before the end of the year. Mr Jorge de Belaustegui, Argentina's ambassador to Egypt, joined the Egyptians in stressing that the new reactor would carry out no military research, and would be built and run under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The two countries were previously linked in a military capacity in the aborted development of the Condor-2 missile in the late 1980s. Egypt had ambitious plans in the early 1980s for several power-generating plants but these were shelved after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It remains to be seen whether the new research plant will lead to new contracts for power generators. The official media in China reported in July that Egypt was ready to order a 300-MW reactor. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is due to make an official visit to China in October.</p>

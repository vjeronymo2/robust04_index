			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mortgage arrears leap THE NUMBER of homeowners in the UK more than six months in arrears with their mortgage payments has risen by a quarter, the most extensive and up-to-date survey of mortgage debt shows. The survey, published today in Roof magazine, shows that 360,100 households were six or more months behind with their mortgage payments at the end of March, up from 290,080 last year. The number in short-term debt is continuing to fall but one in 12 homeowners is two or more months in arrears with mortgage payments. In spite of the halving of interest rates since 1991 the total in arrears of two months or more rose by 27,000 in the year to the end of March, bringing the total to 800,150. The survey, carried out annually by Ms Janet Ford of Loughborough University, draws on data from 41 lenders of all types, responsible for 60 per cent of UK loans. It covers more lenders than the figures released periodically by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which do not include short-term arrears. The figures highlight the trend in arrears from short-term to long-term debt. The number of households two months in arrears is at its lowest for four years. Arrears of more than a year have jumped by more than 50 per cent to 156,740. The growth in the number of homeowners more than a year in arrears reflects the success of the government in persuading lenders not to repossess such homes. Until the launch of the mortgage rescue package at the end of 1991 lenders normally repossessed homes when arrears exceeded six months. One element in the package was the direct payment to lenders of the part of social security benefits meant to cover mortgage interest. But only 17 per cent of those covered by the direct payment of mortgage interest are in arrears, according to the survey. The vast majority of those in arrears do not qualify for means-tested benefits. About four fifths of those in arrears are outside the social security safety net, and are typically people in low-wage employment or families where only one partner is unemployed. The survey says that the number of homes repossessed in the year to March was 60,500. This compares with the CML figure of 68,540 for last year and suggests that repossessions in the first quarter have fallen to almost half the level of the first quarter of last year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        HOMEOWNERS IN ARREARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Period in arrears             March 31 1993      March 31 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2 months                         198,000             207,780 3-5 months                       242,050             275,380 6-11 months                      203,360             186,200 12 or more months                156,740             103,880 Total arrears                    800,150             773,240 Number of mortgages            9,920,000           9,800,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Roof Magazine  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

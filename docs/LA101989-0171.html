The lawyer for Cynthia Nelson, 26, of  Kirkland, Wash., said the jury's decision vindicated his client and was a  warning to Nordstrom about its treatment of employees. Nelson was fired in  September, 1986, when company officials confronted her with five anonymous  letters accusing her of stealing from other employees and wrongly crediting  herself with commissions earned by other clerks.  </P></p>

			<p>Information   `Startling'   <F P=102> PA0106134694 Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in  Spanish 1230 GMT 1 Jun 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA0106134694 </F> <F P=104>  Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Gonzalvez; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" </F> newscast]    [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Ruedas has expressed  surprise at a statement made by a U.S. State Department  spokesman yesterday. The spokesman said his country has decided  to suspend the supply of information from the radars that  operate in Leticia and Aracura because Colombian military  authorities had downed planes. Minister Pardo Ruedas told  Caracol the following:    [Begin recording] [Pardo Ruedas] Thus, it seems to us  that.... [pauses] it is a startling decision. We do not have  any final position apart from the one that a signatory of a  multilateral agreement has unilaterally decided--without prior  announcement or explanations--to suspend its participation.    [Gonzalvez] Could any preceding events have led the United  States to make this decision, minister?    [Pardo Ruedas] This is what we would like to know. [Words  indistinct] multilateral cooperation that is advantageous to us  and other countries. We work on a par with other countries. It  is advantageous to all those who are interested in controlling  drug trafficking. We do not understand why a decision has been  made abruptly and without advising, consulting, or giving  reasons for it.    [Gonzalvez] Perhaps they fear the wrong plane will be downed  due to information given?    [Pardo Ruedas] However, they would have to report this and  discuss it with us. This decision cannot be based simply on  [words indistinct] a meeting without, for example, taking into  account our opinion. [end recording]    Other Defense Ministry spokesmen told Caracol that while the  U.S. Government suspends the supply of radar information to  Colombia, it congratulates the Peruvian Government each time it  downs a plane.</p>

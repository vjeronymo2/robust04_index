			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: PUERTO RICAN BANK OKS FINANCING FOR HOH PLANT  </P> <P> HOH Water Technology said it has received approval in principle for $2 million  in financing from Economic Development Bank of Puerto Rico. The financing is  intended to help the fledgling Newbury Park company set up a manufacturing  plant in Puerto Rico to manufacture its water purification systems for  residential and commercial use.  </P> <P> The financing is conditional until the consulting firm Arthur D. Little  concludes its report on the market potential of HOH's products. That report is  expected to be completed next month.  </P> <P> If the financing is completed, Economic Development Bank would lend HOH $1.5  million and invest $500,000 in the company. HOH has recently been suffering  from a cash crunch. Company President David Kravitz said the company hopes to  be in production within six months after receiving the financing.  </P> <P> The Puerto Rican government often lends money to companies that locate  factories there in an effort to create jobs.  </P></p>

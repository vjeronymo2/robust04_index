The Nagorno-Karabakh Army press office told Interfax that  all  Azerbaijani attacks had been repelled. Azerbaijanis are  suffering huge casualties both in personnel and hardware on all  sections of the frontline. According to preliminary reports, up  to 70 Azerbaijani troops were killed and three tanks destroyed  Thursday alone.    A total of five Nagorno-Karabakh troops were killed, while  another 14 wounded.    At 1700 this afternoon fighting was going on only near  Fizuli.    In the meantime, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry press  center said heavy fighting had been going on near the villages  of Gyullyudzha and Suma of the Agdam district since early  morning.    The ministry's experts believe Armenians intend to break the  Azerbaijani defense on the border between the Agdam and Terter  districts of Azerbaijan.    According to the ministry, up to two battalions of troops  were transferred from Armenia to the north of Nagorno-Karabakh  every week.    The situation in the south west of Azerbaijan, near Fizuli,  also remains tense, the press office said. Over the last 24  hours, heavy fighting continued there. The press center said  Azerbaijani units ousted Armenians from a number of  strategically important heights and seized vast quantities of  weapons and ammo, including a T-72 tank, an armored combat  vehicle, two mobile launchers Grad, 11 artillery guns, five  heavy-caliber machine-guns, seven man-pack radio sets, many  rocket launchers, submachine-guns and an UAZ jeep.</p>

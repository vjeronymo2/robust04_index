			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is reviewing visa requests by two officials of the  Palestine Liberation Organization and a West Bank Palestinian to attend a  U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian conference in New York next weekend, the State  Department said. A visa request for a fourth person, Bassam abu Sharif, a PLO  spokesman, was apparently dropped after U.S. officials told the PLO it would be  impossible. Dennis Harter, a State Department spokesman, did not identify the  three visa applicants by name, but he referred to a Washington Post report that  said they are posing a dilemma for the Administration over how to deal with the  PLO.  </P></p>

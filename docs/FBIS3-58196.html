It only became more dangerous.    Good election outcomes usually have an immediate effect on  the opposition within a political party. Large portions  disappear. Not so with the opposition within the governing  party. It takes part of the credit for the Storting election  victory, and since then has established itself as a separate  organization within the labor movement. This has laid the basis  for a power struggle that will take place as much outside of, as  in, the spotlight of the media.    On the surface it might appear that SME (Social Democrats  Against EC) has not accomplished much in the months since its  establishment. About the only thing the public has seen of the  organization was its victory in the vote in the Storting just  before Christmas [a vote for all four EC applicant countries to  conduct their referendums on the same date]. In view of the fact  that practically all EC opponents in the Labor Party and in the  Labor Confederation belong to SME, it might seem strange that we  hear so little about the organization in these days of summing  up 1993 politically.    It will be very different come this time next year. The SME  strategists want a low public profile. To them the most  important thing is avoiding the accusations of promoting  factionalism for the purpose of undermining the national party  congress's resolution to vote yes to the EC. As a result, they  take every opportunity to emphasize that they are working quite  openly and that they are only concerned with speaking for all  those EC opponents who voted for the Labor Party in the election.    They are so concerned about loyalty that it is almost  comical. Take a really close look at [Labor Party leader]  Thorbjorn Jagland and [SME leader] Hallvard Bakke the next time  they are asked to comment on the handling of the EC issue in the  Labor Party: They both say there is no disagreement between them  as far as the rules of the game go. Bakke says that of course he  respects the party's chosen leaders and program resolutions.  Jagland says that of course one is allowed to work against EC  membership as a Labor Party member.    But behind these pretty words are hard-as-nails realities.  Labor leader Jagland is bound to be just as exasperated over the  SME as the prime minister is. She spoke her mind about its  activities in the Storting just before Christmas. But Jagland  cannot express the same sentiment without risking giving the  impression that he is trying to drive the EC opponents from the  party.    Real conflicts that are swept under the rug do not go away.  Instead new arenas and single-subject issues are produced that  can be fought without disturbing the public peace and quiet too  much.    That makes the power struggle more murky. The need for  political savvy and experience increases. At this point it would  be difficult to say which of the parties has the better tactical  skills.</p>

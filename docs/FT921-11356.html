			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Shutdown costs drive Dow Chemical Dollars 94m into red DOW CHEMICAL, the second biggest US company, has announced a Dollars 94m loss in the fourth quarter of 1991, compared with a Dollars 273m net profit last year. The result again reflects the depressed state of the US chemicals industry. The company's poor showing comes in the wake of this week's disclosures of a Dollars 240m fourth-quarter loss at Du Pont, and a Dollars 63m loss in the quarter at Union Carbide. Dow attributed the fourth-quarter loss to the slowdown in the global economy, weak industry fundamentals, and a Dollars 370m pre-tax charge related to plant shutdowns and asset write-offs. Revenues for the fourth quarter were 11.3 per cent lower at Dollars 4.6bn. For the whole of 1991, Dow's net profit declined by 32 per cent, to Dollars 935m, on revenues down by 5 per cent, to Dollars 18.8bn. Mr Frank Popoff, Dow Chemical's chief executive, acknowledged the fourth-quarter loss 'ends a very disappointing year in which pricing was our major challenge and accounted for about 90 per cent of the profit reduction we experienced'. Mr Popoff estimated that lower prices reduced profits by about Dollars 800m in 1991. Dow's chemicals and performance products division suffered a 65 per cent slump in its 1991 profit, to Dollars 276m, after special charges relating to the shutdown of chlor-alkali and derivative plants. Sales in the division declined by 11 per cent. The group's plastic products division also had lower sales and profits compared with 1990, with the latter 50 per cent down year-on-year, to Dollars 491m. The company said the high-volume thermoplastics, including polyethylene and polystyrene, accounted for more than 75 per cent of the drop in sales and earnings. Dow said its hydrocarbons and energy division suffered a Dollars 230m loss in 1991, mainly because of special charges related to asset writedowns. The consumer specialties division - which generated 57 per cent of Dow's total operating income of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991 - had an operating profit 16 per cent higher at Dollars 962m. Mr Popoff said he expected a resumption of growth during 1992 and a return to 'positive earnings momentum' in the second half of the year, when the world economy was expected to improve. On Wall Street, where the decline in chemicals sector earnings has been discounted by investors, Dow Chemical's share price was marked Dollars 1 3/8 higher to Dollars 54 3/8 .</p>

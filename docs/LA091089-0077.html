			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEEP IT SIMPLE;  </P> <P> CUT THE LEGALESE, SAY IT STRAIGHT IN PLAIN ENGLISH, BAR TELLS LAWYERS  </P> <P> In 1596, an English chancellor decided he had had it with lawyers' wordiness.  </P> <P> Gazing at a document filed in his court, the chancellor ordered a hole cut  through the center of the thing, all 120 pages of it.  </P> <P> Next, he directed that the lawyer who wrote it have his head stuffed through  the hole. The offender was then led around, to be exhibited to all those  attending court.  </P> <P> Four centuries later, the State Bar of California is trying a different  approach.  </P> <P> Led by a San Diego attorney, the Bar's Board of Governors recently passed a  resolution urging its 117,000 members to "promote and foster" the use of plain  English. The resolution was prompted by a 1987 Bar survey in which 90% of the  public and 91% of the lawyers responding said there was a need for simpler  legal documents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guidelines Ordered  </P> <P> The board voted to urge lawyers to simplify forms and language used in the  practice of law. It also directed the Bar staff to develop "simple-language  guidelines" for communicating with the public and for helping lawyers  communicate with clients.  </P> <P> "What I've discovered since we passed the thing is that there's a ton of  interest," said San Diego lawyer John Seitman, a member of the Bar board who  led the drive to pass the measure.  </P> <P> "That tells me there's a problem we're addressing," Seitman said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unprecedented Interest  </P> <P> The Bar's action -- the governors took a first step by dropping the word hereby  from the resolution -- comes as lawyers across the nation are demonstrating an  unprecedented interest in learning to write clearly and concisely.  </P> <P> Lawyers are being turned away at the doors of special writing workshops and  lectures. Legal journals regularly offer articles sharing writing tips. Books  on the topic abound.  </P> <P> "I think the topic is hot," said Steven Stark, who teaches writing at Harvard  Law School. "If you go into any legal bookstore, there's a dozen books on the  thing. 'Better Writing in 30 Days,' that sort of idea."  </P> <P> Stark teaches occasional courses through the Practicing Law Institute in  Manhattan, a leading continuing-education clearinghouse for lawyers. At a  seminar last month in New York, the room held 60 people. "We filled it up with  60 and we had to turn people away," said Eileen Shapiro, an institute staff  member.  </P> <P> Joel F. Henning is a Chicago lawyer whose firm, Hildebrandt Inc., offers  writing courses to lawyers at private firms and at government offices.  "Business in the legal-writing field is booming," he said.  </P> <P> The seminars put on by Henning's firm run for three or six weeks at $2,500 per  session, so a six-week seminar costs $15,000. Among Henning's clients are the  Bank of America's legal departments in Los Angeles and San Francisco, IBM's  legal department and the Department of Justice.  </P> <P> The notion that the seminars and the books try to get across is that lawyers  should write in a simple and straightforward manner.  </P> <P> After all, not even a lawyer says at dinner-table conversation:"Please pass the  green beans. Said green beans are excellent." But many lawyers feel compelled  to write their briefs with extra words they think lend precision, said Richard  C. Wydick, a law professor at UC Davis. Wydick's book, "Plain English for  Lawyers," includes that example and the story of the hapless English lawyer of  four centuries ago.  </P> <P> That hoped-for precision, however, is usually illusory, said David Mellinkoff,  professor emeritus at UCLA Law School and the dean of legal-writing  specialists.  </P> <P> "If you ask most lawyers or judges why they write the way they do, they'll tell  you it's because ordinary English is imprecise," Mellinkoff said. " 'If you  write it . . . according to the language of the law, it might not look pretty,  but it is precise and will be understood by lawyers and judges years from now  and so forth.' Most of that is hogwash."  </P> <P> A "small core" of legal terms -- such as hearsay or plaintiff -- assuredly have  their place because they are precise, Mellinkoff said.  </P> <P> "But most of the language of the law is not precise and most of the language of  the law does not have to be repeated and repeated and repeated in order to make  legal documents and legal writing precise and clear," Mellinkoff said.  </P> <P> The trend toward the use of "plain English" in lawyers' private practice is  about 10 years behind the movement toward simple language in other areas of the  law.  </P> <P> The broader movement itself perhaps can be traced back to 1963, when Mellinkoff  published his first book on the subject, "The Language of the Law."  </P> <P> Previously, there had been occasional attention paid to the topic -- in 1939,  for instance, a Yale law professor put out a book called "Woe Unto You,  Lawyers!" complaining of lawyers' "dreary double-talk" -- but Mellinkoff  contends that his book "gave courage to lawyers who wanted to make a change."  </P> <P> Wydick published his work in 1978. It since has "outsold any law book ever  published in the United States," more than 230,000 copies, said Keith Sipe,  president of the Carolina Academic Press, the Durham, N.C., publisher.  </P> <P> About the same time Wydick's book hit print, many federal regulations, at  then-President Jimmy Carter's urging, were simplified. And many states adopted  laws requiring clarity in consumer documents.  </P> <P> California did not go that far. The Legislature did, however, pass a law  ordering state agencies producing regulations to write those after Jan. 1,  1983, in "plain, straightforward language."  </P> <P> Many law schools also began offering legal-writing courses. Most "good law  schools" now offer a course "designed to teach, among other things, the plain  English style," Wydick said.  </P> <P> But seeing practical results is a long process, Mellinkoff said. And there's a  vicious cycle at work, he said.  </P> <P> Too often, school administrators don't accord writing courses the importance  given to core courses, Mellinkoff said. Younger instructors, instead of a  tenured professor, often teach the course, he said.  </P> <P> Then there are the materials that students must read in those core courses,  primarily old appellate cases, riddled with legalisms, Mellinkoff said.  </P> <P> After reading all those cases, students during exams "don't get graded for bad  writing," said Tom Goldstein, a lawyer and the dean of the graduate journalism  school at UC Berkeley. They "get graded for thinking. There's no incentive."  </P> <P> Simplicity is "the message that has to be gotten across," Goldstein said. "So  the State Bar saying this, fine. They should say it, they should repeat it."  But real change will only come from the schools and firms, he said.  </P> <P> That change is inevitable, said Robert Benson, a professor at Loyola Law School  in Los Angeles. But he conceded that he is an optimist.  </P> <P> In 1987, Benson surveyed appellate judges in Los Angeles, as well as their  clerks, showing them briefs written in plain English and in "gobbledygook."  </P> <P> The judges and clerks far preferred the simpler briefs, Benson said, saying it  was much more persuasive and "must have been written by lawyers from  prestigious law firms. On the other hand, the gobbledygook must have been  written by lawyers with low prestige.  </P> <P> "That's what's going to get them," Benson said. "These people don't want to be  thought of as shlocky. And that's what legalese is: shlocky."  </P></p>

B. Mikheyev, S. A. Kulyukhin, and A. N. </F> Kamenskaya; UDC 621.039.337+546.799]    [Abstract] Previous work on the possibility of obtaining  M[.sub]22[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] actinoid clusters showed that all  bivalent actinoids having an electron configuration of [f[.sup]n-  1[/]d[.sup]1[/]][.sup]2+[/] are capable of co-  crystallization with Gd[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/], and the  possibility of individual actinoid cluster synthesis was  demonstrated. However, attempts of such synthesis by classical  means proved unsuccessful. Other attempts by electrochemical  means also proved unsuccessful. In the present work, an attempt  of An[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]3[/] cluster synthesis (where An =  Th, U, and Np) from melts resulted in reduction to the metallic  actinoid, and it was concluded that actinoid cluster synthesis  from melts is not possible by this method.

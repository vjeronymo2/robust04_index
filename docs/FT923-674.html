			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / French prison officers strike ends: Paris rescinds suspension notices FRANCE'S prison officers are set to return to work today after the French government's offer of concessions yesterday aimed at ending their fortnight-long industrial dispute. The Justice Ministry has succumbed to pressure to rescind the suspension notices against striking warders, the officers return to work. The dispute has crippled France's jails since the murder two weeks ago of a warder at Clairvaux during a shoot-out in which seven prisoners escaped. The Clairvaux shooting, the latest in a series of violent incidents in the over-crowded prison system, sparked demands from officers for more staff and better protection against dangerous inmates. Mr Michel Vauzelle, justice minister, immediately promised to review staffing levels. But early last week, when the warders' unions broke off negotiations, he exercised his right to suspend striking officers, who as public servants have no right to stop work. The dispute has weakened since its peak when it affected more than 140 of France's 182 jails. However, riot police and military squads are still in place at a number of prisons. There have also been intermittent go-slows and demonstrations at jails where staff have already returned to work. Throughout the protest the government has been embarrassed by television footage of inmates rioting at strike-bound jails. Yesterday's offer to scrap the suspensions has persuaded most of the striking officers to return to work. Warders at Clairvaux will go back on Monday. The main prison unions, including Force Ouvriere, have agreed to resume negotiations over long term staffing arrangements. However, one union, the UGSP-CGT, is still threatening to boycott the talks. The French government has agreed to reform its controversial new driving licence system which sparked the bitter lorry drivers dispute that caused chaos on France's roads this summer. Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, transport minister, yesterday confirmed that the government intended to implement most of the recommendations of the Roche Commission, which was set up to review the licence system. The Roche proposals favour retaining the government's original concept whereby drivers forfeit points from their licences for offences, but makes the system more flexible by awarding between six and 12 points to each licence with drivers losing one to four points depending on the severity of the offence.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Camacho rules himself out of presidential race, again Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in the rebellious state of Chiapas, yesterday took himself out of the presidential race - yet again. A former mayor of Mexico City, and foreign minister, Mr Camacho had been tipped as a possible candidate of the ruling party to replace Mr Colosio. But in a brief statement Mr Camacho said: 'Two days ago I said I was not looking to be president of the republic. After the events of this lamentable crime I reiterate that I do not aspire to the presidency.' Mr Camacho has held three cabinet positions over eight years, and is one of the best known politicians in the country. As peace envoy in the state of Chiapas, he successfully negotiated a preliminary agreement with rebels that won him national popularity. Mr Camacho's announcement was the second time this week he has had to rule himself out of presidential contention. On Tuesday Mr Camacho made a similar declaration after speculation over a potential presidential bid from the opposition had caused the stock market and peso to weaken and appeared to be complicating his peace efforts in the state of Chiapas. Mr Camacho said he took the decision for the unity of the country. Mr Camacho has made a large number of enemies in the ruling party during his career, and his recent flirtation with an independent candidacy alienated him from the mainstream of the Institutional Revolutionary party, and especially supporters of Mr Colosio. Even if President Salinas had wanted to nominate Mr Camacho, his candidacy could have split the ruling party. Given Mr Camacho's poor relations with Mr Colosio, it may have been seen as a betrayal to the spirit of the late presidential candidate. Apart from being opposed by many in the ruling party, Mr Camacho is also, perhaps unfairly, mistrusted by many in the foreign and domestic investment community. His critics in the government say he opposed some of the economic reforms proposed by President Salinas. While Mr Camacho recently publicly committed himself to responsible fiscal and monetary policy, this did not fully allay suspicions in the market place. Mr Camacho may seek to play a central role in restoring political order to Mexico after the assassination of Mr Colosio. Of all members of the PRI, he has the best relations with the opposition, and enjoys their trust. It is expected that he will use his powers of persuasion to try and make the electoral process up to August as smooth and as trouble-free as possible. In the meantime Mr Camacho will seek to solve the conflict in Chiapas. It is not clear how the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas will react to the assassination of Mr Colosio, but the public outcry against violence will likely put considerable moral pressure on them and their opponents in Chiapas to settle their differences quickly.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown presses on electoral reform MR PADDY Ashdown last night used his biggest campaign rally, which attracted 1,500 people, to call for a mandate to reform Britain's political system. He warned that the Tories were 'playing on division and conflict'. Seeking to energise Liberal Democrat activists ahead of tomorrow's polling, Mr Ashdown said his party, 'can now give Britain the leadership it so desperately needs' and predicted widespread Liberal Democrat wins in the south-west, particularly Cornwall. However, his upbeat speech in St Austell, Cornwall, jarred with the private acknowledgment by Mr Ashdown's aides of the difficulties a hung parliament could cause the party. The Liberal Democrat leader refuses to call publicly for a hung parliament, which would offer a third party the first chance to influence the government for 15 years, but almost simultaneously says the chance to form a coalition government presents a historic opportunity to form a government based on consensus. Sir David Steel, former Liberal leader who helped forge the 1977-78 Lib/Lab pact, yesterday said that inflation had then fallen from 20 per cent to under 9 per cent while share prices rose the day the pact was announced, 'not because they liked the Lib/Lab pact but because they welcomed the stability'. However, colleagues of Mr Ashdown made clear that he was not looking for a repetition of 1977-78, which failed to bring significant gains for the Liberals except in delaying a general election. He prefers 'partnership' government, including ministerial posts for Liberal Democrats. Sir David also rebuffed reports that he might not vote against a Labour minority government's Queen's Speech if it included Scottish devolution but not PR.</p>

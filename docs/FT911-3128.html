			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Guy's will cut staff in effort to reduce costs GUY'S, ONE of the most famous hospitals to become a self-governing trust under this month's health reforms, plans to shed staff throughout its organisation. The hospital's managers are also mounting a review of all clinical activities over the next three months, which may lead to withdrawals of some services to patients. Trust hospital managers have wide freedom to run their own affairs. Yesterday's developments at Guy's, coming less than a month after the introduction of the reforms, threaten to revive fears that the changes will force commercial values on the National Health Service - a view ministers have been anxious to dispel. Health service union leaders say the actions of the trust management at Guy's, in south London, confirm fears that self-governing hospitals will become more like private ones. Mr Peter Griffiths, Guy's chief executive and until recently deputy chief executive of the government's NHS management board, told employees yesterday that the trust 'must have fewer staff this year'. The reductions would be made 'at all levels, where possible by early retirement, redeployment and leaving vacancies unfilled'. The management says it will 'attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies'. Staff costs form a much higher proportion of total expenditure in hospitals than in many commercial organisations. Nearly Pounds 90m of the trust's Pounds 128m budget is spent on staff costs at Guy's, its sister hospital at Lewisham and associated services. The trust inherited debts of Pounds 6.8m and Mr Griffiths told staff the first priority was to get into good financial shape. It was 'destructive of morale and standards' to be lurching from one crisis to another. 'We want to get to the point as quickly as possible where we pay staff properly and improve working conditions, but that can only happen when our finances are in shape.' The review of Guy's clinical services will examine efficiency, relevance to the needs of the local population and the views of general practitioners and health authorities. Mr Griffiths said there was no point in supporting a service that was not best for patients simply because it had always been provided. If contracts were not won there would be no future for the trust. There was no longer a fallback position of money appearing every year regardless of how many patients were treated. Services that had low patient satisfaction levels would find that 'resources will not be allocated to them'. Mr Hector MacKenzie, general secretary of the health union Cohse, said: 'Guy's is now behaving exactly like a private hospital, dumping patients and services which are not profitable.' Part of the hospital's difficulty, he said, was the amount of debts that had been built up from previous years of chronic underfunding.</p>

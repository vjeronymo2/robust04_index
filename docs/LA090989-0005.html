			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S PLAN TO FIGHT DRUGS  </P> <P> I admire President Bush for wanting to keep his word to the American people in  regards to not raising new taxes, but never has a President been given the  opportunity to "break" his word and find the majority of the people ready to  say "we back your retraction." Now having declared war on drugs, he must put  aside his promise or that war will be lost. Who is paying the $7.9 billion  inadequate budget he now proposes? The taxpayer!  </P> <P> The taxpayer wants to win this war and would rather win without having other  vital domestic programs cut to finance it. Does President Bush honestly believe  we want the addicts, pushers and drug lords to continue destroying our nation  while he wrings his hands in frustration, telling us, "I must keep my word at  all costs?" This is war!  </P> <P> When he finds the budget he has proposed is woefully inadequate, America may  have to admit we have lost another war.  </P> <P> Come on, Mr. President, ask us for permission to break your promise. You will  get a resounding cry of support -- provided the tax monies are used effectively  against what is proving to be the great threat to America at this time --  drugs!  </P> <P> Let's not lose this one!  </P> <P> ALLAN BENJAMIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

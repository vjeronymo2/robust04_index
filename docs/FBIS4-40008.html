			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 10 June TASS -- "The halt of the Chernobyl  nuclear power plant will not change the general situation,  bearing in mind the operation of Chernobyl-type reactors at  other power plants of the Dnieper River basin near the Ukrainian  borders. Nobody is going to halt them," says a report of the  Ukrainian Government circulated here today in response to the  campaign of the Greenpeace international non-governmental  ecological organization which demands an immediate halt of the  Chernobyl plant.    In the opinion of the Ukrainian Government, this problem  should have a comprehensive solution. Nuclear reactors have  been given preference in development of power engineering over  the past decades. Ukraine has practically not modernized  thermal power plants and power plants of other types. The  majority of them now have worked-out technical resources and  equipment which require immediate modernization and the  introduction of modern ecological technologies of burning.  Thus, the Ukrainian thermal power engineering will not  compensate the halt of the nuclear power plant which counts for  almost 10 per cent of electricity production capacities.    The government is doing much to raise the plant's safety.  There are no deviations in its work. Two units are working in  the permitted capacity regime. The state of the "shelter"  facility over the damaged unit, as well as of the whole plant is  under permanent control of the State Committee for Supervision  over Nuclear Safety.    "The complete halt of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will  turn it into the largest energy consumer from a major energy  producer. Some 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity will be  needed to keep the technical state of the plant every year, not  to mention huge state allocations," says the document. One  should also not forget about social problems.    One can understand the demands to immediately halt the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant. "However, this problem can have  a constructive solution only through the modernization of the  whole energy complex, which Ukraine will not be able to do  without international assistance.    "The intention of the G7 to discuss assistance to the  Ukrainian power engineering, including the safety of its nuclear  power engineering and the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant, is a great hope.    "There are no doubts that all problems related to the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be further solved with due  account of the requirements of population safety and  environmental protection," says the report.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: UK stifles disappointment at German cut THE British government hinted yesterday that a cut in interest rates had moved closer, as it put on a brave face in response to what is seen as a disappointingly small reduction in German rates. With several European countries following the Bundesbank's lead and lowering their rates, Downing Street said the cut had 'probably brought forward the time when British interest rates will move'. While admitting the German move might be 'a one-off', officials sought to portray it as the start of a trend towards lower interest rates throughout Europe and said there had been 'a significant change of mood'. But they reiterated Prime Minister John Major's uncompromising message last week that he would not allow sterling's value in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism to be undermined. British interest rates would be set with a view to 'maintaining our position in the ERM,' they said. The probability of a realignment of the pound's ERM parity was 'zero'. Privately, officials suggested that the British government had succeeded in undermining the consensus view held in the markets a few weeks ago that the next move in British interest rates would be up. The 0.25 percentage point cut in Germany's trend-setting Lombard rate was criticised as too small by British MPs. Mr John Carlisle, a Tory Euro-sceptic, described it as 'derisory'. 'It shows that we should be free of the ERM and able to set our own levels and float the pound in the currency markets,' he said. Mr John Townend, outspoken chairman of the influential Tory backbench finance committee, said the size of the reduction was 'very disappointing'. He said he was 'more than ever convinced' that the move had been motivated by the need to get a Yes vote in the French referendum. For the Labour party, Mr Alistair Darling, a shadow Treasury spokesman, said the cut was 'a lot less than people hoped'. He urged Britain and other European countries to 'reduce interest rates to try and stimulate the economy and to bring back confidence'. Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow heritage secretary who is also an outspoken critic of official Labour policy over Maastricht and the pound, said the reduction was 'so small it can only be regarded as a gesture'. A wider realignment of ERM currencies involving sterling was still 'desirable'. This view was refuted by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who said he did not regard devaluation as the best way of bringing British interest rates down. In Harrogate, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also described the move as 'disappointing'. He urged the government to 'grit its teeth' and to permit a reduction in UK rates only when sustainable in the longer term. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, called the cut as 'small but welcome'. 'We have always argued that there was a great strength in the co-ordination of the Exchange Rate Mechanism,' he said. Downing Street sought to counter this disappointment by pointing out that yesterday's move represented the first cut in German interest rates for five years and arguing that any reduction, however small, was 'significant'. It said the move showed 'the benefits of international co-operation' and argued that hopes of anything other than a 'modest' cut were unrealistic. The weekend's developments had also been 'useful' in dispelling the notion that sterling would have to be devalued at the same time as the lira. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, had been involved in discussions to formulate a strategy for addressing the crisis in the European Monetary System but the exact size of the interest rate cut had been determined within the Bundesbank.</p>

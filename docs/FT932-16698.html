			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Valued words snatched from fire and flood AFTER the Chinese found 2,000 years ago that tree bark, rags and fishing nets could be macerated into a new form of writing material, paper became a staple of civilisation. Even the electronic office has failed to consign paper to the waste bin as a tool for carrying information. Paper, however, is a vulnerable material. Chuck a piece in the dustbin by mistake or feed the wrong file through the shredder and it is lost, unless there is a spare copy. For many organisations, a big risk is deterioration of documents through water damage from leaking pipes, mould, smoke and charring from fire. 'Britain has some of the highest rates of arson attacks on libraries in the world,' says Georgine Thorburn. Thorburn has unearthed a tiny but very profitable business niche. Deterioration does not necessarily mean ruination. Her company, Document SOS, specialises in paper salvage and conservation, using chemicals and special drying techniques to remove soot, mud, even sewage from documents vital enough for organisations to pay to save them. 'There has really been nobody handling documents and there was therefore a huge void in the market,' she says. Georgine completed a four-year BA degree course in paper conservation in 1987 and, three years ago, set up Document SOS with the help of Midland Bank's small business advisory service and the London Enterprise Agency. In its first full year it took contracts worth Pounds 100,000 and its second year turnover was between Pounds 195,000 and Pounds 210,000. On this, it makes a healthy pre-tax profit of about 25 per cent, according to the company's accountants. A quarter of its turnover comes from providing companies with disaster prevention reports on their document storage. Document SOS operates from small rented premises in a London mews. It can do this because all its salvage and restoration work is done on site. There are just four permanent staff. Professional conservators are brought in as freelancers for jobs which usually last from a day to a few weeks and are paid about Pounds 300 a week. Last year the company handled 15 to 20 large contracts and also performed a range of tiny ones. At present it is repairing damage to a book for a fee of Pounds 43. Disaster audits in which the company assesses how a client can minimise the risk of document damage cost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 3,000. Georgine says the skills of paper salvage were partly born out of the 1966 river flood in Florence. The waters of the Arno caused tremendous harm to many treasures. Some of the people involved in restoration work there became tutors at Camberwell School of Art where Georgine took her degree. Fortunately for Georgine, hardly any of her fellow students decided to set up a salvage business. Georgine says the company does no advertising. It has told all the UK's loss adjusters, the people who investigate insurance claims, about its services. Much of the company's work is from this source. 'Most of our work comes from disasters like fires and you never know when the next one will happen. We might have five in a row and then may be five months with nothing substantial.' Document SOS's first contracts included London's Hammersmith hospital where fire damaged research books and files and a school in Barnet where smoke harmed books and papers in the head teacher's office. Customers include architects and computer companies where original plans and operating manuals have been damaged by fire or water, and libraries, often in schools, keen to save books harmed in arson attacks. 'One of the most difficult things is to really set fire to a book but the little blighters think it is easy,' says Georgine referring to the youngsters who are often the perpetrators of such attacks. The covers are burnt but most of the pages are only blackened round the edges. The company's contracts also included salvage work after the Baltic Exchange bomb attack and the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion. In that case, documents were under water for three months. 'Water damage is the worst, the nastiest scenario being a burst river bank with silt, sand and mud.' Georgine says. 'If that is not treated properly you will also get mould. That could develop in as little as 12 hours. Moisture and stagnant air alone can create it and it simply feeds off the cellulose in the paper. With a fire, the seat of it can be quite small and up to 98 per cent of the damage can come from smoke, which is very acidic and incredibly corrosive. Handling the paper and laying just the oil from your fingers on soot can make it much worse.' A lot of damaged paper is beyond restoration. But Georgine demonstrates how fully-blackened smoke-damaged material with no writing visible can be restored so that every line is readable. She says that before restoration starts, the conservator usually assesses the type of ink on the paper, the paper's 'loading' - the chalk filling in between the fibre - and the type of heat-sensitive coatings it uses. Georgine's techniques include chemically impregnated sponges and deodorisers for smoke damage, fungicides and controlled drying for water damage. Preventing charred paper from disintegrating involves consolidating it with synthetic resin and polyvinyl acetate. The equipment includes dehumidifiers, disinfected gloves and, in bad post-fire conditions, respirators. Georgine wants to extend her business into continental Europe and has representatives in Switzerland and Spain. Though she says there are few direct rivals in her business, general industrial cleaning companies are getting in on the act. She questions the techniques they offer - which include freeze drying which she says can worsen the damage - but these companies are proving irksome competitors.

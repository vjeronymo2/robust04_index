			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Power companies near coal accord REGIONAL electricity chiefs say they are close to successfully concluding with generators the heads-of-agreement negotiations that will underpin long-term contracts to buy British coal. Some believe they can complete the talks by the end of next week, although they say nothing is likely to be signed before the government publishes its white paper on energy, probably next month. Rumours about the progress of the talks helped to raise the price of most electricity shares yesterday, particularly National Power and PowerGen, the generators. The heads-of-agreement talks are being held between 11 of the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) of England and Wales and each of the two generators. They will provide the basis for the bilateral agreements between regional companies and generators by which the Recs will buy electricity generated from British coal. Although the heads of agreement are fairly detailed, covering such issues as risk-sharing in the event of unforeseen circumstances, they would leave individual companies to negotiate price and volumes. Tariffs for electricity supply, based on the contract prices, are due to be in place from the beginning of April and the companies would aim to publish them a month earlier. The talks assume that deals will last five years in spite of suggestions by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, that a one-year deal might be preferable. Mr Duncan Ross, chairman of Southern Electric, said the heads-of-agreement talks would help to clear the air for bilateral talks. The regional companies would want any deals cleared by Offer, the regulator, before signing them. National Power said progress had been made in the talks but it was too early to say when they could be concluded. Evidence from 327 individuals and organisations had been received at the end of last week by the Department of Trade and Industry as part of its coal review, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister said yesterday.

Santini will be remaining chief executive and chairman of Sky Sites, the international airports advertising group within the AHM orbit. Santini has been with the group since 1980, when he joined Avenir-AHM as a product manager, later becoming head of research. OCuilleanain, 38, first worked for Burroughs Computers (now Unisys) as a trainee sales and marketing executive, joining David Allen in 1982, and becoming its managing director in 1983. He is replaced at David Allen by Roisin O'Boyle, 34, who after university first worked for Ireland's Industrial Development Authority. She later moved to Foir Teoranta, an Irish state bank set up to subsidise ailing private sector companies. She joined David Allen in 1992 as sales and marketing director.</p>

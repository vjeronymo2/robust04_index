			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Tokyo begins improving ties with Hanoi JAPAN HAS taken an important step towards improving relations with Vietnam by announcing a government mission to Hanoi to negotiate the repayment of loans that have not been serviced for over a decade. The Japanese government regards the visit this weekend as a sign that it is prepared to develop a foreign policy independent of Washington. The US is unwilling to lift an embargo on Vietnam that has limited the country's access to foreign aid and investment. Mr Michio Watanabe, Japan's foreign minister, indicated that the dispatch of the 10-member delegation, including representatives of the Trade Ministry, the Finance Ministry, and the Economic Planning Agency, was likely to be followed by another mission which will assess projects for possible financial assistance. While Japan is keen to develop a stronger political presence in Vietnam and Cambodia, a Foreign Ministry official indicated that Washington had been consulted before taking the decision to send the delegation. The official said the US did not oppose a 'step by step' improvement in ties between Tokyo and Hanoi. The delegation, which will spend nine days in Vietnam, is to negotiate the settlement of arrears on Japanese government loans totalling Y28bn (Pounds 120m). Repayments were stopped after Japan and other countries suspended economic aid to Vietnam after its invasion of Cambodia in late 1978. An expected settlement of the debt question and the likelihood of government assistance resuming in the near future will encourage Japanese companies to increase their exposure in Vietnam. Until now, they have been wary of large investments for fear of a negative reaction in the US, where the issue of Vietnam war servicemen missing in action remains sensitive. Japanese investment in Vietnam has accounted for about 8.6 per cent of the total Dollars 1.06bn (Pounds 580m) pledged by foreign partners, while Taiwanese investment is about 14 per cent of the total and French capital 13.8 per cent. Mr Watanabe, who has taken a personal interest in improving relations with Vietnam, said that fresh Japanese government money could begin flowing into the country within a year. New lending by the World Bank and other agencies is likely to follow the lifting of the US embargo.</p>

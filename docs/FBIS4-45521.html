			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "CMI" newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper met with Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff and President Gaviria today.  Meanwhile, Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana has called a  news conference for tomorrow.    The contacts to finance the political campaigns were made  between 7 and 11 June, a few days before the runoff elections.  In the recordings, journalist Alberto Giraldo talks with Miguel  Rodriguez Orejuela [Cali Cartel leader] and tells him about the  need for funds to cover expenses at the end of the campaigns.  They mention five billion pesos. Here are excerpts of three of  the six recordings. The others cannot be disclosed for legal  reasons. [begin recording]    Giraldo: The man urgently needs money.    Rodriguez: Who is the man? Eduardo?    Giraldo: Yes, he asked me to act as emissary.    Rodriguez: Fine.    Giraldo: Yes, yes.    Rodriguez: Is he the same one I know?    Giraldo: Yes, yes, yes.    Rodriguez: There are a few little problems here.    Giraldo: Oh?    Rodriguez: Because they want everything,  everything, everything, everything, everything, everything.  There are five points there that are basic commands, right?    Giraldo: Yes.    Rodriguez: Another thing...    Giraldo, interrupting: How do you see things in  the [word indistinct]?    Rodriguez: I am in your hands. It sounds funny,  doesn't it?    Giraldo: Then why is Medina saying that Santo  Domingo or whatever they want to give him?    Rodriguez: No [words indistinct]    Giraldo: That is what he told us that day. I  heard him, but his saint wants the same length and width. They  have a limit and [words indistinct] the truth is they need five  billion. They already have two billion; they need three billion  more.    Rodriguez: Oh.    Giraldo: They are there.    Rodriguez: Yes?    Giraldo: Yes [words indistinct]. [end recording]    After confirming that they were there, Giraldo tells  Rodriguez Orejuela in another conversation that he is upset  about articles in LA PRENSA that mentioned him as spokesman of  the Cali Cartel. Rodriguez Orejuela then tells him not to worry  as the other campaign had reportedly received $2.5 million from  the so-called Northern Valle Cartel.    The recordings also mention money presumably received by  General Miguel Maza Marquez.    [Begin recording]    Giraldo: I talked to Maza.    Rodriguez: Yes?    Giraldo: He [words indistinct] after what I told  him, but I hope he gives it to me in cash.    Rodriguez: [Words indistinct]    Giraldo: I hope he gives it to me in cash, to  deliver it tomorrow.    Rodriguez: [Words indistinct]    Giraldo: Good. Okay. [end recording]    The two people speaking mentioned a Pastrana supporter in  the  coffee producing areas. Before starting the second  conversation, one of them warns the other of the risk that their  call could be intercepted, to which the other replies: Don't  worry, brother, these phones are safe.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Mar (EFE) -- The Argentine and  Brazilian foreign ministers, Celso Amorim and Guido Di Tella  respectively, signed an agreement on 10 March on the need for  regular meetings between the two countries aimed at  strengthening their bilateral relations and stimulating the  exchange of ideas and opinions.    Di Tella said that the agreement was signed after the two  countries realized that Argentine-Brazilian bilateral relations  were becoming too centered around Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], that is, on talks centered around Mercosur concerns,  while important bilateral aspects were being left aside.    The agreement was discussed last night, following a closed  door meeting between representatives of the two countries to  analyze Brazil's purchase of subsidized Canadian wheat.    Di Tella and Amorim also discussed the Argentine desire to  have an option to join NAFTA, which is made up of the United  States, Canada, and Mexico, without abandoning Mercosur.    The agreement establishes that the two countries' presidents  will meet once a year, while representatives of all ministries  and the foreign relations vice ministers will meet every three  or four months.    Such meetings will create "ad hoc" working groups to discuss  and follow specific matters.    Di Tella and Amorim announced the details of the agreement  today, shortly before their meeting with the other Mercosur  member countries' foreign and economy ministers. Mercosur is  made up of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.</p>

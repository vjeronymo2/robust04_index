			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Beige Book points to uneven growth US economic activity continued to expand over the summer, though unevenly, according to two government reports released yesterday. The Beige Book, the survey by Federal Reserve Districts of regional economic activity, said: 'Regions that have been lagging are generally said to be doing better, while most of the stronger areas saw growth plateau.' US Commerce Department advance monthly retail sales figures showing a 0.8 per cent rise in August, up 7 per cent on August 1993. The Beige Book, prepared for use at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 27, follows the August 3 report which showed economic activity growing at a solid pace in most parts of the country. The FOMC meeting of August 16 raised interest rates by half a percentage point. The expansion in consumer spending is seen as 'healthy albeit decelerating', the report said yesterday.</p>

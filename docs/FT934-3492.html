			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Belgian, Danish rate cuts The continued strength of their currencies allowed Belgium and Denmark to reduce interest rates yesterday, writes Conner Middelmann. The Belgian National Bank cut its key central rate by 50 basis points to 7.50 per cent and its end-of-day rate by 50 basis points to 9.20 per cent. The Danish central bank at its latest open market operation lowered its 14-day certificates of deposit rate to 7 per cent, from 7.25 per cent in the previous two-week offer. Both currencies held up well after the rate cuts, with the Danish krone firming slightly and the Belgian franc ending little changed. The krone finished at DKr3.933 to the D-Mark, up from Monday's DKr3.934 close. The Belgian franc ended at BFr20.83 per D-Mark, barely altered from BFr20.82 late on Monday. Further Belgian rate cuts are likely to continue underpinning the currency, as they will boost the flagging economy and alleviate the interest burden on Belgium's massive budget deficits, analysts said. 'Part of the vicious circle has been that a substantial part of the budget deficit is due to high interest payments,' noted Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. 'If they continue getting rates down, that will have a beneficial impact on the budget deficit, thus restoring market confidence.' The Italian currency continued to rise on widespread relief that the worst is over on the political front. The lira began to rally after Sunday's municipal elections, where left-wing coalitions swept to power in several major cities at the expense of right-wing parties. It is also supported by hopes that the 1994 budget, which was passed last week by the budget committee of the lower house, will be approved before the end of the year. The lira opened around L985 against the D-Mark and rose as high as L981.25 during the session. It closed at L983.1, up from Monday's finish of L989.8. In spite of its recent recovery, 'the lira still looks cheap on fundamental grounds', said Mr Andre de Silva, market strategist at PaineWebber International. 'Whenever the lira has fallen below L1,000 against the D-Mark, buyers have emerged and, from a risk-reward perspective, we are a lot more comfortable in running open lira positions than we are the French equivalent,' Mr de Silva added. The lira's strength gave a small lift to the Iberian currencies, although trade in all three was thin ahead of today's national holiday in Spain and Italy. The Spanish peseta rose to Pta81.93 against the D-Mark, from Pta82.33 at Monday's close. The Portuguese escudo ended at Es101.9, up from Es102.0 on Monday. The French franc drifted lower through the day on concerns over the ongoing Gatt world trade talks and data showing a 34.8 per cent increase in French corporate bankruptcies in October. After breaking key support at FFr3.4360 against the D-Mark, the franc slipped as low as FFr3.444. It finished at FFr3.440, down from FFr3.434 at Monday's close. Sterling shed more than a pfennig against the D-Mark, largely on profit-taking amid thin trading conditions. However, some pointed out that recent rate cut speculation was also weighing on the currency. The pound ended at DM2.5450, down from DM2.5575 at Monday's close. Market opinion is about evenly split over the likelihood of another 1/2 percentage point base rate reduction before Christmas, said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. He listed three factors favouring a near-term rate cut: 'The Budget's gone down very well in all markets, the fiscal tightening was at least as large as the Bank of England wanted, and most of Europe has cut rates.' However, he feels next Wednesday's November inflation numbers will clinch the decision on UK rates. 'If the RPI is unchanged at 2.8 per cent or below, the market will be screaming for a rate cut.' But until the RPI release, the pound is likely to drift in a narrow range, traders said. In the money market, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.7bn, which it later revised downwards to Pounds 1.25bn. At its morning operation it purchased Pounds 17m of band 1 bills and Pounds 20m of band 2 bills at 5 3/8 per cent. In a later round it bought a total of Pounds 196bn of band 1 and 2 bills at 5 3/8 per cent, and provided late assistance of around Pounds 755m. The D-Mark firmed slightly when the Bundesbank revised its October M3 money supply growth numbers to 6.9 per cent, from the provisional 6.8 per cent rate released some two weeks ago. 'The numbers were a touch disappointing - a lot of people had expected a downward revision,' said IBJ's Mr Hannah. M3 growth remains above the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. The German central bank will today allocate another round of 14-day repos at a fixed 6 per cent - the first of five fixed-rate repos at that rate. Some DM95bn in repos expire today and traders are calling for a small net liquidity injection. In late London trading the dollar tested key technical and psychological support at DM1.7000 but finished at DM1.7055, down only a touch from DM1.7060 at Monday's close. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.7032.  -------------------------------------------             Pound in New York  ------------------------------------------- Dec 7           Close      Prev. close Pounds spot    1.49301       1.5045 1 mth           1.4903       1.5020 3 mth           1.4861       1.4978 1 yr            1.4744       1.4864  -------------------------------------------</p>

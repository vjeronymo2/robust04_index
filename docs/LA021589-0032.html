			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PUNCHLESS CSUN WOMEN SETTLE FOR SPLIT  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge softball team split a nonconference double-header  against Cal Poly Pomona on Tuesday at Northridge, defeating the Lady Broncos,  3-0, in the first game before falling, 4-2 in the second.  </P> <P> Debbie Dickmann's two-hit pitching masked the lack of Northridge offense in the  opener, but when Lady Matador pitching failed early in the second game, the  Lady Matador bats were already in a deep slumber.  </P> <P> The Lady Broncos took a 1-0 lead in the second inning of the second game  against starting pitcher Kate Bennitt but most of their damage the next inning  against Christy Alves, who replaced Bennitt after a leadoff single in the  third.  </P> <P> Alves, a freshman from Burroughs High, recorded two quick outs but lost her  control, hitting a batter and walking two to force in a run. Heather Lindstrom  replaced Alves and walked home another run before Holly DeLuca singled in the  third run of the inning to give Pomona (1-1) a 4-0 lead.  </P> <P> Pomona's Lori Thompson had a shutout going until Northridge awoke in the  seventh. The Lady Matadors (2-4) got on the scoreboard when Lisa Hall scored on  a wild pitch.  </P> <P> Alves followed with a single that scored Erin McGuire to cut the Pomona lead to  4-2. Michelle Blaha singled and Lisa Erickson was hit by a pitch to load the  bases.  </P> <P> Bronco Coach Carol Sparks had seen enough. And so had the Matadors. Sparks  called in reliever Caryn Askey, who recorded the final out.  </P> <P> "We looked a bit inexperienced today," Sparks said. "We did some bad things,  but we did some things I'm proud of, too. In the second game we stayed cool  under fire."  </P> <P> In the first game, Dickmann struck out seven.  </P> <P> "Hey, what can I say. I had it going today," she said.  </P> <P> Erickson set up CSUN's first score with a leadoff single in the bottom of the  first inning.  </P> <P> The fleet-footed outfielder stole second and third, allowing Pam Smith to  collect her first run batted in of the season with a squeeze bunt.  </P> <P> Northridge increased the lead to 2-0 in the third when Anna Getherall singled,  advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on an an error. The Lady Matadors  scored their final run in the fourth when Hall doubled home catcher Char  Schmitt, who had reached third on a throwing error.  </P> <P> Erickson had two hits for the Lady Matadors, but the game belonged to Dickmann.  </P> <P> "I was throwing hard today today," she said.  </P> <P> Indeed, Dickmann (2-2) walked seven -- including DeLuca three times -- but was  close to unhittable, allowing only singles to Kathy Twisselman and Nicky Luce  in the fifth.  </P></p>

Security and stability are  necessary conditions for the continuation of the economic reform  and development programs. These programs have so far achieved  results that have drawn praise from several international  economic circles.    In his first meeting with the newly formed National  Democratic Party [NDP] General Secretariat, President Mubarak  asked the Secretariat to get in touch with other political  parties with a view to launching a national dialogue.    Following Mubarak's meeting with the NDP Secretariat,  Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif said that the Secretariat  has been in touch with all political parties. Al-Sharif said  that there are many points of agreement with those parties and  only a few of disagreement. This boosts the hope that the  national dialogue will produce constructive and positive results  that would have a beneficial effect on the country's future.    There is no doubt that this clear desire of the Egyptian  political parties [to hold a national dialogue] is a response to  the sincere call made by President Mubarak some time ago, in a  bid to serve the interests of the country and the nation.  President Mubarak called for that dialogue to be a fair and  honest one in which all parties, including the NDP, should rise  above their rivalries. President Mubarak promised that the  NDP's role, as the majority party, will be one of creating the  appropriate atmosphere for a successful national dialogue.    We have not the least doubt that we are all patriots,  seeking  to promote the general interest of our beloved country and  nation. Our profound commitment to democracy, reiterated by  President Mubarak, is an endeavor in which all of us should get  involved. Democracy is the wind that will bring country's ship  to safe shores. It is the only and best guarantee against  excesses of all sorts.    Democracy involves much more than rhetoric. Every one of us  should insist on democracy being upheld. We have to create the  right atmosphere for every citizen to exercise his  constitutional rights in such a way as to shore up the country's  national unity and ensure that anyone who is tempted to  jeopardize the nation's security and stability and undermine the  livelihood of the citizens is brought to justice.    It is our firm belief that the responsibility of protecting  the nation does not rest solely with the government, but is a  joint responsibility for both the people, who care for the  country's future prosperity, and the government.    A look at the circumstances through which the country and  nation are passing is enough to persuade us that our only  recourse is to correct our mistakes. This, of course, is easier  said than done. It involves a strong resolve and definite desire  to repair the damage that the evil hands have done to our  country's security and stability. The consequences of our  failure to do that could be grave.    Therefore, we affirm that the outcome of national dialogue  will lay the groundwork for national policies for many years to  come, during which the nation may look forward to an improvement  in their standards through the joint effort of the country's  political parties.</p>

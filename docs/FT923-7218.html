			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Danish bank may pass dividend UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second largest banking group, expects to pass the dividend for 1992 after making a substantial loss in the first half. The dividend last year was DKr10 per share, totalling DKr463m (Dollars 82m). The bank reported a DKr1.48bn first-half loss compared with a DKr728m profit in the same period last year and a loss for the whole of 1991 of DKr1.55bn. A substantial contribution to the first-half loss arose in the UK, where the bank's subsidiary, Unidanmark Holding, reported a DKr508m loss, reflecting provisions to cover falling property values. The bank will cut staff at the London arm from 202 people to about 115 in 1993. The London bank's status will be changed from a subsidiary to a branch of the Danish parent bank. Unidanmark parted company with its chief executive, Mr Steen Rasborg, earlier this month in anticipation of the poor first-half result. No replacement for Mr Rasborg has so far been announced. The bank's first-half result before provisions was down from DKr2.79bn last year to DKr1.18bn. The main factor was a swing in the adjustment for the value of its securities portfolio from a positive DKr1.43bn last year to a negative DKr314m this year. Provisions climbed to DKr2.44bn from DKr2.00bn last year. The bank's costs, however, declined from DKr3.33bn to DKr3.26bn. The balance sheet total was down from DKr263bn at the end of last year to DKr256bn. The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the first half was 10.6 per cent, against 10.4 per cent at the end of last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Oleksiy Breus report: "Calm Is Not Envisaged"] </F>   [Text] A few days ago, a conference under the  auspices of the International Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA] was  held in Vienna where representatives of "atomic" countries  discussed today's state of safety at atomic electric power  plants [AES] using high-power reactors [RBMK], in particular,  the Chernobyl Plant. That particular plant was the reason for  convening the conference.    One month earlier, an international group of experts visited  the Chernobyl AES to study the safety of the plant's operation.  Eight specialists commissioned by the IAEA studied design  characteristics of the plant and certain aspects of its  operation. The assistant general director of the IAEA for  questions of nuclear safety, Morris Rosen, discussed the results  of that work with top leaders of Ukraine's State Committee for  Atomic Energy and State Atomic Supervision Agency.    Speaking about the meeting a few days latter, chairman of  Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy M. Umanets said that  international experts had expressed certain criticisms regarding  the Chernobyl AES, but had not demanded that the operating units  be halted. Therefore, the independent expert opinion, which had  long been demanded by the public, did not object to the  continued operation of the atomic plant. Having referred to the  IAEA principled stand in Iraq and Korea, M. Umanets called upon  the press to finally exonerate that agency. Perhaps, because he  did not yet know about the letter, which would sit on the desk  of the Ukrainian president in another hour or two and which  would come as an absolute surprise for the leader of Ukraine's  atomic department.    In that letter, IAEA General Director Hans Blix told the  president about the results of work of the same group of eight  experts: Numerous shortcomings have been revealed in the  operating units of the Chernobyl AES; the obsolete design of the  first unit is particularly alarming. Safety is also affected by  the difficulties in the provision of the AES's with spare parts,  the departure of skilled personnel, the difficult conditions of  work of the personnel, and, in addition to all of these, the  state of the "Ukryttya" [Shelter] Facility is deteriorating. In  view of the conclusion drawn by specialists to the effect that  international safety norms are not adhered to at the Chernobyl  AES, H. Blix proposed that a conference of representatives of  interested countries be convened in Vienna in order to improve  the situation.    Commenting upon that letter, first deputy chairman of the  State Committee for Atomic Energy N. Nigmatullin called it  unobjective. According to him, today, the safety of Chernobyl  units is not inferior to that at Russian AES's using RBMK's, for  example, the Kursk plant. This was also known to IAEA experts,  just like all those measures taken at the Chernobyl AES for  raising its safety. Therefore, if Chernobyl reactors do require  the attention of "interested" countries, this must also apply to  other RBMK's -- Russian and Lithuanian. Accordingly, the  attitude of the Vienna conference must be changed. Otherwise,  it may harm Ukraine's image. The State Committee for Atomic  Energy informed [President] L. Kravchuk about this point of view.    Regarding the Chernobyl AES, in N. Nigmatullin's opinion, it  is rather social and psychological and not technological  problems that are largely associated with it; also political  ones. N. Nigmatullin took the liberty of suggesting that the  IAEA conclusions reflected the interests of certain circles in  particular countries, which, in this manner, take care of their  free market of energy. They simply carry on "their own game,"  although not always in accordance with the rules of decency.    This political assumption from the lips of the leader of a  nonpolitical department would not sound strange, if one recalls  that the Chernobyl AES has long become an object of precisely  political battles. Isn't it true that, for several years, they  have been particularly adversely affecting the plant's safety?  However, the IAEA does not mention that fact. It would suffice  to picture an operator, who, for a long time, fails to  understand what his work is all about -- is it for the good of  the people or is it treason? If he is capable of alienating  himself from external influence, this is by no means better, as  there must be a citizen and not an introspective Yoga adept at  the control panel of any potentially dangerous installation....    Speaking of operators, it might be relevant to recall that,  in addition to the IAEA experts, the EC Commission also sent its  group of experts for coordinating international technological  assistance to work at Ukrainian AES's. They specialize in  training the personnel of AES's operating in Eastern European  countries. They studied problems involved in our system for  training operators and Ukraine's needs in that sphere. After  that, on 1 April [1994], at a meeting with Ukrainian atomic  specialists, the extent of methodological and technological  assistance on the part of the EC Commission to all Ukrainian  AES's was discussed. Not a single word on the inexpediency of  expenditure for the Chernobyl AES or on boycotting it was  uttered. When the chairman at the meeting, head of the group of  experts Mr. Defrenn [name as transliterated] gave the floor to  IAEA representative A. Kosilov of Russia, thorough procedural  actions were taken, to be on the safe side, to place A.  Kosilov's speech outside the framework of the meeting (despite  that, A. Kosilov also spoke about assisting the AES's in raising  their safety, but on the part of the IAEA, which allocates an  annual sum of about $50 million for that). Well, even abroad,  opinions on the Chernobyl AES safety differ. However, there,  just as in our country, there also exist extreme opinions.    This was confirmed at the beginning of April by the visit to  Ukraine of representatives of the U.S. Department of Power  Engineering and the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation who  studied problems of our power engineering. It seems that they  found the safety of the Chernobyl units to be, perhaps, the most  important problem and stated that the Chernobyl Plant needed to  be closed down in the very near future. Vice Premier V. Shmarov  remarked that it was first necessary to introduce new power  engineering capacities to compensate for closing down the  Chernobyl Plant. Taking into account Ukraine's electric energy  needs, the Americans agreed with his statement without, however,  giving up the idea of closing down the Chernobyl units.  Incidentally, from the point of view of acquiring a free market  of energy, such a position differs little from the demand that  the Chernobyl AES be closed down immediately....    In short, as soon as passions around the operation of the  Chernobyl AES subsided in Ukraine, they started flaring up  abroad. It might be good, had there been good intentions behind  it. The results of the Vienna conference also indicate that  they will not be final. The question of whether the measures  for raising the RBMK safety really prevail over those of its  shortcomings that cannot be eliminated still remains unsolved  abroad.    However, there is nothing new about the fact that these  reactors were not only created in conformity with the laws of  nuclear, but also of "political" physics. It is not only  technological decisions that may be listed among the causes of  the catastrophe. However, the Chernobyl AES was "revived,"  first and foremost, by political decisions, when specialists  found it expedient to commission new atomic units, in  particular, the fifth Chernobyl power unit. Because we turned  out to have too many specialists in that "political" physics.    In all probability, their number has not decreased in the  new  parliament. It is unlikely that we will get fast and entirely  independent expert opinion from abroad, as they have their own  interests, which are not always common to all of mankind.  Therefore, despite the decision adopted by the parliament and  the time that has passed since then, it would be futile to  expect calm around the operation of the Chernobyl AES. Perhaps,  this will continue for as long as the plant operates.</p>

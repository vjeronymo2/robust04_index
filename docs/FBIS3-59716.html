			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory  (Tsukuba City, Ibaragi-ken) of the National Agricultural  Cooperative Society Federation (Zen No) announced on 5 November  that for the first time in Japan, a transplanted fertilized egg  that can produce a cloned cow was separated and further recloned  to produce second generation ``recloned cows'' successfully. It  was a step forward towards accomplishing a technology to produce  large numbers of genetically superior cows from one fertilized  egg.    A clone is a living group that possesses identical genes in  all respect. The cloning technology to produce such living  groups have been actively studied for livestocks and the United  States, in 1987, was the first in the world to succeed in the  production of cloned cows.    In the case of cloned cows, after the cells in the  fertilized eggs had divided into 16-32 pairs, they are separated  and transplanted one pair each into another cow's egg in which  the nucleus had previously been removed. The general procedure  is to inject the transplanted egg into the cow's uterus.    Cows that are born by this procedure are first generation  clones. However, the Livestock Feed Central Research Laboratory  had tackled with a method in which the transplanted egg was not  impregnated into a female cow but instead it was induced to  perform a second cell division. From these cells, transplanted  eggs were produced to form second generation cloned cows by  impregnating into female cows.    In the technology of cloning, the repetition of recloning  leads to inferior growth and conception rates for the  transplanted egg as each generation is added. However, recloning  was made possible at the Central Research Laboratory by using a  certain type of test reagent that activate treats during the  process of producing the transplanted egg.    According to the project leader, Tatsuo Onihara of the  fertilized egg transplant laboratory, on 3 February of this  year, the second generation transplanted egg was injected into  the uterus of a female Holstein and later, the pregnancy was  confirmed. Nine months later, on 5 November, a calf was born at  1:30 PM by Caesarean operation. The calf weighed a normal 48  kgms and was female.    In the United States, they have already been successful in  producing third generation cows and furthermore, it is said that  they are producing transplanted eggs for sixth generation  cloning at the laboratory level.    Onihara project leader claims, ``In the future, it is  possible that we will be able to produce infinite number of  highly competent cows that can produce milk and meat.'' He will  be presenting his research results at the International Egg  Fertilization and Transplant Society Meeting to be held in  Australia next January.</p>

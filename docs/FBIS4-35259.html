			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  stated that Egypt and a number of Gulf states have submitted a  request to the UN Security Council to discuss the situation in  Yemen and the ongoing fighting there. He pointed out that a  cease-fire is important to stop the deteriorating situation in  that country. He noted that all parties, including Arab and  international ones, are interested in halting the continuing  bloodshed in Yemen without prejudice to the political situation  in that country.    Musa emphasized that what is important now is to reach a  cease-fire in Yemen because this is in the interest of both the  Arabs and the Yemenis. A cease-fire, he added, would allow for  a return to negotiations and safeguard Yemeni unity. He noted  that the continued bloodshed will certainly hurt Yemen's unity  and future.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Relaxation of building society rules proposed Building societies could save several hundred thousand pounds a year from streamlining procedures for communicating with their members under plans from a government advisory body to be presented this week. The taskforce on de-regulating financial services, one of seven groups set up by trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine almost a year ago, has concluded that there is scope for relaxing some of the requirements on societies to notify and consult their millions of members. Recommendations from all the taskforces are due to be published on Wednesday, together with the de-regulation bill itself. The financial services taskforce, made up of a small group of people working in the sector, has proposed that societies should be able to ask their members whether they still wish to receive individual notification of arrangements for annual general meetings and copies of summary results. Society members could also decide to end the system of giving their individual consent every time a society seeks agreement to engage in a new financial activity. Instead, members could delegate this function to the society's board. The changes could be brought about through orders made under existing legislation. If ministers approved the plans, they could come into effect before the new bill had completed its passage through parliament. Most of the proposed measures for de-regulation in financial services relate to building societies - which are also expected to benefit from new powers in the bill itself. There is some hope in the industry that the powers the government would take in the new measure to amend primary legislation by statutory orders could be used to increase the present limit of 40 per cent of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets. Larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper, in order to offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers. At present, because the limit is set by the Building Societies Act 1986, a new bill would be required to alter it.</p>

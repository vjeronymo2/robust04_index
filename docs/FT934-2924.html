			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Swiss telecom sacks chief executive Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment maker, yesterday sacked its chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, and announced the latest in a long series of divisional restructur-ings. Ascom was formed in 1987 when three suppliers to the Swiss PTT merged. It has been struggling ever since to unify the three companies and to develop a strategy to cope with liberalised telecommunications markets. Mr Vannotti, a highly-rated Swiss manager, became chief executive at the beginning of 1991. He had previously held senior positions with ABB-Asea Brown Boveri and Mr Stephan Schmidheiny's Unotec group. He scored an early coup, acquiring Timeplex, a leading US supplier of corporate telecoms networks, enabling Ascom to increase its non-Swiss business rapidly. However, in the past few months, the combination of recession and weak links in the corporate structure proved his undoing. In April, Ascom shocked investors by announcing it would incur a 1992 net loss of SFr46m (Dollars 31.4m) and pass its dividend. Days earlier, it had forecast a profit of around SFr25m. Mr Vannotti took full responsibility, but rashly predicted a return to profit this year. That forecast came back to haunt him in August when the group reported a loss of SFr79m in the first half and admitted it would face a 'marked loss' in the full year. Ascom bearer shares have been falling virtually ever since the merger, when they were worth about SFr8,000, and yesterday closed at SFr1,180, up SFr95 in advance of the announcement. Directors said Mr Fred Sutter, deputy chief executive, would succeed Mr Vannotti, and they have formed a committee to direct the group during its restructuring phase. Analysts said managing Ascom was made difficult by the interventionist policy of the Hasler Werke foundation, which holds 54 per cent of the voting power with 22 per cent of the capital. Mr Serge Ledermann, head of equity research at Geneva bankers Lombard Odier, said there was no reason to have more confidence in the new management than the old. 'Management by committee is always wrong,' he said.</p>

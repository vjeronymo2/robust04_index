			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> DAMAGES SET AT $150,000 AS FIRE SWEEPS 6,300-SQUARE-FOOT HOME  </P> <P> An early-morning fire partially destroyed a house under construction in an  exclusive Newport Beach area Thursday, causing estimated damages of $150,000,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Firefighters were called to the scene at Ocean Beach Drive in the Spyglass Hill  area about 2:20 a.m. after officers in a Newport Beach police helicopter  spotted flames from the two-story structure, police spokesman Bob Oakley said.  </P> <P> About 25 firefighters brought the blaze under control but not before one-third  of the building was gutted. Investigators believe that the fire was started  accidentally by a plumber's torch, Battalion Chief Ray Brown said.  </P> <P> Brown said the owner of the 6,300-square-foot home estimated its value at $1  million.  </P> <P> The blaze was about half a mile from a home on Port Ramsgate that was damaged  in a fire Wednesday.  </P> <P> That residence, located across a greenbelt from a street plagued with fires the  last 10 months, sustained $25,000 worth of damages. The cause of the fire is  still under investigation, Brown said.  </P></p>

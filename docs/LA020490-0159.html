			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU RENEWS TALKS WITH SHOUP  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran has renewed negotiations for a settlement with fired football  Coach Bob Shoup in an effort to avert a lawsuit, a member of the university's  board of regents said Saturday.  </P> <P> Shoup has rejected previous proposals, including one that would have paid him  $183,000 as a buyout of his contract, and instead filed a grievance that  claimed he held tenure as a coach as well as a faculty member.  </P> <P> On Jan. 23, the regents' executive committee upheld a faculty decision denying  the grievance. A meeting of the regents is scheduled Friday.  </P> <P> "The executive committee wants to avoid a lawsuit," said Jim Tyner, a CLU  regent. "I know that people at the school would very much like to get this  resolved before the regents' meeting Friday."  </P> <P> Shoup said that he is not personally participating in the negotiations.  </P> <P> "There is no agreement or anything close to an agreement from what I  understand," he said.

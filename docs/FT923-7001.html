			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Brazilian austerity breached THE ATTEMPT by Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, Brazilian economy minister, to defend fiscal austerity by resisting political patronage appears to be wilting under the crisis bedevilling President Fernando Collor. The minister has agreed to release the equivalent of about Dollars 400m (Pounds 209.4m) in credits for building cheap housing and sanitation projects, at the request of Mr Ricardo Fiuza, social action minister. He is one of several ministers from the conservative Liberal Front party (PFL), the main source of political support for Mr Collor, who might face impeachment over corruption allegations. The PFL has been seeking reward for its support, especially since the party's chances in municipal elections in October have dwindled because of its clear relationship with the unpopular president. Mr Eduardo Suplicy of the opposition Workers' party (PT) called the release of credits 'an attempt by the federal government to please the legislators who provide its base of support, to ensure that they will vote against impeachment.' The strategy of funding public works could be a powerful lobbying card for Mr Collor, against whom there would be no impeachment proceedings if a third or more of Congress were to demur. However, Mr Moreira, whose presence gives the administration credibility at home and abroad, especially in business, had resisted pressure to open the coffers. PFL support across the country, though, is not solid. An influential PFL state governor has broken with Mr Collor and other governors have said the 86 PFL federal representatives should have a free vote on the impeachment issue. 'The public demonstrations are making legislators think twice about their stand on impeachment,' said Mr Suplicy.</p>

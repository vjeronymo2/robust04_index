			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDEN FORGES 'SUICIDE PACT' AS TAKEOVER SHIELD  </P> <P> The top 25 executives of consumer products giant Borden Inc., in something akin  to a corporate suicide pact, said Wednesday that they have forged an  anti-takeover plan that calls for all of them to quit the company if any one of  them is fired after an unfair corporate takeover.  </P> <P> Borden chief executive Romeo J. Ventres, calling the defense a "people pill,"  in contrast to the widely used "poison pills," said that any bidder who tries  to take over Borden at a low-ball price would face an executive suite exodus  that could cripple the firm overnight.  </P> <P> "If I were an acquirer, I'd think twice about . . . risking the total loss of  this operating management," said Ventres, whose company produces Borden dairy  products, Laura Scudder's potato chips and other snacks, Cracker Jack candy,  Elmer's glue and dozens of other brands. "And, if I were a lender, I'd think  twice about lending to somebody willing to take such a risk."  </P> <P> In return for signing contracts pledging that they would join the pact, these  top executives would get additional cash in their severance packages, called  "golden parachutes," the company said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Firms Change Hands  </P> <P> The pact is a sign of the anxiety many corporate executives feel today,  particularly in the consumer products industries, as the unabating takeover  wave has engulfed company after company. As corporate chieftains and Wall  Street buyout specialists have bid higher and higher for the values they see in  brand-named products, such leading U.S. corporations as RJR Nabisco Corp.,  Pillsbury Co., Kraft Inc. and Beatrice Co. have changed hands.  </P> <P> And, recently, there has been new evidence of how difficult it is to defend a  company against a determined bidder who is willing to pay mostly cash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Poison Pill' Rejected  </P> <P> Only two weeks ago, the Delaware Supreme Court threw out Pillsbury's attempt to  block an offer from Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British conglomerate, with one of  the "poison pill" devices, which seek to block unsolicited takeovers by making  them prohibitively expensive. Grand Met is now completing the acquisition.  </P> <P> "Some managements are feeling pretty hemmed in these days, as this desperate  gesture shows," said Gregg Jarrell, a finance professor and former chief  economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. "This one says: 'We're in  the trenches, boys -- fix bayonets.' "  </P> <P> Borden executives insisted that the company, which had 1987 sales of $6.5  billion, is not now faced with a takeover threat. But they acknowledged that  the takeover boom has been very much on their minds.  </P> <P> "We read the papers and watch TV," said Ventres, who struck on the idea while  sweating in a sauna last March.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said the company's stock is now trading at what many  consider a depressed level, suggesting that some potential acquirers might  consider a takeover offer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bloody Takeover Battles  </P> <P> Ventres said the recent history of bloody takeover battles shows that many  acquirers have won companies by paying the shareholders less than they might  have. He noted the case of the British conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC, which has  so far raised $1.3 billion by selling off parts of SCM Corp., which it bought  in 1986 for $930 million.  </P> <P> Some Wall Street analysts and takeover specialists said they thought that the  "people pill" might cause some potential buyers to hesitate before making a bid  or might result in a higher bid to avoid a court fight over some provisions of  the device.  </P> <P> But several said it would probably prove to be more ingenious than effective.  </P> <P> "It's definitely clever, but, if an acquirer were thinking of just selling off  the pieces of the company, losing the management might not prove such a  disadvantage," said Richard Lowe, takeover specialist in Washington with the  law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn.  </P> <P> "The unemployment lines are filled with people who thought they were  indispensable," said Ralph Whitworth, executive director of the United  Shareholders Assn., a "shareholder rights" group in Washington, D.C., formed by  corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr.  </P> <P> Jarrell questioned whether the contracts would hold up in court and whether an  acquirer might not be able to run the company using the Borden executives  immediately below the top 25.  </P> <P> Also uncertain, he said, is whether the 25 executives would stand together, in  a pinch, and actually quit the company.  </P> <P> "Top executives generally step on a lot of people getting where they are," said  Jarrell, who now teaches at the University of Rochester's William E. Simon  Business School. "They may not be willing to go quietly."  </P> <P> To put the pact in effect, the executives late last month signed contracts  committing them to quit if Borden were taken over in what they considered an  unfairly priced deal.  </P> <P> The 25 executives have for several years had a severance compensation package  that is collectively worth up to $27 million. The new contracts have increased  the maximum value of these "golden parachutes" to $35 million.  </P> <P> To deal with the case of an executive who violates the pact by staying on, the  contracts include a clause that Jarrell called an "exploding reverse golden  parachute." In such a circumstance, the salary of an executive who did not quit  would have to be divided equally with the 24 who left.  </P> <P> That would mean that, to pay an executive a $150,000 salary, the acquirer would  have to shell out $3.75 million, $3.6 million of which would be divided among  the executive suite "loyalists."  </P> <P> Borden executives said that they thought the pact would be particularly  effective because the company is highly decentralized, largely consisting of a  collection of regionally distributed brands run by managers who have been with  the company for years. The average tenure of the 25 executives is 21 years,  officials said.  </P> <P> It would be difficult for an acquirer to replace such people, they insisted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Determination of Worth  </P> <P> If a takeover offer were made, the company directors' first step would be to  try to judge its fairness, based on complicated criteria for judging the  company's worth. A fair offer, under the new arrangement, would be one that  took into account 100% of Borden's value as an operating concern, plus 50% of  the extra value the company might have to some bidder in a takeover.  </P> <P> The "people pill" would be defused if the offer at least matched that value. It  would also be nullified if shareholders seem to be enthusiastic about the  takeover. Specifically, the anti-takeover plan would be dead if 85% of the  shares held by disinterested shareholders -- neither management nor the bidder  -- are tendered.  </P> <P> But the "people pill" would be triggered if those conditions were not met and  if the new owner demoted or fired a single one of the 25 top executives.  </P></p>

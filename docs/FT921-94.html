			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Defence 'deceit' attacked by King EFFORTS BY the Conservative party to raise the profile of defence as an election issue were foreshadowed yesterday by Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, who accused Labour of 'spinning webs of deceit' about its plans. The Conservatives are expected to use their party election broadcast on television tonight to focus on defence policy, which was seen as a weak point for Labour in the last two general elections. Mr King, speaking at the Royal United Services Institute in London, accused Labour of setting out to say as little as possible about defence in its manifesto. A Labour government, he said, would imply the 'wholesale closure' of military units and factories and could destroy a number of defence companies. Labour's proposed Defence Diversification Agency was a 'piece of Elastoplast designed to cover the gaping wound which would be caused by the cancellation of a lot of projects'. The idea that it could immediately replace the jobs lost was 'manifest nonsense'. Another defence review, proposed by both Labour and the Liberal Democrats, would be 'the worst thing you could possibly do at this time and the cruellest thing for people in the armed forces' following the Conservative government's Options for Change reforms. The Liberal Democrats' plan to halt the signing of contracts for equipment while a review was under way was 'grossly irresponsible', he added, and could be 'the final straw' for many suppliers. Mr King ruled out a further round of cuts if the Tories were re-elected. The Options for Change review was properly funded, more than had perhaps been the case for many years, and was standing the test of time, he said. 'We're set on our course now,' he added.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Mark Gastineau, former New York Jet defensive end, has been placed on waivers  by the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League.  </P> <P> Under CFL rules, if the 33-year-old Gastineau clears waivers, the Lions could  place him on their practice roster. Because of Gastineau's large personal  services contract with Lion Owner Murray Pezim, it's unlikely that another CFL  team would claim him.  </P></p>

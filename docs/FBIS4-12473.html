			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the ARAB TIMES" by Mahmud 'Abd-al-Qadir and </F> Sa'ud al-Farhan on news conference by Defense Minister Shaykh  'Ali al-Sabah in Kuwait on 30 March]    [Text] Kuwait City, April 1: Thousands of Iraqi troops  stationed in the south to crush Marsh Arabs could any moment  start moving towards Kuwait, Minister of Defense Shaykh 'Ali  al-Sabah said. The situation, however, is not similar to the  morning of August 2, 1990, he added.    "Iraqi troops in the south (of Iraq) are posing a continuous  threat to Kuwait. These troops could begin moving any moment  and we are closely watching its movements and are completely  ready to repulse any attack on Kuwait. These troops are capable  of doing something but we are very alert," Shaykh 'Ali told a  press conference.    The meeting took place Wednesday, was delayed for half an  hour as the Minister was meeting with ambassadors of U.S. UK.  and France who came to congratulate him for the Assembly's  approval of the defense budget and discuss other issues.    The Minister accused Iraq of attempting to violate the  Kuwaiti borders. "Firing across the borders against our troops  was still taking place," affirmed the minister. He declared  that Kuwait has completed digging the security trench on the  borders with Iraq. leaving "four gates" as demanded by the  United Nations.    He launched a scathing attack on those who have been  criticising and opposing Kuwait's arms procurement. "Those have  been acting out of their self interests," asserted the Minister  who repeatedly came under fire in the National Assembly for  allegedly squandering public funds to buy hundreds of millions  worth of unnecessary arms. MPs alleged wide-ranging misuse of  funds and kickbacks. A parliamentary committee is looking into  such allegations.    Shaykh 'Ali said he could have easily gotten the KD3.5  billion [Kuwait dinars] defense budget through, had he approved  "some personal favours for a number of MPs.    The Minister said that the latest Iraqi military moves in  the  south are not directed against Kuwait but could be any time.  "Although these moves are not directed against Kuwait, it does  not mean Kuwait is safe of Iraqi regime's plots, Iraq is still  keeping relatively large forces. So, I may tell you now it's  safe and there is nothing, and Iraqi troops start moving towards  us the next morning", he said. [sentence as published]    "Iraqi troops stationed in the south are capable of doing  something and the extent of this "thing" can be determined only  after those troops start moving".    The Kuwaiti Defense Minister said Iraqi troops have been in  the south for over a year now. "They are large troops and it's  natural that we, and our allies, have been closely monitoring  them round the clock," he said and added. "So far we have not  seen a direct threat but the presence of such large number of  troops and machinery is posing a certain threat to Kuwait".    Shaykh 'Ali said Iraqi troops have not made any aggressive  moves so far as its movements have been confined to south of  Iraq. He added that defense pacts Kuwait signed with four big  powers include clauses on how to "organise and regulate  repulsing an external attack on Kuwait." Under those  agreements, Kuwaiti armed forces carried out about 100 military  excercises with the Coalition countries and Russia. "These  exercises have been intended at applying defensive plans" on how  to defend the country.    He stressed that the position at present is not similar to  what it was on August 2, 1990, when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.  "But the presence of regular Iraqi army in the south for  training and crushing the uprising in southern Iraq, is a threat  to the country. These troops could receive orders to move  further south, towards Kuwait," he said. "The way Iraqi troops  are scattered now does not pose an immediate threat on Kuwait  but this assumption could change. This could be true for now,  but it could reverse 180 degrees just one hour after this  meeting. The decision is surely with Saddam Husayn," asserted  the minister.    About the credibility of reports saying that Kuwait and the  coalition countries have made a deal to carry out a military  operation to rescue Kuwaiti POWs in Iraq, the minister said no  deal has been signed with him personally. But he affirmed that  all government bodies have been working very hard to achieve  this target. "The Kuwaiti National Committeee for POWs has made  a very important progress to put international pressure on Iraq  to release the POWs. But whether or not Iraq would respond, the  answer is surely with Saddam Husayn," he insisted.    He praised the decision taken by the UN Security Council  members to continue sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said  this shows these countries are convinced not to ease or lift  sanctions against Iraqi regime. He said this shows these  countries are convinced not to ease or lift sanction unless Iraq  complied with all UN resolutions, especially those relating to  border demarcation, respect of human rights and release of POWs  and missing. "Until now, things look promising and satisfactory  for us."    Shaykh 'Ali asserted that Kuwaiti post-liberation arms  procurement has been based on scientific foundations and  thorough evaluation and study. "Most of the defense ministry  critics are inexperienced and their criticism lacked substance  and facts", he said. Critics, mostly from the National  Assembly, have based their opposition on the assumption that the  KD3.5 billion budget was going to be used immediately. People  should know it's for 12 years. He also denied allegations that  half of the budget has already been spent.    The Defense Minister said that Kuwait has accepted a U.S.  defense study on formulating a defense strategy in Kuwait. The  U.S. study was picked up by top Kuwaiti military commanders in  preference to studies submitted by Britain and France. "We  explained to our friends in the three countries our position and  requested a defense strategy to be suitable to us. A highly  qualified Kuwaiti military team found that the U.S. study was  the most appropriate. The strategy took into consideration  Kuwait's financial and human resources," he said. The amounts  allocated also involve expenses for training. After the  liberation, as many as 14,000 Kuwaiti military personnel have  undergone training courses mainly how to handle the advanced  weapons.    Shaykh 'Ali insisted that the Ministry of Defense cannot  disclose all defense information because "most of it is  classified." He challenged those who criticise the military  establishment to prove their allegations. "These very same  people have criticised the purchase of the Warrior APCs from UK  after about 90 officers from the Army decided it was the best  for Kuwait after conducting on spot examinations on the vehicle.  Commander of the land troops, Brigadier Salim Mas'ud  recommended the APC and he is the one who is going to use in  fighting".    The Minister urged MPs to "isolate Kuwait's national  interests from that of their own private interests. Some are  insisting on us to buy certain arms because of vested  interests." He defended the military establishments in regard  to allegations of wide-spread kickbacks and illegal commissions.  "This has become an exhausted issue that has no sympathy from  the public. They claim to be having the evidence and we say  they can send it to the prosecution. In fact, they are still  demanding information from us," stressed the minister in  reference to the Assembly's fact-finding panel.    He revealed that MP Mubarak al-Duwaylah, one of the most  outspoken critics of the ministry, has asked him to sack the  chief of staff and undersecretary of the ministry because "they  are thieves" as al-Duwaylah stressed. The minister refused. He  also said that most of the Kuwaiti arms repatriated from Iraq  have been repaired and used.    On the Bedouns, stateless Arabs, the minister said that all  those who fought to defend Kuwait should be considered Kuwaitis  even if those happen to be Iraqis. He stressed such persons  will not be dismissed from the Kuwaiti armed forces. Bedouns in  the army are granted Kuwaiti passports to travel to certain  countries.    The current Peninsula Shield troops will be the nucleus for  the proposed 100,000-strong Gulf Army. The troops will have  three exercises by next year. Shaykh 'Ali also said the  ministry will shortly submit a new law for conscription which  may include increasing the duration for conscripts.    Commenting on reports speculating a cabinet reshuffle, the  minister said there has been some "thinking" about improving the  whole administration including the cabinet. Soon after that the  thinking changed and it was thought it would be better to leave  the Cabinet as it is now. "But, the final decision is with the  Crown Prince and Prime Minister", he stressed.    Shaykh 'Ali announced that the Kuwaiti troops in Somalia  have  started pulling out despite the fact that the UN wants them to  stay. The pull out of Kuwaiti troops coincides with pulling  other troops.</p>

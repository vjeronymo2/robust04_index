			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / German constitution changed Germany's parliament voted yesterday to amend the post-war constitution to take account of unification, but it turned down other proposed amendments and was set to reject several more radical changes. The deputies, meeting in Berlin's historic Reichstag building, voted 622 to three with four abstentions for stronger commitments to the rights of women and the handicapped and for a pledge to protect the environment for later generations. But they rejected clauses on respecting ethnic minorities and on the division of power between the federal government and the 16 states, whose powers Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) have refused to extend. The CDU has pledged to block the more radical motions, including one from the combined opposition parties to recognise common law relationships, whether heterosexual or homosexual. Since changes require a two-thirds majority, it was almost certain that only the reforms which had cross-party consensus would pass.</p>

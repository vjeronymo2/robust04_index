			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TASK FORCE URGED FOR INITIATIVE  </P> <P> Torrance City Councilman Tim Mock has requested that city staff form a task  force to draft a proposed March ballot measure that would tighten controls on  all hazardous chemicals in the city.  </P> <P> Mock said Tuesday that he wants the measure to require industries to obtain a  conditional-use permit to use and store hazardous chemicals. A panel of experts  would review the safety of a chemical's use on a case-by-case basis before  issuing a permit, Mock said.  </P> <P> The proposed measure would also provide voters with an alternative to an  initiative proposed by Councilman Dan Walker, which is only intended to  restrict the use of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid at the Mobil Oil  refinery, Mock said in an interview.  </P> <P> Walker has said he expects to collect enough signatures within the next three  weeks to get his initiative on the March ballot.  </P> <P> Mock stressed the need for tighter restrictions but also said he feared that if  Walker's initiative succeeds, it will tie up the city in a court battle for  years.  </P> <P> "I would do almost anything to stop Walker's initiative," he said.  </P> <P> Walker said that he is concerned that Mock's proposed measure will be a  "back-door attempt" to derail his ballot measure and may confuse voters.  </P> <P> Mock's proposal would require approval by the City Council to place it on the  ballot.  </P> <P> A series of fires, explosions and gas leaks at the Mobil refinery have killed  three people and seriously injured at least 12 others since March of 1987,  prompting the city to file a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. The suit asks  that the court declare the refinery a public nuisance and give the city the  power to regulate it.  </P></p>

He made  one mistake."  </P> <P> Jones, 19, rushed for 1,160 yards and was the most valuable player in the  Palomar League his senior year. He also won all-state honors.  </P> <P> SOCCER  </P> <P> The Sockers have signed former Minnesota Striker and Los Angeles Lazer  goalkeeper Tim Harris to a 10-day contract.  </P> <P> Harris, who was 7-5 with a 5.12 goals-against average for Minnesota last  season, will replace Felipe Hernandez starting Friday night when the Sockers  play at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Hernandez, who was 0-1 with the Sockers, already has been signed to two 10-day  contracts this season, the most allowed by the Major Indoor Soccer League.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Anja Bordt's game-high 36 points led St. Mary's (19-9, 12-2) to a conference  championship and a 76-71 West Coast Athletic Conference victory over host  University of San Diego.  </P> <P> Paula Mascari had 20 points and Rochelle Lightner added 13 for USD (10-17,  6-8), which finished fourth in the conference.  </P></p>

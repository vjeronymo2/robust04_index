			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMATION OF SPLINTER PARTIES  </P> <P> Ross K. Baker's column "Women's Splinter Party Would Stymie Friends and Comfort  Enemies" (Op-Ed Page, July 27) expresses that he doesn't have a clue which way  the political drift is shifting!  </P> <P> The recent success of the Japanese women in their government is not mentioned  in Baker's article, while he claims the National Organization for Women (NOW)  would establish an "American Women's Party on a fool's errand which could not  even count on the support of Alan Alda," based on his stated belief women have  such limited issues.  </P> <P> Mr. Baker, women have more savvy in all matters of life on earth watching,  hearing, feeling and enduring men in all walks of life running the world in  gross ignorance, and are more than ready to give their support to a national  women's party which would also receive a "man-date."  </P> <P> Your column was the most snide, arrogant, foolish and belittling bias I've read  in a long time against women. Prof. Baker, wise up!  </P> <P> ELAINE MORGANELLI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

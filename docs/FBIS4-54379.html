			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Intolerable Challenge" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- U.S. Vice-President  Albert Gore reportedly appeared on a TV program recently and let  loose a string of balderdash saying it is dangerous to continue  talks with North Korea and that the steps taken by the United  States to strengthen security for South Korea are "wise" ones.    This is a provocative outburst intended to create obstacles  to a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and  bring the situation further to a phase of crisis.    Judging from the U.S. hardline conservative force's open  remarks that it is dangerous to resume the talks with the DPRK,  one can see clearly that they are not interested in a negotiated  settlement of the nuclear issue but are scheming to isolate and  stifle the DPRK with strength.    The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean  peninsula today shows that the DPRK's negotiation proposal to  establish a durable peace arrangement which will replace the  military armistice body in Korea is just and timely, and it  urgently requires that the proposal be carried into effect at an  early date.    The United States must realize that to respond to the DPRK's  peace initiative, instead of clinging to adventurous military  action against it, is a reasonable view either in view of the  interests of the United States itself or in view of the  guarantee of regional peace.    The United States must opt a package solution to settle the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and normalize relations  with the DPRK, true to its declaration before the world through  the DPRK- U.S. joint statement.</p>

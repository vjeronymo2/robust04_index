			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 3 (BTA) -- 1,718 of the 2,840  lecturers and employees at the St. Kliment Okhridski University  of Sofia are on strike, the strike committee chairman, Assoc.  Prof. Petyo Petkov, said at a press conference today. Members  of all trade union organizations at the university have joined  the effective strike. The Sofia University students have been on  strike since January 21. The Neofit Rilski Southwestern  University in Blagoevgrad will join the strike tomorrow.    Academic work -- examinations, lectures, seminars,  laboratory  research and preparations for the admission of new students, at  Bulgaria's largest university has stopped. Classes are  conducted only with extramural students and persons doing  postgraduate work.    The strikers' demand for the allocation of 2.3 percent of  the  gross domestic product to education and science (1.5 percent for  university education and 0.8 for science) is realistic and  necessary, reporters were reminded again.    Addressing all Bulgarians, the Strike Committee of the Sofia  University Lecturers and Employees calls for support. The  document makes it a point that "the university lecturers and  students are not on strike for salaries and scholarships, meager  as they may be." They are fighting for the very survival of  education and science, so that Bulgaria can exist, it is  stressed in the address.    At a working meeting in the University of Veliko Turnovo,  central Bulgaria, representatives of the rector's offices of six  provincial universities adopted a document expressing their  stand on the acute problems of higher education in Bulgaria.  The document says that the financial collapse of higher  education institutions may have serious negative consequences,  causing unforeseen damages over the next five or ten years. The  Council of Rectors in Sofia will be familiarized with the  document.    After the talks of Ministry of Science and Education  officials and representatives of the striking students and the  lecturers' strike committee, it became clear that except for the  financial demands, all other ones were feasible and included in  the Ministry's programme long ago.</p>

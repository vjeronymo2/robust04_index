			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORGY, BESS AND UNCLE TOM;  </P> <P> THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PORGY AND BESS; THE STORY OF AN AMERICAN CLASSIC BY  HOLLIS ALPERT(ALFRED A. KNOPF: $35; 346 PP.)  </P> <P> Picture this. Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures allegedly proposed to George  Gershwin: If "Porgy and Bess" makes it to the screen, "we could cast Al Jolson  as Porgy, Fred Astaire as Sportin' Life . . . and Rita Hayworth as Bess." As  Hollis Alpert reports in this journalistically styled survey, however, Gershwin  by no means fancied the notion of a white cast in black face; earlier he had  refused the same proposal from Jolson himself, agreeing with DuBose Heyward,  the writer who created the seminal 1925 novel, "Porgy," that the story was  meant for a black cast.  </P> <P> Set in 1912, "Porgy and Bess" purports to depict the harsh realities of life in  Catfish Row, a Charleston, S.C., slum inhabited by blacks who speak Gullah, a  Creole tongue that mixes English and West African languages. Porgy, an  honorable, philosophical cripple on a goat-drawn cart, falls in love with Bess,  a former prostitute kept by a murderous brute named Crown. Sportin' Life, a  drug-peddling devil incarnate, tempts Bess from the path to salvation -- the  love of a good man.  </P> <P> Alpert's book focuses on those responsible for creating "Porgy and Bess" and on  the behind-the-scenes struggle to stage the play and then the opera. Alpert  sketches portraits of Heyward, his wife Dorothy, the Gershwins, acclaimed film  maker Rouben Mamoulian -- director of the play and the first opera production  -- and Robert Breen, the general director of the American National Theatre and  Academy (ANTA) in the 1950s. Breen, whose life became enmeshed in the "Porgy  and Bess" saga from the 1950s until his death in the 1970s, organized a tour of  "Porgy and Bess" during the Cold War and fought to bring his stage version of  the opera to the movie screen. He failed on the last score: Otto Preminger  directed the critically unheralded motion picture.  </P> <P> While succeeding generations of critics have not taken Heyward seriously as  either a writer or dramatist, Alpert sees him as "one of the most important  influences in opening up the American stage to black participation. The large  casts for 'Porgy' as both play and opera gave great opportunity to a host of  black performers, made new black stars, and gave white and mixed audiences a  new appreciation of the talents of black performing artists. . . . It is a  contribution that lives on."  </P> <P> Alpert also acknowledges, however, that since the opera opened in New York,  many African Americans have found it to be a kind of Uncle Tomism, a rip-off of  black culture. Some of Gershwin's black detractors even have suggested that the  music was stolen outright from melodies heard in black churches and then  exploited for profit.  </P> <P> There is some truth in these theories. That Gershwin culled African-American  musical sources for "Porgy and Bess" has never been in doubt. Gershwin said so  himself, as Alpert's book reports. But he used them as inspiration. It was not  outright appropriation, as some still like to claim. In fact, as Alpert's book  points out, Duke Ellington criticized the opera not only for its stereotypical  portrayal of blacks but for its ersatz black music: "The times are here . . .  to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms." And he complained that "the music  does not hitch with the mood and spirit of the story. It does not use the Negro  musical idiom." Still, Ellington thought it "grand music and a swell play, but  the two didn't go together."  </P> <P> With every generation, Alpert points out, black criticism of "Porgy and Bess"  became harsher. Thirty-two years after the opera's New York opening, Harold  Cruse, in his "The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual," called the work "the most  contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World." He went so  far as to demand that blacks never perform in it.  </P> <P> Some modern-day resentment toward the play stems from the way the State  Department exploited it during the Cold War to counter Communist propaganda  about the virtual "enslavement" of black Americans. Breen, the American  National Theater director, saw the tour as an "opportunity to show how blacks  were rising in the cultural firmament," Alpert reports, "and at the same time  to nullify propaganda about their lack of opportunity."  </P> <P> But while foreign audiences embraced "Porgy and Bess" casts featuring, among  others, Leontyne Price, William Warfield, Maya Angelou and Cab Calloway, these  artists had a tougher time at home. They were forced to use the "colored only"  bathrooms in a suburban Washington restaurant, Alpert writes; to eat their food  in a special basement room of the restaurant, and to use the back door of the  Willard Hotel in the nation's capital to get to their hotel rooms -- which they  had to find themselves once handed a key.  </P> <P> Truman Capote, whom Alpert paints as a waspish and unethical journalist, wrote  about the Russian tour of "Porgy and Bess" and shrewdly guessed that Soviet  permission for the tour came from the "opera's message about people being happy  when they have 'plenty of nothin'.' "  </P> <P> As far as Cruse and many other critics are concerned, Jolson, Astaire and  Hayworth should have had the starring roles. Clearly, though, Alpert doesn't  see it that way. Playing objective reporter, he discusses the racism that  surrounded Porgy and Bess, but he often sounds like an apologist.  </P> <P> "The talented cast of 'Porgy and Bess' came from a host of schools and  institutions," he writes. "Broadway and the New York opera and concert halls  were still the primary lure, but it was a large country out there and its  hunger for entertainment and culture provided opportunity for gifted black  artists."  </P> <P> Alpert seems to forget that it was not until 1955, when she was 53 and her  vocal powers were fading, that the great African American contralto, Marian  Anderson, made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera House. Racism had prevented  an earlier debut.  </P> <P> Leontyne Price, who first came to fame in the role of Bess in the 1952-54 road  production of "Porgy and Bess," did not make her Metropolitan debut until 1961.  And even though African Americans are now among the world's leading divas,  black men still claim that they face enormous career obstacles in the operatic  world.  </P> <P> It seems that anyone purporting to play the role of historian is obligated to  understand how people saw their own times but not obligated to adopt their  language or point of view.  </P> <P> Implicitly, Alpert suggests throughout this book that it was the largess of the  liberal-minded whites associated with "Porgy and Bess " that gave blacks the  opportunity to prove how talented they were. That paternalistic attitude is not  a particularly endearing argument to African Americans or any other perceptive  U.S. citizen in 1990.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, that's the way it was, so let's move on. Right? The problem,  however, is that that's still the way it is -- the few exceptions only proving  the rule. The same attitude that ticked off black people when "Porgy" was first  staged enrages them now: that of Euro-Americans who believe they know and  understand African American culture better than the people who created it, and,  most important, have the social and economic power to impose their  interpretation.  </P> <P> Alpert misses this and other points throughout "The Life and Times of Porgy and  Bess." "Life and Times" suggests, of course, that Alpert plans to provide  context, but he in fact fails to examine seriously the cultural and racial  issues that shaped the creation of "Porgy" or defined the social circumstances  under which it has been performed.  </P> <P> He tells us a little about the flowering of black literature, but his social  history is maddeningly glib: "Ezra Pound was publishing his cantos, Fitzgerald  telling his tales of the Jazz Age. T. S. Eliot saw it all as a 'Waste Land'. .  . ."  </P> <P> Alpert views much of the criticism of "Porgy and Bess" during the '60s and '70s  as revisionist. Most African American artists weren't complaining when the show  debuted, he points out. Well, given that it was virtually the only game in  town, of course they weren't. How many opportunities did a classically trained  African American singer have to perform in the United States until very  recently, except for "Porgy and Bess"?  </P> <P> For better or worse, "Porgy and Bess" has helped define American culture. Its  name conjures images of the nature of black life in America that are reinforced  by similar contemporary stereotypes of so-called black-ghetto life in  newspapers, films and on television. The problem, as always, is that there are  not enough countervailing African American images in the popular media to  balance the predominant portrayal of blacks as welfare queens, gang-bangers and  dope peddlers.  </P> <P> Perhaps to "The Jeffersons," "Sanford and Son" and "Good Times," all of which  Alpert cites, in a book published in 1990, as examples of shows that "carried  their own stereotypes," just as "Porgy and Bess" does, but now with a "note of  racial pride." Somehow it escaped him that the '80s sitcoms were not created by  black writers but by white ones who thought they knew how African Americans  lived.  </P> <P> As a work filled with some interesting anecdotes (though most of them are from  other writers' books), Alpert's effort offers some pleasant and occasionally  amusing reading.  </P> <P> Wisely, toward the end of his book, he suggests that people just accept "Porgy  and Bess" -- with all its outmoded sensibilities -- as a set piece. That seems  sound. But to some people just discovering "Porgy," those sensibilities may not  seem completely out of date. Take a real-life, 40-something-year-old man of  color I know about, who had been passing as "white" all his life. Trying to  impress an African-American woman, he told her he wanted to get her a new  recording that was on sale: "You know, the Gershwin thing, Por . . . Por . . .  Porky and Bess."  </P> <P> Interpret the dynamics of that scenario, Mr. Alpert, and maybe you'll get a  handle on the real life and times of P and B.  </P></p>

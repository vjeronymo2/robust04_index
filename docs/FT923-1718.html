			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Investment declines in W Midlands CAPITAL investment by quoted companies in the west Midlands has fallen 8 per cent on average over the past year, or 18 per cent if the spending plans of utility groups are not taken into account. The decline was measured by the Birmingham branch of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, by collating the most recent published results of 131 companies active in the region. The results of the survey raise serious doubts about the competitiveness in the medium and long term of companies in one of the UK's main industrial regions. Although KPMG Peat Marwick found many companies that are 'fit, profitable and cash-generating', it suggests that 'lack of investment coupled with high labour rates can only undermine competitiveness for the long term'. The collective bill for employees in the west Midlands companies  - wages and salaries, social security and pension costs  - was Pounds 6.32bn in 1991-92, compared with Pounds 6.06bn in 1990-91. The survey notes that average wages and salaries rose 6.5 per cent to Pounds 13,100 a year, as the total number on the payroll declined to 418,000 from 430,000 in 1990-91. It found, however, that companies were maintaining dividend payments to shareholders. Payments rose overall by 3.5 per cent while total pre-tax profits earned by the 131 companies declined 24 per cent. Only the utilities  - Midlands Electricity, Severn Trent Water and South Staffordshire Water  - and companies in the retailing and food and drink sectors recorded an increase in capital investment. 'Given the significant increase by the utilities, reflecting the investment programme of Severn Trent to improve the standard of water supply', the average fall in capital spending 'disguises much larger reductions by both large and small companies', the survey says. Expenditure by small companies, defined as those with a market value of less than Pounds 50m, fell 46 per cent during 1991-92. Spending by large companies  - those with a market value of more than Pounds 100m - declined 12 per cent from 1990-91. West Midlands plc, Annual Report 1992.

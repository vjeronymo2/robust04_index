			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: Can cultural differences be overcome? Cultural differences were cited as the main reason for calling off the proposed Leeds Permanent/National and Provincial merger, which would have created the third largest UK building society after Halifax and the Nationwide. Leeds is seen as having a traditional, hierarchical structure. N&amp;P, whose attempts to reshape its activities through business process re-engineering were profiled on this page on July 5, has adopted a different approach. But when should a culture clash be allowed to derail a merger that is universally agreed to make strong commercial sense? Philippe Haspeslagh, professor of corporate strategy and organisation at Insead, the business school outside Paris, observes: 'Cultures are always different. Even between two companies in the same sector and country.' Mark Tilden of Gemini Consulting is more blunt: 'If institutional shareholders were around this merger would have been pushed through.' Tilden agrees that cultural differences can be worked round but admits that there comes a point when 'the future looks so unbearable it has to be called off'. Others are more adamant that the cultural differences were insurmountable, partly because of the personality of David O'Brien, N&amp;P's chief executive, who would have been chief executive of the merged society. Some in the industry find his manner abrasive. At the same time, though, many are convinced that a big commercial opportunity has been missed. Says Robert Baldock, a partner in the financial services division of Andersen Consulting: 'If N&amp;P had been different, this would have been a marriage made in heaven.' Simon Farnborough of the Boston Consulting Group agrees: 'It comes down to the curious ownership structure of building societies. Without doubt, they've missed an opportunity. They would have been very powerful.' Nevertheless the episode should be kept in proportion, for as Baldock points out only 50 per cent of planned mergers take place. 'Very few of those ever realise their potential.' If the cultures were really that different then at least the societies have avoided what could have been a disastrous error. 'If you find that there are such significant cultural differences, you are not going to be able to implement a joint business plan. They've been very brave,' says Stephen Lawrence of Arthur D Little.</p>

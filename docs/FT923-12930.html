			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil recovers most of its June decline / The winners and losers among the world's emerging markets Allegations of corruption against President Fernando Collor prompted a 30.7 per cent fall in Brazilian equities in dollar terms last month, but most of the losses have since been recouped as the passing of some important economic reforms has lifted investor confidence. According to emerging markets data provided by the IFC, part of the World Bank, Brazil was the poorest performer in June, while Turkey came out on top after several months of decline. Mr Eduardo Farria, an analyst at Latin American Securities, says the Brazilian press was 'besotted' with the allegations against the president in June, and that the Congress's passing of a reform to streamline the country's ports, and the approval of a complex review of civil servants' pay by the Senate, had been overlooked by the market. He adds that since the government pushed through these economic reforms, no easy task in the midst of a presidential crisis, the market has become cautiously optimistic that the government's fiscal package could be passed by Congress. This could set the scene for inflation to come down. Another stimulus for the market in early July was news that Brazil and its foreign creditor banks had reached agreement on a Brady-style restructuring of some Dollars 44bn of commercial bank debt. This was another feather in the cap for Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, who is increasingly seen as a figure of stability within the government. Indeed, since the start of July, the Bovespa index in dollar terms has risen by 1.64, or 28.2 per cent, to 7.46. Mr Farria warns that share prices could fall back if any evidence implicating the president is produced. 'But the most likely scenario is that the president will stay,' he says. Elsewhere, Turkey's 27.8 per cent rebound in dollar terms last month, reducing its fall since the start of the year to 39.1 per cent, has fanned analysts' hopes that a turnround has finally begun. Investors reacted positively to changes, passed last month, in the capital market law, permitting institutional investors to invest in the stock market. Tax breaks have also been offered to mutual funds if they place 25 per cent of their portfolio in equities. The prospect of a big cash injection has been welcomed by brokers since, in the past, trading in the stock market has been shallow and influenced by the whims of retail investors. A fall in inflation, and the low valuations of Turkish equities compared with other emerging markets, especially in Latin America, have attracted foreign investors, comments Ms Nur Agis Pekin at Schroder Securities. Mr Ben Hakham, at Carnegie International, also attributes the stock market's rebound in June to seasonal factors, as the arrival of tourists has taken pressure off the Turkish lira, which in turn has allowed the Treasury to reduce the yields on its bills.</p>

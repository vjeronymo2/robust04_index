			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (9): Profits are still flowing - Foreign stockbrokers and banks WHILE most Japanese financial institutions are struggling to break even, foreign banks and securities companies in Tokyo claim to be making a healthy profit. In some areas foreign institutions have benefited from the weakness of domestic players. For example, foreign banks were able to increase lending to blue-chip Japanese corporations as the domestic banks cut back on asset growth. However, unlike their Japanese rivals, foreign banks and securities firms have not pursued market share as a strategic objective. Many are now reaping the benefits of strategies which emphasised high margins in favour of high volume. For example, foreign banks have never taken more than 3 per cent of the corporate loans market in Japan. By the end of last year market share was probably close to this historic high, but is now declining as foreign bankers become more cautious about credit risk. Bankers reject the suggestion that there is any problem gaining access to the corporate loans market. 'There is business out there for any bank which wants to lend,' commented Mr Gerard Jeannin, head of Tokyo operations for Banque Indosuez, which has a corporate loans book of around Y250bn. But foreign bankers agree that there is little money to be made directly from lending to Japanese companies. Loans are made only where the borrower is likely to buy other banking services: foreign exchange, treasury hedging products and structured finance. There is no syndicated loans market in Japan. The exact terms of loans depend on the relationship between borrower and lender. However, bankers said that good quality Japanese corporations were now paying 70-80 basis points over interbank rates for medium-term loans - at least double the levels of the late 1980s. However, there are no commitment fees standard in the US and European syndicated loans market. Return on capital remains relatively low. Moreover, bankers said that lending margins had already peaked and were now tightening slightly. As in the UK and US, demand for loan finance is subdued as companies cut investment plans and liquidate financial assets. In the securities markets, foreign firms have also avoided head-on competition for high-volume business. Instead they have emphasised product diversification, which in most cases is shorthand for building expertise in futures, options and other derivative financial products. Over the past year the strategy has been successful, particularly for firms which have made aggressive use of their own balance sheets for index arbitrage. In the six months to the end of September, the most profitable foreign securities operations in Tokyo were Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley. Both firms are active users of the futures market for index arbitrage trading. Their results were only bettered by Nomura and Daiwa, the two giants of the Japanese securities industry. For the full year the contrast in fortunes will probably be even greater. All the big Japanese securities firms except Nomura have forecast a deficit. However, the contrast of styles and trading strategies has created conflicting interests which threaten to sour relations as the Japanese authorities cast around for ways to stimulate the financial markets. Daily trading volume on the Tokyo stock exchange averaged fewer than 200m shares in February. At the peak of the bull market in June 1988 trading volume reached 1,770m shares a day. Combined with lower commission charges, the total commission income of brokers in Japanese equities may only be 20 per cent of the level of 1989. Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director of Nomura, estimated cash trading volume of 500m-700m shares a day is required for domestic market participants to break even. Recent moves to stimulate cash trading volume are likely to squeeze the profitability of many foreign securities firms. In March, the authorities increased futures commission charges on the Osaka securities exchange, where the Nikkei 225 stock index future trades. Mr Hideaki Yamashita, director of international affairs at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said futures commissions had been raised to iron out volatility in the cash market caused by futures-related trading. Up to 15 per cent of cash market transactions are now related to index futures trading, which is concentrated in the Nikkei 225 contract. Cash stocks are bought to hedge short positions taken through index futures, holdings which are unwound as the futures contract expires. Cash volume on the last day of the futures contract is often double the average. In a thin market, these block trades can cause wide movements in the cash index. The authorities hope that a reduction index futures trading will reduce volatility and help to attract small investors back into the equity market. This is seen as essential by domestic securities firms for trading volume to be restored. However, foreign firms argue that low trading volume and volatility are factors of influences other than index arbitrage trading. 'The loss of political credibility and the possibility of panic selling are the root causes of low trading volume,' commented Mr Bill Thompson, chairman of Salomon Brothers Asia. Foreign analysts readily admit the differential between cash and futures market commissions is too wide. However, they argue cash commissions should be liberalised to stimulate trading volume. But there is little prospect of a further reduction or deregulation of cash commissions while the domestic securities firms are facing a severe squeeze on operating income. In the absence of price competition on commissions, foreign securities firms are trying to maintain profitability by other means. Active use of the derivatives markets is one aspect of this. Most foreign firms operating in Tokyo also cite the quality and objectivity of their research as an important competitive advantage. A recent poll of Japanese institutional investors by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the financial newspaper, ranked Mr Peter Tasker of Kleinwort Benson the top equity market strategist.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILIPINOS IN THE SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> In response to your article "Filipinos -- A Search for Community," Part I, May  24:  </P> <P> I take issue with this headline if you meant that the Filipinos have not yet  found their community. We have a dynamic community that will be a major player  in the socioeconomic and political future of this country. This community  collectively clamored for my judicial appointment.  </P> <P> When you discussed the absence of a Filipino town, you did not mention that we  are not a nation of shopkeepers. Since we have a special kinship with our  fellow Asians we patronize their businesses. Historically, culturally, by  training and education, we are service-oriented. There is no need for us to  live in enclaves nor work in a Filipino town. Without the language and cultural  barriers, we easily blend into the mainstream. Even without community support,  we can compete effectively in the professional marketplace.  </P> <P> Yes, we have numerous dialects and cultures, but this is precisely what makes  the Filipino nation so vibrant and culturally rich. In the same vein, the  greatness of the American people lies in their diversity. Consequently,  Filipinos are adaptable to any social, economic or political setting. Filipinos  understand each other.  </P> <P> It may be true that in some of their association politics they expressed  themselves passionately in what they believe in. But they respect each other's  right to disagree. Is this not what democracy is all about?  </P> <P> We love and respect our manongs (elders). We insist that they live with us in  our homes.  </P> <P> Our seniors were the victims of California's anti-miscegenation law prohibiting  intermarriages between Asians and whites. They had comported themselves with  restraint but when the war came they fought gallantly side by side with their  American brothers. We demonstrated again the same gallantry and restraint in  our recent People's Power revolution.  </P> <P> Filipinos place a high price on their children's education. Parents  instinctively deny themselves the luxury of the good life just so the kids can  go to the best schools. I am proud to say that our children have lived up to  our highest expectations so that some day one of them will be president of this  great country.  </P> <P> MEL RED RECANA  </P> <P> Municipal Court Judge  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVING THE PAN  </P> <P> Just two days after the fire that crippled the Pan Pacific Auditorium I gave a  lecture about the loss of the Pan. Everybody was aware of its historical  significance and saddened by the event.  </P> <P> Since then, I have talked to many other people about this building and it seems  that no matter how uninformed a person may be about the architecture or history  of Los Angeles, I have not run into anyone who was not aware of the Pan. People  have told me stories about events they attended there over the years or just  that they enjoyed seeing it stand there. Certainly it was a significant  landmark.  </P> <P> I enjoyed Sam Hall Kaplan's column (June 18). It expressed so eloquently many  of the feelings I have about the building. I hope he will continue to support  the regeneration of this architectural treasure.  </P> <P> Please do everything you can to save this precious piece of art from  extinction.  </P> <P> ROSLYN M. WILKINS  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

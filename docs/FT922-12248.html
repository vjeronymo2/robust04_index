			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (20): Credit for success goes to workforce - Oakwood FIVE YEARS after winning a Queen's award for export achievement, Oakwood Design of Letchworth, Herts, has done it again. The company designs and manufactures bank-card production machinery. Oakwood claims to be at the forefront of the latest 'smart card' developments which require micro-chips to be embedded in the cards, as well as the card fraud-busting technique of embodying digitised photo images onto bank cards. Marketing efforts in the former eastern bloc are beginning to pay off, says the company, with new markets established in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Other potentially profitable regions being targeted include Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Taiwan. In 1987 the company exported just 58 per cent of its Pounds 1.6m turnover, and this has grown to 86 per cent of last year's Pounds 5.4m sales total. Mr Richard Smith, managing director, says it is greatly to the credit of his 70-strong workforce that Oakwood's products are in daily use in high-volume card-producing nations such as the US, Canada and Western Europe.</p>

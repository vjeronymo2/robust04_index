			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Propaganda  Department of the CPC Central Committee and Ministry of Justice  recently issued a circular, calling on propaganda departments of  party committees and judicial administrative organs at all  levels to properly organize the propaganda of and education in  legal knowledge about a socialist market economy, to better  serve the establishment and improvement of a socialist market  economic system.    The circular noted: The "Decision on the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee clearly mapped out a  blueprint for China to establish a socialist market economic  system. It indicates that China combines efforts to promote the  economy as a whole with those to achieve breakthroughs at focal  points, thereby entering a new phase in carrying out the reform  of its economic system. Progress sets a demand on us to  accelerate legislation of economic laws and, furthermore, to  learn how to use legal means to manage the economy as well as  other fields of endeavor. China has successively adopted and  amended a number of laws and regulations on the market economy  in recent years. A legal framework standardizing the socialist  market economy will take its initial shape in the next few  years, according to the objectives proposed by the current  National People's Congress for its work. It has become an  important and urgent mission to further successfully conduct  propaganda of and education in legal knowledge about the market  economy; and to enhance the vast numbers of cadres' and masses'  awareness of the market economy's legal system under the new  situation of accelerating the legislation of the laws on a  socialist market economy in China.    The circular called on propaganda departments of party  committees and judicial administrative organs at all levels to  have an adequate understanding of the importance of successfully  conducting propaganda of and education in legal knowledge about  the socialist market economy; to stress the need to do a good  job of publicizing and studying laws and regulations closely  related to the market economy in the last two years of the  "second five-year" plan for spreading legal knowledge; to  especially publicize in depth laws and regulations that have a  bearing on the immediate interests of the masses of people; and  to focus on the substance of laws and regulations on the market  economy during study of the laws on specialized trades and  professions.</p>

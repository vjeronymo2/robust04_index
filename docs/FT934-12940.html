			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Gardening: A roving eye on beds and borders - Robin Lane Fox follows the tracks of a TV camera in Kiftsgate Court JUST BEFORE the frost cuts off the garden's bright spots, I find myself standing in the right spot at the right time. Do not accuse me of being smug: you have been there, too, if you have been watching the television series on English countrywomen's gardens. The last but one episode looked at Kiftsgate Court in Gloucestershire, where the surviving two of three generations of gardening women were characteristically modest. From the programme, you might not have guessed how much we can all learn and enjoy from their accessible garden, maintained in the same female line for more than 70 years. Some 20,000 visitors probably agree with me, having propelled the takings at the gate to a record this year. In the mid-October sunshine, I followed the tracks of the TV camera in midsummer. Out of season, it is legitimate to pick, choose and be selfish. There is no longer the tension between being fair to the plan and the site as a whole, and trying to note down all the plans which you want for yourself, as if the garden was a lesson in shopping or an encounter with a master chef. In mid-October, the main shapes of the borders have died away; the forms of old trees may be appealing, but the owners did not often plant them for the particular effect of their last flourish while the garden around is dying. You can justly make for whatever plant takes your eye, and size it up for yourself, without such a context. Kiftsgate in mid-October no longer emerges from a haze of Chinese deutzias and striped old roses. Where the TV camera showed profusion, now there is a mixture of leaves on the turn and particular subjects with a long season which ask to be copied. Few of us will ever garden where our grandmother gardened before us, and not many of us enjoy the Kiftsgate range of soil and favourable micro-climate. Marginal plants are hardy, even at the top of their very steep hill. Others run wild in the soil. Away from the south-west, few of us can grow the glorious madrona tree, Arbutus menziesii, which is the queen of large-leaved evergreens and, so far, is indecently happy in this corner of Gloucestershire. Rather more of us have planted the famous white Kiftsgate rose; but those who visit it at home will fear for their safety. It has now run sky-high up two beech trees and the single plant has spread for several hundred yards, proving that it is totally unsuitable for most of the gardens where it has been planted. In your grandchildren's day, whole areas of previous cultivation will have disappeared in a monstrous thicket. At a simpler level, there are plants which stand out at this late season and encourage us all to want them. Sometimes, it is a matter of proving the right way to treat something. On the side of the house, I noticed out of season how the tall, yellow-flowered Moroccan brooms, Cytisus battandieri, have been pruned ruthlessly to a main framework after high summer. I have always been nervous about cutting too far into this silky/grey-leaved shrub for walls; but they have cut it for years at Kiftsgate and it flowers far better for a hard trim. Round the corner, I have learnt how to use a wonderful foliage plant. After the recent frosts, the sea-green Melianthus major may not be looking so noble, but they give it every chance at Kiftsgate by isolating it in a clay pot all to itself. The leaves are a superb, serrated sea-green with pale, apple-green flower stems which make me want to browse on them. In sheltered corners or against the walls of a botanic garden, this excellent plant often will live on through the years, being cut to the ground in cold winters. With me, it usually dies if left outdoors after mid-November. It has to go into a pot, but I now realise that it is five times as good if it is not battling for attention in mixed company. At Kiftsgate, one plant goes in one pot alone and has the impact of a good piece of sculpture. Nearer ground level, I picked and chose among ideas which most of us neglect or do not know. One of my successes this year has been a hardy white sorrel called Oxalis Bowles White, which derived from the great Bowles' garden at Enfield. It flowers for most of the summer, but I now see that Oxalis articulata would be almost as good and much easier for you to find. It is a favourite at Kiftsgate, where it flowers continuously at a height of 6in above leaves, like shamrock. Just round the corner, you encounter a good companion, the yellow-flowered flax, Linum arboreum, with its good, evergreen leaves, another long-lasting plant which the rest of us overlook nowadays. On the main terrace, the salvias are an important presence' but would any of them survive a winter? Yearly, the list grows, tempting us all towards the greenhouse side of the family. At Kiftsgate, however, the owners consider that the tall, hooded flowers of Salvia candelabrum are certainly hardy, encouraging me to try it wherever stems could come up through a bed to a height of 3-4ft. To one side spread the trailing groups of Geranium Buxton's Blue, reminding all visitors that this form is still the finest late-flowering variety to spread through a low undergrowth or run across the front of a border. The small-leaved Fuschia thymiflora is less familiar, but it has been hardy here for several years, like other small-flowered forms, and is a charming contrast to the last penstemons and the white flowers as second crop on the evergreen prostanthera. In the late sunshine, did anything turn up for those everyday problems, a semi-shaded corner or the difficult dry ground under trees? The latter runs all down Kiftsgate's steep slope between the upper and lower gardens of its hillside site: hardy cyclamen are one spectacular answer, but the other is the lesser-known Campanula latiloba. The violet-flowered Highcliffe form has run for years on this steep slope in dry soil: I first copied it nearly 30 years ago and have now added the good white form and the mauve one called Hidcote Amethyst. Young plants need to be dead-headed quickly in order to encourage the side growth, but they do make tough mats of fresh leaves which send up flower stems about 2ft high, even in the bone-dry ground below a hedge. You need to see them in a garden as old as this one to feel confident that they are so tough. In semi-shade, I go first for Japanese anemones, pink and especially white: after Kiftsgate, I now think of them with one of the tough, lace-cap hydrangeas called Preziosa and fresh, evergreen skimmias and clumps of the curious tricyrtis, or toad lilies. The Plantfinder lists 26 varieties of this late-blooming beauty, the flowers of which usually are spotted so as to resemble a toad's skin with purple markings. They need slight moisture throughout the year and a lightly-shaded aspect, but they are not all difficult so long as you do not ram them with a fork before they wake up early in summer. After the main season, great gardens with continuity through generations outclass the rest of us because they can show such plants at settled maturity and include such a range that you can pick and choose happily on a slow walk during an afternoon. When we film them, we always seem to do so in the full flush of summer, or their best season. We are either restricted to close-ups or such personal detail or eccentricity as the owner can be coaxed into releasing for the occasion. Very few people who love and understand gardens will ever make feature films: they prefer to garden and be left alone. As a result, it is always worth following the camera's footsteps and seeing for yourself what has been elided for the sake of an idea of what the public is prepared to enjoy.</p>

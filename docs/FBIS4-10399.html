			<p>BFN     [Text] Evans Paul, mayor of Port-au-Prince and National  Front for Change and Democracy spokesman, criticizes the authors  of the resolution for enforcement of Article 149 of the  Constitution. It is the coup d'etat logic that continues,  Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul told the Haitian Press Agency  regarding the 10 April vote by the Senate [office] led by  Bernard Sansaricq for a resolution relating to the reenforcement  of the Constitution. It is a masquerade without legal  foundation, by individuals with no electoral legitimacy, who do  not respect any logic, he adds, explaining that their objective  is to work for the ruin of the people and to guarantee  themselves continued illicit wealth.    Paul further stated that the international community will  not  back this undertaking, which is already doomed to failure and  which will most likely result in reinforcement of the sanctions.    After accusing the authors of the resolution and their  allies  of responsibility for the misfortunes of the country, Mr. Paul  noted that no one has acknowledged Sansaricq as president of the  Senate. Neither have the parliamentarians stemming from the  contested 18 January [1993] elections, whose fate depends on the  verdict of the arbitration committee provided for by the Haitian  Constitution, been acknowledged as senators.</p>

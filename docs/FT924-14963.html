			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Sterling's rally encourages short and medium gilts A RALLY in sterling lifted prices in the short and medium-dated gilts, though the long end of the market remained in the doldrums. Dealers said yesterday's improvement was partly a technical correction after the market was oversold on Monday. Trading conditions proved volatile yesterday, with the long gilt future opening up  11/32 at 95.16, before falling back to close at 94.30. But the shorter end of the market performed well, recording gains of as much as  3/8 point. 'Sterling holds the key at the moment,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew. The improvement in sterling revived hopes that a further reduction in interest rates would be possible sooner rather than later. The short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange gained 6 basis points to close at 91.75. However, dealers expected trading conditions to remain volatile at least until firm details of the government's economic policy emerge following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism. The market will listen keenly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech tomorrow for hints of the form the new economic policy will take. HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets continued their meteoric fall yesterday. Italian government bonds shed 1 1/2 points, as the lira dived yesterday morning, but recovered some ground later in the day. Spanish bonds fared poorly, recording losses of 1 3/8 points. Non-resident selling pressure pushed prices down further, as fears of a peseta devaluation and worries about the lifting of capital controls depressed sentiment further. Dealers said liquidity in the Spanish bond market was particularly poor. GERMAN bund prices were forced to surrender some of the gains that they made on Monday, ending  1/4 point lower. Dealers said the market had got ahead of itself, but sentiment remained positive. The new 10-year 7 1/4 per cent bund issue met firm demand, dealers said. The results are due to be announced today. Although the rush of buying seen on Monday appeared to have dried up, German bunds are expected to retain their safe haven status, since economic fundamentals remain favourable. The German bund future on Liffe closed at 91.38, down from Monday's close of 91.70. DUTCH bonds fell back after their opening rise, following a steep fall in German bund futures. Dealers said bond prices had gone too high and fell back as stock market turbulence faded. An increased supply from tap issue had also brought prices down, dealers said. BELGIUM will issue a new state loan aimed at private investors between November 12 and November 18, the Belgian Finance Ministry said, Reuter reports from Brussels. The maturity, coupon and issue price will be set later. The previous state loan in June raised BFr58.5bn and one in February brought in BFr66bn. FRENCH bond prices fell a further half point yesterday, as benefits from the fall in stock prices on Monday evaporated. Dealers said the concerns of currency weakness continued to preoccupy the market. The OAT future on the Matif ended 0.58 point down at 108.56. JAPANESE bonds again performed inversely to the stock market, gaining ground during early stock market weakness, then falling back when equity prices rallied later in the day. The JGB future on Liffe ended unchanged at 106.87, in thin trade. LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on disappointment that the Federal Reserve's monthly federal open market committee (FOMC), which met during the day, did not ease monetary policy to help the ailing economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at 98, yielding 7.411 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at 100 17/32 to carry a yield of 3.735 per cent. In the absence of economic news, the market's attention was focused on yesterday's FOMC meeting. Speculation has mounted in recent days that the FOMC would sanction another cut in interest rates (possibly a 25 basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate and a 50 basis-point reduction in the discount rate) to lift the apparently stalled economic recovery. A policy ease has been partly discounted by the market, and the lack of a move from the Fed yesterday meant that some of those gains had to be given back.</p>

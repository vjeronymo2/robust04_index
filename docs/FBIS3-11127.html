			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Rodolfo Robles -- the first one he </F> has granted since he and his family were granted political  asylum in Argentina in May 1992 -- by Carlos M. Reymundo Roberts  at Robles' apartment in the Palermo neighborhood of Buenos Aires  City; date not given]    [Text] [Roberts] What is your opinion of the sentence  handed down by the military court [on the murder case involving  nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University in  Lima, Peru]?    [Robles] This has been a step forward because it presupposes  the acknowledgement that the murder was indeed committed, as had  been charged. Nevertheless, only the ones who committed the  murder were punished -- the Colina group from the National  Intelligence Services (SIN). The mastermind behind the murder  -- Presidential Aide Vladimiro Montesinos -- and the person who  executed his commands -- General Nicolas Hermoza, the chairman  of the Armed Forces Joint Command -- emerged unscathed.    [Roberts] How do you know that Montesinos ordered the  murder?    [Robles] Because that group answers directly to him. What  the sentence says, namely that it was a "personal initiative  without having been ordered by their superior" is not true.    [Roberts] What is the reason for such brutal murder at La  Cantuta University?    [Robles] Those people are completely deranged and Montesinos  hired them precisely because they have no scruples. They seem  to have no principles at all. They feel powerful because they  have the backing of the country's rulers and think it makes no  difference whether they kill sheep or people.    [Roberts] Was there any proof that the university students  were involved in terrorist activities?    [Robles] No, that allegation has never been proved. They  were not found in possession of subversive literature, weapons,  or leaflets ... They offered no resistance! They were most  brutally abducted and murdered. Their bodies were then  quartered and burned. The sadism in this action has nothing to  do with the way the true Peruvian Army acts.    [Roberts] What was Gen. Hermoza responsible for?    [Robles] It is my considered opinion that he was implicated  in this affair because the Colina group operation was supported  by several units that answer directly to him. In such a special  operation, one that entailed entering a university, no general  would have dared take a step without being authorized to do so.    [Roberts] Did any of the military who were found guilty not  plead during the trial that they were obeying orders from their  superiors?    [Robles] It seems that they did not, but their attitude is  quite understandable -- there are many ways to coerce a person  into submission through promises, blackmail, threats ... They  are well aware that intelligence services have their own rules  of conduct and that they can pay very dearly if they happen to  ignore them.    [Roberts] Do you believe that the sentences have been very  lenient?    [Robles] Had they been tried by a civilian court, the  sentences would have in all likelihood been much more severe.  The truth is that the crimes they committed -- labeled homicide  because there was no violent clash between them -- do not exist  in the Military Justice Code. Hence, they had to somehow make  these crimes fit in there so that the military could be tried by  a military court.    [Roberts] Was it an obvious case of civilian jurisdiction?    [Robles] Absolutely. The law passed by Congress to remove  the case from a civilian court was most aberrant and cast  discredit on the rule of law in Peru. It was a gross  interference by the legislative branch in the realm of the  judiciary. A specific law was passed for this trial which goes  against all legal regulations. Congress bowed to this trick  because it is in the hands of a group of cowardly and obsequious  people who are at Fujimori's beck and call.    This law was enacted when it seemed imminent that the  Supreme  Court was going to rule that a civilian court had to hear the  case. Overcome by despair, they urgently convened a session of  Congress -- even obliging those deputies who were on holiday to  be present at the debates -- and passed the law. It was such a  scandal that the U.S. and German Governments strongly protested,  and the prime minister had to resign.    This laid bare the fact that the belief that there is a  democracy in Peru is totally erroneous. What we have is a  dictatorship by Fujimori propped up by a military coterie.    [Roberts] Some contend that Vladimiro Montesinos is a sort  of  black monk who wields as much -- or more -- power than the  president himself.    [Robles] That is true -- many of the changes, the true  quakes  that are taking place in our institutions, have been the work of  his hand.    As is public knowledge, Montesinos is a former Army captain  who has protected drug traffickers. In fact, he has not severed  his ties with them. He was cashiered from the Army following  his conviction for treason, as he had sold confidential  documents to other countries.    [Roberts] Can it be said that human rights are  systematically  violated in Peru?    [Robles] The Colina group -- not the Army -- has indeed been  violating human rights in a systematic way. Hiding themselves  under the false colors of countersubversive struggle, they are  involved in these criminal actions, which in many cases are  perpetrated to eliminate those who oppose the government.    [Roberts] Do you agree with Fujimori in the sense that  Shining Path is about to be routed?    [Robles] I hope so because they are the worst scourge we  have  ever had. Nevertheless, it is quite difficult. This is an  overly triumphant attitude by Fujimori in order to be  re-elected. The Shining Path continues to wreak havoc in our  country.</p>

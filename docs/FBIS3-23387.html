In a statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT yesterday, the movement said that one of its units  carried out the operation, in which 'Ali Hasan al-Majid  sustained leg and hand injuries and his aide, Police Major Salih  Arjah, and two guards were killed outside the Iraqi defense  minister's home in Baghdad.    The statement said that the nucleus of the IFROM was formed  before Saddam Husayn's forces invaded Kuwait and that it  includes a group of senior officers and soldiers, including  prominent officers in important positions.    The statement added that 136 IFROM officers and soldiers  have  been martyred in operations against the regime's forces and that  in the first two months of this year it distributed thousands of  antiregime leaflets in the camps of al-Rashid, al-Taji,  al-Suwayrah, al-Rashidiyah, and Khan Bani-Sa'id.    It urged the Iraqi opposition forces to unite and end their  political rivalry, and it stressed that the desired change  should emanate from within Iraq and from within the Armed Forces.    It also said that it strives for a truly democratic regime  in  Iraq, for Iraq's return to the Arab fold, for fraternal and  good-neighborly relations with the neighboring states, and for  the reconstruction of a strong Iraqi economy.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: BP Its first quarterly net loss aside, BP's results were depressing confirmation that the group appears bent on maintaining its dividend at the expense of shrinking itself. The quarterly payout accounted for 40 per cent of a Pounds 544m net cash outflow before financing. The result was that gearing rose to 85 per cent and may rise again this quarter. BP may have been influenced by the big US oil companies, all of which held their dividends despite a dismal first quarter. Its peculiar problem is that it entered the downturn with a relatively weak balance sheet which has gone on deteriorating. A cost-cutting programme should make the group more able to compete with its peers. But capital spending will fall this year and next, whole divisions are marked for sale and management is praying for a recovery in the oil price. Even if that unlikely event occurs, margins will be slow to respond. Shareholders are already being offered a payout which is falling in real terms, so it is scarcely surprising that BP shares have underperformed the market by a fifth this year. A nominal cut in the dividend would doubtless hit the shares harder again. But arguably investors would be better served in the long run by a reduction in the payout to a level which BP's cash flow can bear. Whether BP can bring itself to bite the bullet is another matter.</p>

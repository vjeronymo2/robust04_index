			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The prime minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's  official visit to the Philippines, the first by a Malaysian  premier to that country, is already yielding results. The  Philippine Government is keen and serious about enhancing trade  relations with Malaysia. And this should be the case with  [words indistinct] ASEAN. In response to Dr. Mahathir and his  delegation's visit to the Philippines in February, a  high-powered multimember delegation from the Philippines paid a  two-day visit last weekend to the Federal Territory of Labuan  off the East Malaysian state of Sabah. The Philippine delegation  was truly interested in knowing more about the development of  Labuan as an offshore financial center and also about foreign  investment opportunities in both the East Malaysian states of  Sabah and Sarawak. What is encouraging is that the visit showed  the commitment of the Philippine Government to the development  of the East ASEAN Growth Area. The visiting mission was given a  detailed briefing on the investment opportunities available in  Labuan as well as in Sabah and Sarawak.    It is noteworthy that the Philippine delegation's visit was  the first by a well-represented government and private sector  mission from that country. What seemed to interest them was the  function of Labuan as an international offshore financial  center, or IOFC. The delegation included a group of bankers who  appreciated the IOFC concept being adopted in Labuan. The  president of the Philippine National Bank has been quoted as  saying his bank was considering setting up an offshore bank in  Labuan. The bank would like to finalize joint financial  undertakings not only with the Malaysian Government but also  with the private sector.    Cooperation between the Philippines and Malaysia is  certainly  on the way up. One of Malaysia's leading companies is currently  involved in the development of infrastructure in the  Philippines. Malaysian participation in the power supply, stock  development, and telecommunication sector will also be welcomed  in the Philippines. [Words indistinct], both countries can help  each other to promote their respective tourism industry. The  idea of setting up a regional air link needs serious  consideration. The visit by the Philippine president, Fidel  Ramos, to Malaysia last year and the reciprocal visit by Dr.  Mahathir have opened the way for increased cooperation between  the two ASEAN partners. The private sector of the two countries  should take this opportunity to go into joint ventures for their  mutual benefit.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Business in the Community (7): Stimulus for pupils and teachers - Schools and colleges are a prime field for involvement THE Mary Rose is not the first thing one associates with engineering. But for Roy Hedges, a consulting structural engineer who worked on the Mary Rose project, describing the recovery of Henry VIII's flagship to fourth formers at Bullers Wood School for Girls in Chislehurst, Kent, was among the most rewarding events in his first year as one of the school's 'neighbourhood engineers'. 'The strongest bias against technology comes from the parents', says Mr Hedges, partner in a Bromley firm of structural engineers and one of 6,000 neighbourhood engineers attached to 1,600 secondary schools across the country. 'Yougsters have a better idea of what engineering is about than their parents - who see it as dirty hands and overalls. Our job is to break the stereotypes.' To help do so, Mr Hedges has arranged work experience schemes in his company for several pupils, and is a frequent visitor to the school - talking, for instance, to third years about to make GCSE option choices. It is much appreciated by the school: 'for 10 years we have encouraged girls to take maths and science seriously', says Mrs Barbara Vanderstock, the head teacher. The neighbourhood engineers scheme, run by the Engineering Council*, is just one of many activities supported by Business in the Community** in its quest to get business to play a more active role on the education scene. 'Education is number one item on the agenda of many member companies,' says Ian Pearce, BIC's education director. 'We are keen to move business on from sponsorship to people power - commiting expertise to schools and colleges, actually getting employees to help with curriculum projects or to act as governors, management consultants and mentors. BIC has set up a 'leadership team' under Michael Heron, Unilever's personnel director, to provide vision and national focus on what business can do with educators to increase opportunities for all young people. Working through Britain's 150 Education Business Partnerships (EBPs) - comprising local representatives of business, local education authorities, schools and colleges - BIC sees its main task as raising the level of corporate activity in schools and colleges. It could hardly start from a lower base. Only one in 10companies currently engages in educational partnership worth the name - and often that is pure tokenism. BIC wants company top brass to consider what they could do - and ought to be doing - under headings like these. Compacts. Compacts are bargains between young people, employers and schools/colleges, by which employers agree to give training or employment priority to young people who meet targets for attendance, punctuality, exam results and so on. Compact centres - 62 of them in inner cities nationwide, attached to local BEPs and Training and Enterprise Councils - act as contacts and matchmakers. Ken Young, deputy chairman of the Post Office, sees compacts as 'one of our best investments of time and talent into community projects - showing benefits for employers and school leavers alike.' Teacher placements in industry. Since 1977 a teacher placement service, now sponsored jointly by the CBI and the employment department, has organised short stints in companies for teachers and education administrators. The scheme is well-organised and expanding, with 141 placement organisers setting up links between schools and businesses across the country. Nearly 30,000 teachers did placements last year, most of them lasting about a week. 'I have come away from this week with so many ideas as a result of my time with London Buses', says Pam Riley of Blackfen School for Girls in the TPS blurb, 'that I and another teacher on placement are producing a schools maths workshop pack based on London buses'. The teacher placement office in Oxford*** has details - and is on the lookout for sponsors. Placements are well supported by briefing, with special study and video packs for those embarking on them. 'It is a very individual service', says Jan Hussey, TPR's information officer. 'The main problem area is modern languages, where it is hard to find companies with a relevant department'. The aim is to give 10 per cent of teachers direct business experience each year leading to long term development in teaching and the management of schools.' Secondments. BEPs need full-time staff, and company secondees are the ideal recruits. At present some 40 companies secondees - from Barclays Bank to the Royal Mail - have staff on secondment: far more are needed to work with education institutions and help develop quality activities with local industries. Alan Hodges of Marks &amp; Spencer spent two years as co-director of Mid-Glamorgan EBP learning much about local education and corporate responsibility before promotion to run the Swindon. School governors. Britain's 25,000 schools need from eight to 18 governors apiece - and more than half of them, under recent legislation, must be either parents or co-optees with relevant experience. John Patten, the new education secretary, recently launched a 'schools need governors' campaign, urging employers to give employees time off with no loss of pay to become governors. 'Employers cannot complain at the output of schools if they do not offer their employees the opportunity to become governors,' he told an assembled crowd of business and education leaders. Curriculum enhancement. Companies provide resources, access to plant and volunteer employees to work with teachers on new courses and with pupils as mentors. Esso has helped with the School Curriculum Industry partnership to work with primary schools and publish guidance on 'Industry and the Curriculum 5-14.' Quality work experience. Every young person needs access to challenging work roles to help understand about industry, the world of work and career opportunities. Rover gives annual awards to the best school programmes. It is often supposed that teachers and parents alone make schools tick. But business can make learning more realistic, exciting and relevant to youngsters. Britain's top five per cent of pupils lead the world, but the others are less competitive. If Britain is to recruit and train staff to operate new technologies of modern business, a lot more than one in 10 companies will have to play a part in education. * Details from the Engineering Council, 10 Maltravers St, London WC2R 3ER. ** Business in the Community, 227a City Road, London EC1V 1LX. *** Teacher Placement Service, Sun Alliance House, New Inn Hall St., Oxford</p>

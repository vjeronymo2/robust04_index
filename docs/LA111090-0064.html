			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CHULA VISTA TOPPLES SWEETWATER TO EARN THIRD CONSECUTIVE METRO TITLE  </P> <P> All season long, the student bodies at Chula Vista and Sweetwater high schools  viewed the season finale as The Game in the Metro Conference. They figured --  just like old times -- the county's longest continuous rivalry (43 years) to  decide the league race would be a doozy.  </P> <P> They were right . . . until the final 24 minutes or so. Then it was all Chula  Vista.  </P> <P> The Spartans won their third consecutive Metro championship by beating  Sweetwater, 28-6, in front of about 4,000 at Sweetwater. Chula Vista, ranked  sixth in the county, will head to the playoffs 8-2, 7-0. Sweetwater, ranked  seventh, is 7-3, 6-2. The Red Devils, who slipped to third behind Southwest  (8-2, 6-1), should make the playoffs as an at-large team.  </P> <P> Sweetwater (averaging 29.8 points per game) and Chula Vista (27) came into the  game ranked fourth and eighth in the county, respectively, in scoring offense,  but it took 23:55 for either team to score.  </P> <P> With five seconds left in the first half, Neviett Richardson (12 carries, 60  yards) scampered in from the five-yard line for a 7-0 Spartan lead. Using the  same play -- an off-tackle blast Chula Vista calls "56 power" -- Richardson ran  for 17 yards on the previous play. A few seconds before that Chula Vista faced  a fourth and 10 at the 32 with 53 seconds left, but Sweetwater called a  timeout. After an offsides penalty, quarterback Brandon Gregg (five carries, 72  yards) ran 10 yards on an option keeper.  </P> <P> To begin the second half, Chula Vista's Winfield Scott and LeMar Bailey teamed  for a 49-yard kickoff return on a reverse. Steve Gomez, who rushed for 118  yards to give him a league-leading 1,119, then carried five, 10 and 30 yards  for a touchdown down the right sideline, and the rout was on. JIM LINDGREN  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Curb set on use of Lloyd's reserves THE GOVERNMENT is to amend the Finance Bill to ensure withdrawals by Lloyd's Names from new tax-free reserves may be made only to fund losses. Though this was always the government's intention, Labour had criticised the original proposals for failing to set explicit restrictions on the circumstances in which withdrawals could be made. Labour yesterday welcomed the government's amendment - tabled ahead of Monday's Commons report stage - saying it was exactly what it had been arguing for. The move followed undertakings by ministers in committee stage to incorporate the suggested change if a 'legitimate' way could be found of doing so. The arrangements set out in the Budget do nothing to help Names on the troubled insurance market who have already been hit by heavy losses. But they will allow them to establish tax-free reserves against heavy losses they may incur in the future. Under the new arrangements - which come into in effect to cover the 1992 underwriting year - Names will be able to transfer up to 50 per cent of profits to the new reserve each year, provided the value of the funds in the reserve does not exceed 50 per cent of the Name's overall premium income limit. Amounts withdrawn will be made to fund losses or cash calls. Withdrawals not used to meet losses will attract tax.</p>

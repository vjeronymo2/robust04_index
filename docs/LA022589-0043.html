			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR THE RAPPERS' BOYCOTT  </P> <P> I admire the position taken by the three rap acts in boycotting the Grammy  Awards ("Grammy Nominees in Rap Promise Boycott," Feb. 10). I wished in past  years that the jazz artists and jazz labels had the courage to do the same. For  years, I had fought with the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences  to include at least one jazz artist on the telecast, but they couldn't be  bothered with jazz -- ironically, when Mike Melvoin, a self-professed jazz  musician, was president of NARAS.  </P> <P> It wasn't sour grapes as far as winning Grammys, because I had produced on  Verve and Pablo Records 22 Grammy-winning albums (with Ella, Basie, Dizzy,  Oscar Peterson, et. al.). It was insulting that artists of this importance and  quality were not given the same telecast exposure as pop and rock artists and  in frustration I resigned from NARAS, having been a member since its inception.  </P> <P> As your report stated, Pierre Cossette is still coming up with the same tired  excuses that there are too many categories; thus, he cannot find room for rap  nominees, as he couldn't for jazz. Cossette and NARAS continue to equate  quantity of sales with quality of music.  </P> <P> Once again my hat's off to the rappers, who in their first year on the Grammy  Awards conducted themselves with dignity.  </P> <P> NORMAN GRANZ  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

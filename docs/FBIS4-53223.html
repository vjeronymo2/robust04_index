			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Guest report: "BAe Wins 39m pound Seoul Arms Deal"] </F>   [Text] Seoul -- South Korea decided yesterday to award a  39 million pound contract to equip its destroyers with command  and firing control systems to a joint British-French company.    The Surface Ship Combat System Mark 7 (SSCS), made by  BAe-Sema [British Aerospace-French Electronics Group] processes  battle data, enabling a destroyer to detect, target and  neutralise enemy vessels before they can retaliate.    South Korea's Defence Ministry said it chose BAe-Sema's  system over a rival German model, Cosys-200 Kl, because the  British product is better value, has superior logistical support  and because the Royal Navy had decided to develop a compatible  system.    The deal may be a sign that Seoul's arms procurement  programme is being revived after a bribery scandal left it  paralysed last year.    Seoul had been expected to opt for the SSCS Mk7 last summer  but the Defence Ministry said the decision was delayed "due to  problems arising from the credibility of the British  manufacturer".    Military analysts believe the real reason for the delay was  quite different. At the time the deal was being discussed, the  reformist government of President Kim yong-sam was conducting a  colossal purge of the remnants of the previous military-backed  regime.    In the purge last year, 39 generals, two former defence  ministers and a former naval chief of staff were sacked,  reprimanded or jailed for "selling" promotions or taking  kickbacks from arms manufacturers.    At such a time, no one wanted to be seen signing a  multi-million-pound purchase order for fear that prosecutors  might question their motives and subject their personal finances  to an audit.    Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the government spent a third  of its budget on defence to deter any possible aggression from  the hostile North.    The volume of money that was poured into the South Korean  military was matched by the secrecy surrounding the way it was  spent. Parliament had no right to scrutinise the military  accounts, and corruption among senior officers was consequently  rife.    Few high-ranking members of the old military government  would  emerge unscathed from a rigorous financial probe.</p>

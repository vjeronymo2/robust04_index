			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / National Heritage lists reinforced-concrete silo as Grade II Imperial Chemical Industries has recently discovered a much undervalued company asset - a reinforced-concrete silo which the National Heritage Department has just listed as Grade II, starred, Chris Tighe writes. The 63-year-old building beside the River Tees near Billingham went unremarked for decades until spotted by English Heritage inspectors. It used to store phosphate rock but is currently being let to a freight company. ICI Results, Page 25</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cuomo's defeat hits Lilco shares Shares in the Long Island Lighting Company, a private-sector US electricity company, tumbled by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4 in early trading, a decline of more than 8 per cent, following the defeat of Mr Mario Cuomo, the state's Democratic governor, in the US mid-term elections. Last month Mr Cuomo proposed to buy out Lilco's shareholders at Dollars 21.50 a share and take the the company into state ownership in an attempt to cut electricity bills. However, the plan looks unlikely to go ahead under New York's new Republican governor, Mr George Pataki. Mr Cuomo said Lilco's electricity rates, the highest in the US, would fall by 10 per cent if the company were nationalised because it would no longer have to pay federal taxes or shareholder dividends. Later this month Lilco's electricity rates are due to be reviewed, but the New York Public Service Commission, the state body that sets electricity rates, is not expected to permit any increase. Shareholders fear the result will be declining company profits and a cut in the dividend.</p>

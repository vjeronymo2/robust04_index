			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: IN THE CITY OF ANGLES  </P> <P> On any given day in L.A., several thousand people are sitting around trying to  figure out a way to make everyone feel better.  </P> <P> Not feeling better by looking better, although that too has become a kind of  cottage industry in the City of Angles.  </P> <P> We're not talking fanny tucks and breast implants here.  </P> <P> We're talking emotional health. We're talking smile, man, and hum a little  tune, woman, though you might be overweight and flat-chested and, God knows,  that nose could use some work.  </P> <P> We're talking don't worry, be happy.  </P> <P> What brings this to mind today is Friendpower, the latest means of  simultaneously enhancing your feeling of self-worth while making a little money  for the guy with your happiness at heart.  </P> <P> Friendpower is the idea of Allan Colman, a former Fresno County administrative  officer who has come south in an effort to crash L.A.'s booming feel-good  market by taking us back to a better place in time.  </P> <P> He isn't alone. I hear from feel-good people all the time from Bellflower to  Malibu, and I generally give their efforts a try.  </P> <P> I have squeezed sponges, floated freely, hallucinated and marched around the  living room to mind-bending music in an effort to make myself feel better.  </P> <P> Always, however, I am hounded by reality. The last effort I made to feel better  ended with the 6 o'clock news telling me our milk cows take drugs and our oat  bran health cookies are useless.  </P> <P> If you can't trust milk and cookies, what's left?  </P> <P> Allan Colman and Friendpower are left.  </P> <P> What struck me first about Colman is that he is very clean. This may not seem  important to you, but when you've been around as much scum as I have over the  years, you come to appreciate a person who is well-scrubbed.  </P> <P> Colman is so clean he glows. I like that.  </P> <P> Also, I was impressed with the simplicity of his notion. All you've got to do  is remember something good and it makes you feel a little better.  </P> <P> He calls it a "self-guided reflective tour." It's a term applied in order to  establish Friendpower's credibility. No one's going to pay to attend a  self-help seminar advertised as Remembering Something Good.  </P> <P> Colman is 48 and the holder of a doctorate in public administration from New  York University. As Fresno's chief administrative officer from 1979 to 1983, he  was responsible for 6,000 employees.  </P> <P> At first, he says, he was a typical boss. When someone had a problem he'd tell  him, in effect, to shape up or ship out. As such, he was not unlike most  employers who, with characteristic insight, would respond to a worker's stress  by canning him.  </P> <P> Then, however, he began to discover it was more productive to get his people to  relax than it was to throw them out a window, an idea that continues to elude  the mass of those on a supervisorial level.  </P> <P> Colman discussed this with a psychiatrist friend who had been using the memory  of pleasant events to alter current moods. Combining that with his own  experience, Colman came up with Friendpower.  </P> <P> He describes it as a series of techniques that will "bring a little fun back"  from the past and put it in the future, using, among other memories, those of  former friends. Hence, friend-power. Get it?  </P> <P> The precise nature of those techniques are, of course, what you will pay to  learn at his seminars.  </P> <P> After my discussion with Colman, I decided to give my limited understanding of  Friendpower a try by recalling pleasant events with pleasant people.  </P> <P> Colman uses recollections of young love to relieve stress. He remembers his  first boy-girl party, when they held hands and toasted marshmallows. Not at the  same time, of course, but at the same party.  </P> <P> I tried, but I don't think we bothered with marshmallows or hand-holding in  East Oakland. All I can remember is Gloria Mack under the bleachers at  Castlemont High.  </P> <P> It was said that Gloria knew things about the human body they weren't even  teaching in biology yet. She was far ahead of her time.  </P> <P> Gloria Mack isn't her real name, by the way. For all I know she may be teaching  biology at Castlemont today.  </P> <P> Back then, she used to hang around the bleachers after school waiting for  football players to run by, like a moray eel looking for stray fish.  </P> <P> I didn't play football, but I sauntered by one day and Gloria pounced.  </P> <P> I fled in terror after she explained in some detail what she had in mind. I  wasn't ready for all that. I don't think I ever have been.  </P> <P> Thinking about Gloria put me in a cold sweat. Allan Colman was right in one  sense. While I wasn't necessarily feeling any better, I sure wasn't worried  about whatever came on the 6 o'clock news.  </P> <P> I can't even remember it.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 21 (CNA) -- Domestic farmers will  suffer greatly from Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT), according to a study published Tuesday  [21 June]. The study, conducted by Professor Peng Tzuo-kuei of  National Chung Hsing University under the Commission of the  Council of Agriculture, found that the opening of the domestic  rice market could mean an income loss to farmers of at least 20  percent within six years.    Taiwan must gradually open its various markets to smooth its  bid to join GATT, which is expected by the end of the year. The  government is currently mulling over how best to accomplish a  rice-market opening in line with GATT while sparing Taiwan rice  farmers extensive harm.    Professor Peng's study says that if Taiwan adopts the  "Japanese formula," which allows rice imports of up to 4 percent  of domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and  gradually increases the imports to 8 percent in the sixth year,  farm losses could top NT [New Taiwan] $2.6 billion (US$95.94  million) by the year 2000. If the "Korean formula" is adopted,  the study says, Taiwan farmers are expected to suffer a loss of  NT$3.2 billion (US$118.08 million) by the year 2004. Under the  Korean formula, rice imports will account for only 1 percent of  domestic consumption in the first year of market opening and the  import ratio will rise to 4 percent in the 10th year. Farm  losses will be even higher if expected reductions in government  farm subsidies were included in the figures, the study notes.    The professor recommended that the government lower its  guaranteed purchase price of rice by 20 percent in six years to  comply with the GATT Uruguay round codes reached last December.  The study was the first analysis of the negative impact the  opening of the rice market will have on Taiwan farmers.</p>

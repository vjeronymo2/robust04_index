			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UTAH STATE NEXT STOP FOR HAMPTON  </P> <P> Three Glendale College football players have committed to four-year schools and  will transfer in a few weeks at the semester break, Glendale Coach John Cicuto  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Running back Sean Hampton, a graduate of Sylmar High, will attend Utah State.  </P> <P> Hampton rushed for 760 yards and seven touchdowns last season for Glendale and  also caught 11 passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns. In 1988, Hampton gained  1,150 yards and scored 13 touchdowns and was an All-Western State Conference  selection.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Pat Lynch, who played at Burroughs High, will attend San Jose  State. Lynch had 39 receptions for 581 yards and five touchdowns this season.  </P> <P> Mark MacMillan, an all-state defensive back for the Vaqueros in 1988, chose  Alabama over USC.  </P> <P> The Trojans might have lost MacMillan, but they gained an offensive lineman  when Reseda High's Jason Keiderling orally committed to USC. Keiderling (6-5,  255), an All-City 3-A Division selection, had scheduled trips to Cal, Oregon,  Stanford and UCLA but canceled them after committing to USC.  </P> <P> Keiderling said that he liked USC's winning tradition and its strong academic  program in business. He carries a 3.4 grade-point average and said that he has  scored 1,130 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  </P></p>

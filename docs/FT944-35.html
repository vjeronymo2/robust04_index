			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (10): A Sipp will cost less and allow you to have more control - Pensions for high earners Employees, the self-employed and business partners who can afford to pay Pounds 5,000 a year or more into their personal plan, and who want greater control over the investment process, should consider a self-invested personal pension (Sipp). The key feature of this product is that it separates the two main functions usually combined under a typical life office plan - namely, the investment management and administration. This adds considerable flexibility to the arrangement. First, you can manage the investments yourself, although most people prefer to appoint a stockbroker. Second, you can see exactly what you are paying for the administration and investment management, whereas the cost of these functions can be blurred under a standard plan. Third, if you are unhappy with the performance, you can change the investment manager yet leave the underlying administration in place. This avoids the early termination penalties that often apply when you stop payments to regular-premium personal pensions. Eddy Woore, manager for personal plans with pension provider Pointon York, said: 'For investors prepared to contribute Pounds 5,000 or more to their plan, the flat-rate charges associated with Sipps are definitely cheaper than the percentage charges imposed by conventional plans. Moreover there are no policy conditions, so you can transfer out or retire early without penalty.' Only a few providers offer the administration and legal package you need to run a Sipp. Pointon York and Personal Pension Management (PPM) specialise in this market, while several firms of stockbrokers, solicitors and chartered accountants have launched their own Sipps. Most use PPM's legal and administration services. Investment management charges will vary, but for the basic shell Pointon York charges a Pounds 600 set-up fee and a Pounds 400 annual management charge. PPM has several charging structures, depending on the level of service required. For the full service you would pay a combined set-up and annual management charge of Pounds 800 in the first year and an annual management charge of Pounds 400 thereafter. If you are only interested in investment trusts, then the fee would be Pounds 456 for the first year and Pounds 228 thereafter. As a rule of thumb, the investment trust Sipp is cost-effective for annual contributions of Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000 or more. The rules on Sipp contribution limits and benefits are the same as those for personal pensions, but there the similarity ends. Most conventional plans allow you to invest only in the provider's funds, although one or two offer links to other investment managers. Mr Woore commented: 'Some personal pension plans give you access to external funds, but usually there is an extra annual management charge which makes this route very expensive. With a Sipp, there is no second tier of annual charges.' Under a Sipp, you can invest in: Stocks and shares (eg, equities, gilts, debentures) quoted on the UK Stock Exchange, and including securities on the Unlisted Securities Market; Stocks and shares traded on a recognised overseas stock exchange; Unit trusts and investment trusts; Offshore funds (recognised by the Securities and Investments Board); Insurance company managed funds and unit-linked funds; Deposit accounts; and Commercial property. Professional firms find commercial property an attractive option. A Sipp fund cannot purchase a firm's existing business premises from the partnership, but it can buy new offices into which the partnership can move, provided the property is leased back on a commercial basis. Furthermore, a Sipp can borrow on the strength of the pension fund, to help with property purchase, although it cannot lend part of the pension fund to scheme members.</p>

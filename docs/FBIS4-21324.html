			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["st."-signed report: "Marijuana in Ketchup"] </F>   [Text] Vienna/Schwechat -- A suitcase with stinking fish,  a putrid steppe animal, and African fruits from Lagos: At  Vienna-Schwechat Airport, the drug squad headed by Colonel  Alfred Rupf checked the strange luggage, where the four large  ketchup cans were probably supposed to attract the least amount  of attention. In fact, however, 19 kg of marijuana packed in  plastic bags were found in the sauce. A suspect, who wanted to  pick up the luggage, is under arrest.</p>

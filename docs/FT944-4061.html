			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (16): Cardiff Bay 'key to city's development for five to 10 years' - Cardiff Region / The regeneration of 2,700 acres of docklands gained impetus this year with the start of work on the barrage Cardiff Bay is the key now to the next five to 10 years of Cardiff's development,' says Mr Peter Kelly of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the property adviser. The bay is inevitably the most eyecatching project in south Wales. The regeneration of 2,700 acres of docklands gained impetus this year with the start of work on the long-delayed barrage, which will transform low-tide mudflats into a freshwater lake. A less controversial but essential part of the project will be the completion next year of a distributor road to link westwards with the M4 motorway. Equally important will be a boulevard, named Bute Avenue, and a light-rail system to reunite the waterfront with the city centre. Work on this infrastructure is expected to start next year. Mr Kelly, chairman of DTZ's Cardiff office, is convinced that the metamorphosis of the docklands will succeed: 'Any doubters will finally be happy when they see Bute Avenue completed and integrated transport.' In the bay, work has begun on the manufacturing plant of a joint venture by Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke. TBI, the property group, has a speculative industrial development at Ocean Park. Wilson Bowden Properties is the developer for 320,000 sq ft of non-food retail, leisure and commercial space at Ferry Road. Over the next 15 years, the corporation has a target of 4m sq ft of office space, 5m sq ft of industrial floor space and 6,000 homes. Two pre-let office deals have been agreed with Grosvenor Waterside, the property arm of Associated British Ports. The Welsh Health Common Services Authority has now occupied a 150,000 sq ft building, and a 119,000 sq ft UK headquarters for NCM Credit Insurance is being completed. Headline rentals have been over Pounds 14 per sq ft, although there is grant assistance. On the bay's fringe, there has been a freehold sale of 45,000 sq ft to AXA Insurance in a Pounds 10m investment. Meanwhile, confidence in the city centre was shown this year by the opening of Queens Arcade, an Pounds 80m investment by BICC Developments and SPP-LET International of 140,000 sq ft with 44 units. It is three-quarters let with rents at Pounds 80 to Pounds 130 per sq ft. The arcade reflects the reputation of the Welsh capital as one of the UK's most profitable retail centres. Rents for prime sites are beginning to pick up again and Pounds 160 per sq ft is being quoted for the best locations. For offices, there is scant interest in space over 20,000 sq ft. Chesterton, the property consultant, says the annual average take-up over the past decade has not been achieved this year, although there has been a reasonable level of inquiries for small offices and incentive packages are declining. Increased investment activity earlier this year, and a shortage of good stock, encouraged commitment to two quality schemes. Knox Court, developed by NIG Sheridan Properties and forward-funded by Scottish Life, and Helical Bar's Magnet House will provide a total of 120,000 sq ft. Chesterton predicts that rentals are likely to reach Pounds 16 a sq ft; Pounds 2 a sq ft above existing prime levels. Outside the centre, Cardiff Business Park at Llanishen has seen lets to Zurich Insurance and Camelot, the national lottery consortium, and rentals of more than Pounds 13 are quoted, reducing the disparity with the capital. Cardiff Gate business park, beside the new Pentwyn link road with the M4 motorway, has 90 acres for commercial development, including a speculative 60,000 sq ft office building. Elsewhere in south Wales, the completion this autumn of a 'missing' stretch of the M4 in west Wales is seen as a stimulus to investment, especially in Swansea and Llanelli, which have substantial development sites. King Sturge's latest survey of industrial floor space in Wales shows stability, with the floor space coming on to the market almost equal to the amount removed. However, Mr Kelly of DTZ stresses that although many companies are full to capacity, they are reluctant to add to costs by taking extra space. Rents are static. Overall, the picture in south Wales has brightened. 'The property market went quiet but never dead,' Mr Kelly says. 'It is emerging with reasonable confidence which I think can be sustained.'</p>

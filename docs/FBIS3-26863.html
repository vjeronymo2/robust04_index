It has been learned that all units in Guangdong, which carry  out institutional reform this year, should promptly practice the  civil service system in coordination with progress in  institutional reform.    According to the schedule, the provincial-level  administrative organs should conduct experiments in the first  half of this year and basically complete it in the first quarter  of next year, and administrative organs at the city, county,  township, and town levels should begin experiments in the second  half of this year.    The plan for reforming the wage system in Guangdong's state  organs and nonprofit institutions is scheduled to be basically  completed in the first half of this year. The present wage  reform focuses on the establishment of a normal incremental wage  system, with state organs and nonprofit institutions practicing  different wage systems. State organs are to practice a  post-rank wage system, which will be composed of four parts,  i.e. post wage, rank wage, basic wage, and seniority wage.    Nonprofit institutions are to practice five different kinds  of wage system among specialized technical personnel. The  first, covering educational, scientific research, public health,  and other nonprofit institutions, is a specialized technical  post-rank wage system; the second, covering geological, survey  and drawing, marine, aquatic, and other nonprofit institutions,  is a specialized technical post wage system; the third, covering  cultural, art, and other performing organizations, is an art  structure wage system; the fourth, covering athletes, is a  sports allowance and bonus system; and the fifth, covering  financial units, is a rank wage system. A staff post-rank wage  system is to be practiced among the administrative personnel of  nonprofit institutions.    Wages in nonprofit institutions are divided into two parts,  the fixed part and the active part. The former chiefly reflects  the level of staff and the latter their actual work amount so as  to encourage specialized technical personnel to concentrate  their energy on doing their own jobs or tasks well.</p>

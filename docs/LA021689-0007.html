			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT APPEAL  </P> <P> My attention has just been called to a recent letter (Jan. 18) by Deputy Dist.  Atty. Paul Rugnetta. Rugnetta complains that the Office of the State Public  Defender has squandered taxpayer money by raising on appeal the single  contention that our client received a prison sentence that was three days too  long.  </P> <P> Parenthetically, I would note that three hours let alone three days of unlawful  and undeserved time in prison constitutes a miscarriage of justice.  </P> <P> Under our justice system, a person convicted of a crime has a statutory and  constitutional right to have an appeal court review his case to determine that  he or she had a fair trial and received a lawful sentence. When an appeal court  appoints this agency to represent an indigent person, we have an ethical  obligation to review the record, explore all potential issues, but raise only  arguable and not frivolous issues.  </P> <P> After reviewing the facts and circumstances of the case, I am personally  satisfied that the deputy who authorized the appellant's brief acted pursuant  to her professional responsibilities.  </P> <P> The state public defender's office did its job well and responsibly and  corrected an injustice.  </P> <P> HARVEY R. ZALL  </P> <P> State Public Defender  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P></p>

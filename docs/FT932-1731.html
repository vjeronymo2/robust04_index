			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (12): Give and take in the world of charity - Trade THE CHARITY BUSINESS: THE NEW PHILANTHROPISTS by Tom Lloyd John Murray Pounds 19.99, 248 pages THE CHARITY industry in Britain and throughout the developed world is now very big business indeed. From Live Aid to Band Aid and Comic Relief, from corporate giving and private philanthropy to little old ladies with street corner collection boxes, the charity business today runs to big numbers. In the UK alone, an estimated Pounds 17bn a year is handled through more than 165,000 charities and associated endeavours. The Charity Commission, according to this study, registers a new charity every 30 minutes of its working day. For its sheer size and the number of its participants - both givers and receivers - the business must be about the most unregulated in the country, the light touch of the Commission making the Securities and Investments Board seem like a regulatory steamroller. Not surprisingly, therefore, the industry attracts its unfair share of conmen and dubious fundraisers, with some villains and fraudsters creaming of as much as 90 per cent of donations from a generous and unsuspecting public. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee reported a few years ago on the workings of the Charity Commission, having noted that tax exemptions for UK charities were then costing non-exempt taxpayers some Pounds 2.5bn a year in lost revenue, or equal to 5 per cent of the government's projected budget overspend in the current year. The committee took the commissioners to task on almost every aspect of their work. It dismissed the plea that their resources were inadequate, and committee chairman Robert Sheldon asked: 'Why is it because they cannot do everything, they did nothing?' Things have improved a lot since then, particularly with last year's Charities Act, but there are still undetected rogues, even if many dubious charitable activities are caught. In 1990 the Charity Commission removed charitable status from a record 749 organisations as a result of its investigations and a census to identify inactive charities. Little wonder that more more and more of the public's generous giving is going to fewer - and to the biggest and generally better run - charities. Much of the giving is by individuals, but there is a growing list of corporate givers, mainly through The Per Cent Club, founded in 1986 by the then Hector Laing (now Lord Laing of Dunphail) of United Biscuits and based on a similar (but Five Per Cent) initiative started in Minneapolis in the US. The UK Per Cent Club now has more than 300 members, qualification for participating being a contribution of not less than half a per cent of UK pre-tax profits, or 1 per cent of dividends, to the community. In addition, there are the long-established corporate and family trusts which give to charities, including names such as Weinstock, Palumbo, Cayzer, Whitbread, Sainsbury, Hanson, Inchcape and Alan Sugar. The whole business of giving, by whom and for what,is well compiled and analysed by Tom Lloyd. The Charity Business: the New Philanthropists is a real mine of information, from the interesting - which of the British Royals is the biggest charitable draw? who are the big charity supporters among show business? - to the downright informative. In the second category are four interesting corporate case studies of what motivates companies to give, where they direct their giving and, what they get in return. The four are the National Freight Consortium (now NFC), Tate and Lyle, United Biscuits and Pearson, whose interests include ownership of the Financial Times. Each has its own style and philosophy. The author writes: 'Openness and UB-style evangelism are important in the differentiation of the corporate reputation; a systematic approach, like Tate and Lyle's, is necessary if investments in reputational assets are to be 'efficient' in the sense of yielding good returns; NFC-style consultation with employees helps to widen the 'ownership' of a company's reputation for citizenship and will therefore make the company more attractive to potential recruits; Pearson's low-key generosity fits well with the hands-off style of its management and with the self-sufficiency of its high-quality operating companies.' Lloyd's examination of the charity business does not stop at Britain, although his glancing look at the US and Canada, France, Australia and Japan (where the National Horse Racing Welfare is the biggest corporate giver, well ahead of the Toyota Foundation) is largely headline stuff. Overall, though, this is an informative read with some cautionary tales, not least for the givers.</p>

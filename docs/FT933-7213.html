			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: All fired-up to test the market - The proposed flotation of the BSM Group THE British School of Motoring can probably claim to be the world's biggest. The Red Army's school once came near it - but that now had other things to do, joked Mr Paul Massey, chief executive of BSM Group, who confirmed on Friday that the company would be floated in October. The flotation aims to raise between Pounds 40m and Pounds 50m. Much of that will be used to repay the Pounds 30m of debt incurred during a management buy-out in 1990, led by Morgan Grenfell Development Capital Partners, which owns 70 per cent. BSM traces its history to the first days of the horseless carriage, claiming that its first pupil in 1910 was a coachman threatened with the sack when his employer traded in a coach and pair for a car. It also claims to have taught the first person to pass the UK driving test after its introduction in 1935 - a Mr Beene. The school was acquired in 1973 by Sir Anthony Jacobs, whose family still owns 20 per cent of the company. Sir Anthony decided to sell in 1990 when he was ready to retire and his son wanted to pursue other interests. Mr Massey's management team, which owns 10 per cent, held off rival offers from car makers and leasing companies eager for such a large captive market. Mr Massey holds 30 per cent of the management team's 10 per cent stake, and will not be selling any of his shares in the flotation. The school now operates 134 branches spread between Aberdeen and Plymouth. It has 2,000 self-employed instructors, who pay a weekly franchise fee to BSM. Mr Richard Glover, managing director, said that teaching learner drivers would remain the group's core business. More than 90 per cent of the population is within easy reach of a BSM school, he claims, and the familiar white pyramid on the roof of BSM cars is paraded through 1m miles of UK roads every week. BSM teaches 120,000 people to drive each year, and claims a market share of 15 per cent. However, the competition is very fragmented - the nearest in size is the Automobile Association's operation - The Driving School - with just over 500 franchised cars, and there is a multitude of one and two-person businesses. The market has been depressed for two to three years as the recession has held back new learners, according to Mr John Lepine of the Motor Schools Association. Also, demographically, the UK population of 17-year-olds is at its lowest level since 1945. This has a big effect as learners between the ages of 17 and 19 form 43 per cent of the total, according to Transport Research Laboratory figures for 1992. Those aged between 20 and 24 make up a further 22 per cent. In such conditions prices have been kept down. One small London school owner said he had not raised the cost of an hourly lesson in the daytime from Pounds 14 since June 1989. BSM prices range between Pounds 14.95 an hour to Pounds 17.50 in central London. As a rule of thumb, learning to drive takes 1 1/2 hours for every year of someone's life, so that a person of 20 will need to spend Pounds 450 at Pounds 15 an hour to reach driving test level. The company is now making more effort to attract the younger end of the market. Only 30 per cent of its customers have been under 20. In July the group switched from Rover Metros to Vauxhall Corsas, a car which BSM believes will appeal more to teenagers. Vauxhall will supply the company with 5,000 cars a year over 10 years in a Pounds 400m deal. Mr Glover is also keen to expand the company's health and safety division and MCR, which maintains the fleet. The health and safety arm provides training to company car drivers. He claimed that BP's motor accident rate had fallen by 58 per cent in the year after its drivers had undergone BSM courses. The company also sees good growth opportunities for MCR, which has started to take on the maintenance of other company fleets. Mr Massey described the recession as 'awful', but said the group still managed to report operating profits of Pounds 4.1m on turnover of Pounds 21m last year, and Pounds 2.2m on Pounds 11.8m in the first half of this year.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE, SENATE PASS SIMILAR $1.2-TRILLION SPENDING PLANS  </P> <P> The two houses of Congress approved separate $1.2-trillion spending plans  Thursday designed to carry out the budget accord struck with the White House  and hold the deficit below $100 billion for fiscal 1990, which begins next Oct.  1.  </P> <P> Although the House and Senate resolutions are similar, the budget measure will  have to go to a House-Senate conference committee to iron out some differences.  The balloting in the House was 263 to 157. Approval in the Senate came on a  vote of 68 to 31.  </P> <P> Changes in the legislation were held to a minimum, reflecting a reluctance by  lawmakers to risk upsetting the budget agreement with the White House. A  Democratic move to impose an oil import fee to help finance higher spending for  social programs was roundly defeated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approves Wilson Amendment  </P> <P> In the only two notable revisions, the Senate approved an amendment by Sen.  Pete Wilson (D-Calif.) to boost spending for drug enforcement by $100 million,  while the House increased veterans' programs by $175 million. In both cases,  the money was offset by cuts elsewhere.  </P> <P> Just before the final vote, House members rejected a bid by Rep. Richard A.  Gephardt (D-Mo.) that would have raised an additional $9 billion in revenues by  imposing an oil import fee. Gephardt also would have hiked domestic spending by  $5.8 billion. The vote against it was 373 to 49.  </P> <P> And the Senate brushed aside a substitute proposal by Sen. Ernest F. Hollings  (D-S.C.) that would have frozen all government spending at the current year's  levels. The vote on that measure was 82 to 18.  </P> <P> The fact that the two budget resolutions were passed virtually intact suggests  that the accord the lawmakers worked out with Administration officials most  likely will stand -- at least long enough to meet the deficit targets mandated  by the Gramm-Rudman budget law.  </P> <P> The Administration already has announced that it hopes to complete negotiations  with Congress this year on a budget accord for fiscal 1991 -- a virtually  unprecedented development, if it ultimately occurs. Talks on the fiscal 1991  budget could begin early next month. That fiscal year begins Oct. 1, 1990.  </P> <P> California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget  Committee, said that the House-Senate conference committee will start work next  week in hopes of completing the measure so the congressional appropriations  process can begin on schedule May 15.  </P> <P> Conceding that the compromise budget package was modest because of the  constraints imposed by President Bush's refusal to consider new tax increases,  Panetta promised that the lawmakers would consider a "bolder" plan for fiscal  1991 -- but only if Bush agreed to drop his restrictions.  </P> <P> "If the President continues to say, 'read my lips (no new taxes),' you're not  likely to see a bold package," the Budget Committee chairman told reporters.  White House officials have consistently refused to say what Bush will do for  fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> For a variety of mostly technical reasons, the two resolutions call for  slightly different deficit levels. The Senate version projects a red-ink figure  of $99.4 billion, while the House resolution assumes a deficit of about $99.7  billion. The two will be reconciled in conference.  </P> <P> As was the accord with the White House, the two congressional resolutions were  based on forecasts of the economy's performance that many outside economists  regard as overly optimistic. Both assume a slight reduction in interest rates,  which have been on the increase.  </P> <P> The lawmakers also have yet to work out details of how they will raise some  $5.3 billion in added tax revenues called for as part of the accord, without  violating President Bush's campaign pledge for no new taxes. They also left  vague their plans for getting $5.7 billion from sales of U.S. assets.  </P> <P> As specified in the accord with the White House, the two budget resolutions  essentially would freeze outlays for military programs at their current level  of about $299 billion, while allowing spending for domestic programs to keep  pace with inflation.  </P></p>

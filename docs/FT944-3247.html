			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein row casts shadow on conference Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, intervened to avert a potentially embarrassing row between the British government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, as politics overshadowed the first day of the Belfast International Investment Conference yesterday. With more than 300 delegates gathering for the largest business conference since the troubles began 25 years ago, Sinn Fein confirmed that its party councillors would be attending today's working sessions. The decision followed a meeting in Londonderry between Mr Brown and Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the organisation's northern chairman. Mr McLaughlin insisted that the party, which had threatened to boycott the conference, had always said it would attend. As Mr John Major, the prime minister, launched the event by seeking to highlight the province's investment potential, the British and US governments signed a science and technology agreement to give Northern Ireland companies access to US technology and production techniques. Separately, British Telecommunications and US chemicals group DuPont were poised to announce new investment projects for the province totalling Pounds 36m. Speaking after a meeting with Mr Brown, Mr Major told delegates they could be in at the beginning of 'a very exciting phase' in the province. He said he was not asking potential investors to be 'less than hard-headed' about their business decisions but simply to 'recognise that there is a society bursting with the desire to succeed'. He said he hoped strong pressure to 'make peace irreversible' would come from outside Northern Ireland. Mr Brown said the US would work with the people of Northern Ireland 'to replace the architecture of violence'. He said the US was drawing up a strategic plan for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic's border counties which he would present to the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland in April. However, he announced no new plans for US government investment in the province. He said the US would 'seek to harness the effort and expense of hatred and security; to build with it an economy on which opportunity overshadows enmity; and create an infrastructure that will support a new era of reconciliation'. Mr Brown also said the US Trade and Development Agency was to lead a technical delegation to the province to identify projects 'that represent more mutually beneficial opportunities'.</p>

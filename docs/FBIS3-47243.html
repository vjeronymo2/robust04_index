On 9 January, a relevant official from the business sector  said: We recently received a request from North Korea for the  export of rice, maize, and gasoline. Since the United States  exports rice to North Korea, I do not see the reason why we  cannot export rice to North Korea.    According to the annual report recently submitted to the  U.S.  Congress by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S.  Government, which officially banned export of goods to North  Korea, allowed export of grains including rice and some other  products from the humanitarian view of point. The total amount  of export was learned to be $137 million in seven cases during  the fiscal year 1992.    Another relevant official from the business sector said that  "in addition to the United States, Japan exported even strategic  materials to North Korea through the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan. Recently, Japan is actively striving  to hold official and unofficial contacts with North Korea to  resume negotiations for establishment of diplomatic relations.  This being the case, if our economic cooperation with North  Korea is linked to the nuclear issue and our export of rice is  restricted on the pretext of being a strategic material, it  would be difficult for the government to effect its policy to  achieve national reunification by making North Korea open itself  up."    Sin Chang-ho, professor at Chungang University and chairman  of the Research Institute of Unification and Economy, also  pointed out:    Even if North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will require a  number of procedures and much time to ensure nuclear  transparency. The present situation, in which a clue is found  for the solution of the nuclear problem through contacts between  the United States and North Korea and between North Korea and  the IAEA, is an adequate time for our government to demonstrate  flexibility in its policy on economic cooperation with North  Korea.    Meanwhile, it was learned that the government began to  examine the flexibility to be given to the principle of  implementing phased economic cooperation according to progress  in negotiations over the North Korean nuclear issue and to the  degree of solution of the nuclear issue.    A relevant government official said: During U.S.-North Korea  contacts, North Korea agreed in principle to accept inspection  of seven nuclear facilities. Therefore, the necessity arose to  intensively examine the first-phase policy which defined "a  breakthrough for solution to nuclear issue," the second-phase  and the third-phase policies.    In particular, if North Korea accepts IAEA's nuclear  inspection and responds to the exchange of special envoys, the  government will affirmatively review the time of visit to North  Korea by businessmen and technicians and their advance to free  economic zones in North Korea through third countries including  China.    In the event that North Korea completely returns to the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepts the inspection of  two undeclared sites by IAEA, the government, regarding this as  a "breakthrough for a solution to the nuclear issue," will  permit the businessmen's visit to North Korea, as well as the  visit of technicians in a bid to invigorate processing-for-wage  deals.    In addition, the government will resume model projects if  North Korea accepts mutual inspections of the North and the  South and will resume overall economic cooperation if  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is realized.</p>

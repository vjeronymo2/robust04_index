			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Observer: Midland shanghaied If the dear old Midland Bank goes off the rails again, blame the new owners, HSBC Holdings. Yesterday Midland Bank's new chairman, HSBC chieftain Sir Willie Purves, and Midland's new chief executive, HSBC's Keith Whitson, celebrated their first day in office by removing almost the last traces of the ancien regime and moving more of their own men into positions of power. Out goes Chris Wathen, Midland's managing director of branch banking and one of the great white hopes of previous Midland managements, and in comes a new deputy chief executive Richard Orgill, who used to run HSBC's Australian operations. Barry Hine, another HSBC man, takes over as head of human resources, and Bert McPhee, HSBC's group risk controller, takes charge of Midland's credit and risk. About the only Midland man to gain from the reshuffle is Chris Thom, the network support director, upgraded to general manager retail. The changes must be particularly galling for Wathen, a career Midland banker, who played a key role in helping Midland get into bed with HSBC. They will also put an end to any suggestion that Midland 'merged' with HSBC. It was taken over by an autocratic outfit which is out to prove that it can run a UK clearing bank better than anybody else. We shall see.</p>

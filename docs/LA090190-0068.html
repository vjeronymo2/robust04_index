			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ABCS OF CHILD-PROOFING KITCHEN, BATH  </P> <P> Home safety doesn't happen by accident.  </P> <P> While no one can foresee a child being injured in the kitchen or bathroom --  two of a home's more hazard-fraught rooms -- everyone can take steps to lessen  potential perils. Most of these measures are common sense, but Kitchen and Bath  Ideas magazine says it pays to review.  </P> <P> These safety guidelines apply to both the kitchen and bathroom:  </P> <P> Store liquor, chemicals, cleaners and medicines in upper cabinets out of  children's sight. And lock the cabinets -- children can climb. Buy potentially  lethal products in child-resistant packaging only.  </P> <P> Latch cabinets where garbage and plastic garbage bags are kept.  </P> <P> All cabinet doors and drawers should have safety stops. Knobs should be too  large for a child to swallow.  </P> <P> Provide safe storage for sharp objects, such as knives and fingernail files.  </P> <P> Install slip-resistant flooring and make sure that scatter rugs have non-slip  backings.  </P> <P> Eliminate or cover sharp corners, such as on counters and tables.  </P> <P> Place all electric outlets, or at least those near water sources, on a ground  fault circuit interrupter.  </P> <P> Cover electric outlets.  </P> <P> Stay away from water sources when using small appliances.  </P> <P> To avoid burns, set the water temperature no higher than 120 degrees. Water  heated to 156 degrees can cause a third-degree burn in only one second.  </P> <P> Install smoke detectors and place a fire extinguisher near the exit. If  building or remodeling, consider installing a sprinkler system.  </P> <P> Install windows and mirrors with protective film that prevents shards from  flying when broken.  </P> <P> Windows, especially those on upper floors, should feature hardware that limits  how far they open.  </P> <P> Keep cords for draperies and mini blinds out of reach.  </P> <P> Make sure interiors are well lighted.  </P> <P> Keep lamp cords hidden.  </P> <P> Until children are older, put away knickknacks that are small enough to pose a  choking hazard.  </P> <P> To spot potential dangers to small children in the kitchen, or any room,  consider the space from their point of view. For example:  </P> <P> Buy a stove with controls on top, not on the side.  </P> <P> Turn handles of pots away from the edge of the stove when cooking. And, install  a pot guardrail on the front edge of the stove.  </P> <P> Keep small appliances stored and latched in upper cabinets or in an appliance  garage.  </P> <P> Don't let appliance cords dangle from countertops when in use. Unplug  appliances not in use.  </P> <P> Always install a latch on a deep freezer. Latches are also available for  refrigerator doors.  </P> <P> Children love to play in and around water, but child's play can lead to mishaps  without the following precautions:  </P> <P> Never leave a child unattended in the bathroom, not even for a minute.  </P> <P> Because children can drown in very small amounts of water, install latches on  all toilet lids.  </P> <P> Install grab bars in the tub and shower. Faucet parts should be shatter  resistant and have no sharp edges.  </P> <P> Provide a sturdy step stool to raise children high enough to easily reach  faucets and countertops.  </P> <P> Install hardware on the bathroom door that can be unlocked from either side of  the door.  </P> <P> To prevent children from entering the bathroom unsupervised, keep the door  closed. Also, cover the knob with a safety sleeve that requires an adult grip  to open.  </P></p>

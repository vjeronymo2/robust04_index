			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRITAIN;  </P> <P> THATCHER POPULARITY LOWEST IN 19 YEARS  </P> <P> The political fortunes of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have plunged  further with the release of an opinion poll showing her Conservative Party  18.5% behind the opposition Labor Party, its lowest standing in 19 years. The  survey undertaken by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph newspaper indicated  Thatcher's slide is due to a controversial new tax and her refusal to lower  interest rates to spur economic growth. The poll put the Labor Party of Neil  Kinnock at 49.5%, a rise of 1.5% from two previous polls.  </P></p>

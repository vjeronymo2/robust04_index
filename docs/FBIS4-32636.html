			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>   [Text] Fikret Abdic, the rebel from the Cazin Krajina, can  no longer count on any support from Zagreb. He has not had it  for some time now. We were told this today exclusively for  Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina by one top-level official in  the presidential palace in Zagreb, who wished to remain  anonymous. We can only say that he is a very well-known and  respected politician in Zagreb, even though he is perhaps not  the most popular one.    Even the Serbs from the so-called Krajina have repudiated  Abdic, although just a year ago -- when he proclaimed autonomy  -- they signed an agreement on military aid. However, according  to the information in Zagreb, now they send him almost no aid,  or so little that he can do nothing with it against the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, that is, its 5th Corps, our source  claims.    The doors to Zagreb have been closed to Abdic since the  Washington Agreement. Our source says: The autonomy proclaimed  in principle in western Bosnia is nearing its end. Abdic danced  his dance of death around Kladusa and Bihac for only one summer.  According to the information on the successes of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps, all of western Bosnia will  soon be under the Sarajevo authority, says our reliable source  from the presidential palace in Zagreb. If they knew who he  was, both Fikret Abdic and President Tudjman would probably get  headaches.</p>

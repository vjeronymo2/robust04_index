I  am asking because you have not responded as yet to whatever the  Americans apprised you of.    [Rabin] At this point, I take a positive view of President  Clinton's efforts to assist in promoting the negotiations with  Syria. The Americans do not intend -- they never did -- to  force negotiating stands on Israel. [passage omitted]</p>

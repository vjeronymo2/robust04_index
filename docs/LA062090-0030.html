			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEDDY BEARS TO ANSWER ALARMS WITH SAN DIEGO FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> The staff at San Diego's Fire Station 18 got some extra helpers Tuesday.  </P> <P> Instead of quelling fires, the helpers will be called upon to quell the tears  of frightened children that the station's firefighters encounter.  </P> <P> The helpers are teddy bears, and the San Diego Fire Department hopes they will  provide comfort to child victims in a way that human firefighters cannot.  </P> <P> Fire trucks leaving Station 18 and 16 other stations around town will now carry  the teddy bears along with their axes, hoses and other equipment, said Al  MacDonald, a spokesman for the Fire Department.  </P> <P> If a truck's captain sees a child who has been hurt, separated from his parents  or otherwise traumatized, he'll give the child one of the bears, MacDonald  said.  </P> <P> "The bears give them something to hold, something to comfort them," MacDonald  said. "It makes a real big impression on the kids."  </P> <P> The idea of giving teddy bears to dejected children isn't a new one; police and  fire departments in several cities across the country are now giving bears  away.  </P> <P> San Diego officials first considered the practice after the local chapter of  Telephone Pioneers of America approached them last December.  </P> <P> After conversations with employees in a Florida fire department about the  bears' fitness for duty, San Diego officials decided to give them a three-month  trial at 17 stations, MacDonald said.  </P> <P> At the end of the summer, the department should have a good enough estimate of  the demand for the bears so that each of the city's 42 stations can be fully  stocked, MacDonald said.  </P> <P> The bears are all manufactured and donated by the Telephone Pioneers, a group  of retired telephone company employees who work for a number of charitable  causes.  </P> <P> The bears, with "Hug me, I'm yours" embroidered onto them, will be available in  any color as long as it isn't red, said Mary Bernritter, the group's treasurer.  </P> <P> "The children will already be traumatized, and red could represent fire or  blood," Bernritter said.  </P> <P> "We want the bears to be their friends."  </P></p>

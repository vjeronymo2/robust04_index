Discussions are expected to focus on inspection of Taiwan's  software exports and proposed revisions to the trademark and  patent law, according to Lin Yi-fu, head of the Taipei  negotiating team and deputy director-general of the Board of  Foreign Trade.    Lin said that Taipei will explain to the U.S. side the  measures it has been taking and the results of its efforts on  IPR protection.    Taiwan has invested a lot of money and manpower in  implementing a software export inspection system at the request  of the U.S., he said, but the inspection operation has  inconvenienced Taiwan software exporters and benefited only a  few American software makers.    Lin said he will call for the termination of the inspection  operation during the talks.    Meanwhile, Economics Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang noted that  the U.S. is expected to review its special 301 priority watch  list at the end of March and the talks offer Taiwan a chance to  try to relieve the imminent threat of U.S. sanctions.    Chiang said that Taiwan has performed well on the IPR issue  and should be removed from the priority watch list.    He added that his ministry and concerned government  departments have prepared a "position paper," which details  Taiwan's efforts and results toward IPR protection over the past  one year, to persuade the U.S. to remove it from the list.    But Economics Ministry officials are not so optimistic about  Taiwan's full removal from the list. However, they said it may  be possible for Taiwan to be downgraded from the special 301  priority watch list to the watch list.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Should label warning statements be required for iron-containing products? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on the data in the AAPCC and AG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petitions and in the CPSC case reports, iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can cause injury, including serious injury, and death when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children gain access to these products. FDA finds from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data that the potential for harm exists for all three types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing products available, i.e., multi-vitamin/mineral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements that contain iron, iron supplements, and iron-containing drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Supporting this finding are the data cited in Tables 1, 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 3 that show that, since 1983, at least 40 deaths have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributed to the accidental ingestion of iron supplements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing drugs, and that, since 1986, nearly 190  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisonings that were life threatening or that resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanent injury, and over 2,000 poisonings requiring some form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of treatment, have resulted from accidental ingestion of adult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Further support is provided by the data in the CPSC case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, which show 80 ingestions of iron leading to hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency room visits with varying types of injury, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, and elevated serum iron (see Table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The data in Tables 4 and 6 show that in several documented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning incidents, children have ingested 30, 40, 50, or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets of iron-containing products when these amounts of tablets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were accessible. Aside from the potential for such ingestion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron-containing supplements and drugs to be fatal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of ingesting even multi-vitamin/mineral type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products in these amounts is evident from Table 8. This table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shows that an amount of iron that may produce symptoms of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning (i.e., 25 mg/kg) can be ingested by a 10 kg child if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the child consumes 25 tablets containing 10 mg of iron each or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 14 tablets containing 18 mg each. (Ten mg and 18  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg of iron are the amounts typically contained in multi-vitamin/mineral supplements with iron including children's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vitamins.) Based upon the data in Tables 4 and 6, ingestion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this many tablets is not atypical. Thus, FDA finds that injury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can result anytime a small child is able to gain access to even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lowest potency iron-containing products available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Further, the fact that over 2,000 reported poisoning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidents of varying severity have been recorded in recent years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Tables 2 and 3), and the fact that AAPCC reports that accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron poisoning is presently the leading cause of pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning deaths, lead FDA to find that pediatric iron poisonings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have occurred, and continue to occur, with significant frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, FDA finds that the fact that these poisonings continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to occur, even though there have been over 40 deaths from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accidental iron ingestion (See Table 1), strongly suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many adults are not aware of the potential for serious harm or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death in young children from accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. Support for this finding is provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements made by the parents of the victims in several of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning incidents, described in the case reports obtained from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPSC as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) ``The mother stated that she thought the pills (prenatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron pills) were just vitamins and would not harm the victim''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 21, case report No. 10).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

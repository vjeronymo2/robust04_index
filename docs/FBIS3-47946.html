			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Takehiko Kajita] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- With the passage of a set of  government-sponsored political reforms through a key  parliamentary panel on Thursday [20 January], Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa has one last hurdle to clear.    But that last test is perhaps the most difficult in his  drawn  out quest to implement sweeping reforms.    For Hosokawa, who has ardently pursued the introduction of  measures necessary to eradicate rampant political graft in  Japan, the clearance of his package through a special panel of  the House of Councillors was a welcome development. But he is  also keenly aware that the race is not over. The full upper  house will meet Friday to put the bills to vote.    Although the governing coalition holds a slight majority in  the 252-member upper chamber, it is uncertain whether Hosokawa  can secure the votes he needs due to an anticipated revolt from  some members of the largest force within the coalition, the  Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ].    Fearing wrath from the public and other coalition members if  the bills fail, the SDP leadership has attempted to persuade its  potential rebels to support the government package.    But some of its lawmakers openly say they will cross the  party line mainly to object to the introduction of a new  electoral system for the House of Representatives, which will  drastically change the nation's electoral map and would further  reduce the SDP's presence in national politics.    Among them, Masao Kunihiro, a staunch opponent of the  package, reiterated his opposition, saying, "To ask me if I am  for or against it is like asking the pope if he is a Catholic."    But a senior coalition official, who refused to be  identified, said the SDP leadership appears optimistic about the  course of the final vote in the full upper house.    "Mr. Kubo (the SDP secretary general) keeps saying, `The  prospects are very grim,' but he has not looked so serious from  yesterday," the official said.    Another factor clouding the fate of the government package  --  and of the Hosokawa cabinet -- is the main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), knocked out of power last August after  nearly 40 years of rule.    An unexpected revolt by Tomoichi Hoshino, an upper house LDP  legislator, in Thursday's vote at a session of the second  chamber panel, surprised the LDP, which had voiced confidence in  unity among its upper house members.    Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee in  the  upper house, told reporters the party will take all possible  steps to prevent more of its legislators from voting with the  government in the final vote.    Hosokawa, apparently in hope of securing the enactment of  the  reform legislation by the January 29 close of the current Diet  sitting, stated there is room for further negotiations between  the coalition and the LDP for a final compromise on the reforms.    While Hosokawa said he is ready to meet with LDP President  Yohei Kono to bridge the gap between the two sides, Kono ruled  out the idea.    The two men are both now in difficult positions. Hosokawa  would have to step down along with all other cabinet ministers  or dissolve the lower house for a general election should he  fail to achieve his pledge to push the reforms through by  January 29.    If the government reform package became law with no  modifications, Kono would also face intense pressure from within  his party to take responsibility for failure to change the  legislation in its favor.    "He would eventually have to quit on his own," one LDP  legislator noted.</p>

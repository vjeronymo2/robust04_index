			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Sniffing out the poorly cows - Worth Watching Bad breath is not just something that affects humans. Scientists at Southampton and Warwick Universities are developing an 'electronic nose' to sniff out cows with bad breath, in an attempt to detect early signs of disease and so improve the health of dairy herds. The robot nose uses an array of sensors linked to a computer to sniff out specific smelly molecules. The molecules interact with the sensors to produce a pattern of responses that the computer can recognise. University of Southampton: UK, 0703 592373.</p>

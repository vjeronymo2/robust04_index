			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Stable franc reflects optimism FRENCH short-term interest rates yesterday fell slightly as financial markets responded positively to the appointment of Mr Edmond Alphandery, a staunch supporter of the strong currency policy of the franc fort, as economics minister. The franc, which has strengthened slightly since the conservatives' victory in Sunday's parliamentary election, was stable, ending the day unchanged at FFr3.396 against the D-Mark. Meanwhile, short-term interest rates, which rose sharply last year in the Bank of France's efforts to defend the franc, have eased. The cost of one-month money is now just under 11 per cent, with three-month money at around 10 per cent. Both rates were about 0.5 of a percentage point higher a week ago. Mr Edouard Balladur, the new prime minister, has made it clear that he hopes to reduce interest rates as quickly as possible to alleviate the pressure on the French economy. The appointment of Mr Alphandery, a former economics professor known to be a strong proponent of European monetary union, has been interpreted by economists as an indication that the new government will continue the policy of waiting for German interest rates to fall before reducing French rates. A question remains on whether German rates will fall far enough.</p>

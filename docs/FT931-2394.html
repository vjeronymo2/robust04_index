			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Election 93: Socialists face second round knock-out - Conservative parties' pact expected to lead to huge majority / The mechanic of the French election TOMORROW France starts a lengthy process which will give it a new government on or around April Fools' Day. Opinion polls attest to the generally low standing of politicians in France, but never have so many sought to join the profession. A record number of 5,169 candidates are contesting the 555 seats in mainland France and Corsica - an average of 9.3 candidates per seat compared to 8.3 at the last parliamentary election in 1988. Representatives from overseas departments and territories make up the 577 seats in the National Assembly. France's majority voting system provides for two rounds, though not all constituency fights will go to a second round. The first round is tomorrow. Candidates who win 50 per cent or more of the vote are elected. Most of these early outright victors will be candidates of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF parties which are well ahead in opinion polls. In fact, the RPR has already won a seat in French Polynesia which voted earlier than metropolitan France because it needed more time between the two rounds to tabulate results and convey election information across its south Pacific islands. If the first round produces no absolute majority in a constituency - which will usually be the case - a second round takes place on March 28. Any candidate winning more than 12.5 per cent of votes in the first round can take part in the run-off. Victory goes to the candidate winning most votes. Some candidates who have only just scraped through to the second round will try to pass their support to other candidates with a better chance. For instance, the Socialist party has said it will instruct its candidates to stand down if they are beaten by Green candidates, to allow the Green a better chance in the second round. The Socialists calculate they will only rarely be overtaken by the Greens, but they hope their gesture will be reciprocated by the environmentalists in the more frequent instances in which Socialist candidates outdistance Green ones in the first round. The only effective difference between France's two-round majority voting system and Britain's single-round majority system is that French deputies generally get elected with a higher share of the vote than their UK counterparts. Both systems tend to accentuate electoral swings  - hence, some projections predict that the RPR/UDF could get 80 per cent of seats on 40 per cent of the vote. As in the UK, the French system also tends to squeeze out smaller parties. Their best tactic is to field joint candidates, as the Verts and Generation Ecologie (and, of course, the RPR/UDF) have done. The environmentalists' problem is that their support is thinly spread, in contrast to the Communists whose strength is maximised by being geographically concentrated. In 1986 the elections were fought under a proportional representation (PR) system, introduced by President Mitterrand and his Socialists to reduce the swing to the right. But the Chirac government scrapped this for the 1988 elections, and returned to majority voting - just as 'fringe' parties were on the rise. If the Greens poll well but gain no seats, there may be calls for some return to PR, perhaps adding a national list of deputies elected by PR to the 577 constituency deputies elected by majority vote. If, when the final results are in on March 29, it is confirmed that the RPR/UDF have won, then the Socialist prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, will immediately submit his resignation to President Mitterrand. The latter will then consult leaders of the victorious conservatives to discover whom they want as prime minister, and whom he feels he can accept. One idea, mooted early in the campaign, was for the new RPR and UDF blocks of deputies to present Mr Mitterrand with a fait accompli by designating their choice for prime minister. But neither Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, nor Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the UDF leader, will want to be bypassed. The manoeuvring could take several days. There is one constraint. Under the constitution, parliament has to start its summer session on April 2. It would look bad if the 'class of 1993' were to take their seats in the Palais-Bourbon, with the government bench empty. Yet, leaving nomination of a new prime minister and government until the day before - April 1 - might be the sort of joke that President Mitterrand would enjoy.</p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SBC to issue 5m covered call warrants on BAT SWISS BANK Corporation is to issue 5m covered call warrants on BAT Industries, the financial services and tobacco group, which is likely to earn the bank a healthy profit on its purchase of the shares through BAT's recent scrip issue. SBC will sell the covered call warrants through its retail network. The warrants give holders the right to buy the underlying shares at a set price during a set period. Like other large Swiss banks, SBC is known for its retail placement ability in Switzerland, where investors are strongly influenced by banks' 'buy' lists. BAT shares are recommended as a long-term and short-term buy by SBC. SBC expects to own about 10m BAT shares, after offering to pay holders 2 per cent less than the market price for the shares issued as a scrip dividend, undercutting Barclays de Zoete Wedd's offer of a 5 per cent discount. The scrip dividend scheme was devised by BZW for BAT for tax reasons. The call price - that is, the price at which warrant holders can buy the shares - is set at 835p, yesterday's closing price. Each warrant costs 110p, which represents a premium of 13.1 per cent over the share price and can be exercised at any time from June 8, 1993 to November 25, 1994. SBC bought the shares at 816.66p so stands to make a profit if the warrants are exercised. Even if the warrants are not exercised, SBC has knocked 55p off the cost of holding each share if it sells 5m warrants at 110p each.</p>

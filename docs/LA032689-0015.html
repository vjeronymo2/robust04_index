			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAINFUL WORDS ON AIDS  </P> <P> Do the editors of Book Review or reviewer Arthur Kleinman begin to realize the  pain that has been caused to thousands of your readers who are HIV Positive or  have ARC/AIDS, by the excessively descriptive review of "AIDS and Its  Metaphors" by Susan Sontag (Book Review, Feb. 26)?  </P> <P> While many people with AIDS are carrying on a close to normal life, imagine you  are one who is housebound and The Times is one of your important links to the  outside. You read the review and the words and phrases used or quoted tear into  your emotions: "Terrifying new disease," "epitome of evil," "alienating  repulsive taint of deadly sin," "degrading pain," "terminates in the  preparation for death," all hang in your mind.  </P> <P> AIDS patients will not analyze the philosophic content. They will hear only the  words, added to the other words that have been aimed at them.  </P> <P> The agony of those in pain is far more important than fuzzy political rhetoric  of either author or reviewer. The review could have been done in a factual  manner without hurtful pejorative phrases being used. That way, only those who  bought the book would be hurt.  </P> <P> I am a "straight" WASP woman with five children. I don't have AIDS, except in  the way that we now all have this disease. . . . "Is it nothing to you, all ye  who pass by?"  </P> <P> MARION GENTRY  </P> <P> SUN VALLEY, CALIF.  </P></p>

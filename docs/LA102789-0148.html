			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> DISTRICT SETTLES SUIT FILED BY EX-PRINCIPAL  </P> <P> After more than five years of legal wrangling, the lawsuit filed by former  Valencia Park Elementary School Principal John Roseman against the Fullerton  School District has been settled.  </P> <P> But both parties declined to disclose details, saying that they have agreed to  keep it confidential.  </P> <P> Roseman filed a $1-million claim against the district, alleging that he  suffered heavy financial and emotional losses when the district demoted him in  1983 from principal to teacher. His demotion arose out of an incident in which  a 5-year-old girl and her parents alleged that Roseman had molested the child.  </P> <P> Prosecutors dropped charges against Roseman when it was disclosed that he was  simply cleaning up the 5-year-old girl, who had soiled her pants.  </P> <P> But the board demoted Roseman from principal to teacher anyway, claiming that  he had exercised poor judgment in the handling of the incident. Roseman quit  his job at the school and filed suit.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, attorneys for the school district tried unsuccessfully to  have Roseman's claims for unspecified damages thrown out of the Orange County  Superior Court lawsuit.  </P> <P> J. Michael Declues, lawyer for the district, confirmed Thursday that a  settlement had been reached but said the agreement barred the parties from  providing details. DAVAN MAHARAJ  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok: People's Party for Freedom </F> and Democracy Must Review Its Position on Illegal Immigrants"]    [Text] Wim Kok, PvdA [Labor Party] leader, said that the  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] could not have a  place in the new cabinet if it stuck to its position that the  children of illegal immigrants should not be allowed into  schools in the Netherlands. "Bolkestein will not enter the new  cabinet if that is his demand," Kok said yesterday evening in  Amsterdam.    The VVD leader's position about the children of illegal  immigrants, stated last week in a debate on television, is an  obstacle to the "purple" coalition [comprising the PvdA, the  VVD, and the Democrats 66 (D66)], in the eyes of the PvdA.  "There are barriers which you cannot cross mentally and  morally," Kok said.    At yesterday's May Day celebration, it emerged that in the  PvdA, doubts are increasing about whether a cabinet with the VVD  is possible. Minister Van Thijn said that the gap between his  party and the VVD "is very big" and during the election campaign  "is getting bigger day by day." A "purple" coalition was only  possible if "the VVD does not get the opportunity to attack the  social justice of this country," Van Thijn said.    Yesterday PvdA leading candidate Kok would not say whether  he  preferred a "purple" coalition or a coalition with the CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal], but he did say: "I can imagine  that it is possible to make better agreements with the CDA on  the social question than with the VVD. With its proposals, the  VVD is taking the most extreme position." PvdA chairman  Rottenberg also noted that the VVD, with its positions on  foreigners, was making it "extremely difficult" to achieve a  "purple" coalition.    On AVRO radio yesterday, Prime Minister Lubbers said he  expected the CDA and the D66 to act together in the coming  cabinet formation and the PvdA to also probably be part of the  next cabinet. "It is best for tackling social and economic  problems that the CDA and the PvdA work together," he said.  "The best way to follow up the fight against crime is a  dialogue between the CDA and the D66."    In Amsterdam yesterday, Kok said that it was possible that  he  would become prime minister in the coming cabinet. But he  warned the PvdA against euphoria, now that it could possibly  become the biggest party, even though according to the opinion  polls it will not come close to getting the 49 seats it has at  present. "If we get 35 or 36 seats, that is a serious blow.  The fact that we would then be the biggest party is not  sufficient compensation for that."    Yesterday, the Green Left Party pronounced itself in favor  of  a progressive cabinet (with the PvdA and D66), if necessary,  governing with VVD support. If the three left-wing parties  together got 70 seats then "the right can move aside," Brouwer,  the [Green Left] party's leading candidate, said.</p>

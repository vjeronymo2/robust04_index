			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: Quarries head for the coast - Proposals to limit the damage caused by extracting materials for the building industry Rock, sand and gravel, gouged or blasted out of great quarries, are irreplaceable as basic building materials. But does Britain want large unsightly holes scarring its countryside? And what of the environmental damage caused by huge trucks carrying stone to build yet more roads? UK ministers are pondering these questions as they prepare guidelines for local authorities, which are establishing planning targets for aggregates' extraction into the next century. The government's findings could determine the future of hundreds of millions of pounds of investment proposed by British building material companies for a new generation of coastal super-quarries in Scotland and Scandinavia. These quarries would reduce pressure on Britain's shrinking countryside in southern England and the Midlands but would be viable only if the price of aggregates were to rise, providing investors with an acceptable rate of return. A consultation paper published by the Department of the Environment 14 months ago suggested the restriction of aggregates extraction in some of the more politically sensitive regions. It also proposed inhibiting the rise in sea-dredged sand and gravel, partly to protect coastal fishing. The policy would conserve valuable and irreplaceable land-based reserves, requiring the industry to switch to other sources, the department said. These would include Scottish quarries, imports and recycled or secondary materials such as slate, colliery spoil and china clay waste for landfill. Similar deliberations are taking place in other large European countries where concern for the environment is equally high on the political agenda. Tarmac, the construction group, which is currently considering spending up to Pounds 75m on a Norwegian coastal quarry, says the investment would work only if Britain and Germany took a large proportion of the output. Publication of the British guidelines, however, is already 10 months late, emphasising the difficulties faced by domestic politicians who wish to display their green credentials without damaging the construction industry - considered to be an important engine for growth for the economy. Neither are the arguments as simple as they might first appear. Otherwise, companies such as Tarmac would have leaped at an opportunity to raise prices and improve margins, which have been eroded heavily during the UK recession. The DoE consultation paper contained two options, based on forecasts of construction demand up to 2011. The option preferred by the department would reduce the percentage of locally produced rock, sand and gravel in England and Wales from more than 80 per cent to 64 per cent, and cut marine-dredged aggregate from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. Imports from Scottish quarries and elsewhere would be expected to rise from 1 per cent to 9 per cent, while the use of secondary and recycled materials would rise from 10 per cent to 16 per cent. A second option, preferred by building material suppliers, would require a more gradual reduction in land-won supplies, with the proportion of crushed rock remaining constant at about 50 per cent but with sand and gravel, mostly from south-east England, falling from 32 per cent to 24 per cent by 2011. Marine-dredged sand and gravel would rise to 8 per cent, requiring a lower increase in imports to 6 per cent by 2011, compared with 18 per cent in the department's preferred option. The BACMI, the British Aggregate Construction Materials Industries trade association, says its members recognise the need to consider the environment but that the department's option could create worse environmental problems. Deliveries of aggregates by sea from Scotland or Scandinavia would require large port facilities for unloading, storage and transfer to land-based transport. Construction is a fragmented activity and most deliveries would still need to be made by road. Land-based quarries are traditionally within 30 miles of most of their customers. Deliveries from coastal areas or rail depots would require much greater lorry distances to be travelled. Alternative materials such as slate create their own environmental problems and often cannot replace traditional aggregates for technical or cost reasons, the BACMI says. An attempt to use china clay sand from St Austell in Cornwall as a substitute for embankments and fill on the new Severn Crossing failed after it was realised that 'this would involve 500 vehicles a day for more than a year - some 68m heavy goods/vehicle miles'. The BACMI advocates an increase in sea-dredged aggregates which, it says, affects only 0.03 per cent of the sea bed in the North Sea compared with 54 per cent affected by fishing. It says the Ministry of Agricultures receives virtually no complaints from fishermen about marine dredging. Companies say a more restrictive planning regime will not necessarily lead to higher aggregate prices needed to make investment in Scotland and Scandinavia attractive. Tarmac says that at present extraction rates shortages may not start to emerge for at least four years. Moreover there is sufficient flexibility in existing planning permissions for operators to increase production in the short term. Falling demand for construction during the recession has meant that annual production of aggregates in England and Wales has fallen by 23 per cent since 1989 from 300m tonnes to 230m tonnes. Given the uncertainty over demand and supply, it may still be difficult for companies to commit the Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m needed to open a coastal quarry even if a more restrictive policy is introduced. The BACMI, which says that quarry operators have become more sensitive to environmental considerations, favours a more gradualist approach and would prefer a compromise between the two options.</p>

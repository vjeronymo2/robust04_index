			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Militants claim bank bombs Moslem militants in Egypt yesterday claimed responsibility for planting bombs at three Egyptian state banks, only one of which exploded, Reuter reports from Cairo. They said the bombs found on Monday were the start of a violent campaign to enforce the Islamic ban on usury. The Gama'a al-Islamiya, the largest militant group fighting the Egyptian government, gave people two weeks to withdraw their money from banks which pay interest.</p>

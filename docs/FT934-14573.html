			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London COFFEE changed direction in the afternoon, heading higher as news began to filter through that Brazil was putting the finishing touches to its retention arrangements. The January quotation closed at Dollars 1,192 a tonne, up Dollars 15 on the day. The president of the Federation of Brazilian Coffee Exporters later said Brazil would start buying coffee next week, pushing New York prices even higher, but that was after London's close. COCOA prices headed lower as the market seemed to lose heart and braced itself for another move back towards the Pounds 900-a-tonne support area for the March 1994 futures contract. The price dipped to Pounds 930 a tonne before closing at Pounds 935, down Pounds 10 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange aluminium prices were firmer on producer support and short-covering purchases. The three months position closed at Dollars 1,128.25 a tonne, up Dollars 10.50. ZINC prices edged back following Wednesday's strong advance as the market continued to await confirmation or rumoured European production cuts. The GOLD and SILVER markets were weaker after Wednesday's jumps, but PLATINUM was up again. Compiled from Reuters</p>

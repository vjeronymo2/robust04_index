			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: UK markets Mr Kinnock doubtless has more faith in the judgment of the local electorate than he does in stock markets. Yet the sanguine reaction of London shares to the Tory setback in Thursday's poll is hardly encouraging for the Labour party. Either the market still refuses to believe that he can win come the Big Day, or it is reassured by the thought that any UK government will have to operate within the constraints of the ERM. Since a June election is now almost certainly ruled out, and an October poll increasingly unlikely, the political element is likely to drop out of market thinking for a while - perhaps until Mr Major's next misfortune revives it. At some point, the market will want to see improving economic statistics in the autumn reflected in the Conservatives' opinion-poll rankings. Without that, the gilt market in particular is likely to start reflecting that Labour could still devalue inside the ERM; and its PSBR could easily outstrip even that of a kinder, gentler Toryism.</p>

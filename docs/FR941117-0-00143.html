The general policy of the FCC is to assign one ground station communication channel in an area to a carrier per application cycle, up to a maximum of six ground station communication channels per area. That is, a carrier must apply for one ground station communication channel, receive the authorization, construct the station, and notify the FCC of commencement of service before applying for an additional ground station communication channel in that area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air-ground transmitters in same area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any transmitter on any of the ground station channels listed in &sect;22.805 is considered to be in the same area as another transmitter on any ground station channel listed in &sect;22.805 if it is located less than 350 kilometers (217 miles) from that transmitter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial channel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The FCC will not assign more than one ground station communication channel for new ground stations.

The filing date of any application so amended is the date the FCC received the subsequent application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dismissal of premature applications for additional channel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized ground station prior to receiving notification that the station is providing service to subscribers on the authorized channel(s), the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dismissal of applications for seventh channel. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the FCC receives an application requesting an additional ground station communication channel for an authorized ground station which would, if granted, result in that station being assigned more than six ground station communication channels in the same area, the FCC may dismiss that application without prejudice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.819 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  AGRAS compatibility requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, stations transmitting on the channels listed in &sect;22.805 must operate in compliance with the technical and operational requirements contained in the document, ``Technical Reference, Air-ground Radiotelephone Automated Service (AGRAS), System Operation and Equipment Characteristics'', dated April 12, 1985. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Until January 1, 1996, stations may continue to operate in compliance with the previous standard adopted in Docket 16073. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Copies of the document referenced in this section may be obtained from the FCC's copying contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.821 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Authorization for airborne mobile stations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An authorization separate from any ground station authorization is required for each airborne mobile station that operates on the channels listed in &sect;22.805.

The application must contain an affirmative representation that the applicant has made definite arrangements with a wireline common carrier for service and billing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

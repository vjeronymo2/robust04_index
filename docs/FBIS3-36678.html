The ministry was surprised, he said, that the Estonian  diplomats view the fact that the Russians have yet to submit a  withdrawal timetable as linkage of the military issues with  others such as social guarantees for Russian military pensioners  who stay in Estonia.    Demurin recalled that from the outset of the talks the  Russian negotiators insisted on a civilized solution for the  11,000 pensioners and their families (a total of 44,000 people -  IF). In his words, what the Estonian authorities want boils  down to removal from Estonia of a large number of military  pensioners, most of whom are old people who have lived there for  a long time.    "We reconfirm our resolve to withdraw Russian troops from  Estonia in compliance with bilateral agreements which would  provide a just solution to various problems, in particular the  future of military pensioners," the Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman emphasized.    The 2500 Russian troops now stationed in Estonia are  expected  to be withdrawn before August 31, 1994.</p>

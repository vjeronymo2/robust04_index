			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cotonou, 25 Jan (AFP)--BENIN PRESS AGENCY [ABP] has  disclosed that on 25 January, the Beninese Government banned a  demonstration called for by unions in protest against the social  repercussions of the 11 January CFA franc devaluation.    The press agency disclosed that security forces were  positioned around the Labor Exchange and prevented thousands of  people from going to the meeting point. According to ABP, the  organizers of the demonstration subsequently called off the  strike, accusing the government of not "respecting union  freedom." They stated: "We will fight to the end," adding that  they would "consult the grass roots" before deciding what to do.    On 20 January, the unions called for a 120-percent salary  increase and an over 300-percent increase in the statutory  minimum wage to offset the increase in prices brought on by the  devaluation.    The CFA franc has been devalued by 50 percent in relation to  the French franc, which was its currency of reference and  convertibility. The exchange rate is now 1Fr to 100 CFA francs  instead of the previous rate of 1Fr to 50 CFA francs.    On 23 January, President Nicephore Soglo reiterated that a  price freeze on basic commodities and a series of fiscal relief  measures had been decided upon. He agreed to the "principle" of  a salary adjustment but urged workers to accept a reasonable  salary increase to avoid a damaging and illusory competition  between salary and prices.    [Paris AFP in French at 1506 GMT on 25 January in a similar,  Cotonou-datelined item adds: "It has been observed in Cotonou  that several thousands of people who tried to meet at the  Cotonou Labor Exchange on 25 January in response to a call by  six unions dispersed in the early afternoon without incident  after security forces had prevented them from gathering there.  At 1400 GMT, police were still patrolling the city center,  banning all meetings.    ["The union leaders, who had called for the strike in  protest  against the social repercussions of the 11 January CFA franc  devaluation, have denounced the government's "antidemocratic  attitude" and decided not to attend the working session they  were supposed to have held in the afternoon with President  Nicephore Soglo.    ["In a communique issued on 24 January, the interior  minister  justified the banning of the demonstration by saying that he was  informed of the organizers' intention to round off the meeting  with a march through the city only at the last minute.    ["Minister Antoine Alabi Gbegan told AFP on 25 January:  `This  march was not included in their initial request for permission  to hold the meeting. I, therefore, preferred to ban the  demonstration to avoid any incidents.'"]</p>

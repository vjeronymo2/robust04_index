He added that in a meeting which focused on  external economic activities held earlier this year, the  government emphasised improving and simplifying investment  procedures so that investors would have less trouble in applying  for investment licence.    The law on foreign investment introduced in 1987, is  considered of the more open compared with several other  countries in the region. However, rules governing investment  procedures are very complicated, taking much time and creating a  lot of trouble for investors. At the moment it takes about six  months or even a year to get a project licensed, often having to  be submitted to up to as many as 10 authorised offices for  approval. The meeting, Mr Xuan said, also discussed measures to  secure the implementation of the licensed projects. It affirmed  that great efforts should be made in 1994 to make the investment  environment in Vietnam more favourable. Regarding the export  processing zones (EPZ), Mr Xuan said there was nothing to worry  about the matter of losing the nation's sovereignty (as a number  of people once believed) when opening EPZs. It depends on the  state management in EPZs on Vietnam's laws. The most important  thing is to create favourable conditions to attract more  investment into the EPZs. Mr Xuan further said that the setting  up Tan Thuan EPZ (Ho Chi Minh City) had the potential to be  successful. To date investors had registered to establish their  enterprises, factories and companies in more than half of the  available area. Other EPZs such as ones in Linh Trung (Da  Nang), Haiphong and Soc Son (Hanoi) are expected to be  successfully formed.</p>

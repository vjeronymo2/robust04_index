			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Japan unveils rescue package for economy THE JAPANESE government yesterday approved a Y10,700bn (Pounds 43bn) emergency package aimed at reviving economic growth and rescuing the nation's financial system from crisis. The package is the largest in Japanese history, amounting to 2.3 per cent of gross national product. Government economists estimated the measures would add 2.4 per cent to economic growth in the 12 months from October. The emergency measures were drawn up amid mounting concern that plunging land and stock prices, along with weakening demand throughout the economy, were jeopardising the stability of the financial system. Stock market investors greeted the move enthusiastically yesterday, with the Nikkei average rising 415.79 to 17,970.79. Prices have rebounded 25.6 per cent in the last eight trading days, when news of the package began to leak out. It consists of Y8,600bn of public investment, including road and airport construction, and a government plan to purchase land. The balance of the total, or Y2,100bn, comprises loan provisions from the government to promote private investment. Economists said the package's direct contribution of new government spending to gross national product would be about Y5,200bn. It could add 0.6 or 0.7 per cent to economic growth in the current fiscal year, although most economists believe economic growth is likely to be closer to 2 per cent than to the government's growth target of 3.5 per cent. Full enactment of the measures will require a supplementary budget, expected to be submitted to the Japanese Diet in October or November. Government officials said they did not yet know how much in additional funds would have to be raised by issuing government bonds. The package offered little concrete help for Japan's troubled banking sector, which has been hobbled by a huge burden of bad debt that analysts believe may now total Y30,000bn. The government is nonetheless committed to draw up measures by December to help banks remove bad debt from their books. Billions of yen from government-managed investment portfolios are also being made available for stock market investment, although it is unclear how much of the funds will eventually be used to purchase shares. The deep difficulties facing the economy were underscored yesterday when a range of leading industrial and commercial companies revised down earnings estimates for the current fiscal year, just after the market closed.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison up 34% and looks south WM MORRISON Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery retailer, yesterday announced a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 83.8m and indicated that it might expand southwards. Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said the company, which has 59 superstores in northern England, was searching for a new warehouse which could service its existing outlets, but also allow Morrison to widen its trading area. 'We are unlikely to go further north, and that means we are interested in going further south.' The southwards move would be limited at first, but in later years expansion plans were limited only 'to the mainland.' Pre-tax profits for the year to January 30 rose from Pounds 62.6m to Pounds 83.8m, on turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 1.32bn (Pounds 1.12bn). Like-for-like sales increased 4.6 per cent, and the net operating margin improved from 6.1 per cent to 6.4 per cent for the year, in spite of a fall to 5.8 per cent at the interim stage. Profits were also boosted by interest received of Pounds 3.9m, against a Pounds 3.8m charge previously, thanks to the Pounds 98m rights issue in November 1991. Earnings increased to 7.23p (6.16p) fully diluted and 7.71p (6.59p) basic. The increased final dividend of 0.64p raises the total to 0.8p (0.67p). Mr Ackroyd said staff costs and overheads rose broadly in line with sales, but the depreciation charge increased Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 23.3m. Some Pounds 1.1m of the increase was accounted for by the policy, adopted last May, of depreciating freehold land assets. This recognised that the alternative use value of sites might be much less than their food retailing value. Morrison, recently named top-performing company by the Institute of Directors, opened six superstores last year at Beverley, Walsall, Mansfield, Oldham, Kendal and Lincoln. It is adding new space as a percentage of its total selling area at a faster rate than any of its bigger national rivals. COMMENT The news that Morrison may move south is cause for alarm for the bigger national chains. The company's refusal to pay more than a fraction of what its competitors hand over for new sites has allowed it to match them in its service and merchandising range, but undercut them in price. It also allowed the company to expand its sales base last year by 12 per cent, with only a Pounds 3m cash outflow. A resurgent Asda, which has a similar selling proposition and competes in the same areas, could be a threat, but Morrison has scope to reduce prices further if necessary. With current-year profits forecast at about Pounds 100m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 18.3 - a big premium to the sector, but Morrison offers the fastest profit growth.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India prepares for bumper tea crop India, the world's biggest producer of tea, which harvested a record tea crop of 758.1m kg in 1993, is set for another bumper crop this year. In the five months to May the country's production was up 12.8m kg to 194.6m. However, the gain in production was entirely on account of the gardens in south India, where output of 83.6m kg was up 16.8m on the corresponding period of last year. North Indian production fell by 4m kg to 111m. 'The quality of Indian tea has remained steady, except for what was produced in north India in the month of April. The quality suffered in April as the production rose to an all-time high of 60m kg,' said Mr HM Parekh, chairman of J. Thomas, the world's biggest tea broking firm. In spite of the early lead in production, industry officials think that the Indian tea output in the current year will be around last year's level. They say that the tea estates are 'not going to repeat the mistake' of producing large quantities in November and December, as they did in 1993. The extra production of 16m kg - much of it of inferior grades - in the last two months of 1993 was largely responsible for the sharp fall in tea prices. In the six months to June, the north Indian CTC (cut, tear and curl) leaf tea fetched an average auction price of Rs44.04 a kilogram, compared with Rs51.76 in the corresponding period of last year. 'This is a crisis year for the south Indian gardens, which in the first half could realise for orthodox leaf only Rs33 a kg, against Rs48, and for CTC leaf Rs29.13, against Rs44.55,' said Mr Parekh. 'At these prices the gardens are not able to provide adequate funds for fertiliser and pesticide.' In spite of Kenyan output falling 21m kg to 75.4m kg in the first five months the world crop, aided by a strong Indonesian recovery and higher output in India and Sri Lanka, was nearly 9m kg up on the same period last year. Tea has been fetching lower prices at all auction centres. 'However, south Indian teas suffered the sharpest erosion in value,' said Mr Parekh. Industry officials point out that, defying the general trend in prices at the auctions, Darjeeling tea (orthodox leaf) fetched a higher average price of Rs127.49 a kg in the first half of the current year, compared with Rs116.63 in the same period of 1993. Similarly, 'the really good liquoring CTC teas with coloury, full cups have been able to hold their ground. These, however, constitute less than 20 per cent of production in Assam,' said Mr Parekh. The setback in prices of orthodox tea has much to do with the lower enquiries from the former Soviet Union and Iran. As for CTC tea, for which the principal market is within the country, consumers 'are ready to pay a premium for quality. The medium and plainer CTCs are, however, meeting with weak domestic enquiries,' said Mr Parekh.</p>

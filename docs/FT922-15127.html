			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Observer: Unexplained The newest addition to the list of those embarrassed by the fall from grace of Control Securities' Nazmu Virani is no less than the Agha Khan. In December 1990 Virani was appointed the UK member of the supreme advisory body for the Agha Khan's 12m Ismaili Muslim followers throughout the world, the International Conciliation and Arbitration Board. As Virani was being remanded in custody for a week by City of London Magistrates on charges of conspiring to present false accounts to the BCCI auditors Price Waterhouse, the Agha Khan's headquarters staff in France were unable to comment on the reasons for or details of his appointment. For some of the faithful, however, the latest development will merely be confirmation of their long-voiced misgivings about having a brewer in such a senior Islamic position.</p>

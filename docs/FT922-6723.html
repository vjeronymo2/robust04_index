			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Letter: Views polarised on state of vocational training in UK (2) Sir, Malcolm Craig is widely off the mark and totally inaccurate when he writes of 'hotch-potch' training in the construction industry. Construction, which employs one in 10 of Britain's workforce, has developed a highly disciplined, properly integrated and, more to the point, employer-led training base. Led by the Construction Industry Training Board, it has the biggest youth training programme of any industry in Britain, and YT has long been accepted as the preferred method of entry training for craft workers. More than 165,000 young people have been through the scheme under the CITB's managing agency, training for up to two years in very specific industry-related occupations. Today we are training some 16,000, despite the recession. Periods of instruction and supervised practice at a college or training centre alternate with periods under supervision on site. These on-site periods are generally spent with the trainee's sponsoring or employing company in order to give practical experience of day-to-day working techniques and conditions. There are 30 individual skills and occupations for which the CITB provides YT programmes. Until now, most of those completing the programme have gone on to gain City and Guilds craft qualifications after further training under apprentice-type arrangements. We expect most of those who complete the programme in future to achieve the construction national vocational qualifications now jointly awarded by the CITB and City and Guilds. Equally important, more than 90 per cent of those who have finished the programme have remained in the industry in permanent jobs. Surely evidence enough to confirm that their training has been wholly relevant, and not hotch-potch.

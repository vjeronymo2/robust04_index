			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum moves for Brabant ABERDEEN Petroleum, the US-based oil and gas production company which is quoted in London, yesterday threw down the gauntlet to Brabant Resources with an all-paper bid valuing the UK explorer at Pounds 6.5m. The move follows Aberdeen's protracted efforts to reach agreement on a friendly merger with Brabant. If successful, a takeover would double Aberdeen's issued capital. Mr Nicholas Gay, Brabant's finance director, said his group still strongly opposed any proposals from Aberdeen. 'It is not consistent with Brabant's strategy and there is no clear synergy,' he said. Brabant would delay its results, due tomorrow, until Aberdeen's offer document is published. Aberdeen is offering 35 shares - which closed 1 1/4 p down at 11 1/4 p  - for every 10 Brabant. This values Brabant at 39.3p per share, compared with last night's close of 39p, up 10p on the day. Aberdeen already controls 21.4 per cent of Brabant. This includes its holding of 9.99 per cent and irrevocable undertakings from Titon Oil &amp; Metals to accept the bid in respect of its 11.4 per cent stake. Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director, said the takeover made sense in the light of an inevitable rationalisation of the small oil and gas sector. 'If we can glue a lot of these companies together, and increase liquidity, it would make sense (for institutional shareholders)', he said. Significant savings could be achieved on overheads and by cutting down exploration. The bid was described by analysts and some institutional investors as opportunistic, however. One analyst suggested that Aberdeen, with all its assets in North America, 'is carrying costs in the UK which the US is not happy about'. A large shareholder also suggested that Aberdeen was trying to fend off its own potential predator. Pittencrief, the telecommunications and resource group, recently took a 16.6 per cent stake in Aberdeen. Pittencrief is reported to be building up its oil and gas assets in advance of a demerger of its two divisions.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Italy may consider Dollars 15bn borrowing programme this year ITALY yesterday returned to the Eurobond market, after a two-year absence, with a DM4bn (Dollars 2.5bn) issue in what could be the start of a Dollars 15bn international borrowing programme this year. Pricing for the five-year bond, which marks the second biggest D-Mark Eurobond issued and Italy's borrowing debut in the German currency, will be revealed this afternoon. Bankers expect the transaction to offer a yield spread of between 45 and 50 basis points (0.45 to 0.5 percentage points) over the yield of five-year German government bonds. Pricing is likely to be a sensitive issue. Italy has seen its credit rating tumble following last year's political and currency turmoil, plus international banking dissatisfaction with the government's attitude to the debts of the Efim state holding company, now in voluntary liquidation. Having benefited from the triple-A rating until the early 1990s, which allowed it to borrow at the cheapest rates, Italy last year suffered a two-notch cut in its rating by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency. Political approval for major budget cuts, principally a L93bn (Dollars 62m) budget reduction package this year, has been among the prime factors in influencing Italy's return to the Euromarkets. Mr Mario Draghi, the director general of the Italian treasury, said the government would like to borrow between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 15bn this year, subject to investor demand and market conditions. That would be two and a half times the level of borrowing at the peak of Italy's Euromarket activity in 1990. Future issues would be in a range of currencies and at either fixed or floating interest rates. Italy also retained its commitment to the Ecu market, he said. Italy's last Euromarket issue was a Ecu2.5bn issue in February 1991. The D-Mark bond is likely to involve around 30 banks, comprising German, Italian and leading international financial institutions. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank board member responsible for corporate finance, indicated the response had been good so far and a 'good share' of the paper had been placed already. Borrowing in D-Marks should help Italy reduce its large debt-servicing costs in the long-term. Five-year German interest rates are currently more than 5 percentage points below equivalent rates in lira, while demand for D-Mark paper has opened a substantial window of opportunity for many borrowers to issue at attractive spreads. Last November, the UK took advantage of the market by launching a DM5.5bn issue, also led by Deutsche Bank, at just 10 basis points over equivalent German paper. The new issue will strengthen the reserves of the Bank of Italy, which were sorely depleted in defending the lira prior to its 7 per cent devaluation and subsequent departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September. The issue should also help to create a Euromarket benchmark in D-Marks for other Italian borrowers. See Lex.</p>

Members of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National  Committee from educational circles gathered there and invited Li  Lanqing, Political Bureau member of the CPC Central Committee  and State Council vice premier, to jointly discuss major guiding  principles for education.    "I have been assigned to take charge of education for only a  year; therefore, I am a `freshman.' As a student, I must first  learn. CPPCC members present here today are experts in  education. I have come to listen to and learn from you. This is  an excellent opportunity," said Li Lanqing candidly in his  opening remarks. At once, the atmosphere was enlivened.    Members successively took the floor.    Vice Chairman Wang Hu of the Beijing Industry University's  Administrative Committee called for increased investment in  education;    Vice President Su Dongzhuang of the Beijing Information  Engineering Institute stressed the need to stabilize the  contingent of teachers and raise the quality of education;    Fudan University Professor Hu Hesheng suggested stepping up  efforts to improve the basic subjects taught at schools of  higher learning;    Vice Chairman Guo Yanjie of the Liaoning Provincial  Education  Commission called for energetic efforts to promote vocational  and adult education;    Vice Principal Liu Sifu of Shunnanjie Primary School in  Sichuan's Suining city stressed the need to implement the  "Teachers Law" to the letter;    .... [ellipses as published]    As he listened and took notes, Li Lanqing often nodded  approvingly.    After hearing the speeches, he said: The issues you have  just brought up are similar to those I heard during discussions  over the past year. Practical problems in education can be  divided into three categories -- investment, teachers'  remuneration, and their housing conditions. As far as  educational investment is concerned, the party Central Committee  and the State Council have attached great importance to this  issue, and all local governments and relevant departments have  exerted great efforts and done a tremendous job. Spending in  this year's budget on educational undertakings has increased  18.5 percent over last year, including 81.5 billion yuan from  budgetary funds, which is up 19.1 percent over last year.  However, it is true that, as you have just mentioned, spending  on education is offset by inflation. This problem, which exists  not only in educational spending but also the entire state  budget, should be studied further. In short, we should  gradually increase investment in education in accordance with  the requirements of the "Outline for Reforming and Developing  Education in China."    Speaking on the problem of teachers' remunerations, Li  Lanqing said: The principle need to increase teachers'  remunerations is legislation. The "Teachers' Law," which was  promulgated last year, must be strictly enforced. In view of  the problem of the wage default to teachers raised by some  members, Li Lanqing said: Last year the Education, Science,  Culture, and Public Health Committee under the National People's  Congress organized the State Education Commission and  departments concerned to conduct an inspection of law  enforcement in six provinces. According to their inspection and  report, past wage defaults have been basically cleared. What is  important now is to forestall the recurrence of defaults and to  establish a mechanism to ensure that teachers are paid every  month according to their teaching hours. He stressed: All  localities which have not cleared wage defaults to teachers are  not allowed to construct buildings or purchase automobiles;  cadres from coastal areas where wage defaults have not been  cleared are not allowed to go abroad or they will face  investigation and punishment for violating discipline. In the  meantime, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and control  over funds for education and to establish and perfect the  supervisory mechanism. Except for economically-developed areas,  the leadership and management of basic education should be, in  principle, taken charge of by county-level authorities and  should not be delegated to lower authorities.    Speaking on the problem of housing for teachers, Li Lanqing  said: If leaders at all levels earnestly place education in the  strategic position of priority development, there will be some  ways to resolve the problem of housing for teachers. We can  practice frugality in some areas, but we must run educational  undertakings well and do some practical things for teachers. Li  Lanqing also praised leaders from Beijing, Dalian, and other  places for their attention to educational work and the methods  of actively resolving teachers' housing problems. He said: I  asked central and local television stations as well as other  mass media to cover the principal measures of various localities  in enforcing the "Teachers' Law." It revealed that all  localities had some measures to serve teachers in a practical  way.    Li Lanqing continued: China is now a poor country running  the world's largest educational undertaking. In view of this,  merely relying on governments at all levels to strive to resolve  the aforementioned problems is still not enough for the  development of education in China. The key lies first in reform  and, second, in encouraging the enthusiasm of all sectors to run  educational undertakings.    Li Lanqing stressed the need to readjust the macrostructure  of education. First of all, we should make efforts to run basic  education well and vigorously develop vocational and adult  education. Basic education should be conducted in rural areas  in line with local conditions. Vocational and technical  training should be incorporated into basic education, so as to  train skilled peasants to promote the application of science in  farming and developing village and town enterprises. In cities,  students should be gradually introduced to various specialities  after junior middle school, and vocational education of various  levels should be vigorously developed so as to cultivate  personnel useful to society. This will be the way to become  useful persons for the overwhelming majority of Chinese youths.  As for higher education, greater efforts should be made in  reforming the patterns of running schools, systems, the creation  of branches of learning and courses, teaching contents,  enrollment, tuition, and distribution with a view to improving  teaching quality and the efficiency of running schools as well  as meeting current and long-term needs for developing a  socialist market economy. Some reforms should be popularized  before experimentation, and it is necessary to conduct in-depth  and meticulous ideological and political work to enhance  everybody's identification with the reform; thus vigorously and  steadily promoting educational reform. Meanwhile, we should  encourage all institutions of higher learning to supplement one  another with their respective supremacy, share resources,  advocate a gradual removal of barriers between them, and jointly  run shools. Li Lanqing also emphasized the need to strengthen  and improve moral education in schools.    Xu Zhijian, deputy secretary general of the State Council  and  persons in charge of the State Education Commission, Ministry of  Finance, Ministry of Personnel, and departments concerned  attended the forum and answered questions the members were  concerned about.</p>

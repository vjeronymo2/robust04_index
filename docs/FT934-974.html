			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Bomb alerts hit London again Bomb alerts paralysed much of London's train and Underground systems yesterday as the IRA's campaign of disruption continued to punctuate the talks on Northern Ireland. Police searched 200 miles of track between London and Sevenoaks in Kent after receiving coded telephone calls from Dublin. Some 37 stations were closed, including the main London stations of Victoria, Blackfriars, London Bridge, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Waterloo East. The disruption was the latest in a series of random terrorist activity - either acknowledged by the IRA or attributed to it - that has provided an unsettling backdrop to the talks between London and Dublin. The anti-terrorist branch of the Metropolitan Police has joined forces with the British Transport Police to deal with the disruption, aimed at Christmas shoppers and retailers as much as commuters. Mr John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert with a security consultancy, said the latest campaign of disruption suggested a deep-rooted fragmentation within the IRA that reflected the allegiances of the small cells which made up the organisation. He said that the IRA's command structure did not have 'full control' of all the cells. Nor did Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, speak for the entire organisation. 'Part of the IRA wants to keep the pressure up because they do not think that the concessions offered go far enough,' Mr Wyatt said. 'But they don't want to do anything too radical. The latest disruption is not intended to lead to serious loss of life and doesn't pose much threat of injury either.' All British Rail lines except those between London and Sevenoaks were running normally by early afternoon.</p>

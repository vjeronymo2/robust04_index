			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 MILLION APPAREL JOBS AT RISK -- REPORT  </P> <P> More than one million apparel and textile workers -- mainly women, minorities  and immigrants -- will lose their jobs if government officials fail to reverse  policies that are sabotaging the industries, a new report from the liberal  Economic Policy Institute contends.  </P> <P> The industries -- taken together, the second-largest manufacturing employer in  Los Angeles County and one of the biggest nationally -- could be virtually  wiped out in this country by 2000 if current trends continue, according to the  study.  </P> <P> Richard Rothstein, a Los Angeles research consultant who wrote the Economic  Policy Institute study, said in an interview Thursday that the heaviest toll  would be taken on "a part of the labor force for which there are no better  alternatives." He said dislocated apparel and textile workers "can't easily be  moved" into other types of jobs, largely because of their lack of job skills.  </P> <P> To counter the industry's decline, the study calls for a variety of government  initiatives, revisions in existing economic policies and tighter enforcement of  import quotas. The study's sponsor, the Washington-based Economic Policy  Institute, is a research group backed by organized labor and other interests.  </P> <P> Some other analysts characterized the report as off-target or overblown. Edward  Hudgins, deputy director of economic policy studies for the conservative  Heritage Foundation, criticized it for relying on quotas, which he contends  have backfired in the past for the textile and steel industries.  </P> <P> Hudgins argued that quotas "keep inefficient workers and industries going in  this country" and translate into higher prices for consumers.  </P> <P> "If we have a world flooded with cheap underwear, who cares if we make it or  not?" Hudgins said. Hudgins quickly added that the U.S. apparel and textile  industries should remain a significant factor, albeit a smaller one, in the  economy for years to come because of improved technologies that will partly  offset overseas competitors' cheaper labor costs.  </P> <P> Carl Preistland, chief economist for the American Apparel Manufacturers Assn.,  said he agreed that the nation's apparel industry -- whose employment fell from  1.26 million in 1980 to 1.09 million last year -- would continue to decline  because of increased imports. He added, however, that even without government  initiatives, many American women's apparel makers could continue to thrive by  offering such advantages as quicker deliveries than foreign firms provide.  </P> <P> The Economic Policy Institute's study argued that U.S. apparel and textile  makers could exploit those advantages -- which it said also include greater  labor productivity, proximity to designers and retailers, and manufacturing  flexibility -- to maintain its strength. The report contended, however, that  government officials have mistakenly conceded that the collapse of the  industries is inevitable due to foreign competition.  </P> <P> According to the study, the foreign firms' gains have come largely because of  flawed U.S. policies. It cited foreign debt policies that have put pressure on  Mexican workers' wages, thereby undercutting U.S. competitors with higher labor  costs. The study also contended that apparel makers in the Caribbean can get  more U.S. aid than domestic firms, in the form of engineering help, training  programs and marketing.  </P> <P> A continued decline in apparel and textiles, the study said, would ripple  through many allied industries and lead to big increases in government spending  on welfare and other programs.  </P> <P> To support the apparel and textile industries, the institute called for pushing  for improved international labor standards that would raise foreign workers'  wages. It also endorsed government programs that would promote cooperatives  enabling small apparel contractors and subcontractors to pool their efforts and  measures to bring together domestic buyers and sellers of apparel products.  </P> <P> In addition, it called on the government to encourage apparel exports and  provide more credit to contractors' to help them cut their interest expenses.  </P> <P> According to government figures, Los Angeles County last month had 87,900 jobs  in apparel manufacturing and 12,100 in textile production.  </P></p>

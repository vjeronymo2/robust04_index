Recognition of the election results and the installation of  millionaire Moshood Abiola, a Yoruba Moslem businessman, would  remove the "cancer that will afflict the people of Nigeria for  generations," the Ibo leaders said in a statement.    The June 12 election was annulled by then military ruler  General Ibrahim Babangida on the grounds of irregularities,  though international observers had called it free and fair. The  eastern-based Ibos, together with the Hausa and the Yoruba, are  the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria, Africa's most populous  nation, with some 89 million people.    Plans by the current military regime of General Sani Abacha  to hold a constitutional conference to chart the country's  future should be scrapped in favor of a national conference, the  Ibo leaders added. Members of the conference must be elected  and their decisions should be final, they said.    The leaders also called Nigeria's very future into question.  Nigerian unity had been maintained by force by the northern  military class against the people of the" rest of the country,  they said, adding that the merger of north with south in 1914  under British colonial rule "was a monumental mistake or so it  seems". The government has, however, warned that it will make  no compromises on the issue of the continued existence of  Nigeria as a entity during the conference scheduled to take  place in the first quarter of the year.    Nigeria suffered a bloody civil war in the late 1960s after  the Ibo Eastern State region of the time tried in vain to secede  as independent Biafra, after a dispute over the distribution of  oil revenues from the region.</p>

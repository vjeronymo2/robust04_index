At talks in Canberra,  Prime Minister Paul Keating urged Mr. Rabuka to keep up the  momentum in favor of constitutional reform. Mr. Rabuka said he  now believed he has earned the trust of Canberra.

[end recording]    Mr. Rabuka said native Fijians and Fiji's Indians would both  have to make compromises on constitutional issues for the good  of Fiji. [passage omitted]</p>

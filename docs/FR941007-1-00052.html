			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Smaller banks and thrifts would continue to be evaluated under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> streamlined assessment method that would not require reporting of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lending data. However, the streamlined method would be the presumptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for evaluating small institutions and would be applied to every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying institution unless the institution affirmatively requests an alternative assessment method. The agencies have also altered the description of the streamlined assessment method in order to make clear that this assessment is not intended to operate as an exemption from the CRA rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The streamlined assessment method would continue to focus on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's loan-to-deposit ratio, degree of local lending, record of lending to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers and geographies of different income levels, and record of responding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to complaints. The institution's fair lending record would still be taken into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account in assigning a final rating. In response to comments, the agencies have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated the provision in the December proposal that made a loan-to-deposit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio of 60% or more presumptively satisfactory. The revised proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider an institution's size, financial condition, and credit needs of its service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area in evaluating whether its loan-to-deposit ratio is reasonable. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation would further consider, as appropriate, other lending-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities, such as originations for sale on the secondary market and community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development lending and investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Every institution would continue to have the option to be evaluated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to a pre-approved strategic plan. The strategic plan option would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relieve an institution from any reporting obligations that it otherwise would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have. The revised proposal clarifies, however, that small institutions would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject themselves to any data reporting responsibilities by electing the strategic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan option. The agencies also have provided more detail as to how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed strategic plan option would operate in practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal has eliminated provisions that some comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted as ``safe harbors'' from examination or enforcement action. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised proposal would not make substantive modifications to the December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions governing what types of institutions are subject to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, although the agencies have clarified that bankers banks would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be covered. The revised proposal continues to provide that uninsured branches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of foreign banks would not be covered by the proposed regulations. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agencies are aware that the Interstate Banking Efficiency Act would address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the CRA coverage of certain uninsured branches of foreign banks. Should this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act be signed into law, the agencies would modify the revised proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the new legal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December proposal would have made an institution with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned rating of ``substantial noncompliance'' subject to an enforcement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 12 U.S.C. 1818. A number of commenters questioned the legal authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the agencies under the CRA to use assigned ratings as the basis for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement action. Other commenters endorsed taking enforcement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against institutions with poor CRA ratings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal includes the enforcement provisions from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal while the agencies continue to analyze the issues raised by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comments. The agencies invite further comment on these issues before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuing a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> The Lending Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The lending test in the December proposal would have evaluated_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of its performance in relation to other lenders subject to CRA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on an independent basis_the extent to which a retail institution was making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans in the low- and moderate-income portions of its service area. The test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have evaluated an institution's lending performance relative to other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders by comparing the institution's market share of housing, small business,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small farm, and consumer loans in the low- and moderate-income geographies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its service area with its share of such loans in the other parts of its service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area. The test would have evaluated performance on an independent basis by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examining the ratio of reported loans made (both number and amount) by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution in the low- and moderate-income geographies of its service area to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reported loans made throughout its entire service area and the geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of its reported loans across the low- and moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographies of its service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the election of the institution, the agencies would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered indirect loans under the lending test. Indirect loans were defined to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include loans made by third parties, such as lending consortia, subsidiaries of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution, non-chartered affiliates funded by the institution, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenders that lent to low- and moderate-income individuals or geographies and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the institution had made lawful investments. The agencies would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributed indirect loans to an institution in proportion to the size of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's investment in or funding of the third party lender or participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the third party's loans, provided the institution reported the indirect loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

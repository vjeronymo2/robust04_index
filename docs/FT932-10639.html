			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: US stores see slight recovery in April sales LEADING US store chains reported only a very modest recovery in sales last month, despite better shopping conditions during April. For many of the largest retailers, same-store sales gains in April were in the low single digits - although most acknowledged this was an advance on the March results, when severe winter storms hit much of the country. Nevertheless, the results were quickly seen as reinforcing the notion that economic recovery was slow and patchy in the US. Among the big discount chains, for example, K mart reported a 2.8 per cent same-store sales advance in its general merchandise division and a 3.4 per cent decline for the specialty chains. The company said the lift in sales, over the March figures, was 'most pronounced in hardline merchandise categories', although it noted clothing sales had been dampened by the cool weather. Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's top-selling retailer, reported 6 per cent growth in like-for-like sales. At Sears, Roebuck, sales on a like-for-like basis rose by 5 per cent, with the strongest improvements coming in clothing, footwear, fine jewellery, home office equipment and some garden items. But Woolworth saw a 2.3 per cent fall in same-store sales, causing Mr Harold Sells, chairman, to blame 'weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence'. The picture among department stores was similar. May Department Stores reported a 2.3 per cent advance in same-store sales last month, while Federated - which takes Abraham &amp; Straus and Bloomingdale's - managed a 2.2 per cent advance. Among the more specialised retailers, The Gap - the once high-flying fashion chain - reported only a 2 per cent advance in same-store sales, while The Limited said like-for-like sales were flat.</p>

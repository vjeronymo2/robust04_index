			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The Long View: Mortgages that threaten ruin GLOOM HAS recently intensified in the British housing market, with Halifax Building Society's estimate of a remarkable and unprecedented 3.1 per cent average price drop in the single month of September. True, there were exceptional factors such as the ending of the stamp duty holiday in August, and anyway September is seasonally weak. However, the figure only confirms the underlying downtrend, with a year-on-year decline of 7.5 per cent. Applied across the UK's 15.5m owner-occupied dwellings that implies a loss of aggregate wealth of Pounds 80bn in 12 months. To a greater or lesser extent this hits us all. The biggest postbag I ever received after one of these Saturday columns was in January 1990 when I suggested that UK entry to the ERM would knock 25 per cent off house prices. My correspondents - who included a Tory MP - were alarmed: could I be serious? Indeed I was, but when the government duly entered the ERM nine months later one of its biggest errors was its failure to warn housebuyers of the risks. However the politicians were thinking much more about the next general election than about the need to protect gullible homebuyers from a powerful lending industry keen to thrust 100 per cent mortgages down their throats. But much water, as well as money, has flowed under the bridge. We are now out of the ERM again, and merrily cutting interest rates. Will house prices, freed from Germanic restraint, get back on to their former uptrend? I suspect, not for quite a while. On average, according to the Halifax, house prices have fallen by 12 per cent in nominal terms since the national market peaked in July 1989. Allowing for retail price inflation that is a decline of 27 per cent in real terms. And although house prices have been known in the past to fall in real terms the nominal decline of the past three or four years is quite unprecedented in the living memory of homeowners. In London nominal prices are down by 24 per cent since a late 1988 peak. Of course, if you live in Scotland you may wonder what all the fuss is about. House prices there are still rising (just) and the puncturing of the great south-east England house price bubble has meant that the ratio of prices in London and Scotland has returned to early 1980s levels at about 1.35 instead of the 2.3 touched in 1988. In one sense, therefore, the housing market is simply returning to sanity, in a thoroughly healthy way. This applies to the earnings relationship too. Whereas the ratio of the average house price to average earnings headed dangerously for the stratosphere in 1989, reaching almost 5.0, it is now just about back within what could be regarded as the historically normal range of 3.0-3.5. But there the good news ends, because it would be prudent to expect the ratio to undershoot on the downside: it could easily drop significantly below 3 before the confidence of both borrowers and lenders can be rebuilt. Moreover we must remember that although house price relationships have become rebalanced, in one vital respect there has been a big change since the mid-1980s: much more debt is secured on the British housing stock. Values have been declining in the past two years, but mortgage outstandings have continued climbing - from Pounds 294bn to Pounds 321bn in 1991, and probably by nearly another Pounds 20bn this year. Ten years ago mortgages represented 22 per cent of the value of the housing stock, but today the figure is a worrying 35 per cent. This is worse than it looks, because there are mortgages on only 10m homes, which therefore bear 54 per cent debt on average. Within the 10m is a significant (at least 10 per cent, and growing) proportion on which the debt:equity ratio is over 100 per cent. Will a post-devaluation spurt in inflation help? The trouble is, only pay inflation will ease the burden. In the next year or two pay rises are likely to lag behind price inflation as the personal sector suffers a cut in living standards. There is precious little comfort there, although yesterday's one-point cut in interest rates will obviously help. Lots of self-serving solutions are being promoted by the mortgage industry. The other week I received a press release from a firm of mortgage counsellors whose business is advising home owners who cannot service their debts. Answers to the crisis, it was suggested, included encouraging banks and building societies to offer 100 per cent mortgages to first time buyers and finding a way in which second time buyers could carry their negative equity over to their next house. Otherwise house prices could never recover. But it was 100 per cent mortgages that got us into this mess in the first place. It is hard to imagine that more of the same could ultimately be good for anybody except debt counsellors. Of course, the lending industry is desperate for a sharp jump in house prices that would bail everybody out of the current disaster. Awkwardly, the rational view is that on the fundamentals house prices at present are not low. Moreover they might well ease further over the next year - what price homes in the Yorkshire coalfields? - before beginning to climb slowly in parallel with average earnings. If it works out like this, up to 2m home buyers and important sections of the mortgage lending industry face potential ruin. It is time for the government to be preparing a national household mortgage workout scheme to absorb, reschedule and, where necessary, write down the problem loans. The sums will be staggering, because the debt involved must be of the order of Pounds 50bn. This includes the 1m-plus uncovered mortgages which are not in most cases bad but must be refinanced on a partially unsecured basis if young people are not to be stuck for many years in starter homes. Acacia Avenue is sinking under water and will soon need a lifeboat.</p>

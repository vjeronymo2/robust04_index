			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUCKS, CAR PILE UP IN FREEWAY TUNNEL  </P> <P> Six big-rig trucks and a car slammed into each other Friday evening in a  chain-reaction pileup at the end of a rain-slicked tunnel on the Golden State  Freeway near Newhall, authorities said. Two occupants in the car were injured,  one seriously.  </P> <P> The pileup occurred at 7 p.m. when a truck nearing the tunnel's exit skidded on  the wet pavement and jackknifed, causing other trucks to crash as they came  around a blind curve, said California Highway Patrol Officer Louie Pravettone.  The car, a Volkswagen hatchback, struck the back of the last truck in the  pileup about a minute after the initial crash, Pravettone said.  </P> <P> The driver of the car, described as in his 20s, was arrested on suspicion of  drunk driving after officers found several open cans of beer in the car and  smelled alcohol on his breath, Pravettone said. The driver suffered moderate  injuries.  </P> <P> None of the truck drivers were injured in the crash, which occurred in the  southbound truck lanes below the Antelope Valley Freeway overpass, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Witnesses described the crash scene as chaotic.  </P> <P> "I was coming around the corner and I saw a bunch of metal flying and saw a  little car crash into the back of a truck," said Don Vogt, 43, who swerved his  loaded tanker-trailer rig and avoided hitting the car. "It was just all crazy.  Trucks and cars were going all over the place."  </P> <P> Pravettone said the passenger in the car was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center  in Mission Hills. The driver was being treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial  Hospital in Valencia. Their names were not immediately released.  </P> <P> The tunnel was expected to be closed for several hours until the wreckage could  be cleared, Pravettone said. Southbound trucks were being diverted to car  lanes.  </P> <P> WET WEEKEND AHEAD  </P> <P> A storm that flooded streets in the Bay Area headed into Southern California  for the long holiday weekend.

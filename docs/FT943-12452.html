			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chairman of Lac Minerals steps down A shareholder revolt has forced Mr Peter Allen to step down as chairman and chief executive of Lac Minerals, the Canadian gold and base metals producer which is in the throes of fighting a hostile takeover bid. Mr Allen had become a lightning rod for shareholders' dissatisfaction since Royal Oak Mines, a much smaller but more aggressive Vancouver gold producer, came forward with a CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.01bn) takeover offer this month. The rationale behind Royal Oak's bid was that Lac, which has mines in Canada, the US and Chile, was not realising its full potential under existing management. Mr Allen's departure throws another obstacle in front of Royal Oak, whose bid, consisting largely of its own shares, was already considered a long shot. Lac shares are expected to rise sharply on the Toronto stock exchange today. They climbed by 37 cents to CDollars 13.38 on Friday before Mr Allen's resignation was announced. The shares are widely held, mainly by US and Canadian institutions. Many have made their displeasure with management known in recent weeks by tentatively tendering their shares to Royal Oak. Mr Allen, aged 54, said: 'I have listened very carefully to Lac's shareholders and their concerns about management. I am not prepared to let personalities define this takeover fight and distract from the fundamental economic issues at stake.' Mr Jim Pitblado, a non-executive director and former head of Canada's biggest securities firm, will take over as Lac chairman and acting chief executive officer. Mr Pitblado said the board would prefer Lac to remain an independent, widely-traded Canadian company. He plans to present that case to shareholders this week. However, he said the board would keep its options open should another bid materialise.</p>

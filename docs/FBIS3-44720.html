			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] A top ROC [Republic of China] trade negotiator has  said that if Washington and Taipei can reach preliminary  agreement on tariff cuts when they meet this month, Taiwan will  be prepared to lower some of them by April or May for the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    (Huang Yen-tao), director general of the Board of Foreign  Trade and the government's chief trade negotiator, pledged not  to give in easily to Washington's demand when he meets with U.S.  negotiators on January 19.    The U.S. Trade Representative Office gave the Board of  Foreign Trade a list of 2,785 products last year in November on  which the U.S. [words indistinct] wants Taiwan to cut trade  tariffs on as a prerequisite for its entry into the GATT. Of  the 2,785 products, Taipei was given a December 3 deadline to  lower tariffs by 50 percent on 699 items. Among the 699 items  she mentioned in the ultimatum, 514 were auto and industrial  manufacturing products. Taipei rejected Washington's request in  December last year but agreed to discuss the issue in bilateral  tariffs negotiation early this year.</p>

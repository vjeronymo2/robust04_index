			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Torture 'still widespread in China' Torture is still widespread and systematic in China despite the Beijing government's claims to have instituted reforms, Amnesty International said in a report published today, Reuter reports. The London-based human rights group said the practice of torture had actually spread in the last 10 years to become endemic in many Chinese detention centres and prisoners now suffered much more severe abuses. A Chinese government report to be submitted to the United Nations' Committee Against Torture on April 22 makes largely false claims that torture cases are scrupulously investigated and the torturers brought to justice, Amnesty said.</p>

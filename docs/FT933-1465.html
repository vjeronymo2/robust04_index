			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Aspiring doctors are undeterred MEDICAL school applications in the US reached a record high this year, despite the uncertain effects healthcare reform will have on the lives of doctors. 'It has made sure that people are doing it for other reasons than to make a lot of money,' said Mr Brian Nelson, a medical student at the George Washington University School of Medicine. With the University of California, San Francisco, receiving 5,100 applications last year for 140 medical school places, other reasons are clearly abundant. The attraction may be job security. The push towards 'managed care', whereby doctors would form networks to compete for business, is likely to reduce salaries. At the same time the Clinton administration hopes to increase the number of students entering general medicine to 50 per cent within five years. In 1992 just 15 per cent of medical students chose primary care specialties, with salary differentials the main reason for the low take-up. A GP makes an average of Dollars 111,500 a year, while a specialist averages Dollars 233,500.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Beijing University professor  Ding Zilin has launched a two-day hunger strike in protest at  heavy police surveillance of her home, ahead of the fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, a source said Friday.    A tearful Ding, whose son Jiang Jielian was shot by soldiers  on June 3, 1989, said she and her husband Jiang Peikun had only  drunk water since after dinner Thursday, according to a reporter  who succeeded in telephoning the protesters Friday despite  official efforts to isolate them.    Jiang Peikun, also a professor, said this week that if  police  officers outside their home had not left by Thursday the couple  would begin their protest at 6:25 p.m. (1025 GMT) and continue  until Saturday, the anniverary of the army's crushing of  pro-democracy demonstraters on June 4, 1989.    The hunger strike's starting time marks the moment of the  birth of Jiang Jielan, who celebrated his 17th birthday one day  before being killed.    The couple lit candles on a birthday cake Thursday to mark  what would have been his 22nd birthday.    "My son was shot between 11:05 and 11:15 pm on June 3,"  Ding,  a 57-year-old philosophy professor who suffers from heart  problems, told this reporter. "I don't know when he actually  stopped breathing. I will continue to fast till June 4 because  I want to commemorate others who died with him," she said.    Ding said her heart had been bothering her Thursday night  but  insisted that she was now better and lying in bed very calmly.  The reporter said however that Ding was crying and sounded weak  and shaky.    The number of plainclothes police visible from her window  had  increased from about four to eight Thursday night, the professor  said, confirming that the reporter was the only person to  succeed in calling her in almost 24 hours. The authorities  began blocking all incoming and outgoing calls to Ding's  appartment around midday Thursday. "The police don't want  people to know what I'm doing," she said.    Jiang said Thursday that police had followed him and his  wife  everywhere in recent days and harassed anybody who tried to  visit them.    The couple sent an appeal to the Chinese Government last  week  to restore their freedom.    The houses of all dissidents and their families have been  placed under heavy surveillance recently, as part of an intense  security clampdown here in the run-up to the anniversary of the  massacre.</p>

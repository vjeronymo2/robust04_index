			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (41): Stringent demands met in 11 countries - International user report: How Sun Microsystems selected a database system AS a champion of 'open systems,' the manufacturer of Sun workstations and computers, Sun Microsystems might be expected to have some inside knowledge when it came to choosing a database. But the company arrived at a Progress Software application through an unusual route, writes Claire Gooding. Mr Aitken Paton, project manager for Sun's worldwide field organisaton, explains: 'Our strategy was to find an application which would allow us to standardise on such operations as order processing, invoicing, accounting, and so on, in 11 countries. ' The package had to meet a stringent functional specification, and this meant that the choice of the database running underneath was dictated by finding the right 'front-end' package. Sun was looking for a multi-language, multi-currency application, running with a relational database and 4GL under a client-server system. Despite a thorough search, assisted by consultants KPMG, only one package came up to scratch: the MFG-Pro suite, which happened to be written using the Progress database and language. The others, says Paton, 'didn't come close,' meeting only 50 per cent of Sun's requirements. MFG's developers, Santa Barbara-based QAD, had recently appointed a European representative, Minerva, based in Holland, and Minerva won the Pounds 500,000 contract, including training, modifications, and hotline support. The number of system users varies from country to country - in the UK there are around 50 - but all can do direct interactive queries, formulating ad hoc reports at will. According to Aitken Paton, the business benefits are largely internal at present, but customers will notice a difference in the future. 'The Progress language in particular has saved us substantial programming work, time and effort, simply because it is so powerful. 'We have been able to build a lot of tools ourselves, to interact with the application and the database. We are now looking at providing information for managers. 'Eventually, the benefits will filter through to our customers, in the shape of an improved service, a higher standard of documentation and accuracy, and even electronic data interchange of data,' he says.

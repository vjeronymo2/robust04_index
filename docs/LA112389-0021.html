			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10 LIVELY SPOTS;  </P> <P> FOLK DANCING GROUPS CELEBRATE A WORLD OF TRADITION  </P> <P> Folk dancing, popular in the '60s along with coffeehouses and guitars, has  survived the '80s and is marching boldly into the '90s.  </P> <P> Broadly defined, folk dancing is the traditional  </P> <P> dance form of a country or a particular ethnic group. The ever-faster hora  danced at a bar mitzvah, the whirling polkas at a Polish wedding, the line  dance in "Zorba the Greek" -- all are folk dances.  </P> <P> Some dances are for couples only, others take all comers. In some the dancers  are arranged in squares, in others they form circles or lines. The variations  are as endless as the various peoples and cultures of the world.  </P> <P> Here are some folk dancing places in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Westwood Co-Op Folk Dancers -- Thursday nights.

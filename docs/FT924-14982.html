			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Share slide reduces Trinity flotation price TRINITY HOLDINGS is to come to the market at 120p, valuing the maker of chassis for Dennis buses, fire engines and refuse collection vehicles at about Pounds 61.7m. The pricing decision was taken during 'traumatic' Monday night talks that followed the plunge in the FT-SE 100 Index and turmoil in the foreign exchange markets, according to Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman. As late as last week, the company had hoped the placing and intermediaries offer would value Trinity at about Pounds 80m. At 120p, Trinity is valued at the equivalent of 11.3 times forecast earnings per share for a pro forma year ending January 1993. The shares yield 6 per cent at this price on the same basis. The flotation will raise about Pounds 29m net of expenses. Some Pounds 14m will repay the debt that financed the 1989 management buy-out from the conglomerate, Hestair. It will also reduce working capital and redeem the preference shares, leaving Trinity virtually debt free. Directors, other shareholders - like Citicorp and Bankers Trust - and employees will receive another Pounds 14m. The directors and original shareholders now hold 43 per cent of the new equity. The founding shareholders have agreed to hold their shares for at least a year and the directors will not sell for 18 months. Private investors will be free to apply for 6.4m of the 25.6m new shares by applying to financial intermediaries. Applications must be in by noon on October 14. Mr Hollyhead describes Trinity as a specialist niche engineer of vehicles. While market growth has been slow or non-existent in the UK, Trinity's share of those markets has grown rapidly. Its share of the bus market, for example, has grown from 10 per cent in 1982 to 19 per cent in 1990, a year after buy-out and to 50.4 per cent in 1992. Trinity's share of the refuse collection vehicle market grew from 15 per cent in 1979 to 45 per cent in 1991. Fire trucks remained a static market, with Dennis taking about 40 per cent of the market. COMMENT On the face of it Trinity looks like that rare beast, a management buy-out that is not only cash generative but has growth potential as well. Certainly after three years of notable growth in dull markets for buses, coaches, refuse collection vehicles and fire engines, its past performance is not in question. Beyond the end of 1992, the growth is more in question. Granted a race to develop market dominance in the UK refuse collection market has prevented the company from looking to Europe. That market is now beckoning, indeed more so after sterling's devaluation. Equally eastern Europe through a soon-to-be-signed contract in Poland has great potential. But it is less obvious that next year will see a reversal of the recent UK trend of under-replacement of UK bus stock which Trinity hopes will fuel further growth in the UK. For this year, however, operating profits of Pounds 8.5m giving earnings of 10.6p means 120p is a relatively undemanding flotation price.</p>

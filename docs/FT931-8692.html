			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Timex sacks 300 in Dundee TIMEX Electronic announced yesterday it was dismissing all 300 striking assembly workers at its Dundee plant and replacing them with new staff as soon as possible, Robert Taylor writes. The US-owned company said it was going ahead with the sackings because the strikers refused to accept a settlement of a 20-day dispute over a pay and conditions package. Last Sunday and again yesterday the workers agreed to return to work under protest and accepted a company offer of arbitration. But they refused to accept a wage freeze for the rest of the year, a cut in fringe benefits and a profit-sharing scheme which the company was demanding.</p>

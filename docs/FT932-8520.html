			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Soviet coup leaders may walk free THE trial of the 12 Soviet coup leaders seemed set to disintegrate yesterday after a judge ordered the dismissal of the prosecuting team for prejudging the outcome by publishing a book about the defendants. Presiding judge Anatoly Ukolov granted a motion by the defence that the prosecutors should be removed from the case because of 'serious violations' of legal procedure by the Russian prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, and his deputy, Mr Yevgeny Lisov. Defence lawyers had argued for the prosecutors' dismissal on grounds of bias. They alleged that Mr Stepankov and Mr Lisov had violated defendants' rights last year when they published a book, Kremlin Plot, that described them as criminals. Mr Stepankov is not personally prosecuting the case, but was responsible for appointing the prosecution lawyers. The decision by the military branch of the Supreme Court to suspend the trial pending a decision by parliament on what to do next is a stinging indictment of the prosecution's incompetence and an embarrassment for President Boris Yeltsin. It is now unlikely that the men who declared a state of emergency on August 19, 1991, and brought tanks into Moscow to prevent what they saw as the collapse of the Soviet Union will ever be brought to justice. There were bad omens from the very start, when Mr Stepankov had the 12 indicted on the charge of betraying the Soviet motherland - which the defendants argued they were trying to save. The charges had to revised subsequently in order to make them more likely to stick. In the meantime, video-taped interrogations of the accused were sold to the media and the culprits in the prosecutor's office were never discovered. Having already degenerated into near farce, the trial is unlikely to recover from this latest blow. Deputies, locked in confrontation with President Yeltsin over his determination to dissolve the conservative-dominated parliament, are unlikely to take any decision to help the trial along. Even if it does, the defendants' lawyers have a an arsenal of other delaying tactics, including the ability to declare any of the elderly defendants too ill to attend. The trial only resumed yesterday after being suspended three days after it opened when Mr Alexander Tizyakov, the 67-year-old former leader of a hardline industrialists' union, was taken to hospital with heart trouble. But despite being released from jail on grounds of illness pending the final judgment, two of the other defendants, Mr Vladimir Kryuchkov, the former KGB chief, and Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, head of the Soviet parliament, have been attending anti-Yeltsin demonstrations and meetings of the recently-unbanned Communist party. The popular scorn they faced at the time has now given way to mixed feelings in society, with many people regretting the passing of the Soviet Union despite the fact that its demise was accelerated by the coup attempt. Intended to provide a lesson in democracy, the trial has become a victim of the fragility of Russia's democratic institutions - in this case an incompetent and unfocused prosecutor general's office.</p>

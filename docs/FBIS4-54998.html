			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, May 8 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe Sunday termed an extension of the detention of 11  French aid workers by Bosnian Serbs "unacceptable." [passage  omitted] In Paris, Juppe said in a statement that the French  Government held the authorities of the rump Yugoslavia (Serbia  and Montenegro) responsible for the detentions on an equal  footing with the Bosnian Serbs. Paris "continues to demand the  immediate and unconditional release of all our compatriots," he  said, adding that "that is the message that has been transmitted  directly to the Serb authorities" by Bertrand Dufourcq, the  permanent secretary of the Foreign Ministry, who was visiting  Belgrade.</p>

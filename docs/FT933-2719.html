			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Former health executive sees benefits in pay limit THE GOVERNMENT'S new public-sector pay policy could give a fresh impetus to reforms in the National Health Service, the NHS's former director of personnel said yesterday. Mr Eric Caines, who left the NHS earlier this year, said the chancellor's blunt warning to the public sector that there could be no growth in the pay bill could only lead to the same or more work done by fewer staff. He said there was huge scope for productivity improvements in the NHS - principally through a significant reduction in the numbers employed at all levels and all disciplines. Mr Caines has consistently argued that at least 200,000 NHS staff, about one fifth of the total, could be shed without having an adverse effect. Mr Caines, now professor of health services management at Nottingham University, said trusts should be grasping their freedom to set pay and conditions locally, breaking away from central pay review bodies. Management and staff at the local level, he said, should now be looking at ways, within the pay ceiling, of giving staff 'worthwhile increases' from next April as part of an overall policy incorporating a reduction in numbers and a drastic redesign of many jobs. However the NAHSPO, the NHS human resource management association, said personnel staff believed that any efficiency savings, including those gained by job losses, could not be ploughed into pay increases in the majority of cases. Rather, the money would be needed to maintain financial stability overall. A number of trusts have started to look at their staff's skill mix but few have made significant progress in achieving significant changes.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Blue-chip runners display feet of lead - The punters are piling into unit trusts. Will they avoid getting stuck in the Footsie rut? / Keynote THE HOT Derby favourite came nowhere last month, and in the financial markets, too, the long-odds gamblers have had a better time of it. During the second quarter of the year the underlying theme was risk: accept it, and you stood a chance of making some money; avoid it, and you probably showed a loss. It seems that gamblers themselves have started to become celebrities. Wherever you saw ripples on the calm surface of the financial markets in the April-June quarter, it appeared to be because the arch speculator George Soros was throwing some rocks in. His deal with Sir James Goldsmith in April over shares in Newmont, the American gold producer (see page 9 of this Review), set the mining sector and the bullion market temporarily alight. His entry into the UK commercial property market, via a joint arrangement early in June with British Land, promptly sent property shares jumping. Finally, a few days later he proclaimed that the D-Mark was heading for a nasty fall, and it duly began to slide. But whenever Soros was not making waves, the markets seemed oddly quiet, even though there was plenty going on. For example, a new chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, was driving into Downing Street, while his predecessor Norman Lamont was storming off to condemn the government's short-termism. Meanwhile, the British economy started to recover quite convincingly, with a decent pickup in manufacturing output and a steady fall in unemployment. Inflation continued to track downwards, and sterling began to look quite strong, at any rate against other European currencies, including a distinctly off-colour D-Mark. The disappointment for the stock market, perhaps, was that the next cut in short-term interest rates failed to appear. Kenneth Clarke's arrival at the Treasury at the end of May raised hopes of a change of emphasis in economic policy, but they proved misguided, or at any rate premature. Significantly, however, long-term interest rates continued to edge downwards. By the end of the quarter, long-dated gilt-edged were yielding no more than 8.11 per cent (compared with 9 per cent as recently as mid-January). As in the January-March quarter, long gilts significantly outperformed blue-chip equities, the ones included in the FT-SE 100 Index. The Footsie has been stuck in a rut all year so far. It rose in the second quarter, but by less than 1 per cent, and the trading range was a mere 2 per cent either side of 2850. Share prices on Wall Street have become similarly becalmed. No wonder George Soros has had to go into gold to find some action. Outside the boring top 100 stocks, however, there was quite a bit more to go for in London equities. The FT-Actuaries SmallCap Index, which tracks the fortunes of the smallest 450 shares in the All-Share Index, rose by a decent 6 per cent. That was not as good as in the first quarter, but after six months of the year the SmallCap was up by a fifth, so a very reasonable bull market has been taking place among the minnows. The basic reason for this is that little matter of risk. Investors have been encouraged to accept a little more risk this year, both because of the evidence of economic recovery, and because the small companies that remain in business at the end of the recession look like tough survivors. In contrast, many industrial giants are still in the process of downsizing. In 1991 and 1992 investors plunged headlong into the big, boring companies which looked recession-proof. Now, many of those stocks are languishing: in the second quarter, the food retailing, breweries, food manufacturing and water sectors propped up the rest of the leaders and laggards table. To hit the top, you had to go for speculative aerospace  - where British Aerospace was the quarter's big individual winner - and crumbling construction, where hope generally continued to triumph over experience (although sales of new houses have begun to recover). High risk has been the global theme, too. The best national stock market during April-June was that of Italy. The country's economic and political problems may still look daunting, but investors have become ready to gamble that political reforms will provide a way of avoiding the crippling financial crisis that has otherwise seemed inevitable. Japan was the other market where returns to sterling-based investors were close to 20 per cent for the quarter. The strength of the yen played a big part here; otherwise, the Toyko market has seemed to offer recovery potential, being still at only about half its all-time peak. But there are big risks here, too, because the fundamental value in Japanese stocks is often very poor, not least because the strength of the yen is putting great pressure on profitability. Moreover, the political crisis that blew up in June and triggered a snap election took the shine off the quarter's gains towards the end of June. British investors did not, however, have to punt in Tokyo or Milan to make reasonable returns during the second quarter. The rule that return went hand in hand with risk did not apply in the UK Government securities market where, despite the overhanging threat of a huge borrowing requirement, gilt-edged prices moved ahead. Take an investor who bought stock in the Bank of England's auction of Treasury 8 per cent, dated 2013, on March 31. By the end of June he was showing capital appreciation of nearly 5 per cent. The Bank of England has begun promoting gilts more actively to private investors, issuing explanatory brochures and advertising the auctions in the Saturday papers. Certainly savers have been taking increasing note of the paucity of returns on bank and building society savings deposits. But the main effect of cheaper money so far appears to have been a rush of savings into unit trusts, which are predominantly invested in equities. In both April and May, net sales of units topped Pounds 900m, and assuming June sales (not yet reported) remained strong the quarter should have been the best for the unit trust industry since the third quarter of 1987. But will this flood of money go into the more promising sectors, or will unit trust investors get stuck in the Footsie rut? Blue-chip income stocks do not appear to be the right selections for current market conditions. The name of Tenby, the red-hot favourite for the Derby has disappeared into Epsom oblivion. In the stock market, too, the odds-on runners like Glaxo and Unilever have been displaying feet of lead. There is more value these days in the outsiders, and if you don't have the stomach for risky longshots, perhaps you should try gilts instead.</p>

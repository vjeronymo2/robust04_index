			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, a number of Belarusian newspapers have  published an open letter to the readers signed by the chief  editors of such leading Belarusian newspapers as NARODNAYA  GAZETA, ZVYAZDA, and SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA. "The Belarusian  press is on the brink of disaster," the letter reads.  "Expenditures for publishing a large-circulation newspaper  amount to 1 billion [not further specified] a week. Funds  coming from subscription fees will be enough for the next few  days. ...Neither advertisement nor other forms of commercial  operations, with which editorial boards have been forced to  deal, will ensure further existence of the press." Beginning 29  April, as the letter points out, publication of newspapers will  be halted, except for the 1 and 9 May issues which will be  devoted to Victory Day. "Although this is not a strike," the  authors note, "there are grounds to hold one. ...The editorial  boards are ready to resume publishing as soon as a solution to  the current deadlock is found."</p>

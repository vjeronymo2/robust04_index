			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Drayton Asia spurns EFM Dragon offer Drayton Asia Trust, an Asian investment trust managed by Invesco MIM, yesterday recommended shareholders to take no action in respect of the offers from EFM Dragon Trust, because they undervalue the company. EFM Dragon, a similar trust managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, has made a bid for the whole of Drayton's share capital and warrants. The terms involve EFM Dragon offering to issue ordinary shares at fully diluted net asset value in exchange for Drayton Asia's ordinary shares at a rate equivalent to EFM Dragon's asset value. The offer includes the issue of three 2005 warrants for each Drayton warrant.</p>

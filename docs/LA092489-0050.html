			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER REPORT: CHARTING PROGRESS OF AIRLINE CHARTERS  </P> <P> It's getting more and more difficult to differentiate between charter and  scheduled airlines.  </P> <P> Some charter airlines list their flights on the computerized reservation system  used in most travel agencies.  </P> <P> Some charter airlines may even offer a variety of fares and travel classes.  </P> <P> Martinair Holland, a charter airline, will begin a class of service called Star  Class this fall.  </P> <P> "The seats will be wider, reclining, and with a deeper pitch," according to  Janice Holden, assistant vice president of Martinair. "Basically, this section  and class will correspond to the business sections of scheduled airlines. We'll  also have a separate check-in for (Star Class) passengers."  </P> <P> Fares for the upgraded service are expected to be $150 to $250 above round-trip  economy class.  </P> <P> Charter airlines are also offering more varied fares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Refundable Fare  </P> <P> "We have a Y-class fare which is good for one year and is refundable, just as  with regular airlines," said Janny Davis, sales/marketing manager of LTU  International Airways, a Los Angeles-based charter. "If passengers want to  change their return date in Europe, they can do so on a stand-by basis with no  extra charge."  </P> <P> LTU also offers a Q-class fare, which is costs less but is non-refundable.  </P> <P> "This fare has conditions that call for full payment 48 hours after ticketing,  and there's a $100 charge for making flight changes in Europe," Davis said.  </P> <P> Martinair offers a regular economy fare that comes with a $75 cancellation  charge.  </P> <P> "We also have an APEX fare with the same kind of conditions that scheduled  airlines have on their advance-purchase, one-way and stand-by fares. We have  five fares, so we're still way behind the scheduled airlines, but we're getting  there," Holden said.  </P> <P> And on most charters, travelers should be able to get a full refund before  departure if the operator changes the price by more than 10%, makes major  changes in itineraries or changes the departure time by more than 48 hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deregulation Helped  </P> <P> Why the similarities?  </P> <P> Deregulation has had a great deal to do with charter airlines becoming more  like scheduled carriers, Martinair's Holden said.  </P> <P> "Charter airlines found they had to compete more directly with the scheduled  airlines to survive," she said.  </P> <P> Yet there still are differences in charter flying.  </P> <P> "We operate like scheduled airlines except that we don't have the same  frequency. However, we maintain our schedules religiously, regardless of how  many passengers we have aboard," said Heinz Niederhoff, president of DER Tours  and general service agent for Condor Air Lines, a Lufthansa subsidiary.  </P> <P> "We provide passengers with a seat in a nonsmoking section, though we are not  obliged to," Holden said. "It's a voluntary procedure on our part, and we do it  for competitive-service reasons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Learn Baggage Rule  </P> <P> Charter airlines may not allow as much luggage as scheduled airlines do. Before  traveling, passengers should find out what the luggage allowance is for both  check-through and carry-on bags.  </P> <P> Overbooking policy is another difference.  </P> <P> "As a scheduled charter airline we're not obliged to follow the rules on  overbooking," Holden said, "but we always make sure that passengers can fly by  making alternate arrangements."  </P> <P> In terms of providing amenities to passengers affected by canceled or delayed  flights or lost baggage, charter airlines have individual policies similar to  those of scheduled airlines.  </P> <P> "In our case, depending on the circumstances, we can provide accommodations,  meal vouchers, messages to people and baggage replacements," Holden said.  </P> <P> When booking a trip on a charter line, make sure that any travel insurance,  such as for trip cancellation or interruption, covers charters. Some charter  airlines may offer their own form of protection.  </P></p>

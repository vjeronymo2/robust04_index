Columbia states that these refunds covered the period December 1, 1991, through May 31, 1994, in the total amount of $2,967,033.96 including $232,266.96 in interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 9, 1992, Columbia and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company submitted to the Commission a joint offer of settlement in the above referenced dockets (Settlement). On April 2, 1993, the Commission issued an order approving the Settlement. On September 29, 1993, the Commission issued an order on rehearing approving the Settlement for all consenting parties and severing certain non-consenting parties (the Cities) from the Settlement. On October 13, 1993, Columbia notified the Commission that it accepted the Settlement and filed rates to be applicable to settling parties with a proposed effective date of October 1, 1993. Columbia states that refunds were made to consenting parties on October 25, 1993, and a refund report concerning such refunds was filed on November 24, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 5, 1994, the Cities filed a motion for confirmation of status as supporting parties to the Settlement. The Cities' motion was unopposed and was granted by the Commission order issued on June 22, 1994. This refund report addresses the refunds made to the Cities as supporting parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia states that it computed the refunds to the Cities in accordance with the terms of Article I, Section E of the Settlement. The principal refund represents the difference between the amounts computed under settlement rates and the rates actually charged those customers for gas service during the refund period. Included in each refund amount is interest through July 28, 1994, computed in accordance with &sect;154.67(c)(2) of the Commission's Regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before October 7, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

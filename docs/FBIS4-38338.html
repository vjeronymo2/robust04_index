			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant General Aleksey Shcherbakov, deputy  commander of the Russian border troops, headed an inspection  commission which carried out a systematic survey of the defense  of Russia's Pacific Ocean border. He held a news conference in  Vladivostok, at which he said that troops of the Pacific Border  District were in a state of good combatreadiness. The  inspectors had the opportunity to witness with their own eyes  that the eastern border protected by the Pacific troops was  still strong and secure -- the district's border guards detained  35 transgressors, uncovered and prevented 63 attempts to use  counterfeit passports at border crossings, and seized a large  contraband shipment of choice seafood delicacies, which domestic  businessmen attempted to export to Japan illegally.    The chairman of the inspection commission said: "We  evaluated  the situation in the border district strictly and impartially.  Practically every aspect of the condition of the troops was  examined, and in spite of the numerous problems, all troops and  units of the district cope well with the goal of protecting the  border, and the state of morale of the officers and personnel is  praiseworthy."</p>

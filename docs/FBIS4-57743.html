			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish on page 3A  of its 24 April 1994 edition reports that, according to former  National Assembly president Alfredo Cesar, the seven remaining  parties of the National Opposition Union plan to remain in a  coalition through the end of President Chamorro's term, but are  uncommitted to an alliance for the 1996 election. He stated:  "The parties are united by a commitment to put into effect the  government program." Cesar denied that he has lobbied for the  position of finance minister because of rumors that Finance  Minister Emilio Pereira will leave the post. He said that he  does not wish to work with a government which has lost  "influence and credibility....I have no relations with  (Presidency) Minister Lacayo, nor do I want to. Not with Lacayo  or any member of the government team." With regard to 1996,  Cesar observed that a liberal-conservative alliance of two or  three parties is "possible" and "desirable." Based on recent  polls he predicted that no member of the government will win  more than 8 to 10 percent of the votes in 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Mytri Ungphakon] </F>   [Text] Marrakech -- Thailand and other members of ASEAN  have agreed to play a substantially more active role in the new  world trade system that will emerge from the Uruguay Round  agreements that are due to be signed tomorrow.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says he is  going to propose that Thailand chairs the agricultural committee  of the new World Trade Organisation [WTO] due to be established  on January 1. This would put Thailand and its allies in the  14-nation Cairns Group in a position to influence the agenda of  a committee handling one of the more contentious issues facing  the new organisation.    And at an informal meeting of ASEAN economic ministers on  Tuesday, Singapore received support from fellow-members in its  bid to host the first WTO ministerial meeting. These  ministerial meetings, to be held every two years, will be the  forum for ultimate control of the new organisation created by  the Uruguay Round of world trade talks that concludes formally  in Marrakech this week.    Both bids are still at a formative stage and in Thailand's  case no formal discussions have yet taken place with any other  country. So there has been no reaction so far from others among  the more than 100 countries attending this week's Uruguay Round  meeting.    The process of setting up the WTO will only begin today when  a preparatory committee is due to be appointed.    So far, the only ministerial meetings of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- the forerunner of the  WTO -- that have been held outside Switzerland have been those  that are part of a round of trade negotiations. All other  routine GATT ministerial meetings have been held in Geneva.    Singapore's bid to hold the 1996 WTO meeting would therefore  set a new precedent.    Unconfirmed reports say China also wants to host the 1996  meeting. It hopes also to be granted readmission to the GATT  system so that it can be a founding member of the WTO. China  helped to found GATT, but its membership lapsed following the  communist takeover.    The WTO agricultural committee that Thailand hopes to chair  will initially be responsible for monitoring how the Uruguay  Round's 125 participants implement the round's agreement on  reducing subsidies and lowering trade barriers in farm trade.    This is an issue that has caused some of the biggest  controversies throughout the seven years of the Uruguay Round.    Dr Suphachai said the idea of Thailand's candidature came  from two meetings on Tuesday: the informal meeting of ASEAN  economic ministers where he proposed that Thailand should be  ASEAN's spokesman on agriculture in the WTO, and a bilateral  meeting with Australian trade minister Bob McMullen who said the  committee's chairman should come from the Cairns Group.    Thai officials say that out of the Cairns Group's 14  members,  one from ASEAN could prove to be the most acceptable to the  major participants in the sometimes bitter agricultural  negotiations. And among the four ASEAN countries that are also  in the Cairns Group -- Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines -- Thailand has been by far the most active in the  farm trade talks.    The United States, which has been pressing for sharp cuts in  subsidies and protectionist trade barriers, is likely to support  anyone from the Cairns Group because the group shares that  objective, the officials say.    The European Union has resisted radical reform and could  find  a country from ASEAN, which has tended to take a more moderate  position in the Cairns Group, more acceptable, they say.    The officials believe that Australia, chairman of the Cairns  Group, will not want simultaneously to chair the WTO committee,  and that the group's five Latin American countries could be too  aggressively critical of agricultural protectionism to be  acceptable to the European Union.    The five -- Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay  --  twice walked out of Uruguay Round ministerial meetings in  protest against the failure of the United States and European  Union to reach agreement on agriculture.    Dr Suphachai said he had not yet put forward the idea to any  other country. But he has already shown a keenness for Thailand  to assert itself in this issue, himself playing a particularly  active part in Cairns Group affairs since his appointment as  deputy prime minister in 1992.    Chairing a WTO committee could require a substantial  bureaucratic change for Thailand since the country's  representative would have to be senior, probably with the rank  of ambassador. The choice facing the Government would be to  have a diplomat take the position, or a trade specialist.    At present Thailand's ambassador to Geneva is a Foreign  Ministry diplomat whose duties cover a wide range of subjects  handled by the various UN agencies there, ranging from human  rights and disarmament to labour and trade.    Thai trade officials are discussing the possibility of  appointing an experienced trade negotiator as ambassador either  in place of the present diplomat, or preferably as a second  ambassador assigned specifically to GATT or the WTO. They point  out that more than half the countries represented in Geneva have  ambassadors from economic ministries, some as their countries'  sole envoys in the city.    The question of whether the new WTO should link trade  concessions with the observance of international standards of  labour rights has turned out to be one of the most controversial  issues in the main Marrakech meeting, with virtually all  ministers referring to it in their formal statements.    Broadly, developing countries opposed the move which is  proposed by the United States and France, and is largely  supported by developed countries. Dr Suphachai said that in  discussions with the Australians, he was told that Canberra  would not actively promote the idea, but that Canberra would not  oppose it either because the Australian governing party is Labor.    But the bulk of attention in Marrakech this week has turned  to the many issues being discussed in side meetings. In the  main conference room, more than 100 ministers are scheduled to  plough through their formal statements over a scheduled period  of almost four days, culminating in tomorrow's signing  ceremonies.    In addition to discussions with ASEAN and Australia, Dr  Suphachai has also been involved in breakfast and lunch meetings  yesterday of ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) group and the Cairns Group.    Members of the Cairns Group agree that the group should  continue in existence so that the implementation of the Uruguay  Round agricultural deal can be monitored.    But differences are emerging within the group over a Latin  American proposal that the group be reorganised so that the  chairmanship rotates instead of remaining with Australia. The  Latin Americans also want to expand the group's membership to  other agricultural exporting countries.    Brazil and Argentina in particular are thought to be  sufficiently dissatisfied with the Uruguay Round's compromise on  agriculture to seek a more aggressive chairmanship.    However, Dr Suphachai said Thailand preferred to keep  Australia as chairman.    The group is due to meet formally in Uruguay next month.  Discussions here in Marrakech this week have served as  preparation.    Dr Suphachai was also scheduled to meet delegation heads  from  Italy, China, Hungary and the Czech Republic during this week.    Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon, who is also in the  Thai  delegation, has been meeting counterparts from Hong Kong and  India.    Bigger players on the world trade scene have been discussing  more serious issues. The United States and European Union have  been trying to narrow their differences on commitments related  to a new deal on government purchases due to be signed tomorrow  by 20-30 countries; and the United States and Japan have been  tackling the US demand for greater access to the Japanese market.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Turkey seeks to revive Syria pact: Move to gain support against Kurds TURKEY WILL today seek to revive a five-year-old border security agreement with Syria in the latest diplomatic effort to curb the rebel activity of the Kurdish Workers party (PKK). During a two-day visit to Damascus, Mr Ismet Sezgin, Turkey's interior minister, is expected to press the Syrians to reduce their support for the PKK, which is fighting for the independence of south-east Turkey using training camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon. The move reflects a government desire to paint the PKK as an external threat despite growing evidence that the rebels enjoy broad support inside Turkey. It also underlines growing impatience with the Syrians over a number of bilateral issues including disputes over the Euphrates river and Syrian claims on Hatay, the border province ceded to Turkey in 1938 when Syria was still under French mandate. Mr Sezgin's visit is part of a broader diplomatic initiative to win regional co-operation against the PKK following German and EC criticism of its handling of recent unrest in the south when more than 100 demonstrators died in clashes with security forces. Mr Massoud Barzani, leader of the Iraqi Kurds, gave an implicit undertaking to Ankara last week to clear the border area with Iraq where the PKK has exploited a power vacuum. Turkey reportedly won Egyptian assistance in putting pressure on the Syrians during a visit to Ankara last week by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. In Turkey's and Syria's last agreed on a shortlived border security agreement of 1987, On that occasion Syria insisted on linking the border security agreement with a dealon allocation of Euphrates water. Turkish officials insist this time water will not be discussed. Instead Mr Sezgin will present what officials say is documentary evidence of Syrian complicity in PKK actions.</p>

The 20-million U.S. dollar contract was signed today in  Zhuhai City, one of the country's special economic zones, in  Guangdong Province, south China.    In 1992, the airlines set up a simulation training center in  Zhuhai for Boeing pilots. With one Boeing-737 simulator and one  Boeing-757 simulator, the center trained 716 pilots last year.    Pilots for Boeing previously had to go abroad for training.    The airline has ordered six Boeing-777s, the first of which  is due for delivery in December this year.</p>

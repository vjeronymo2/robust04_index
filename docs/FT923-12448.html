			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Country View: The Ministry hedges its bets THOUSANDS of miles of hedges in Britain have been grubbed up in the last 25 years - and what sticks in the gullet of those who deplore their removal is that much of it was done with the aid of taxpayers' money. Under the Farm Improvement Scheme, operated by the Ministry of Agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s, high levels of grant aid were available for this. Ministry advisers were all for 'rationalisation' of fields. The aim was to create enclosures big enough to enable fullest use of heavy machinery - in other words, to permit straight-line driving over long distances. It always seemed strange to me that hedge removal under the Farm Improvement Scheme was classified as 'land drainage,' never as hedge removal. Often, hedge removal did involve an element of land drainage, because many hedges were associated with open drainage ditches. The removal of a hedge by bulldozer nearly always entailed destruction of the open ditch. In any case, if the ditch been left it would have defeated the objective of long, uninterrupted runs for modern arable machinery. With ironic timing, in 1969, the Ministry of Agriculture revised its superb pamphlet, 'Farm and Estate Hedges.' This, now out of print, was directed not towards the removal of hedges, but towards their establishment and maintenance. It lists the advantages of hedges: an effective barrier against livestock; shelter and shade for livestock; shelter to crops; amelioration of soil erosion; improvement and preservation of the amenities of the countryside; the encouragement of wild life, and improvement of sporting value. The pamphlet also gives the comparative merits of the various varieties of hedging plants: hawthorn, blackthorn, beech, hornbeam and so on. It describes - admirably clearly and helpfully - the planting, trimming and laying of hedges. It commends the practice of allowing promising young shoots (or tellers) to grow up through the hedge into trees, to give shelter for livestock. Now that straw burning - the cause of so much haphazard hedge destruction - has been brought under control, and conservationists are mindful of the need to look after our remaining hedges, it would be a fitting moment for the Ministry of Agriculture to reprint this admirable publication. Some of the more senior officials may smile wryly to find themselves doing the opposite of what was required of them not so many years ago. Instead of processing grants for hedge removal, they are now administering grants for the planting of new hedges and the reconditioning of existing ones. It is the Department of the Environment, however, which is now making the running, turning attention to the protection of existing hedgerows. By 1990 some 24,238 miles - 10 per cent of hedgerows - had been removed (not counting losses from building development). Corresponding figures for Wales show a broadly similar pattern. Commendably, the Department of the Environment has come up with a two-pronged approach: a hedgerow notification scheme and, separately administered and funded, a hedgerow management grant scheme. The first of these would be administered by local planning authorities, while the grant scheme would be operated by the government. Those wishing to remove hedges would be required to notify the local planning authority, which would consider the application, as required of planners for any 'development.' Grants are proposed, to encourage landowners and farmers to bring existing hedgerows into positive management. (Eligible operations would include hedge laying, a craft requiring great skill; farmworkers competent to lay hedges are pretty thin on the ground these days.) Regional instruction courses would be required. And there would certainly be a need for re-publication of that admirable pamphlet, 'Farm and Estate Hedges.'</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: L.A. PERFORMANCE ARTIST'S CHILDHOOD MEMORIES INSPIRE PERSONAL  PORTRAIT OF 'DOWNTOWN'  </P> <P> Luis Alfaro is making theater like crazy.  </P> <P> "In the last six months, I've done like 30 projects," said the local  writer-performer whose latest effort, "Downtown," opens Friday at Highways in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "Usually, I'll write something on Monday, then work it, work it, work it. On  Thursday, I memorize it; on Friday, I work it onstage; on Saturday, I perform  it." The pace, he said, is largely fueled by request: "I'm always thrilled when  people ask me to do my stuff. It's like an alcoholic -- I want to do everything  anybody asks me to."  </P> <P> "I think he does perform compulsively," said fellow performer Eduardo Santiago,  who collaborated with Alfaro on "Peliculas Prohibidas" ("Forbidden Movies") at  Power House in 1989. "The most interesting thing about Luis' work is that he  performs all the time. Any night of the week you'll find him off doing  something, somewhere. But he doesn't perform out of vanity, to showcase  himself. After the show, he's not waiting around in the lobby for compliments.  He's off to another performance."  </P> <P> Alfaro's recent burst of performance activity follows several quiet years  behind the scenes, studying acting with Michael Kearns and Scott Kelman. Alfaro  said he spent many years at the Wallenboyd, a now-defunct downtown theater,  "working on technical stuff: lighting design, stage managing, watching other  people work. So I had a long gestation period. Now that I'm not studying with  anybody, the training really comes from being onstage. It's also great training  for me to able to write quickly -- and get the work out."  </P> <P> "Downtown" has taken far longer to create. It's been in the making for seven  months. A solo paean to Alfaro's growing up in the Pico-Union District, it is a  montage of urban rhythms, movement and characters (eight in all, including tour  guide Smiley, seamstress Lupe, the junkie and the father).  </P> <P> Alfaro, whose works usually develop in the form of a short story or poem,  performed earlier versions of "Downtown" during the year; the final version, he  said, has "four new characters and a lot of new text."  </P> <P> It also contains a segment about himself -- a persona and voice he generally  avoids in performance.  </P> <P> "I usually do the investigation through other characters," said Alfaro, 29, who  includes in his performance a childhood recollection of his mother furiously  battering a rat with a broom. "The image is so much the reality of growing up  in downtown and being poor and living with that kind of desperation."  </P> <P> The memories are not all gloomy, however. A latchkey kid, Alfaro recalls riding  the bus downtown with his brother every day after school. "We spent our lives  with people -- not people we necessarily knew -- but in the community, in  large, open spaces -- and not being afraid of what that means," he said.  </P> <P> His adult perspective has changed somewhat. For the past six months, Alfaro has  been living in the tranquil high-rise setting of Park La Brea in the Fairfax  area.  </P> <P> "Coming here was a release from having been robbed so many times, being held up  in my home," he said with a sigh. "For the last six years, I lived on Sunset  and Alvarado. I'd go down to Burrito King, walk to Pioneer Market. I'm very  neighborhoody. I miss the neighbor who'd come over every day with soup, the old  lady whose trash you'd pick up. Here, you don't talk to your neighbors; it's  very sterile. I know I have to go back. But it was also a good thing to get  away, distance myself from it. I think a lot of good writing came from it."  </P> <P> His credits this year include "Smiley and Other Vatos Like Me" at the Los  Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, "Retablo" at L.A. Contemporary Exhibitions,  "Learning the Language" at the Saxon-Lee Gallery and "Relationships" at the  Zeta Collective. Alfaro also has made numerous appearances in other people's  work (including the acclaimed L.A. Festival entry "The Undead"), readings,  writings and fund-raising performances for, among others, VIVA Latino Artists  Collective, the Homeless Writers Coalition and Act Up L.A.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Alfaro was arrested downtown with a "chain gang" of artists,  who were protesting the withdrawal of federal funding for the arts. "Part of me  was really torn by this action of marching into downtown, being arrested at the  Federal Building," Alfaro said. "A lot of the images I have of downtown are as  a very nurturing place. In 'Downtown,' I pay homage to it; I speak of the  buildings as 'big, long, tall, beautiful women.' So the idea of questioning  power, going back and marching through that neighborhood -- it affected me  deeply."  </P> <P> Alfaro doesn't shun the mantle of a political agenda, nor does he court it. The  same goes for his homosexuality. In "Downtown," he tells the story of a Virgin  Mary figurine that's passed through the family. "At the end, I say, 'I met this  guy who had a Virgin Mary doll that lit up, and I fell in love' -- and there's  a naturalness about it. It's like, 'Oh, he fell in love. Oh, he's gay.' I'm not  holding up a neon sign, throwing it in people's faces. I talk about family, I  talk about Latino culture, I talk about being gay -- and it's all one big  thing."  </P> <P> Alfaro's attraction to words started early. He recalls being the only child in  his family who'd ask for books for Christmas. He was also a big talker, in  spite of having to undergo speech therapy for a stutter. After high school,  Alfaro attended Inner City Cultural Center, and has supported himself with a  succession of jobs -- most recently working for a labor union and currently  teaching performance art to grade-schoolers at the Los Angeles Children's  Museum. "I get fed a lot by the kids," he said earnestly. "It also keeps me  very contemporary."  </P> <P> And honest.  </P> <P> "I'm constantly having to hand myself warning signs, keep myself in check," he  said of performing. "So much of what I do is internal. So the balance is how to  get all those things out externally without losing the power they have inside  of me. I'm dealing with themes that are real important to me: family, the  culture I'm tied to, the problems I see growing up in an urban environment. A  lot of the work is getting that stuff out without making yourself too precious,  too overbearing. It's also allowing yourself to be ugly -- and vulnerable."  </P> <P> "Downtown" plays at 8:30 p.m. Fridays through Sundays at Highways Performance  Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, through Dec. 9. Tickets are $10. (213)  453-1755.  </P> <P> </P></p>

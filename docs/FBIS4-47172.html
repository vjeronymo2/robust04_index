			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zenon Starchenko, Kiev: "Never Before Has Kiev </F> Seen Such a Friendly Turkish Invasion"]    [Text]One could hardly pick a worse time than the  present for a visit by a large foreign delegation to Ukraine.  But Turkish invasions were always timed to coincide with our  instability, whether in the government, economy, or when our  territorial integrity was at risk. This time, however, the  avalanche from across the sea came not to finish us off but to  support us. Obviously, in their own interest.    According to UNIAN (Ukrainian Information Agency),  agreements  signed during the visit covered cooperation in international  cartage and tourism, while soon to be signed accords will  encompass mutual investments, aviation, and oil deliveries. The  Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that Turkey  has plans to enter the Ukrainian market on a larger scale,  particularly in the area of foodstuffs, textiles, clothing,  cellulose and paper products, and leather goods. In turn, Turkey  is interested in acquiring Ukrainian metallurgical products, as  well as airplanes, railways cars, ships, and buses.    However, statistics show that Ukrainian-Turkish  rapprochement  needs to overcome some economic realities. Turkey had been the  biggest consumer of Ukrainian products in the Black Sea-Middle  East region at the time of Ukrainian declaration of  independence, but the volume of goods purchased from Ukraine  fell from US$323 million in 1992 to US$185 million in 1993.  Concomitantly, Turkish exports to Ukraine fell to US$18.5  million in 1993, while Iranian exports came to US$490 million.  Finally, Ukrainian corporations find it advantageous to register  in Greek-held part of Cyprus or in Lebanon where the tax climate  is more favorable than in Turkey.    The brightest spot in Ukrainian-Turkish relationship  pertains  to the Black Sea Economic Community (BSEC) initiative, although  the Russian and Greek delegations are attempting to create  roadblocks. Nevertheless, as soon as the new parliament replaces  Ivan Plyushch as the speaker, which seems certain, then a  pro-Russian head of the Ukrainian delegation may be appointed to  the BSEC Interparliamentary Assembly and even this bright spot  may dim perceptibly.    Crimea is an area of shared concerns between Ukraine and  Turkey. Kravchuk has already received assurances of support for  forceful action from Europe if necessary. At least that was the  impression gained from the visit of the British Defense Minister  Douglas Herd [sic], and the outcome of the Paris conference on  peace in Europe held a week ago. President Demirel's and prime  minister Chiler's concerns for the Tartars are driven by the  fact that if they fail to act militant muslims, whose power has  been growing in Turkey, may take the initiative.    The Turkish president insisted on maximum concessions from  Kravchuk for the Ukrainian followers of Allah. Demirel spoke for  30 minutes with Mustafa Jemilev, the speaker of the Crimean  Tartar Mejlis. The Tartar leader secured verbal assurances from  the Turkish leader and the latter from the Ukrainian president.  Turkey has proposed a tried-and-true educational approach that  has worked in Central Asia and Azerbaijan. This includes  creation in Crimea a network of schools with English and Turkish  as the languages of instruction--not just for Tartars but for  everyone--and increasing the number of Tartars studying at  Turkish colleges and universities from 30 to 300. Access to  Turkey for Tartars will also be eased. In addition, Demirel  promised to assume part of the costs of Tartar relocation to  Crimea. Naturally, Turkey is interested in using Crimea as a  loyal outpost in Eastern Europe. For Kiev, this is an attractive  alternative to a Russian enclave. Unlike Russia, Turkey has no  pretensions on the Ukrainian fleet and has no insane ideas to  make Crimea one of its own provinces.    Both presidents agreed that every attempt should be made to  avoid forceful actions in Crimea, whether in the form of an  energy embargo, a demand for three billion dollar debt  settlement as proposed by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, or the use of air  power. Nevertheless, Demirel clearly indicated Turkey's  readiness to become an ally in protecting Ukrainian national  interests. On the other hand, the Turkish president understands  that Ukraine has no choice but to accept Turkish support on  Turkish conditions. This applies particularly to the Tartar  question and Turkish exports.    Other ramifications are that Ukraine may become involved in  Turkish problems. Turkey has been hit hard by the sanctions  against Iraq since Turkey is the primary re-exported of Iraqi  oil. These sanction were extended by Security Council in the  April-May session. The recent Turkish proposal for a pipeline  from Turkey through Ukraine into Europe has to seen in the Iraqi  context.    Then there is the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Turkey  values Ukraine's opposition to various "peacekeeping forces" in  the CIS and to growing Russian influence in the Transcaucasus.  Finally, there is need for a joint position on the conflict in  Yugoslavia, again involving sanctions. Ukraine wants Danube to  be opened up fully to navigation and Ankara favors strict  isolation of Serbia. Demirel feels that if he agrees to joint  control of Crimea with Kravchuk, common interests will force  Ukraine to dance to the Turkish tune.</p>

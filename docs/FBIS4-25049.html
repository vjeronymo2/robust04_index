			<p>BFN     [Text] Following the opinions of the State Planning  Commission as well as the State Economic and Trade Commission on  reforming the circulation system of crude oil and refined oil,  which were approved by the State Council recently, Liaoning  began implementing an important adjustment on the circulation  system of crude oil and refined oil on 1 May. Resources would  be distributed, and prices fixed by the state in a unified  manner.    In the past few years, the issue of Liaoning's irrational  management system as well as unreasonable prices of oil products  has become more conspicuous with each day. Dispersed resources  of oil products, overlapping in management, failure in price  control, and chaos in the market have become more and more  serious, thus providing the soil for speculators, profiteers,  and law and discipline violators to take the opportunity to reap  staggering profits and engage in corrupt practice. Therefore,  it is necessary to take effective measures to reform the current  circulation system of crude oil and refined oil, to strengthen  the macro-management of the production and circulation of crude  oil and refined oil, to rationalize the prices of oil products,  to rectify the order of circulation, to reduce circulation  links, and to establish, step by step, a standardized, vigorous,  and orderly circulation system of crude oil and refined oil  which meets the demands of a socialist market economy.    The major content of this reform is to achieve reasonable  distribution of resources, letting the refineries belonging to  the Petrochemical General Company process land crude oil and  imported crude oil in a unified manner. For the marketing of  refined oil, distribution will be made under state guidance to  change the duplicate and decentralized management. The prices  will be fixed by the state. The state's control of the producer  prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices of crude oil and  refined oil not only ensures the profits of the producers and  consumers but also keeps the prices stable. Categorization of  taxes and rate of taxation will be unified. Unified tax  categories and tax rates will be applied to all the coastal  areas, inland areas, special zones, and development zones as  well as state-owned, collective, "three types of  foreign-funded," and individual enterprises which deal in crude  oil and refined oil. Governments at all levels should not give  them preferential treatment by reducing or exempting their taxes  or fix their tax quotas. Sale channels should be made  reasonable, and intermediate links should be reduced.  Provincial, city, and county petroleum companies should be the  main channels of selling refined oil, and the resources of  refined oil should be distributed by the petroleum companies at  all levels in a unified manner according to plans. All  refineries should sell petroleum only to petroleum companies.  Current refined oil wholesale organizations should be screened  and reorganized, and retail gas stations (spots) should be  rectified. Party, government, and army organs at all levels are  not permitted to engage themselves in the wholesale and retail  sale of crude oil and refined oil. The wholesale organizations  which have been reorganized will be brought into the main sales  channels. Gas stations, which prove qualified to engage in the  business after joint investigation and rectification, should  phase in the system of sales on a commission basis. They should  replenish their stock from the local petroleum companies and  sell according to the retail price set. Those who do not sell  at the set price, pass the bad off as the good, give short  measure, and evade taxes will have their oil supplies stopped  and their status as sales agents canceled.</p>

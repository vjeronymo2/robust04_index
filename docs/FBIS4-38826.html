			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Korean President Kim Yong-sam  said on Thursday that "it will be impossible to preserve peace  in northeast Asia without Russian cooperation". The president,  who is now on a state visit to Russia, was addressing the  Federation Council (the upper chamber of the Russian parliament).    Kim Yong-sam noted that "the cooperation of the leaders of  the Russian administration and parliament to forge a new era of  regional peace will also help promote peace throughout the  world".    The president said that through an extensive dialogue with  President Yeltsin this morning he was convinced that Korea and  Russia could be "trusted partners in quest of greater shared  prosperity well into the 21st century".    According to the president, both states should cooperate to  ensure the success of the reform policies now being pursued in  both lands.    Kim Yong-sam expressed hope that his current visit will  boost  Russian-Korean cooperation that "will make us even better  neighbours". He reminded that the two-way trade jumped from  only 900 million USD in 1990 to 1.6 billion last year. Korea's  businesses have invested 24 million USD in 25 development  projects in Russia, and as of March 1994, 29 major Korean  companies had established branch offices in Russia.    Touching upon the situation on the Korean peninsula, the  president noted that "it is imperative to resolve international  suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development programme as  quickly as possible" adding that "without a decisive solution of  the nuclear issue, it will be impossible to preserve peace not  only on the Korean peninsula but also in Asia as a whole".    "If and when the nuclear issue is settled, the Republic of  Korea is ready and willing to provide economic support to North  Korea to help it rebuild its tattered economy and carry out  reform", Kim Yong-sam stressed.    The president appealed to members of the Russian parliament  to actively cooperate to solve the North Korean nuclear issue.    The president cited well-known verses by Russian poet Fedor  Tyutchev: "Russia cannot be grasped by reason... It can only be  trusted". Emphasizing the last line of the poem, the president  said that he trusted that "the rise of a stable and prosperous  new Russia will signal the beginning of a new era of universal  prosperity of not only the Russian people themselves but also of  all Asians and all mankind".</p>

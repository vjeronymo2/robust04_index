			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe that the exclusions proposed by the commenter would require the enactment of new legislation. Accordingly, in the absence of such authority, we have not revised the regulations to incorporate such exclusions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the proposed regulations not limit the exclusion of purchases contained in Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 to initial purchases made with Indian judgment funds and per capita distributions, because that law refers to ``*&blank;*&blank;* any purchases made with such funds *&blank;*&blank;*'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The exclusion of purchases in Pub. L. 97&hyph;458 does not apply to proceeds from the sales or conversions of initial purchases or to purchases made with the money derived from the sales or conversions of initial purchases. As indicated earlier in this preamble, this policy reflects Congressional intent to protect only the distributions made by the Secretary of the Interior. Any purchases made subsequent to initial purchases would not be made from distributions made by the Secretary of the Interior. Furthermore, tracking the funds beyond the initial purchase would be administratively difficult, if not impossible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the Secretary correct a conflict between &sect;416.1210(i) and &sect;416.1234 as proposed. Section 416.1210 provides a list of resource exclusions with corresponding regulatory citations. Specifically, &sect;416.1210(i), states that the resource exclusion of restricted allotted land applies to ``an enrolled member of an Indian tribe as provided in &sect;416.1234.'' Section 416.1234 states that the exclusion applies to ``an individual *&blank;*&blank;* who is of Indian descent from a federally recognized Indian tribe,'' and does not limit its exclusion to an enrolled member of an Indian tribe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that &sect;416.1210(i) may appear to be in conflict with &sect;416.1234. Although a change to correct this possible inconsistency was not included in the NPRM, we believe a technical change to correct our oversight and make our intent clear is appropriate. Therefore, we are making a technical change to the regulations at &sect;416.1210(i) to read, ``Restricted allotted Indian lands as provided in &sect;416.1234;'' to provide a simplified and more accurate cross-reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Regulations Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of Public Law 98&hyph;64 regarding the exclusion of certain funds from income are reflected in the appendix to Subpart K,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> IV. Native Americans, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the addition of paragraph (h) to these final regulations. This obviates the need for continuance of paragraph (c)(3) which only partially reflects the income exclusion provisions of Public Law 98&hyph;64. Paragraph (c)(3) is duplicative and no longer needed. Therefore, we are making a technical change to the regulations by deleting paragraph (c)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for the technical change in response to an issue raised by a public comment and the technical change to remove a duplicative provision, we are adopting these regulations as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Engineers gloomy over growth THE Engineering Employers Federation yesterday sharply revised downwards its forecasts for UK economic growth this year and 1993 amid reduced expectations for UK and world recovery. An update to the federation's Engineering Economic Trends series, which last reported in the spring, confirms that engineering output has stopped falling, but pushes back by about six months the start of its recovery. The federation is a cautious forecaster but is widely respected for its accuracy. Mr Ian Thompson, its economic adviser, expects UK gross domestic product to fall by 0.6 per cent this year compared with his spring forecast of 0.5 per cent growth. Next year's growth forecast is revised downwards from 2.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent. The spring report had predicted that the vehicles sector would lead a recovery in engineering output that would begin in the second half of this year. Yesterday, however, Mr Thompson said that neither the UK market, nor exports, seemed likely to produce any substantial increase in vehicle output during the second half. Consequently, engineering output is now forecast to start recovering from late this year. Among the main points of the federation's forecasts for the next 12 months are: Engineering output will increase by 3 per cent, after falling 15 per cent in the previous 24 months. The total UK market for engineering products will grow by 4 per cent, after falling 17 per cent in the previous 24 months. Employment in engineering will fall at a much slower rate, with about 60,000 job cuts compared with 260,000 over the past 24 months. This will take engineering employment to 1.75m next year against 3m in 1980. The rise in engineering output forecast by the federation for next year is the first for four years, with sales in 1992 money expected to rise from Pounds 121.6bn this year to Pounds 126bn. But, on the same basis, this is still less than the Pounds 126.1bn of engineering sales in 1980. Mr Neil Johnson, the federation's new director-general, said the EEF would continue to stress the importance of maintaining the UK's manufacturing base.</p>

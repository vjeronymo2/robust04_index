			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Japanese companies slash their costs TOYOTA, the Japanese car maker, is planning to cut costs by at least Y100bn (Pounds 613m) this fiscal year, in an ambitious exercise designed to combat the impact of the yen's sharp appreciation and stagnant demand in the Japanese car market, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo. If successful, the efforts by Toyota to slash its costs will take the total amount of cost cuts in fiscal 1993 and 1994 to Y200bn. Toyota said its cost reductions last year, which represented about 1 per cent of its total cost of sales, had been a main contributor to the Y322bn pre-tax profits it made in the year to June 30. To achieve its goal Toyota has set up several committees, each headed by an executive and involving several hundred employees, from purchasing to distribution and administration staff, as well as executives at its components suppliers. So far the company estimates its efforts have enabled it to shave off about 3 per cent of the costs of making each car. The fervour with which Toyota, widely recognised as one of the world's most efficient manufacturers, has taken to cutting costs reflects the difficulties Japanese manufacturers and exporters face amid the country's economic slowdown, a sharp appreciation of the yen and spread-ing gloom about future pros-pects. Toyota, in common with a growing number of Japanese corporations, is also adjusting its employment structure to try to survive through the difficult environment. It has sent 175 employees to a subcontractor from this month. Others are being forced to take more drastic action. Honda said it was reducing the number of its employees by 3,000 over the next three years through natural attrition and by reducing the number of new recruits. Honda's decision is being forced on it by the need to reduce production in Japan due to the fall in domestic demand and the difficulty of remaining competitive in a high yen environment. It will end a shift at one line in its Suzuka factory from October 1 and cut the other line to one shift next April. This is in addition to a reduction of output at another factory near Tokyo. Production of its mainline Accord and Civic models bound for the US market will be shifted almost entirely from Japan to the US. The electronics industry is facing a similar need to shift production overseas, as well as to adjust employment levels. JVC became the latest company to announce a reduction in employees. The maker of audio-visual equipment will shed 2,000 employees by the end of next September, after reducing staff by 3,000 last year. Alps Electric, which makes components for most of the big electronics companies, is looking for cuts of 1,600 through voluntary retirement. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, has sent 2,000 employees to its affiliated retail shops. The moves are increasing concerns that Japanese industry could be hollowing out by losing jobs abroad. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported in a recent study that a 10 per cent fall in exports would lead to a 1.2 per cent fall in GDP, a 2.1 per cent fall in manufacturing output and a surplus in the workforce of 470,000.</p>

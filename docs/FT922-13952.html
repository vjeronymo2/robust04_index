			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television However cynical about politicians we may have become in recent weeks, many of us will watch every moment of polling night itself, not least because this count looks like being the closest for a long time. You simply have to decide whether to go for Jon Snow (cousin of Peter, from the Newsnight sandpit) anchoring for ITN, or David Dimbleby (scion of an even older broadcasting dynasty) doing the same for BBC1, or whether, like many of us, you will flick between the two. If you want to know the results but feel the whole business is overdone, here is the drill: switch to BBC1 at 9.55 and then toggle between Dimbleby and Snow for the first exit poll. As soon as possible after 10.00 switch to C4 and watch Scandal, a goodish British film about politics in what feels like another age: the Profumo scandal. At 12.10 check what has happened in the first hour of results and then watch either Manhattan, one of Woody Allen's best movies, on BBC2 (12.15) or Kit And The Widow, the Flanders and Swan de nos jours, on C4 (12.10) followed by Duck Soup, arguably the Marx Brothers' best. That will bring you to about 2.00 am by which time most of the results will be in.</p>

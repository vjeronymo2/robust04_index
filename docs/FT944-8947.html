			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unigate warns of dairy closures Unigate, the food and distribution group, warned yesterday that it would have to close more dairies to help it adjust to sharp price increases by Milk Marque, successor to the Milk Marketing Board. Announcing yesterday a rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 50.3m to Pounds 53.7m, Mr Ross Buckland, chairman, said the restructuring cost and job losses were still being calculated. Turnover was Pounds 892.3m, against Pounds 1.01bn, which included Pounds 141.4m from discontinued activities. Milk Marque's price increases were 'a clear abuse . . . of its dominant supply position', he said. But he hoped to see some roll-back in prices after the dairy industry had sought redress through the government and the courts. The increases lifted Unigate's costs this year by Pounds 40m, with rise of between 4 and 19 per cent depending on the product, giving an average of 11 per cent. Unigate reiterated its earlier warning that trading profits would be reduced by Pounds 10m in the full year. It was recovering some of the costs after increasing the price of doorstep-delivered milk by 2p to 41p a pint in London and 40p outside and supermarkets had passed on most of the increase. It had also closed its Worthing dairy. Unigate has signed up farmers to supply directly more than half its milk needs. It pays a small premium over the Milk Marque price but achieves benefits such as lower transport costs and the ability to work with farmers to tailor their supplies to Unigate's needs, Mr Buckland said. He declined to comment on speculation that Unigate might bid for Dairy Crest, the manufacturing arm of the old MMB. In the six months to September 30, Unigate Dairies' operating profits rose Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 18.7m on sales of Pounds 229.8m (Pounds 227.5m). Milk volumes, including acquisitions, rose 3 per cent but underlying sales were down slightly. Doorstep sales were down 12 per cent at an annual rate while supermarket sales rose. Fresh foods, including the St Ivel and Malton brands, lifted operating profits by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 14.7m on sales of Pounds 382.3m (Pounds 362.9m). Profits at Wincanton, the distribution business, rose Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 10.7m on sales of Pounds 160m (Pounds 146m). It won new contracts but competitive pressures affected rates. Profits from US restaurants fell by Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 6.1m as sales at its Black-eyed Pea chain fell by 5 per cent on a comparable restaurant basis. The chain, which Unigate still hopes to sell, is spending Pounds 10m by the end of 1995 on refurbishment. The interim dividend is increased by 0.3p to 6.3p, payable from earnings per share up from 15.2p to 16.4p. See Lex</p>

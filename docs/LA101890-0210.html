			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> $20,000 REWARD URGED IN ASSAULT  </P> <P> Mayor Gene Wisner has proposed that the city offer a $20,000 reward for  information leading to the capture of a band of Asian youths who stormed into a  home, bound and assaulted family members and fled with jewelry.  </P> <P> On Sept. 14, members of a middle-class Chinese family were bound with duct tape  while the teen-agers took their jewelry.  </P> <P> The mother of the family was pistol-whipped, leaving her with facial cuts, a  black eye and a broken hand. Brea officers, who patrol Yorba Linda, said that  although the family is Chinese, the intrusion resembles home invasions that  have plagued the county's Vietnamese community.  </P> <P> Wisner, noting that Yorba Linda's crime rate was among the lowest in Orange  County, said the reward would show criminals that the city is serious about  cracking down on crime.  </P> <P> "I felt now is the time to bring it to a screeching halt," Wisner told council  members Tuesday.  </P> <P> Wisner said he also would offer $1,000 of his own money for the reward.  </P> <P> "For $20,000, those people are going to come forward and tell us something,"  Wisner said after Tuesday's City Council meeting. "We don't want to see  something like this happening again."  </P> <P> City Council members voted to take the proposal under study. TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

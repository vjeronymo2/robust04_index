			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Navy Demands More Vessels"] </F>   [Text] The planned expansion of the territorial waters  means that the Navy will call for considerably more resources.  Rear Admiral Sakari Visa, the naval commander, indicated in an  interview on Sunday [8 May] with TURUN SANOMAT that the new sea  regions cannot be monitored effectively without additional  resources.    According to Visa, the Navy's greatest need is for four or  five new patrol boats and new fixed materiel. Finland must also  acquire submarines. Visa believes that if Finland had a  submarine flotilla of its own, it would be much easier to patrol  sea areas and to raise the threshold for border violations.    But submarines are not at the top of the Navy's wish list,  according to Visa.    Several weeks ago, in one of its evening sessions, the  government decided in principle to expand the territorial  boundary from the present 4 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles.  According to plans, the parliament will be presented with a  proposal on this matter as early as this month. Rear Adm. Visa  points out that, despite this decision, the Navy has not been  promised any more ships or personnel. In the TURUN SANOMAT  interview, Visa also pointed out that Finnish membership in the  European Union [EU] would place new demands on border monitoring  and on the defense in general, since Finland's boundaries would  then be the outer boundaries of the Union, as well.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Cookson Cookson's management should resolve never to place the company at the mercy of another put option. The obligation to buy out its partner in the Stern Leach precious metals business cost an unwelcome Pounds 50m last year. Another Pounds 80m will have to be found next year to repay convertible bond holders certain to demand their money back early. Since working capital is also being squeezed by the early stages of US recovery, Cookson faced a pressing requirement for additional capital to which yesterday's rights issue was a natural answer. Gearing climbed from 51 per cent to 74 per cent last year, and would have been higher but for the effect of weaker sterling on shareholders' funds. As well as bringing gearing to a more comfortable level, there will be cash left over for acquisitions. In the light of history, it is tempting to conclude shareholders are being asked to give the company enough rope to hang itself. But after two years' consolidation under new management and with the cycle turning in its favour, Cookson may deserve some leeway. It has to do something. There is little chance of squeezing much more than Pounds 1.5bn turnover from its slimmed-down set of businesses. Even if it reaches a target return on sales of 10 per cent - and allowing for a modest interest charge - that might imply pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 140m at the peak, possibly three years away on an optimistic view. On that basis, the shares were starting to look fully valued before yesterday's announcement.</p>

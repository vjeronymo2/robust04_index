			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries start the week with solid gains US government securities opened a week in which the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again with solid gains yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/16 at 85, yielding 7.452 per cent. Prices were only slightly firmer at the short end of the market, where the two-year bond was up  1/16 at 99 3/32 , to yield 5.980 per cent. Prices firmed gradually after the start of trading in New York, but dealers struggled to explain why the market opened in such an upbeat mood. The morning's economic statistics, showing a 0.3 per cent rise in April industrial production, were in line with expectations, and some analysts suggested prices climbed after the figures were released because the market was relieved that there were no nasty surprises in the data. Otherwise, trading was described as very light, with many participants choosing to remain on the sidelines until after today's meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Expectations are high that the FOMC will sanction an interest rate increase at the meeting. Supported by firmer US bonds, most European markets posted moderate gains in quiet trading as dealers awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting. German government bonds led the advance, with the 10-year sector gaining about  1/2 point on shifts to the longer end of the yield curve. The German yield curve has steepened sharply in recent weeks, with the spread between two-year and 10-year yields widening to around 125 basis points, from 80 basis points about a month ago. However, after the Bundesbank's  1/2 point cut in its discount and Lombard rates last week, many analysts are re-commending curve-flattening trades, suggesting that investors sell short-dated paper and move into long-dated bonds. Last week's rate cut 'is likely to be the last official move until after the summer recess', said Mr Graham McDevitt, bond strategist with market analysts IDEA. Although the weekly repo rate can edge some 50 basis points lower over that period, he feels this is largely discounted in forward rates. At the long end, he said, bunds are resisting further selling pressure and with US Treasuries also showing signs of resilience, 'a decisive (tightening) move by the Fed this week could spark a substantial corrective rally through European bond markets'. 'Since shortening trades are quite widely owned now and the inflation outlook is going to be very positive, I think moving longer in Germany and other continental European markets could be rewarding over the next three months or so,' agreed Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The June Bund futures contract stood at 95.93 in late trading, up 0.66 points on the day and near its 95.95 high. French government bonds followed German bunds higher, with the June notional bond future on Matif rising 0.57 points to 94.58. Trade in UK government bonds was subdued as participants turned their attention to the implications of Friday's announcement of a short-dated convertible gilt issue and the FOMC meeting. 'Attention all day has been directed towards working out what the convertible announcement means and as a result performance has not been dramatic,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. Details of the size and maturity of the issue, which will be auctioned on May 25, are due to be published by the Bank of England at 3.30pm. But Mr Briscoe said that yesterday's data showing low UK producer price inflation helped the market hold on to the gains it made on Friday after the announcement of the issue. Producer output prices in April registered their lowest annual increase since December 1986. 'This is very good news,' said Mr Briscoe. 'There are clearly few signs of inflationary pressures in the economy.' He said that other UK data due this week, including retail price inflation and retail sales, will be important for evidence of a strengthening recovery and of inflationary pressures. The June long gilt futures contract on Liffe traded at 105 1/32 by late afternoon, down  3/32 points from Friday's close.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AGENCY OKS CALABASAS APPLICATION FOR  CITYHOOD  </P> <P> Calabasas inched closer to independence Wednesday when the Local Agency  Formation Commission approved an application for cityhood by the affluent  suburb at the western end of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But activists who have worked nearly a decade to incorporate their community  reacted with restraint, noting they have failed twice in the past and still  require approval from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and local  voters.  </P> <P> Bob Hill, president of the Calabasas Cityhood Committee, noted that LAFCO,  which oversees the creation of new cities, includes two county supervisors --  Ed Edelman and Deane Dana -- who joined in the unanimous vote for cityhood. The  supervisor representing Calabasas, Michael Antonovich, also supports the  cityhood drive, apparently guaranteeing three affirmative votes on the  five-member county board, he said.  </P></p>

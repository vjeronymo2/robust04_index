			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "In Brief" column] </F>   [Text] Moscow -- As has become known, shortly before the  New Year a steering group was formed to set up yet another bloc,  tentatively called Center. It is expected that the bloc will  incorporate representatives of all parties and organizations  which either did not contest the 12 December elections or failed  to pass one of their stages. The parties affiliated with the  New Russia bloc are an exception. In particular this bloc will  apparently include the Russian Social Democratic Center, the  Russia Revival Union, the SPT, the PT [previous two expansions  unknown], the Russian Christian Democratic Movement, the  Democratic Party Moscow branch, and others. The new bloc  intends to contest elections to local power bodies.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A chance to insure against debt - In a Nutshell Businesses frequently take out credit insurance to cover exports but rarely use it for their domestic sales, despite the growing risk of UK customers going bust or delaying payment. Barclays Bank has launched a short-term credit insurance scheme called Barclays Sales Protection, intended to cover domestic sales but applicable also to exports, in the hope of increasing interest. The new scheme is available to limited companies with annual sales of at least Pounds 250,000 and a good record of credit management. Premiums normally cost less than Pounds 1 for every Pounds 100 of cover. The scheme pays up to 90 per cent of outstanding debts six months after the invoice due date.</p>

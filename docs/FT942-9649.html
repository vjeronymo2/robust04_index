			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Whessoe shares fall on setback Shares in Whessoe fell 35p to 184p yesterday as the instrumentation and control and piping systems group reported halved interim profits and the disposal of its project engineering division. After a Pounds 1m exceptional charge for redundancies and interest costs of Pounds 705,000 (Pounds 277,000 income), pre-tax profits for the half year to end-March fell to Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 4.02m). Turnover, however, increased by 56 per cent from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 63.8m, of which Pounds 6.74m (Pounds 8.22m) came from discontinued operations. Earnings per share emerged at 4.4p (11.6p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 2.3p. Whessoe Projects, the project engineering arm, has been sold to Noell, a German engineering company owned by Preussag, for Pounds 1.4m cash. Proceeds will be used to reduce borrowings.</p>

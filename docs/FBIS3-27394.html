An official from the provincial statistics bureau said that  non-state-owned manufacturers -- collectively-owned firms,  private companies and Sino-foreign joint ventures -- turned out  166 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993, up 50 percent over the  previous year.    As a result, these manufacturers now account for nearly 48  percent of the province's total industrial output value, an  increase of four percentage points, the official said.    In contrast, output value of state-owned manufacturers rose  just 5.3 percent last year, he said.    Production growth of collectively-owned businesses in both  urban and suburban areas is the most impressive, with output  value topping 100 billion yuan for the first time in 1993, he  said.    The figure represented an increase of 68 percent over 1992,  he added.    Meanwhile, output value of foreign-funded companies shot up  by 40 percent and that of private firms by 50 percent, he said.    Local economists agreed that non-state-owned companies are  now playing an increasingly significant role in circulation.    They cited the change in market shares as an example. Retail  sales of state-run companies rose 10.4 percent in 1993, while  those of collectively-owned firms climbed by 15 percent, those  of private businesses by 43 percent and those of foreign-funded  enterprises by 70 percent.    As a result, non-state-owned companies accounted for 63  percent of Liaoning's retail sales in 1993, up by four  percentage points.    Moreover, non-state-run research institutes are mushrooming  throughout Liaoning, the economists said.    The province had 5,180 such institutes in 1993, 4,100 more  than in 1992, according to the provincial statistics bureau.  These institutes employed 70,000 people last year, 55,000 more  than in 1992.    Moreover, these institutes generated a total of 170 million  yuan in profits and taxes in 1993, ten times the amount in the  previous year.    According to economists, the non-state-owned sector is also  becoming a major source of revenue for Liaoning Province.    For example, collectively-owned township-run enterprises  paid  five billion yuan in taxes to the government last year, a  quarter of Liaoning's revenue.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Press Center of the State Tax Inspectorate </F> For Smolensk Oblast: "Report From the Tax Inspectorate"]    [Text] In 1993 the oblast's state tax inspectorates  provided for receipts to the budgetary system of taxes and  mandatory payments in the amount of 225.9 billion rubles,  including 157.3 billion rubles to the Smolensk Oblast  budget.    In the course of carrying out monitoring work, the tax  inspectorates established violations of the tax legislation in  every other enterprise and organization that was audited. They  revealed instances of understated profit, concealed taxes and  payments with a consideration of penalty sanctions with a total  amount of 16.6 billion rubles, which constitutes 14.9 million  rubles per average scheduled worker in the tax agencies.    The largest additional computations were made during the  audits of the Dvigatel plant in Yartsevo, 1,445,500,000 rubles;  the Minudobreniya Dorogobuzh AO [joint-stock company],  527,900,000 rubles; the Almazinstrument Plant in Roslavl,  256,700,000 rubles; Gnezdovo AO, 165,500,000 rubles;  Kompleksnyye Dorozhnyye Mashiny AO, 130,600,000 rubles;  Stroykonstruktsiya AO, 120,500,000 rubles; Smolensk Oblast  Commercial-Trade Enterprise, 117,400,000 rubles; and  Smolensknefteprodukty State Enterprise, 87,500,000 rubles. The  basic reasons for the revealed violations were the poor  knowledge of the tax legislation by officials at enterprises and  organizations by physical individuals; their failure to observe  the proper bookkeeping procedure and the statute dealing with  the makeup of the expenditures to be considered as production  costs of output (operations, services) and other normative  documents and instructional documents; as well as the deliberate  understatement of the taxable base for purposes of avoiding  taxation.    During 1993, administrative fines amounting to a total of  66.2 million rubles were levied against 3459 officials at  enterprises and organizations and 3366 citizens for violations  of the tax legislation.    A total of 15,233 foreign citizens were required to file  declarations. They were taxed a total of 58.6 million rubles of  income tax.    In 1993 the state tax inspectorates carried out 140  seminar-conferences with taxpayers, dealing with the procedure  for application of the tax legislation. More than 300  explanatory articles were published, and 84 informative talks  were broadcast by radio.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Bond market investors have, at least for the moment, welcomed last week's appointment of Mr Yasuo Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank, as the new Bank of Japan governor. That Mr Matsushita, a former vice-minister of finance, has had 10 years experience in the private sector has triggered hopes of lower interest rates. Many investors expect him to be more sympathetic to banks' bad-loan problem and the sluggish demand for funds among corporations. They hope that he will relax monetary policy, in contrast to his predecessor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, who is known for his efforts to burst the asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s. Traders on the bond futures markets said the March 1995 futures contract had moved firmly since the announcement. High demand for funds among banks and companies, on the other hand, is expected to limit any rise in bond prices. Banks looking to raise year-end funds are expected to turn to the two-month money markets. Financial institutions are avoiding funding in the three-month certificate of deposit market, their usual source of capital, since they want to avoid a rise in the short-term prime lending rate, which is linked to three-month CD rates, when lending is stagnant.</p>

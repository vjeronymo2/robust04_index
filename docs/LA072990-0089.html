			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 100 REPORTED HELD HOSTAGE IN PICCADILLY NIGHTCLUB  </P> <P> Police said today that a gunman was holding possibly as many as 100 people  hostage in a London nightclub, and a witness who escaped said he believes  members of the Kuwaiti royal family were among them.  </P> <P> Ambulance officers who drove to the scene to await developments said they had  no reports of anyone being hurt.  </P> <P> Armed police also were outside the building housing Tokyo Joe's, a club popular  in London's Middle Eastern community and located off Piccadilly.  </P> <P> Police said negotiations were being conducted with the aid of an interpreter,  although the man spoke some English. They said they do not know his  nationality.  </P> <P> Others who got out of the club said the man appeared to be Middle Eastern.  </P> <P> Staff and visitors who were in the street said the police were called early  today after a man with a gun was seen walking through the packed club toward  the basement area about 2 a.m.  </P> <P> Dennis Tuerena, 38, the doorman, said he was standing in the reception area  when he came face to face with a man armed with two guns, a knife and what  appeared to be a bomb.  </P> <P> "There were some people moving at the time and this man just pushed them back  and ran in," Tuerena said. "He had a shotgun in one hand, a handgun in the  other and a knife pushed in his trousers that was like a little sword or a  rapier."  </P> <P> Tuerena said he led two club members to safety through an emergency exit before  the gunman realized what was happening.  </P> <P> Yacoub Ibrahim, who said he is in London on vacation and had been inside, told  a reporter that members of the Kuwaiti royal family were in the club. Ibrahim  said he had not seen them since he escaped and believed they were still inside.  </P> <P> Jamal Elamery, an Egyptian working in London for a Saudi Arabian family, said  he was on his way into the club to join friends when he was caught in a crowd  of people leaving it.  </P> <P> "I was just going in when I saw a lot of people panicking and leaving. I turned  round and joined in the rush," he said.  </P> <P> Others who managed to get out said about 200 people were in the club when the  gunman entered.  </P> <P> After daylight with the siege more than four hours old, a police officer said:  "People are still trickling out of the premises. I think as the opportunity  arises they break for cover. A handful of people have come out in the last  hour, mainly women," he said.  </P></p>

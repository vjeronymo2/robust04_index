			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bid hint at Allied DRINKS group Allied-Lyons rose sharply in early trading on renewed speculation that the group might be taken over by a consortium of Seagram, the Canadian drinks group and Philip Morris, the US food conglomerate The shares rose as much as 80p in a burst of early trading but then pulled back to close 35 up on the day at 667p on heavy turnover of 6.1m. There was also unusually heavy activity in the London Traded Options market. Allied-Lyons had no comment to make on the rumours. Speculation firmed on the back of a freelance journalist's inquiries according to Mr Chris Wickham, analyst at Lehman Brothers International. Allied was also tipped in the press recently as one of the four British stocks most likely to be taken over in 1992. Allied-Lyons was viewed as vulnerable last year when it reported poor results, in part from foreign exchange losses. But its moves to restore investor confidence, including a management shake-up have helped to restore its image. Analysts said a bidder would need Pounds 8bn to buy Allied-Lyons, taking into account its market capitalisation of about Pounds 6bn and a Pounds 2bn bid premium. And a bidder would be taking on about Pounds 2bn in debt, they pointed out. Philip Morris has hinted that it might make a large acquisition in Europe, but Allied-Lyons has not been considered its top choice. Cadbury-Schweppes has more often been mentioned as its likely European target. Cadbury rose 5 but closed a penny off at 439p. United Biscuits was also affected and gained 11 before closing 4 up at 414p. BT downgraded Volume in the two classes of BT (formerly British Telecom), was more than double that of the next heaviest traded stock. Some 27m BT 'new' shares changed hands, while turnover in the 'old' topped 10m shares. Analysts involved in the Government's sale were precluded from issuing alterations to their forecasts until one month after the market debut of the new shares and the end of the stabilisation process which occurred at the close of business last Monday. Dealers said both the stocks had held up well in the face of determined selling by institutions, which had begun to take notice of a series of profits downgrades by brokers associated with the flotation of a 26 per cent stake in BT. The flotation left the government with a 22 per cent holding in the group. The general consensus among leading analysts was that pre-flotation estimates of BT's pre-tax profits for 1992, mostly in the region of Pounds 3.2bn would have to be pulled back to Pounds 3.1bn and those for 1993 back to around Pounds 3.2bn. Kleinwort Benson said it had reduced its estimate for 1992 to Pounds 3.125bn and for 1993 to Pounds 3.25bn. BZW shifted from Pounds 3.15bn to Pounds 3.1bn for 1992 and from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.3bn for 1993, while UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is forecasting Pounds 3.1bn for 1992 and Pounds 3.175bn for 1993. BT 'old' shares eased 1 1/2 to 328 1/2 p and the 'new' held at 125 1/2 p, having been up to 126 1/2 p. The stock goes 'ex' the 5.7p interim dividend on Monday. Oils hit again Shearson Lehman was the latest broker to cut its forecasts for oil prices and oil company earnings. Mr Jeremy Hudson at Shearson moved to the bottom of the market forecast range in lowering his current year estimate for Brent crude to Dollars 18.50 a barrel and predicted 'substantial' weakness during the next eights weeks. He downgraded his current year estimate of replacement net income for BP by 40 per cent to Pounds 635m and that for Shell by 20 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn. His bearish stance was illustrated by his advice to clients to 'buy both stocks some 5 to 10 per cent lower down.' BP settled 1 1/2 off at 282p on turnover of 6.5m while Shell dipped 3 to 473p on 6.9m traded. Lasmo, still responding to a series of broker buy recommendations, rose 4 to 238p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 4m. Smith New Court described Lasmo as 'significantly (15 to 20 per cent) undervalued,' while Kleinwort Benson labelled the stock its premier 1992 selection in the E&amp;P sub-sector. Motors weak Motor stocks were weak after securities house Smith New Court took a stark look at the sector and cut its profit estimates for the coming year. Smith's new motors analyst Mr Peter Deighton remains a seller continuing with the house line that the sector is 'best avoided'. He has reduced his 1991 forecast for T&amp;N by Pounds 18m to Pounds 42m and his 1992 figure by Pounds 15m to Pounds 55m. He also raises a question mark over the 1992 dividend. Both profit figures are at the bottom of the range of analysts' estimates and the shares fell 10 to 102p. The house cut its 1991 and 1992 forecasts for GKN by Pounds 10m to Pounds 80m and Pounds 115m and the shares dropped 15 to 283p. Lucas Industries, also part of the forecast review, lost 7 to 102p. Raine Industries eased to 102p with analysts expected to alter their estimates for the group, which confirmed it had built up a 2.9 per cent stake in Lovell, the troubled construction group. Smith &amp; Nephew was firm after news it had settled its US legal case with Polteco for Dollars 37.5m, sharply cutting a damages award from Dollars 96m. The shares gained 1 3/4 to 143p on heavy turnover of 9.4m. Motor group Inchcape continued to improve on the back of the 89.3 per cent take-up of its rights issue. The shares gained 9 to 404p. Asda shares were heavily traded (18m changed hands) and dropped to 28p before stabilising at 28 1/2 p, a net fall of 4 1/2 p, after news of the change of the group's finance director. Asda is scheduled to report interim figures on Wednesday when profits are expected to be sharply down on last year's Pounds 60m. Estimates range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 30m. Bearish noises from AB Foods' annual meeting left the shares 16 weaker at 447p and affected other milling and bakery stocks such as RHM, 8 off at 236p, and Dalgety, 9 lower at 376p. Heavy trading in Burton saw the stock retreat 1 1/2 more to 34p on turnover of 14m; dealers said a Smith New Court sell note had triggered much of the activity in the stock. Ratners eased 2 to 21p on turnover of 13m after the statement on Christmas trading and the management changes. Principal chemical stocks were weakened by a change of stance from securities house Smith New Court. The house, is preparing a 20-page strategy document on the sector and analyst Mr Charles Lambert said yesterday: 'The whole sector is overvalued'. The Smiths analysts spoke to their sales team yesterday morning and clients were being advised to take profits principally in ICI, which fell 10 1/2 to 1167 1/2 p and Courtaulds which lost 20 to 499p. A positive note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew on textile stocks in general and Coats Viyella in particular encouraged buyers. The stronger dollar and a UBS forecast on the US currency was behind the forecast change. Coats Viyella rose 8 to 176p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (81).

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A HEALTHY CHOICE OF HOSPITALS;  </P> <P> REGION IS SERVED BY 5 FACILITIES  </P> <P> Where do you want to have your baby? Your face lift? Your back surgery?  Hospital patients who have the luxury of time increasingly have the luxury of  choices. As North County's population has grown, so has the potential to check  out the hospital you'll be checking into.  </P> <P> In addition to considering the medical advice of their physicians, patients can  also evaluate a hospital based on its ambience, its services and its cost. The  right hospital might not necessarily be the one closest to home.  </P> <P> North County's five hospitals:  </P> <P> * Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, the area' largest and busiest.  </P> <P> * Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, the area's only trauma center.  </P> <P> * Pomerado Hospital in Poway, attached to a 149-bed skilled nursing facility.  </P> <P> The Pomerado and Palomar hospitals are administered jointly by the  Palomar-Pomerado Health System.  </P> <P> * Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, which says it's putting hospitality  back into hospitals.  </P> <P> * Fallbrook Hospital, the area's smallest, but which has managed to produce its  own baby boom.  </P> <P> As they scramble to attract and serve patients, the hospitals are offering a  variety of new programs and amenities.  </P> <P> If North County's hospitals are becoming more innovative, there is good  motivation, according to George Belch, chairman of the marketing department at  San Diego State University. "Everybody sees that it's the growth area of San  Diego and that the population is somewhat more affluent. Hospitals do strategy  planning and market analysis like any corporation."  </P> <P> Like all large institutions, hospitals can be bruised by bad publicity and can  be aggressive in seeking good community relations. "It's a competitive  environment," said Alain Jourdier, director of communications for the twin  Palomar-Pomerado system.  </P> <P> The marketing budget last year for Palomar-Pomerado was $1.5 million -- which  included money for advertisements, brochures, health fairs and other  promotions. Tri-City Medical Center spent around $400,000. Fallbrook's budget  for marketing was less than $200,000, and Scripps-Encinitas said it spent  $88,000.  </P> <P> Scripps-Encinitas is a private, nonprofit institution, while the other four  North County hospitals are public, meaning they were established by the  community and are governed by boards elected by district residents in much the  same way that school boards are. Local taxes usually provide only a fraction of  a multimillion-dollar annual budget. Patient and insurance revenues, plus  fund-raising monies, provide the balance.  </P> <P> All of the hospitals have either just completed expansions or have blueprints  for growth in the works.  </P> <P> Scripps plans to build a major new medical center in San Marcos. Kaiser  Permanente, which operates clinics in Carlsbad and Escondido, is considering  construction of a 100-bed hospital somewhere between Escondido and Oceanside.  </P> <P> As the hospitals respond to the growing North County population -- one that is,  in general, insured rather than indigent -- they are striving to distinguish  themselves by the quality and quantity of services offered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TRI-CITY MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> 4002 Vista Way, Oceanside  </P> <P> Calls: 724-8411  </P> <P> Beds: 451  </P> <P> Staff: 2,000  </P> <P> Annual admissions: 18,084  </P> <P> A room service program run by the hospital's 700 auxiliary volunteers will  deliver VCRs and videos and even help patients write letters.  </P> <P> Tri-City Medical Center prides itself on providing services like a posh hotel,  according to Jennifer Velez, public relations coordinator.  </P> <P> A room service menu may be used by patients or their guests for hamburgers,  chocolate chip cookies, herbal teas and other snacks. "Haagen-Dazs ice cream  bars and popcorn are most popular," said Velez. "The response has been great  and the auxilians are very busy."  </P> <P> So is the emergency room.  </P> <P> With more than 55,000 visits last year, Tri-City's emergency room was the most  hectic in the entire county. The 451-bed hospital also chalked up 18,084  admissions and delivered between 400 and 450 new babies each month.  </P> <P> Tri-City offers a cancer center, cardiac care that includes an open-heart  surgery unit, a chemical dependency department, a rehabilitation center, a  neonatal intensive care unit, and an alternative birthing center among other  departments.  </P> <P> Tri-City has more than 2,000 doctors, nurses, administrators, technicians and  others on staff. Its yearly payroll is about $87 million.  </P> <P> One of the hospital's more innovative programs is its Day Treatment Center. The  center, in a white clapboard house on Horne Street, is not a hospital setting,  said Mary Wallace, manager of mental health services.  </P> <P> The center is staffed by a psychiatrist, social worker, psychiatric nurse,  occupational therapist and a recreational therapist. It offers comprehensive  counseling and a range of activities for those who have suffered a traumatic  incident, like the death of a spouse, or who are fighting depression, stress or  anxiety, Wallace said.  </P> <P> The hospital also offers Hospice Services, a program designed to allow  terminally ill patients to live out their last months at home, rather than in  the hospital. Hospice provides in-home medical supplies, nursing visits, pain  medication, and arranges to give family members some time away from the house.  Hospice can also arrange help with legal and financial matters as well as grief  and bereavement counseling for the patient and surviving family.  </P> <P> In several departments at Tri-City, dogs are being used to make hospitalization  a less threatening and intimidating experience. The animals, who are  accompanied by their owners, are gentle, obedient and work with patients in the  rehabilitation center, the mental health unit and with Hospice Services.  Eventually dogs will be used in pediatrics, with cancer patients and in other  departments.  </P> <P> Because the hospital is performing more outpatient surgeries, which no longer  require an overnight stay in the hospital, Tri-City offers a free service that  provides rides to and from the hospital. The service is also available for  appointments other than surgery to any patient living in Carlsbad, Oceanside,  San Marcos and Vista.  </P> <P> Expansion plans at Tri-City include a $20-million construction project that  will triple the size of the emergency room by summer. A new central plant to  supply heating, cooling and other technical needs will also be completed at  that time.  </P> <P> Construction plans for 1992 include building a surgery center that will be  twice the size of the present facility; renovating and expanding the women's  center; and building a 200-bed skilled nursing facility.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PALOMAR MEDICAL CENTER  </P> <P> 555 East Valley Parkway, Escondido  </P> <P> Calls: 739-3000  </P> <P> Beds: 341  </P> <P> Staff: About 1,800  </P> <P> Annual admissions: 12,000  </P> <P> Palomar is one of six trauma departments in San Diego County -- it is the only  one in North County.  </P> <P> A trauma department is different -- and more aggressive -- than a simple  emergency room because the facility is always ready to give full immediate  care, and the staff has been specially trained to deal with critical  situations.  </P> <P> "It's crucial that people know there is a trauma center here," said Maureen  Goehring, who directs the trauma department at Palomar.  </P> <P> Victims of automobile and motorcycle accidents, falls and assaults are often  rushed to trauma centers.  </P> <P> Paramedics summoned by 911 to the scene of an accident or other medical crisis  will evaluate a patient based on a "CRAN" score. CRAN stands for circulation,  respiration, abdominal movement and speech. That evaluation helps determine  whether a patient will be sent to a trauma center.  </P> <P> Before trauma centers were introduced to San Diego in 1985, emergency rooms  were the only option. "If a patient was brought in at 9 p.m., you'd get pretty  rapid care. However, if you came in at 3 a.m. and needed immediate surgery, a  ruptured spleen for example, you'd have to get on the phone to find a surgeon  at home and it could take from two to four hours. Patients were literally  dying," said Goehring.  </P> <P> In contrast, patients brought to the trauma center have the support of an  emergency room physician, a trauma surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a control  nurse who supervises and coordinates events and a support nurse. There is also  a staffer called a scribe who takes minute-to-minute notes. In addition, a  neurosurgeon, a respiratory therapist, an X-ray technician, CAT scan  technician, a pharmacist and a social worker are on call in the building.  </P> <P> The trauma centers have reduced the preventable death rate in San Diego County  from 36% to 2%, Goehring said.  </P> <P> Palomar has between 1,000 and 1,200 trauma patients a year.  </P> <P> Goehring said the members of the trauma staff are "adrenaline junkies. This is  work that makes a difference in people's lives."  </P> <P> Palomar Medical Center and Pomerado Hospital together have an annual payroll of  about $80 million.  </P> <P> A recent $50-million expansion program left Palomar with more beds, a larger  emergency room and almost twice as many operating rooms, including open-heart  surgery and spinal surgery facilities.  </P> <P> Palomar's emergency room sees about 36,000 patients a year. The hospital has  12,000 to 15,000 admissions a year to its 341-bed hospital, and had about 3,600  births in 1989.  </P> <P> Its programs include a heart center where the cardiologist works with a  physical therapist, dietitian, social worker and home health nurse as a team.  </P> <P> A birth center has 26 private "birthing suites," rooms with pink flowered bed  spreads and rose-colored curtains designed to provide the comforts of home.  </P> <P> Palomar also has a patient advocate service. Bob Crawford, director of  marketing, said the patient advocate serves as "an ombudsman to interact,  intercede and assure a patient of satisfaction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> POMERADO HOSPITAL  </P> <P> 15615 Pomerado Road, Poway  </P> <P> Calls: 485-6511  </P> <P> Beds: 130  </P> <P> Staff: About 700  </P> <P> Annual admissions: 6,000  </P> <P> There are only private rooms at the 130-bed Pomerado, but patients are billed  at semi-private rates, said Karen Barron of Pomerado Hospital.  </P> <P> "Our size is our advantage," she said. "We provide state-of-the-art equipment  in a very personalized setting."  </P> <P> Among the options available to patients: the Rx Pets program, which allows dog  visits to rooms.  </P> <P> Pomerado Hospital and Palomar Medical Center together have an annual payroll of  about $80 million.  </P> <P> Some 20,000 patients visited Pomerado's emergency room last year. There were  about 6,000 admissions, 34,700 outpatients, and more than 1,600 births.  </P> <P> Villa Pomerado, a 149-bed skilled nursing facility, is attached to the hospital  by a corridor. It serves as a transitional environment for those just released  from the hospital, and it also provides physical, occupational and speech  rehabilitation therapy.  </P> <P> The facility also offers respite care that allows home care-givers to take a  break. A family member who is ill or disabled and needs support care can be  temporarily checked into the facility while the primary care-giver is out of  town or otherwise unable to offer care.  </P> <P> Since September, Villa Pomerado has filled another role.  </P> <P> It is now one of the only places in the county where rape victims receive  treatment from specially trained nurses in a private environment.  </P> <P> Police from all over the county work with Pomerado's sexual assault and  response team, called SART. One room at Villa Pomerado is set aside for rape  patients. "It is a lot less threatening an environment than an emergency room,"  said Barron.  </P> <P> Six of Pomerado Hospital's nurses have been trained in evidence gathering  techniques in sexual assaults. A social worker also is there to help the victim  deal with the emotional trauma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FALLBROOK HOSPITAL  </P> <P> 624 East Elder, Fallbrook  </P> <P> Calls: 728-1191  </P> <P> Beds: 50  </P> <P> Staff: 300  </P> <P> Annual admissions: 3,457  </P> <P> At just 50 beds, Fallbrook Hospital is the smallest in North County.  </P> <P> "The patient is not an account number, but an individual and is treated with  dignity. That's something that comes through," said Don N. Larkin, Fallbrook  Hospital's chief executive officer.  </P> <P> Last year there were 10,793 emergency room patients, 3,457 admissions, 10,904  outpatient visits and 1,161 births.  </P> <P> Fallbrook, which has a high number of births for its size, recently built a new  maternity unit.  </P> <P> In a $1.2-million addition completed last year, four new suites for labor,  delivery and postpartum were added. Included in the project was an operating  room and 12 nursery bassinets.  </P> <P> Fallbrook Hospital's modest size lends it a flexibility that allows it to stay  current, said Denise Stearns, chief marketing officer. As an example, she cited  the pain management center that opened in October.  </P> <P> The program was started by two physicians who received special training in  treating chronic pain.  </P> <P> The center outfits patients who have chronic pain, such as that caused by  cancer, with a tiny pump that is placed under their skin and releases minute  doses of painkiller directly into the spine. The amount of medication needed by  using this method is much reduced and relieves the patient of many side  effects.  </P> <P> The decision to open the center was swift, said Stearns. "It's part of our  mission to have a commitment to innovation. These are times in health care when  you have to be ahead of the game."  </P> <P> Other hospital programs include a diabetes support group, a sports injury  clinic and a cardiac rehabilitation workshop.  </P> <P> The hospital has a staff of 300 and an annual payroll of $7.5 million.  </P> <P> Fallbrook's 400-member auxiliary is active and offers free rides to and from  the hospital and doctors' offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCRIPPS-ENCINITAS  </P> <P> 354 Santa Fe Drive, Encinitas  </P> <P> Calls: 753-6501  </P> <P> Beds: 148  </P> <P> Staff: 400  </P> <P> Annual admissions: 4,000  </P> <P> There is an atrium, mahogany furniture, flowers and open space in the lobby of  Scripps Memorial Hospital-Encinitas. Other physical amenities: a secluded,  comfortably furnished meditation room.  </P> <P> "Look at the root of the word hospital. It comes from hospitality," said C.  Michael Dabney, director of media relations. "Yet, often people have a negative  impression of the idea of a hospital. There's a lingering negative feeling, and  so the more we can make the hospital seem like it's exuding personal care the  better."  </P> <P> Some 4,000 patients checked in to the Scripps Encinitas hospital last year.  About 16,254 were seen in the emergency room, and about 7,000 were treated on  an outpatient basis. The 148-bed hospital has a staff of more than 400 and paid  out some $30 million in wages and benefits last year.  </P> <P> Last January, Scripps completed a $17-million expansion that increased the  number of beds from 93 to 146.  </P> <P> It has a new eight-bed cancer center and 30-bed rehabilitation wing designed  for stroke and head injury recuperation.  </P> <P> A sauna and gymnasium help with physical therapy, and a transitional apartment  is used to allow patients to relearn living skills, such as cooking and  housecleaning.  </P> <P> A further $5-million renovation begun over the summer will increase the surgery  department by two operating suites; increase the number of beds in the  intensive care/cardiac care unit from 8 to 20; and improve facilities in a  number of other departments.  </P> <P> Scripps is also planning to build a major medical complex in San Marcos.  </P> <P> So far, Scripps has purchased 36 acres and intends to purchase about 30 more  before breaking ground on the project next year.  </P> <P> The first stage calls for construction of a clinic and doctors' offices. Later,  construction would start on the hospital itself.  </P> <P> The project will be paced according to the needs of the San Marcos community,  according to Laurence Blagg, executive vice president of Scripps Hospitals.  </P></p>

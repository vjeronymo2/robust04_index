			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA SEALS ITS BORDER, HUNGARY SAYS  </P> <P> Romania has sealed its border with reformist Hungary, Budapest Radio reported  Friday night.  </P> <P> "Information received so far confirms that nowhere along the Hungarian-Romanian  border can the frontier be crossed," the radio said.  </P> <P> The development highlighted Romania's increasing isolation within Eastern  Europe, swept by reformist winds that hard-line Romanian Communist leader  Nicolae Ceausescu is resisting.  </P> <P> Budapest Radio said travelers were being sent back unjustifiably by the  Romanian side at five main crossing points -- Nagylak, Lokoshaza, Kotegyan,  Biharkeresztes and Gyula.  </P> <P> "The Romanians have not informed the Hungarian side about the reason for this,"  the radio said.  </P> <P> It speculated that the sealing of the frontier might be a precaution linked to  a congress of the Romanian Communist Party scheduled for Monday in Bucharest.  </P> <P> There were also reports that the government, bucking a tide of political and  economic reform in the Soviet Bloc, was taking measures to prevent any upheaval  during the five-day party congress.  </P> <P> On the agenda of the congress is approval of a five-year economic plan, as well  as the election of the Central Committee, the Politburo and the party leader.  </P> <P> The Thursday issue of the Communist Party daily Scinteia quoted the 71-year old  Ceausescu, whose 24 years at the helm of Romania make him the longest-serving  Soviet Bloc leader, in comments that presaged the tenor of the congress.  </P> <P> In a blanket condemnation of reforms as violating "the basic principles of  socialism," Ceausescu also accused "reactionary circles" of exploiting  confusion in the Communist camp.  </P> <P> Romanian diplomats in Vienna said Ceausescu is expected to endorse continuation  of the status quo Monday in a keynote speech at the opening of the congress.  </P> <P> Romania, which owed foreign banks and governments $11 billion in 1981, declared  itself debt-free last spring after an accelerated program of producing for  export that left store shelves bare.  </P></p>

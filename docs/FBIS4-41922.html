			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Belorussia [Belarus]: </F> Young Wolves Have Bared Their Teeth"]    [Text] Minsk -- The results of the first round of the  presidential election have put the spotlight on a new trend.  Prestige is gradually gained by people in the Belorussian  [Belarusian] political arena who are unconnected with existing  parties and clans but who are skilled at winning votes from the  electorate with attractive ideas.    On this occasion the idea in question is the struggle  against  corruption. A short while ago the government press attempted to  depict People's Deputy Aleksandr Lukashenka as some Hercules  cleaning out the Augean stables of corruption. But when the  Council of Ministers' ideologists went into reverse, it was  already too late: The former parliamentary commission chairman  remained more or less the only honest person in the minds of the  general public. What is more he is one of them, a man of the  people.    But on his own Lukashenka would hardly have been able to  maintain this essential position. Help came to him from  politicians of the new wave whom former Speaker Stanislaw  Shushkevich once called the "young wolves." The Lukashenka  team's "think tank" comprises Dmitriy Bulakhow, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet Commission for Legislation; Valeriy Tsepkala, a  former adviser to Stanislaw Shushkevich; Viktor Hanchar, deputy  chairman of Maladechna City Soviet Executive Committee; and  several other people whose names are as yet little known to the  public. The unifying force between them is a strong desire to  get their way into power. Their backing for Lukashenka is for  the moment proving to be justified. The "young wolves" have  organized and are running his election campaign in a  professional manner, which cannot be said about the majority of  other teams. Without making any particular effort to win the  votes of relatively small groups in the population, such as the  intelligentsia, they have basically oriented themselves toward  the rural areas and the urban working class. This brought them  success in the first round.    The results of the 23 June poll came as a real shock for the  government team. On Thursday [23 June] evening, journalists who  were trying to get in contact with the Council of Ministers,  discovered that nearly all its staffers who were at work were  heavily under the influence of alcohol. It was in this way that  stress was relieved throughout the weekend, which hardly  promoted a sober assessment of the situation or helped to map  out a future course of action. In the meantime, it seems that  Vyacheslaw Kebich's entourage did everything it could to sink  its own candidate in the first round. [There were] constant  attempts to bribe voters (in one rayon veterans were handed  envelopes with "from Vyacheslaw Kebich" on the outside and money  inside, after which it was suggested that they vote  immediately). The promotion of the prime minister's candidacy  and the vilification of Lukashenka, Poznyak, and Shushkevich  have rebounded. These tricks are no longer tolerated by the  Belorussian public. But Kebich's team proved unable to put  forward anything else at the time.    The democrats' failure is for the most part conditioned by a  lack of unity in its ranks. The tiny parties -- the Belorussian  Social Democratic Assembly [gromada] and the United Democratic  Party of Belorussia [Belarus] -- decided to show everyone that  they are just as good as anybody else, but were unable to come  up with anything better than to nominate Stanislaw Shushkevich  as a candidate. The former speaker flopped.    Once the preliminary results of the poll's first round were  already known, the "Assembly" managed to complain in print about  the Belorussian People's Front which did not support Shushkevich  but nominated its leader Zenon Poznyak as a candidate, who,  incidentally, polled more votes.    Kebich's team will attempt to change the course of the  contest. The 24 hours [of breathing space] promised by  Lukashenka to officials he considers guilty of corruption in  which to "escape to the Himalayas" is not much of a consolation.  Members of the Council of Ministers evidently have no idea of  how in fact they will act. The few who were fit to work on  Friday were hoping that all those who did not vote for the  anticorruption campaigner in the first round would now vote  against Lukashenka and therefore for them. But this scenario  does not seem realistic. Even if events develop very favorably  for Kebich, he will not succeed in closing such an immense gap.  The only chance for his team is to wreck the election's second  round and this will not be simple.    For his part, Lukashenka and his associates will attempt to  build on the success they have already achieved. A strike  against his rivals is not ruled out by way of an extra measure.  According to information in the possession of IZVESTIYA,  Valeriy Tsepkala is at present in Nigeria. His trip there was  preceded by an incident involving the detention of a transport  plane allegedly bound for this African country (though in fact  actually bound for the former Yugoslavia) carrying Belorussian  arms. If Tsepkala returns with serious enough compromising  materials on the Council of Ministers, there can be no doubt  that this information will soon be in the public domain.</p>

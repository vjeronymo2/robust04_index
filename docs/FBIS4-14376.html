			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Abu-Mazin Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> Peace Negotiations Will Produce Independent Entity Linked With  Jordan"]    [Text] Abu Dhabi, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- PLO  Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) expects  developments in the peace process to crystallize into a form of  an independent Palestinian entity linked with Jordan.    Abu-Mazin believes it is necessary to link Palestine with  Jordan, even if full Palestinian independence is obtained  because Jordan represents a basic and natural extension to  Palestine.    He said: If a confederation is agreed with Jordan, it must  be conducted in accordance with the free will of the two sides,  and the confederation should be the outcome of the negotiations.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his visit to Abu  Dhabi, Abu-Mazin said that it has not yet been agreed to hold a  meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He said it is likely that a  meeting will be held directly between Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin and 'Arafat if the Cairo negotiations end this  week. Abu-Mazin expects the final agreement to be signed next  month.    He refused to give a specific date for the signing. He said:  We do not want people to get frustrated if matters are delayed  at the last moment.    Abu-Mazin described Rabin's statements on the settlements as  very encouraging. He said that these statements represent a  change in Rabin's view of the settlements, which began by  differentiating between security and political settlement.    In Amman, in reply to a question put to him by AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT, Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  strongly denied that Crown Prince Hasan's call the day before  yesterday for easing the administrative measures experienced by  the people of the West Bank residing in Jordan carry any  political dimensions. Dr. al-Majali said: "There is no  political dimension for the measures. It is an administrative  matter."</p>

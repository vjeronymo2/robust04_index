			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: MMI MMI, the financial and corp-orate communication company, has announced two acquisitions and increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 473,000 in the year to February 28. Losses last time were Pounds 383,000. It is buying Pelham, the marketing company, and Mediamix, the publishing services company. The consideration is being satisfied by the issue of 9.72m shares, of which all but 1.65m have been conditionally placed at 22.5p. Some 4.22m shares are subject to an open offer to shareholders. MMI's shares were suspended at 25p in May. A further profit-related payment for Pelham to a maximum of Pounds 621,000 is to be paid and a profit-related payment to a maximum of Pounds 1.1m is due to the management of Park Avenue, Pelham's main operating company. The results were affected by a decline in the core BES business where turnover declined to Pounds 396,000 (Pounds 689,000). There were also start up costs and initial trading losses of an offshoot and the settlement of litigation.</p>

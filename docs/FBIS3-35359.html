[Peres] We carried out a difficult task. We had two main  difficulties: one, the matter itself; two, getting to know the  partner. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, I reached the  conclusion that my partner is not what I thought he would be --  for better or for worse. He is absolutely different. At the  same time, I found that the matters under discussion are much  more difficult than we first estimated.    Considering that we reached an agreement without the  pressure  of war or acts of terror, I believe this is a fine achievement.  I am very sober, and I believe we have been negotiating with  ourselves. The Palestinians do not really have much to give us.  We, on the other hand, can free ourselves of the need to rule  another nation, police its life. There is no point to negotiate  otherwise.    This was not a give-and-take negotiating process. It was  more a process of "liberate yourself, and gain your truth."    [Peri] Who exactly signed the agreement for the other side?  Do you believe the PLO indeed represents the Palestinians today?    [Peres] This is a good question. I would like to say  something from my political experience. Sometimes I ask myself  what is a leader. Some say a leader should be strong or  talented. I believe a leader should have one talent: to  represent his people.    I believe that to a large extent Yasir 'Arafat does  represent  the condition of the Palestinian people. I accept him as one,  and I believe that, from his point of view, he is very devoted  to his role. The negotiations, therefore, were held with the  Palestinian people and its representatives.    [Peri] What did you learn about 'Arafat and his associates  during the negotiations?    [Peres] Primarily, I learned how difficult it is for them to  reach decisions. The image that we have that everything is  organized, that clear cut decisions....    [Peri] For example?    [Peres] On almost every issue. I saw their hesitations, I  saw that I was sitting with undecided people. That is, there is  a great difference between their rhetoric and reality. The  rhetoric is unequivocal, while making a decision is a very  complex process, which for them is not at all simple.    It was very hard on them. They hold diversified views. Even  'Arafat had a hard time. In addition, they are really  suspicious and fearful.    [Peri] Do they suspect us or themselves?    [Peres] They suspect us, and they fear their people  reactions.    [Peri] Who matters most to 'Arafat -- those who surround  him or the residents of the territories?    [Peres] What matters to him most are his own views and  hunches. He has to ask himself first of all what the residents  of the territories will accept and what they will reject. And  the answer is not simple. I have noticed that he usually  listens to what others are saying, and he hesitates a lot when  making decisions. That is contrary to all I have ever believed.    [Peri] Those who followed the negotiations could not fail to  notice that people crop up next to 'Arafat, and then they  disappear. We started the negotiations with Abu-Mazin [Mahmud  'Abbas], and yet he was absent at the signing ceremony this week.    [Peres] Theirs is not a state organization. It is a  political organization, a coalition founded on accords and  discords, unlike us, with people being elected to the Knesset  and the government in an orderly fashion.    [Peri] Although only a short time has passed since the  signing, we can guess that criticism will be leveled at 'Arafat  from within the PLO.    [Peres] Criticism is always leveled after each change.  People do not like changes, and this one is very significant.  I think if we failed, God forbid, the disappointment in Israel,  in the PLO, and the entire world would be great and total. We  have in fact coped with extremely complex issues.    [Peri] How did it work? Can you describe the obstacles you  had to overcome before the agreement was signed?    [Peres] I told 'Arafat in our first meeting: You tell your  delegation and I will tell ours to conduct genuine negotiations.  When they feel they are drawing closer to each other, they do  not have to go back to us. When they feel they are drawing  apart, they should avoid reaching an unbridgeable point. It is  better for them to summon us before they become too entrenched  in their stands.    [Peri] How many times were you summoned in the course of the  negotiations?    [Peres] A great many times. The delegates wanted to consult  all the time, but I also had to be in touch with home, with the  prime minister, on the most vital issues. Then the Egyptians  approached me and then the Palestinians. I only intervened in  cases which I feared would become insurmountable obstacles.    I think it is the right time to say a word about our team:  We would not have reached an agreement without them. They did  an excellent job, they worked together as a team.    [Peri] What was the toughest moment in these negotiations?    [Peres] Almost everything was tough. There were a few times  when various issues were raised during one single day, and  almost each one of these issues was dynamite. The last issue --  border crossing control -- was the toughest. This issue was  formulated in two drafts -- an Israeli and a Palestinian -- and  people who read both might have thought there was no way they  could be bridged. And yet we did it.    [Peri] You have said that in this matter we achieved more  than we had hoped.    [Peres] We achieved an unequivocal Palestinian acceptance of  our full responsibility -- security and administration -- for  the crossings. This issue was ambiguous for a long period.    [Peri] Did the difficulty lie in the Palestinian adherence  to symbols expressing their yearning for a state?    [Peres] The Palestinians were unable to distinguish red  lines from imaginary lines. One of our difficulties stemmed  from the fact that many unauthorized Israelis gave the  Palestinians all kinds of messages that should have never been  delivered.    [Peri] Such as?    [Peres] Such as that Israel would give them 140 square  kilometers (instead of 54). They made an invalid promise.    [Peri] Who are these Israelis?    [Peres] I do not want to mention names. These are  unauthorized Israelis who traveled to Tunis and made pilgrimages  to 'Arafat. Who authorized them? I must say, there is a lot of  unwarranted talk in Israel.    [Peri] What else did they promise 'Arafat?    [Peres] Almost everything. They let the Palestinians  understand that if they as much as asked or demanded, they would  get it. I am not acquainted with all of them. I got feedbacks  from the Palestinians. They presented demands based on the  "pledges" they had received.    [Peri] And what was your reply in these cases?    [Peres] I told the truth. I said these people had no  authority.    [Peri] Who exactly is our Palestinian partner?    [Peres] At one point 'Arafat told me: Do you want to turn  me into the head of a small village or al-Nabi Musa's shaykh? I  told him: Don't forget that when Israel was established in 1948  only 650,000 lived there. Today you are the leader of almost  one million Palestinians.    Our main partner is the one million Palestinians living in  Gaza and the Jericho area.    [Peri] What do you think about the fact that not all members  of 'Arafat's entourage plan to reside in the territories?    [Peres] I don't want to deal with the personal aspect. I  think they still do not fully comprehend what has really  happened here. Life in exile, generally speaking, has many  elements of make-believe: It is life in a realm of uniforms,  symbols, words, and declarations. There is no government, no  state, no budget.    [Peri] 'Arafat seems to be a man of symbols, words, and  declarations.    [Peres] He is a survivor. It is an undeniable fact that so  far he has remained the man who represents the Palestinians more  than any other. To date there is nobody as acceptable to them  as 'Arafat.    I did not encounter any problems in negotiating with him.  Contrary to all the rumors, I did not find him to be edgy, but  he is very tense. I have to admit, however, that I found him  different from what I thought. At the same time it has to be  noted that I met him only on certain occasions, during  negotiations, when he has to consider everything carefully and  evince great responsibility. I even felt that he was somewhat  concerned lest he fails to grasp the full meaning of the issues  under discussion. Altogether I did not find it difficult to  conduct negotiations with him.    [Peri] How did you find him different?    [Peres] On the basis of newspaper reports I thought he is a  man who loses his patience and who jumps to conclusions very  quickly.    [Peri] The most important question is what will happen if it  transpires that 'Arafat does not want to or cannot honor the  agreement?    [Peres] The answer is simple: The Israeli public must  decide what kind of relations it wants to have with the  Palestinians, and whether the Palestinians want peace as much as  we do. I believe most of them do. They are tired of war and  terrorism.    I believe the Palestinian people have the same biological  dynamics as all people: They see a world abounding with  opportunities for the younger generation.    This week I visited the Cairo book fair. It was interesting  to discover what people read there: scientific and nonfiction  books. A new, modern era has opened and everybody is trying to  adjust to it.    [Peri] What did we achieve in this agreement?    [Peres] We overcame many difficult problems without  compromising our security, because we made no compromises on  security issues. What we accomplished there can be summed up in  one expression: Anti-Bosnia.    [Peri] In his speech after the signing ceremony 'Arafat  emphasized the economic issue. He is concerned about this.    [Peres] I am happy about this, because this is the issue  about which I spoke with 'Arafat more than anything else. I  told him the test in the territories will mainly be at the  personal-economic level. People in the territories want to know  whether they will finally be able to bring home more than $1,000  a year. This is the ultimate test. I think that a happy  neighbor is a good neighbor, whereas a dejected neighbor is a  bad neighbor.    [Peri] What will happen if their economic expectations are  not met?    [Peres] I don't see any reason why it shouldn't succeed. We  too have to help, and there is also a lot of international  goodwill in this issue. Besides, judging by the critics of the  agreement you would think our present situation in Gaza is  excellent. We must remember that our starting point is not all  that good. We will always be able to preserve what we have now.    [Peri] Could you dispel the fog surrounding the  negotiations? Who actually led them on their side?    [Peres] 'Arafat, no doubt about it. He listened, he was not  always knowledgeable about the issue at hand, but he was the  leader. No decision was made without him, and he occasionally  caused problems.    The man is a symbol. He is not coming to the territories  with psychological baggage. He kept the Palestinian cause in  the international and Arab public eye for 25 years.    [Peri] And this agreement places him on the way to a  Palestinian state.    [Peres] They want a Palestinian state, but there is no  mention of it in the agreement. In the official meeting between  myself and 'Arafat in Davos, in the presence of our delegation,  he said: You think I do not know the difference between  autonomy and a state, but I would like to tell you that I do. I  realize we are not talking about a state, and we would rather  have a confederation with Jordan.    This statement is also binding on Hawatimah and Jibril. I do  not think 'Arafat was saying that in confidence. He did not  need to convince my five aides.    [Peri] Is the fact that there is no Palestinian state on the  way supposed to appease us?    [Peres] No, such a possibility has not been eliminated.  Moreover, there is no such thing as appeasing situations. Life  is dynamic, and whatever is said today could change tomorrow.    [Peri] What will happen on 13 April?    [Peres] According to the agreement, we must effect the  withdrawal four months after the signing of the agreement. We  are not committed to 13 April. At the same time, I believe we  will all make a genuine effort to meet the tight schedule. Our  people, too, want to be sure we made a feasible agreement.    [Peri] How did you communicate with the prime minister  during the negotiations?    [Peres] We coordinated our positions and held consultations  throughout. Our consultations were matter-of-fact. The fact is  that he ultimately approved the agreement.    [Peri] It has been three nights you have not slept because  of the negotiations. You have actually been doing the dirty  work.    [Peres] That does not matter to me. If the life of one  child is spared as a result of my work, it is all worth to me.  I know exactly what my position is. Nobody can take away from  me what I have done in my life, neither the mistakes nor the  successes. Nobody can add to or detract from them. I know  exactly where I stand.    [Peri] You did hard and ungrateful work to achieve this  agreement.    [Peres] I do not think important achievements can be  attained without hard work. There are no miracles.    [Peri] What sort of nation will we be after the agreement?    [Peres] We will be free of something we could not continue  to endure: ruling over another nation in a very narrow strip of  land currently inhabited by over 4 million Jews and 3 million  non-Jews. Such a situation can easily turn into a tragedy if  there are no statesmen who can exactly envision the dangers and  risks.    Besides, I truly believe we are en route to the 21st  century,  in which the sources of power and wealth will not be measured in  material dimensions but in spiritual and intellectual ones.    [Peri] Could you describe for us a specific moment  symbolizing the entire negotiating process?    [Peres] We were arguing about the criteria to be applied in  the border crossings, whether a man who was a terrorist would be  allowed in. 'Arafat said: If that is the case, I will not be  allowed to cross. I told him: Do not brag. You used to be a  terrorist. Today you are an ex-terrorist.    At first he was taken aback, but then he realized what I  meant. I told him: We are not the only ones who changed their  attitude toward you. You also changed.</p>

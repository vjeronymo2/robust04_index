Experts were instructed last night to finalize the final  document on a cease-fire and disengagement of the sides as the  first stage in the settlement of the Karabakh conflict and  prepare it for signing.    However, according to reports from Stepanakert today, the  Azerbaijani Army, despite yesterday's accord on a cease-fire  effective 0000 on 17 May, fired mortars on Karabakh positions  north of Mardakertskiy Rayon and on the Agdam-Askeran stretch.

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Growth in executive earnings slows A FURTHER slowing of executives' pay rises is shown by the latest quarterly index calculated for the Financial Times by the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. Although the overall rate of increase for the 12 months ending tomorrow remains above inflation at 7 per cent, it compares with 8.1 per cent for the 12 months to June 30. The increase between October 1990 and September last year was 12.5 per cent. The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses. The figures for the latest quarter are based on a survey of 5,364 executives in 421 widely varied businesses. Among the different categories of managers, the biggest rise over the past 12 months went to chief executives of companies with more than Pounds 600m in sales turnover. They continued to pull ahead of their counterparts with an increase of 8 per cent on average to a total package of Pounds 247,453. The average total across all ranks of executives is now Pounds 79,889, of which 71.8 per cent is made up of salary. Company cars and pension entitlements each make up a further 10.5 per cent, bonuses 5.7 per cent, and other benefits 1.5 per cent.

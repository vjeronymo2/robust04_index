He further stated that this notion is reminiscent of a  return  to the old Soviet structure. "Azerbaijan is an independent state  and I support complete independence of Azerbaijan and I believe  that having joined the CIS, the republic's sovereignty has not  been defied,"said Gasanov.    In addition, Gasanov said that he does not exclude the  possibility that Nazarbayev's proposal could have been  misrepresented in the media, "Azerbaijan's official position in  regard to the Eurasian notion can be put forth only after we  have seen and reviewed Nazarbayev's proposal and idea."    As to whether the Russian army would return to Azerbaijan,  Gasanov noted that "this decision may be solved only by the  Parliament of Azerbaijan". According to Gasanov, "any  politician who will deal with matters, alone, must be answerable  to the people, constitution and the Parliament."</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Disputed rights Publication of the OFT-sponsored report by Mr Paul Marsh, of the London Business School, on underwriting commissions will set the cat among the City pigeons. The report concludes that the fixed 2 per cent commission paid to underwriters is unjustified. Certain institutions have been anxious to see the document suppressed, a sure indication that it should be published as soon as possible, together with the responses of merchant banks and other interested parties. The mechanics of raising equity in the UK look inflexible when compared with practice in the US. There, corporations are not obliged to offer new shares to existing shareholders and can therefore gauge the level of potential demand before setting the price of new shares. Large amounts of cash can be raised by such book-building exercises in days, rather than the three weeks required for a UK issue. Fees in the US are higher than in the UK, but the new shares can be issued at negligible discounts to existing share prices. That compares with a 15 to 20 per cent discount in the UK, which reflects the inherent market risks. Arguably the cost of capital is higher as a result. A change to the existing UK system would be difficult in the light of pre-emption rights. But these need not be sacrosanct, nor indeed should they be an issue if the shares can be offered at, or close to, the market price. Merchant banks should become more imaginative in finding ways of circumventing the discount, rather than seeking to smother the Marsh report. But traditional merchant banks, without the capital base or the distribution capacity of large integrated houses, have a great deal to lose if the existing system is changed.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (14): Higher premiums curb 'hot hatch' sales - Insurance A YEAR ago, insurance companies dropped a bombshell which wreaked havoc in the performance car market. A GTi was the car to be seen in during the prosperous late 1980s, but cheap power in the wrong hands led to an unprecedented spate of accident claims. The situation for insurers was exacerbated by car theft raging out of control. By 1992, insurance companies had had enough and used the introduction of the Association of British Insurers' new 20-group insurance system to raise premiums for performance cars and introduce draconian restrictions in providing quotes for high-risk drivers and people living in high-risk areas. This, combined with recession, pushed sales of some performance cars into a nose-dive. Particularly hard hit were the cheaper 'hot hatch' cars. New car sales in this market almost halved in 1992, compared with 1991, mostly owing to prohibitive insurance costs. But sales of expensive performance cars have not suffered as badly. People buying such cars as Ferraris, top-range Jaguars and Mazda RX-7s are older and prepared to pay the higher insurance premium. Mr Robin Foster-Taylor, insurance broker of F Rauch, says the insurance companies are to blame for making performance car insurance too cheap and easily obtainable during the late 1980s. He says: 'For several years, premiums were unrealistically low as insurance companies fought for market share. By charging low premiums, insurers encouraged people to buy performance cars and claims were intolerably high. Premiums charged now reflect the true cost of performance car insurance.' It costs between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 3,000 with a full no-claims discount to comprehensively insure the Ford Sierra Cosworth, a favourite target for car thieves. But sales continue at a lower level as people find cheaper ways to get their performance kicks. Typically, on a Cosworth private buyers will fit an immobiliser and alarm and opt for third party insurance at Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000. The biggest buyers are company car drivers whose insurance company will turn a blind eye to the occasional performance car slipped into a fleet policy of more than 30 cars. What has happened, says Mr Foster-Taylor, is that the buyer profile has changed. 'There are fewer inquiries from 21- to 24-year-olds and the buying age for performance cars has increased to 30- and 40-year-olds.' He adds that the worst is not over, as the cost of insurance has gone up enormously in the past 12 months, with three to four premium increases a year. 'You're looking at premium increases of at least 15 per cent and in some cases some 30 to 40 per cent for GTis. Premiums will continue to affect the market for some time to come.' Yet the impact on sales is selective, with a clear distinction between affordable boy-racer-type cars and up-market performance cars. This is highlighted by the contrast between Mazda and Ford. Ford says its XR3i represented between 10 and 12 per cent of Escort sales. This has now been reduced to 5 per cent. Mazda claims its RX-7, an out-and-out sports car, has not been affected at all by insurance costs: 'This car is sold in limited numbers and is bought as a conscious decision by buyers who are prepared to pay the extra premiums.' Peugeot's 205 GTi is another example of the cheaper hot hatch victim. The company says that GTis have fallen from 15 per cent of 205 sales to 8 per cent. 'Increased premiums had a considerable impact on 205 GTi sales, but we expect the market will stabilise as manufactures take over some insurance,' says Peugeot. Porsche in Britain has seen profits fall hard, with sales of 944s dropping from 1,612 in 1991 to 945 in 1992, but the company says this is mostly as a result of the recession. 'Premiums for our cars were high anyway, but we knew we were going to be hit badly with the 20-group system and prepared for it. As a result of premiums going up, we relaunched our own Porsche insurance which offers favourable rates to Porsche owners, with premiums set for three years. Many customers have taken this up,' said a Porsche representative. Volkswagen says its buyer profile has changed, particularly with its introduction of a V6 engine, to older people who want bigger car refinement but in a smaller car than a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. 'GTi sales have fallen slightly, as people wait for the new 16-valve model, but there's been no noticeable reduction in sales of other performance cars such as the Corrado, Passat and Vento with 16-valve and V6 engines.' Audi also seems to have come through the insurance shake-up relatively unscathed. A representative says: 'With our 80 range, we are selling as many 16-valves as diesels. The typical profile of an 80 buyer is professional, male, married, 35 to 39, household income of over Pounds 30,000 and more comfortable in terms of insurance. 'The Audi 100 buyer is more mature still, with most having built up no-claims discount. Being in a lower risk group means insurance is not such an issue.' The company sold more than 100 of its 150mph S4 models last year and is launching an S2 performance version of the 80 estate. Many performance car manufactures are hitting back with 'in-house' insurance schemes which guarantee a quote and deliver insurance as part of a complete sales package. The fitting of car alarms and immobilisers is widespread. The makers are also considering refining their performance cars and making them less obviously sporty, in an attempt to regain lost sales. As a Ford representative points out, the market is far from dead: 'The performance market has been reduced but it is still alive. It's just the way things are done that has to be a little different now.'</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buoyant exports lift Rotork STRONG SALES to UK water companies and the world oil industry led to double digit profits growth at Rotork, the designer and assembler of valve activators and associated electronic control systems, in 1992. Annual pre-tax profits increased by 10.5 per cent from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 10.5m. At the interim stage, profits increased 11 per cent to Pounds 4.84m. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said that while many smaller UK companies were affected by recession, Rotork had benefited from buoyant export orders. 'We're picking up business from all around the world,' he said. Turnover increased 11 per cent from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 57.1m. Rotork Actuation, the valve division which accounts for more than 80 per cent of sales, performed well. Order levels improved 'appreciably' from a year ago, with especially strong growth in the final quarter. The much smaller analysis division, which supplies air monitoring equipment, made a small operating profit after losses in the previous year. However, the division's sales are likely to remain subdued until stricter environmental rules on pollution are in force. Earnings increased 10 per cent to 22.69p (20.66p) per share. The recommended final dividend of 6.5p makes a total of 11.15p (10p). Rotork's shares, which have performed strongly since 1991, added a further 3p to 448p yesterday, compared to their 12-month low of 258p. Because of the share price rise, and in order to improve the liquidity of the shares, the directors are proposing a 1-for-1 one share split, immediately followed by a 1-for-2 capitalisation issue. This will increase the issued share capital from 28.9m to 86.7m shares.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIPARTISAN CONTRA AID PLAN UNVEILED BY BUSH  </P> <P> President Bush today unveiled a bipartisan Contra aid plan as the first plank  of his emerging foreign policy, outlining a $4.5-million-per-month program that  commits his Administration to support Central American peace efforts.  </P> <P> The agreement for the first time offers money to the Nicaraguan rebels that can  be used to resettle in their homeland and rejoin political life there, and  breaks a long partisan stalemate over U.S. policy toward the region.  </P> <P> "Does it mean an end to the war? Let's hope so," said Secretary of State James  A. Baker III, a chief architect of the accord. Bush said, "The burden of proof  is on the Sandinista government to comply" with democratization promises made  to their neighbors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'One Voice'  </P> <P> With congressional leaders of both parties at his side, Bush said, "We will be  speaking with one voice," striking a sharp contrast to what was perhaps the  most divisive issue of the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> The agreement provides for the continuation of non-lethal humanitarian aid  through February, 1990, the date set for elections in Nicaragua. Baker said it  would amount to $4.5 million a month for 10 months.  </P> <P> "With regard to Nicaragua, the United States is united in its goals:  democratization, an end to subversion and destabilization of its neighbors, an  end to Soviet Bloc military ties that threaten U.S. and regional security," the  agreement said.  </P> <P> It noted that under existing agreements among the five Central American  countries -- Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala --  "insurgent forces are supposed to voluntarily reintegrate into their homeland  under safe, democratic conditions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relocation Aid  </P> <P> The money provided under the agreement is expected to be approved by Congress  soon after it returns from its Easter break next month, can be used for  voluntary relocation aid, the agreement stated. Only the money, not the policy  statement, needs congressional approval.  </P></p>

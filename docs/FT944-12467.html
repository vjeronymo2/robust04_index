			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Sterling gains ground on interest rate speculation Sterling rose on the markets yesterday as speculation about an increase in interest rates intensified, writes Philip Gawith. The trade weighted sterling index finished at 81, its highest level since the beginning of March, but still below a peak for the year of around 83 reached in January. The pound ended in London at DM2.4583 against the D-Mark, from DM2.4505, and at Dollars 1.6306, from Dollars 1.6235, against the dollar. Attention today will focus on the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, and the inflation report, whose publication will provide the background to tomorrow's monetary meeting. Market activity was generally quiet yesterday, and this will continue today with a number of European markets closed for All Saints Day. The dollar had a fairly quiet day, the market showing little inclination to build on Friday's rally. It closed at DM1.5077 from DM1.5094 and at Y96.95 from Y97.335. It ended in New York at DM1.5033 and Y96.90. The D-Mark had a quiet session in Europe. The Swedish krona eased to SKr4.780/DM from SKr4.759 following an announcement from Moody's, the rating agency, that it would be reviewing the status of Sweden's sovereign debt. Speculation about higher UK rates was fuelled by the October M0 money supply figure, which rose by 7.3 per cent year-on-year. This was higher than market expectations, well above the monitoring range of zero to 4 per cent, and the fastest annual rate of growth since January 1989. To some extent, though, market expectations of higher rates possibly being sanctioned at the monthly meeting also reflect a newfound credibility in UK monetary policy. Underlying inflation, at 2 per cent in September, is at its lowest for 27 years. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, commented: 'The Bank of England has managed to build credibility so that the market now believes the government is inclined to act pre-emptively. There is a belief that the monetary regime has now changed. The UK is now acting more like a European country.' The December short sterling contract closed at 93.50 yesterday, showing that the market expects UK interest rates to rise to 6.5 per cent by the end of the year. Three-month LIBOR is currently at 6 1/16 per cent, up from 6 per cent. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said the firmer cash rates reflected both a month-end squeeze, and press speculation about the prospect of higher rates. 'There has been a shift in sentiment from the possibility to the proba-bility of a rise in rates.' While most economists are now predicting a further rise in rates by the end of the year, it is still only a minority who are expecting this to follow in the immediate aftermath of tomorrow's monetary meeting. Many analysts argue that, with the chancellor probably undecided about the extent of tax changes in this month's budget, it would be wise to leave any monetary policy changes until the December meeting. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, last week lent some support to those arguing against a precipitate move. He said bond markets were exaggerating the inflationary threat. In a speech in Birmingham, he added: 'There are relatively few immediate signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly.' Contributing to the governor's optimism about the inflation outlook will have been sterling's recent strength, putting downward pressure on imported inflation. The trade weighted index has risen from a low of around 78, in mid-August, to 81 now. On the other hand, the possibility that market expectations might hasten the next rate increase was highlighted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, during the September monthly meeting. He said: 'Financial markets were expecting interest rates to be raised sooner rather than later. If those expectations were not realised, the markets could become more volatile and the eventual rise in rates might need to be larger.' Although the timing of a rise in rates is in dispute, there is a measure of agreement that the likely trajectory of UK rates will be gradually upwards, rather than sharply, as often in the past. Mr Persaud said the good behaviour of the current account, and inflation, during the present recovery 'would allow rates to peak at a much lower level than before'. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.321bn assistance, including Pounds 355m of late support, after forecasting a Pounds 1.4bn daily shortage.</p>

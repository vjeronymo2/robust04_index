			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Optimistic global view amid interest rate warning for US THE International Monetary Fund is optimistic that the world economy will begin to recover this year, and believes that the US should move cautiously when considering interest rate cuts. Introducing the IMF's latest twice-yearly Economic Outlook, Mr Jacob Frenkel, director of the fund's research department, said the IMF was adopting a 'somewhat positive' tone with regard to the global economic outlook, despite a clear deterioration in near-term prospects since its last report in October. The IMF projects a recovery in the growth of the global economy to 2.9 per cent next year, from an anticipated 1.2 per cent this year. Its projection envisages a strong bounce back in US growth to 2.7 per cent next year, from just 0.2 per cent this year, and a sharp recovery in developing country growth to 3.4 per cent in 1992 from 0.8 per cent this year. Mr Frenkel said now was not the time for the US Federal Reserve to pursue an active monetary policy. If the US economy grew as projected, the Fed, when considering its interest rate policy, should 'weigh very cautiously' the balance between the short-term weakness of the economy and the medium-term strategy for fighting inflation. The Fed should not resist market forces, he said. The only circumstance in which rates could be cut would be if US economic developments turned out to be weaker than projected. At a time when Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury Secretary, has been calling for lower US interest rates and putting pressure on Germany to cut its rates, IMF officials are concerned that an unwarranted cut in US rates now could lead to too steep a recovery six to nine months hence. Underpinning this concern is confidence that the world economy may be nearing the bottom of the trough. The IMF bases its relatively optimistic view of the world on the continuation of relatively strong economic growth in Japan, Germany and elsewhere in continental Europe. The current level of US interest rates is also expected to revive demand for consumer durables. Mr Frenkel pointed out that the federal funds rate, at which banks lend reserves to each other, has fallen about four percentage points to about 6 per cent from its most recent peak.</p>

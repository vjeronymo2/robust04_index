			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> K. Section 1.141&hyph;12&blank;Special rules for qualified bonds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations provide certain limited guidance for purposes of applying the provisions of section 141(e), relating to qualified private activity bonds (private activity bonds that qualify as tax-exempt bonds). Thus, generally, continued compliance throughout the term of the issue is required for bonds to be qualified bonds. The proposed regulations provide, however, that certain of the remedial actions under proposed &sect;1.141&hyph;13 apply for this purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> L. Section 1.141&hyph;13&blank;Deliberate actions and related remedial actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Remedial actions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Although a post-issuance deliberate action by an issuer may cause bonds to be private activity bonds, the proposed regulations provide a number of remedial actions that will prevent bonds from ceasing to be tax-exempt bonds. In order to be eligible for these remedial actions the issue must satisfy certain conditions. First, the issuer must covenant in the bond documents that it will not take any action that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds, and must establish reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with this covenant. Second, the terms of any agreement that would cause the bonds to be private activity bonds must be arm's-length. Third, as under the arbitrage regulations, the issuer must certify its expectations as of the issue date regarding the amount and use of the proceeds. If, however, the possibility that a deliberate action would be taken is not remote as of the issue date, remedial actions are generally not available unless the bonds provide for redemption within 6 months of the deliberate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Permitted remedial actions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The proposed regulations contain several remedial actions that are available in the event of a deliberate action. First, the issuer can redeem or defease the nonqualifying bonds. Second, the issuer is permitted to use the amounts received on the disposition of a facility for a use that would qualify for tax-exempt financing as qualified 501(c)(3) bonds. Similarly, in certain circumstances, if the transferred facility would itself continue to be eligible for tax-exempt bond financing, that use is treated as a qualifying remedial actions. For this purpose, in applying section 55 through 59, 141 through 147, 149, and 150, the bonds are treated as reissued on the date of the deliberate action. Treasury and the Service are considering alternative ways in which the requirements of section 55 through 59 could be satisfied for this purpose (for example, a closing agreement with the issuer similar to the one described below). These rules are based on, but are more flexible than, the safe harbors in Rev. Porc. 93&hyph;17. For example, qualifying alternative uses of the financed facility would include uses under section 142. Finally, the proposed regulations provide the Commissioner with the authority to provide additional remedial actions by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consideration of alternative remedial action <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Defeasing bonds generally results in an issuer foregoing much of the ongoing benefit provided by tax-exempt financing. In lieu of providing for defeasing as a remedial action, a more direct remedial action is being considered. Treasury and the Service are considering the issuance of a revenue procedure pursuant to which an issuer may request a closing agreement with respect to outstanding bonds. Under the closing agreement, the issuer would make a payment to the Service to prevent the interest on bonds from being includable in gross income of bondholders as a result of a deliberate action that results in satisfaction of the private activity bond test. Generally, the closing agreement would be conditioned upon satisfying the requirements of &sect;1.141&hyph;13(a) (relating to conditions for remedial action). If this procedure is adopted, defeasance of bonds would no longer be a permissible remedial action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The issuer would be required to make the payment within 30 days of the execution of the closing agreement. The amount of the payment would equal the present value of the interest rate differential (as described below) multiplied by the amount of nonqualified bonds that will be outstanding for each annual period (or shorter period) subject to the closing agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interest rate differential would equal an appropriate factor multiplied by the difference between the applicable federal rate under section 1274(d) (the applicable taxable rate) and the applicable federal rate under section 1288(b) (the applicable tax-exempt rate). The factor would reflect that the applicable taxable rate is based on obligations of the United States. The rates used would be those in effect on the date the deliberate action occurs. Each rate (that is, the short-term, mid-term, or long-term rate) would be based on the remaining weighted average maturity of the nonqualified bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

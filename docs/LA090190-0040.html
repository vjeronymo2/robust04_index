			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FIRE IN HOUSE PROMPTS PROBE BY THE STATE  </P> <P> State investigators on Friday were trying to determine whether a Pasadena house  involved in a fire had been used to illegally house as many as 20  developmentally disabled people. But Tina Castillo, 28, a resident of the  two-story Summit Avenue house, said the only other occupants are nine members  of her family.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the Thursday fire, which investigators say started when a  pesticide room-fogger ignited after being placed too close to the kitchen  stove. Firefighters evacuated up to 20 people, described in a Fire Department  report as developmentally disabled, Battalion Chief Joe Milligan said.  </P> <P> But Steve Thurston of the Pasadena Police Department said Friday that, "in the  heat of what happened," calling them developmentally disabled was probably just  "a bad choice of words."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, investigators with the state Department of Social Services say  they are following up on a complaint that Castillo and others housed disabled  adults at the house.  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / IMF hopes for Russian entry deal by April LEADING western countries and the International Monetary Fund would like to see an agreement as early as April to admit Russia to the IMF, clearing the way for substantial western support for comprehensive market reforms, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. After initial doubts over how to respond to Russia's requests for massive western financial aid, it is understood that the fund's political decision-making body, the interim committee, is likely to approve Russian membership when it meets in April. The committee is made up of the finance ministers of 22 countries, including the richest western countries. Formalities for entry would then take several more months to complete. IMF membership will give Russia access to IMF funds to support economic reforms agreed with the fund. It also traditionally unlocks other sources of western finance. An IMF mission is now in Moscow for talks on the course of market reforms. It is also collecting the economic data necessary to complete Russia's application. The fund would also like to admit other former Soviet republics such as Ukraine and the Baltic states simultaneously. Apart from political concerns, it will be easier to work out their individual quotas - or rank in the IMF pecking order - through one exchange rate, while they are all still using the rouble as their common currency. The issue of IMF membership may next be raised as early as this weekend when Group of Seven finance ministers are expected to meet in New York.</p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES TO MOVE BENES UP TO TRIPLE-A LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> Pitcher Andy Benes, the Padres' No. 1 pick in the 1988 June free-agent draft,  took a big step toward the major leagues Wednesday when the club decided to  promote him from double-A Wichita to their triple-A club in Las Vegas after he  makes his next start Saturday.  </P> <P> Benes (8-4, 1.93 ERA) is fully recovered from the right shoulder tendinitis  that plagued him recently, the Padres say, and is scheduled to make his first  start for Las Vegas next Wednesday against the Edmonton Trappers in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Padre Manager Jack McKeon, who has scheduled a workout for his team Wednesday  morning, said he likely will fly to Las Vegas that afternoon to assess Benes'  progress.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see the kid," McKeon said. "Who knows, he could be up here sooner  than people think."  </P> <P> Benes opened the season with a 7-1 record and 1.00 ERA for Wichita before  developing stiffness in his shoulder. He lost two consecutive games and was  placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 7.  </P> <P> Benes won his first game back, yielding five hits and two runs in five innings.  And after his most recent start, in which he gave up five hits in eight innings  in a 2-1 loss, the Padres decided he was ready for triple A.  </P> <P> Benes, 6-feet-6, 235 pounds, has allowed 68 hits and 28 runs (22 earned) in 102  1/3 innings, striking out 109 with 37 walks. He opened the season by winning  his first four games and seven of his first eight decisions. BOB NIGHTENGALE  </P></p>

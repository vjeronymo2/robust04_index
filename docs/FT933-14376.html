			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data boost equity market A NUMBER of programme trades, said to have been weighted to the buy side, plus some highly encouraging economic data and another resolute opening performance by Wall Street, helped London's equity market regain its composure yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index ended a net 6.2 up at 2,837.1, while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index did little more than mark time, closing only 1.4 firmer at 3,230.0. But the view around some of the City's dealing desks was that yesterday's performance may well have been no more than a technical bounce, after the near 70-point fall since the start of the month, and that the market's rally might well be followed by a more severe sell-off. Wall Street's steady showing on Monday saw London off to a bright start with the FT-SE 100 opening almost two points higher, and after a brief flurry of selling pressure which took the Footsie down to a net decline of 3.4 at one point, it traded in positive territory for the rest of the day. Sentiment was given a strong boost in mid-morning by news that industrial prod-uction during May had risen by 2 per cent, month on month, compared with market expectations of an increase in the region of 0.5 per cent, and 3.9 per cent on the year. 'The 2 per cent rise is a big number and shows that the recovery is in place,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Panmure Gordon, the stockbroker. He added that the market was now getting keyed up for today's inflation figures for June and tomorrow's unemployment numbers. After a brief period of reflection on the output numbers, the market gradually moved up a gear, with dealers reporting an increased willingness by the big institutions to get involved in the market. 'After the news, it felt much better and the institutions were happy to sort out some of their positions,' noted one marketmaker. Another view in the market was that the output figures, which were seen as confirming the economic recovery, could well have reduced the chances of a cut in UK interest rates in the short term, a view reinforced by sterling's show of strength late in the session. Turnover, which struggled at minimal levels during the early part of the day, picked up as the session drew to a close, finishing at 592.4m shares. This was well up from Monday's 448.1m shares which, as brokers gloomily reported, provided customer business worth only Pounds 796.2m. The value of daily retail business, commonly above the Pounds 1bn mark since the second half of last year, has contracted sharply in the last two weeks. The value of customer business dropped below Pounds 1bn on two days last week and threatens to do so this week. Next Monday will see a dramatic transformation in customer turnover, however, with trading in BT3 certain to give activity levels a very strong boost. BT was among the more active stocks yesterday and continued to underperform the market as bearish circulars from two broking houses, Kleinwort Benson and Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, continued to unsettle nerves. There was no nervousness surrounding shares in SG Warburg, which raced higher on the prospect of hefty fees and commission income generated by the merchant bank's handling of the BT3 flotation.</p>

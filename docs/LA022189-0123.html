			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EPA WANTS TO FINE 109 REPAIR SHOPS  </P> <P> The Environmental Protection Agency proposed fines of more than $1 million  against 109 muffler and car repair shops today for installing improper  emission-control devices on automobiles.  </P> <P> The EPA said the shops installed cheaper, less effective "two-way" catalytic  converters on automobiles rather than the "three-way" converters required under  federal laws to reduce air pollution.  </P> <P> The three-way converters control nitrogen oxide emissions in addition to  hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in car exhaust. The two-way converters do not  adequately control nitrogen oxides, the EPA said.  </P></p>

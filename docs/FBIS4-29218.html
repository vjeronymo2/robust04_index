			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Seoul correspondent Yasunobu Shirouchi; first in </F> a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected  Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the  International Community"; "The North's Strategy: North Korea  Aims To Improve Ties With the U.S. as a Trump Card for Survival"]    [Text] Commenting on the second round of the U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks held last July, North Korean Premier Kang  Song-san remarked: "The joint statement issued by North Korea  and the United States at the end of the talks is a historical  event ending 40 years of hostile relations between the two  countries and laying the groundwork for resolving the nuclear  issue."    In March last year, North Korea announced that it would quit  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). North Korea has  since used its "nuclear card" to force the United States to hold  a dialogue with it and push the international community around  while holding up its actual withdrawal from the NPT.    The Korean peninsula has been a zone where superpower  interests have clashed. The Koreans have a history of the  superpowers defying their will and their nation's existence was  denied. They have a deep-rooted desire to get neighboring  superpowers to pay attention to the Korean peninsula and get  them to listen to what they advocate.    North Korea aims to have U.S. Forces withdrawn from South  Korea. President Kim Il-song's basic perception is that South  Korea is occupied by U.S. Forces. The president has  consistently asserted that the only way to end the division on  the Korean peninsula is to make direct deals with the United  States. In that sense, the "nuclear" is his most effective  trump card.    Kang In-tok, head of the Far East Affairs Research Institute  in Seoul, South Korea, who is well versed with North Korean  affairs, has said: "For North Korea, the nuclear issue is a  'strategy for survival'." North Korea is said to be suffering  serious economic stagnation and if the present situation  continues, it would be hard for North Korea to keep its present  system in place. Kang also has explained that North Korea  intends to use the "nuclear card" to receive economic aid from  the United States after normalizing relations with the United  States and obtain a U.S. guarantee for the maintenance of its  system.    Many North Korea watchers in Seoul have pointed out that  "North Korea is serious about developing nuclear weapons."  Their common analysis is that North Korea aims to 1) reverse  its inferiority in conventional war capability over South Korea;  2) tighten the grip on its system that is being shaken by food  shortages; and, 3) spurn outside pressure.    North Korea recently removed fuel rods at an experimental  atomic reactor in defiance of the International Atomic Energy  Agency's [IAEA] demand for halting their removal at the expense  of the third round of the U.S.-North Korea high-level talks. A  diplomatic source in Seoul has said: "North Korea did so  because it was intent on developing nuclear weapons."    Yun Tok-min, a professor at the South Korean Foreign  Ministry  Diplomacy and Security Research Institute, has analyzed: "North  Korea abruptly strained the situation on the Korean peninsula in  an attempt to "make the United States acknowledge the  inevitability of allowing North Korea to have one or two atomic  bombs." He also has said North Korea might believe that the  Clinton administration would give in to its threats.    The North Korean Foreign Ministry abruptly announced North  Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dealing a sharp  body blow to brisk moves toward slapping sanctions against North  Korea. The announcement did not use the term "North Korea's  withdrawal from the NPT" and the announcement is taken as part  of North Korea's operations aimed at holding talks with the  United States.    The prevailing view is that "at present, the top priority  task for North Korea is to prepare for a succession from  President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il and the  possibility is slim that North Korea will opt for war, which  could result in its collapse" (says a Seoul-based expert on  North Korea). Some experts on North Korea take the view that if  economic sanctions are imposed against North Korea, North Korea  would make some concessions for fear that the sanctions may deal  it a fatal blow.    Will North Korea aim to normalize relations with the United  States without giving up its nuclear program? If the Kim  Il-song regime aims to achieve these two incompatible goals, it  would further deepen its international isolation.</p>

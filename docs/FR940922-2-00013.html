			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 12 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that, in its calculation of respondent's COP of kiwifruit sold in Japan, the Department failed to include: 1) NZKMB's G&amp;A and interest expenses, 2) certain elements of third-country packing cost, which the Department included in the net prices compared to COP, and 3) the New Zealand coolstore cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent contests petitioners' position and maintains that the figures used by the Department include NZKMB's G&amp;A and interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners that NZKMB's G&amp;A and interest expenses should be included in the COP. However, these expenses are already included in the cost of production, therefore, we have made no further adjustment for these expenses in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners argument concerning inconsistencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding third-country packing cost in our COP analysis. Therefore, in the final results, we have excluded certain elements of third-country packing cost from the net prices for COP comparison purposes. Lastly, we agree with petitioners that the New Zealand coolstore cost should be included in the COP because these costs were included in net prices. Since this coolstore expense is a part of NZKMB's G&amp;A expense, however, it is already a factor in our analysis. Therefore, we made no further adjustment for this expense in our COP analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 13 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that the Department omitted NZKMB's G&amp;A expenses from the CV calculation it used in exporter's sales price (ESP) comparisons. Petitioners note that the Department included these expenses in its CV calculations for purchase price (PP) comparisons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent agrees with petitioners that NZKMB's G&amp;A expenses should be included in CV calculations for the purposes of PP and ESP comparisons. Respondent, however, disagrees with petitioners about the amount that should be included because, according to respondents, the figure suggested by petitioners includes both G&amp;A and interest expenses. Respondent urges the Department to use a figure in its CV calculations which reflects only G&amp;A expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners. Because of a clerical error, the Department did not add NZKMB's G&amp;A expenses, including interest expense, in the preliminary CV calculation for ESP sales. We have corrected this clerical error in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with respondent on the amount that should be included in NZKMB's G&amp;A expenses for the reasons explained in our response to Comment 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 14 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that the methodology used by respondent to impute expenses grossly understated the labor costs. Respondent reported labor in three categories: ``labor'', ``imputed labor'', and ``contracted labor''. Petitioners allege that these disparate labor expense reporting practices resulted in a fractured, often unidentifiable, labor component. Petitioners request that the Department reject respondent's reported labor expenses and replace them with costs derived in a more logical fashion. Petitioners contend that actual kiwifruit labor costs should be determined from the responses for five growers only, based on the following factors: (1) the grower produced kiwifruit only, or the grower's kiwifruit labor costs are segregable; (2) the grower needed to impute no labor cost; (3) labor cost was not consolidated with materials; or (4) labor cost was easily identifiable. Petitioners argue that Growers 2, 7, 13, 14, and 20 satisfied the above conditions. Furthermore, petitioners assert that an analysis of these growers' labor cost shows that labor cost per hectare decreases as the area under cultivation increases. Thus, petitioners argue that the Department should impute labor costs according to the following ``surrogate'' matches: Grower 13 as surrogate for Grower 12; Grower 7 as surrogate for Growers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Petitioners argue that to calculate the imputed labor cost for these 15 growers, the Department should simply multiply the growers' kiwifruit canopy hectares by the per-hectare labor cost of the surrogate grower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent argues that since the growers have reported their actual labor and contracted labor expenses and have added imputed labor expenses for family labor, there is no basis for adding additional labor costs to growers who relied more heavily on contracted labor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondent. For most growers, contracted labor expenses reported by respondent include labor and material costs. In instances where labor was not contracted for, the labor was provided either by an employee, by the owner himself, or by the owner's family. In the case of growers who used family labor, an imputed expense for family labor was reported and included in the COP. Additionally, for some growers labor costs were included in direct materials such as spraying and fertilizer. Therefore, we accepted respondent's labor cost allocation as an appropriate estimation of the cost of cultivating kiwifruit and used the information in our COP analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- Three Chinese dissidents  detained Friday and Saturday during the visit of French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur were released Sunday, the dissidents  said Monday.    One of them, Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Chinese  Human Rights Association, said he was beaten for 20 minutes by  three plain-clothed policemen during his detention.    Wang, Bao Ge and Yang Zhou were able to return home Sunday,  but were placed under house arrest for most of the day and their  telephones were cut until Monday morning so that they could not  speak with the press, the dissidents said.    They were released after the departure Sunday of Balladur  from Shanghai, they added.    "We were arrested because of Balladur's visit," Yang Zhou,  50, the association's spokesman, told AFP over the phone. Bao  Ge, 31, added: "The government was scared we would do something  to upset the visit."    Wang, 39, detained the first time on Friday, was released  and  then arrested again Saturday. He spent two nights in the police  station and said he was mistreated. "During my second arrest  Saturday afternoon, I was beaten for 20 minutes by three  plain-clothed policemen," he said.    Bao and Yang were first taken to the police station and each  spent Saturday night in a different hotel under police  surveillance and were restricted from leaving.</p>

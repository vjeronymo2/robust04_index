			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Provision arrests Border TV BORDER Television, the Carlisle-based regional ITV station, reported a small improvement in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 509,000 to Pounds 519,000, in the half year to October 31. However, Mr Peter Brownlow, finance director, warned that the company might not match last year's full-year performance, when pre-tax profit jumped 40 per cent to Pounds 1.22m. In spite of successful cost-cutting, the company faced a shrinking advertising pie. Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 5.9m with a 4 per increase in advertising revenue offset by lower programme sales. Pre-tax profit was reduced by a Pounds 385,000 exceptional provision for retrenchment costs, stemming from the 20 per cut in staff announced in September. That followed the decision by Border and Granada to link their transmission and sales operations. Mr Brownlow envisaged Border striking up a range of 'cost-saving alliances' with other franchise holders in the north of England. Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said Border would continue to invest in local radio. The location of Carlisle Radio - Border has a 20 per cent interest in the consortium which successfully tendered for the franchise this year - at the company's headquarters had created 'a true broadcast centre'. Earnings per share were 3.4p (3.3p). The interim dividend is increased from 1.1p to 1.3p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, February 10 (XINHUA) -- Greek Premier  Andreas Papandreou today said that the U.S. decision to  recognize Macedonia would have "certain repercussions" on  relations between his country and the United States.    The United States Wednesday [9 February] formally recognized  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, saying it would  establish full diplomatic relations with the republic once it  pledged to try to resolve its differences with Greece.    "We would like to believe that the text of the decision  granting recognition might be used positively, but right now we  don't know whether it will," Papandreou told reporters after a  cabinet meeting.    The recognition would encourage Macedonian President Kiro  Gligorov, who was "out of touch with reality," Papandreou said.    He said the reality was that Greece could isolate Macedonia  economically.    The premier added that the U.S. recognition of Macedonia did  not contribute to "normality."    "In contrast," he said, "exerting pressure (on Skopje) for  it  to abandon its liberating designs would contribute."    Replying to questions, Papandreou said that it was possible  to hold a meeting of Greece's political party leaders on the  Macedonian issue, to be chaired by President Konstandinos  Karamanlis.    Papandreou said that he was optimistic regarding the issue,  adding that its solution required "patience, persistence and  determination."    He had recently developed a good personal relationship with  U.S. President Bill Clinton, the premier said.    However, he said, countries did not act on the basis of  personal friendship or party identities; they acted on the basis  of strategic interests as they saw them.</p>

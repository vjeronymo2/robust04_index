			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tegucigalpa, 19 Mar [date as published]  (ACAN-EFE) -- The Armed Forces are considering replacing the  military agreement Honduras signed with the United States in  1954. This would be the end of the long "honeymoon" that reached  its peak during the war waged by the "contras" against the  Sandinist regime in Nicaragua.    It was also reported in Tegucigalpa that Armed Forces Chief  General Luis Alonso Discua said on a U.S. television network  that the current agreement "includes certain rules that are out  of date because the treaty was signed in 1954."    Official Honduran sources and the U.S. Embassy in this  capital declined to make any statements to ACAN-EFE but promised  to do so "in the next few hours." Meanwhile, the Presidency  announced an upcoming meeting of the Security Council.    The Legislative Assembly already knows about the Armed  Forces  position. Vice President Rafael Pineda Ponce said today that it  includes "professional, analytical, and thoughtful" proposals.    Honduran military personnel have initiated efforts to modify  the Military Assistance Treaty because it is obsolete and  currently benefits only Washington in allowing it to exert  pressure on the Central American nation, local commentators said.    These sources did not rule out the possibility that the  military will try to capitalize on the fact that the United  States will leave the Panama Canal in the year 2000, thus making  Honduras the sole military base in Central America.    Political and humanitarian group leaders, however,  criticized  the military initiative today, saying that Honduras's foreign  policy should be set by civilian rather than military powers.

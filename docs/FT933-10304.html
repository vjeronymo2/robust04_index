			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Delors fails to attract all commissioners to talks AT LEAST three EC commissioners are not expected to attend tomorrow's emergency meeting of the European Commission to discuss the fall-out from the explosion in the exchange rate mechanism. Likely absentees among the 17-strong Commission include Mr Peter Schmidhuber, German commissioner responsible for the budget; Mr Bruce Millan, British commissioner responsible for regional aid; and Madame Christiane Scrivener, the French commissioner responsible for EC tax policy. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, who is still suffering from sciatica at his home in Clichy, near Paris, will attend. He is said to be disappointed that his call for a special Commission session in Brussels has failed to persuade all commissioners to break holiday plans or previous engagements. Commission officials describe tomorrow afternoon's gathering as the first chance to examine economic and political consequences of the crisis which has forced the EC to abandon its system of tightly managed exchange rates. The increased threat of currency fluctuations will have a 'profound impact' on EC farm prices, a Brussels official said. For the first time in 15 years, German farmers face falling prices because of the likely upward revaluation of the D-Mark. Equally important are the implications for the 1994 budget of EC currency devaluations against the Ecu. At least four EC commissioners, including Sir Leon Brittan, the Community's chief trade negotiator, are in France. Mr Padraig Flynn, the Irish social affairs commissioner, is in County Mayo. Mr Yannis Paleokrassis, Greek commissioner responsible for the environment, will travel from Greece. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, former Portuguese foreign minister who handles information policy at the Commission, will also be present. Green currencies, Page 28</p>

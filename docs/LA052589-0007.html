			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 'GREENHOUSE' PERIL STRESSED  </P> <P> A U.N. report said that it is too late to halt all the effects from global  warming and that nations should begin to prepare for rising sea levels and crop  damage expected from the "greenhouse effect." Experts who submitted the report  to a meeting in Kenya of the U.N. Environment Program's governing council  reiterated the need to slow down the rate of climatic warming by such measures  as encouraging a switch away from fossil fuels. They also said that rising  oceans could inundate lands now settled by 1 billion people in the next 60  years and urged governments to discourage large-scale coastal developments and  get ready to help existing seaside enterprises that eventually have to be  abandoned.  </P></p>

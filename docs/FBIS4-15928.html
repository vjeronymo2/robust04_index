			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Is There Any Chance of Accord </F> When the Political Struggle Is Intensifying?"]    [Text] The publication of the draft memorandum of civil  accord proposed by the president, and the start of its  discussion should undoubtedly be recognized as the most  significant event in Russia's domestic political life last week.  This document seems all the more important because it has  emerged at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear that  the political struggle in Russia is intensifying. The series of  events that occurred last week is graphic confirmation of this.    The draft memorandum has dispelled the previously current  doubts about the president's political views. In it B. Yeltsin  convincingly proved that he is a firm advocate of the democratic  model of the state's development and has not abandoned the idea  of economic reforms.    This was also confirmed by the president's meeting with the  leaders of the Duma faction of "Russia's Choice," in the course  of which an obvious rapprochement took place, as distinct from  the eve of the 12 December elections, when Yeltsin  demonstratively distanced himself from the democratic movements.  The decision by "Russia's Choice" to allow a number of its  deputies to leave the faction so as to enable the "12 December"  group to become a faction -- a decision which followed that  meeting -- shows that at the meeting in the Kremlin an agreement  was reached on strategic cooperation, in the course of which the  president is reckoning on securing support for himself in the  Duma in the form of three right-wing factions: "12 December,"  "Russia's Choice," and "Yabloko."    At the same time Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin, who on the  eve of the December elections, as we recall, followed the  president's example and distanced himself from the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord, which was sympathetic to him, has  promoted S. Shakhray, the party's leader, to the rank of vice  premier. This gives grounds to conclude that the premier is  also seeking support in the Duma.    Ultimately it has to be noted that the president and the  premier have recently been becoming increasingly independent.  Each of them now possesses not only his own independent  apparatus but also his "own" parliamentary factions. This is  perfectly natural if you consider that Russia is entering a new  stage of the reforms -- a period of mass bankruptcies and  growing unemployment. In this situation both the president and  the government need the support of political forces in the Duma  which would be capable, in particular, of exerting influence  when considering the question of the government's resignation.    The chief problem here is how far this independence will go  and whether it will lead to the rupture of the alliance between  the president and the premier. As the experience of recent  months shows, the preservation of the alliance between Yeltsin  and Chernomyrdin would be the very best option for the country,  since it guarantees the monolith of the executive and,  ultimately, stability.    The natural preconditions for disagreements, however, must  also be taken into account. Above all, there is the objective  possibility that, in the event of a deterioration in the  socioeconomic situation, the president might sacrifice the  government. Finally, we should not forget such a serious factor  as the rivalry and the acute contradictions that exist between  the apparatuses of the president and the government.    In this connection informed sources draw attention to the  fact that Shakhray's appointment coincided with a weakening of  the positions of one of his chief opponents in the president's  entourage -- V. Ilyushin -- and in the absence of S. Filatov,  another opponent. As far as is known, Shakhray's appointment is  viewed in apparatus circles as a victory for the government's  apparatus over the president's.    Meanwhile the apparatus of the top organs of state power  demonstrated its potential as graphically as can be during the  scandal that erupted last week over the president's directive on  military bases. The fact that, as S. Krasavchenko, deputy  leader of the president's administration, reported, a serious  investigation has been launched into this incident concerning  the president's directive makes it possible to assume that  Yeltsin attached greater significance to the incident than to a  simple technical error, and maybe he is already fed up with  being constantly deceived by his entourage.    As we know, this was by no means the first instance when  unexpected documents, to put it mildly, have appeared bearing  the president's signature. Take, for example, the case of the  publication of the presidential edict on the transfer of the  "Lefortovo" Detention Center from the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Internal Affairs to the system of the General  Prosecutor's Office, as stated by former General Prosecutor A.  Kazannik in an interview in TRUD 29 March. This was the edict  which resulted in the rapid release of the Lefortovo inmates.  It has become known that an investigation was conducted into  that fact, during which it was ascertained that the text of the  edict was slipped onto the president's desk by one of his  closest aides, who was involved in a purely interdepartmental  intrigue and did not contemplate that his actions would have  such far-reaching political consequences and would strike a  painful blow at the president himself.    In the case of the Skrunda radar station, if we rely on  available information, it really is a question at present of a  technical error. It is hard, however, to rid yourself of the  impression that the error occurred at the most suitable time for  the president's opponents -- on the eve of the signing of the  Russian-Latvian agreement, with the result that serious damage  was done both to the president's prestige and to Russia's.    Opponents today accuse the president of imposing an  agreement  on them from a position of strength and demanding concessions  while not wishing to concede anything himself. It can be  assumed that, if the tendency not to want to make compromises  continues, then the memorandum of accord will go the same way as  the similar decree of the Seventh Congress of People's Deputies.    Russia is entering the final and most complex, most  dangerous  period of the reforms -- the period of mass bankruptcies and  unemployment. If it can get through it without losses and  without breaking up the alliance between the president and the  premier, if it is possible to preserve political stability in  the country and not slide into taking over the opposition's  slogans -- not to form a new external enemy, not to begin an  imperial flexing of muscles -- then Russia might secure what is  probably its only real chance to start climbing out of economic  depression. In this case the possibility of an opposition  victory will be insignificant.</p>

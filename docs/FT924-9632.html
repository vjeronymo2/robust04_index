			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Stet suffers from crossed lines with investors - The problems of Italy's state-run telecoms sector IMAGINE an international telecoms group as a collection of separate companies. One specialises in local calls, the others foreign traffic, equipment manufacturing and so on. Each has its own board, and stock market quotation. Add a highly politicised management and the normal in-fighting of a big corporation, and you have a fairly clear picture of how Italy's state-run telecommunications sector works. Enmeshed in a L40,000bn (Dollars 29.79bn) four-year investment programme, Italy's telecoms companies have raised productivity and quality. Many analysts praise Stet for boosting investment and services, which should increase profits. But lamentable co-ordination and political differences often leaves the telecoms companies vulnerable. Last month, Stet, the holding company, was forced on to the defensive after buying Finsiel, a computer software company controlled by IRI, the state holding concern that also owns Stet. For many analysts, frustrated by the group's poor transparency and steadily falling share price, spending L700bn on Finsiel was the final straw. It was widely suspected that the deal, sprung on a Friday evening after the markets had closed, was merely an excuse to raise funds for cash-strapped IRI. Stet's shares plunged 23 per cent when trading resumed, though they have since recovered. Analysts were unconvinced by Stet's claim that the purchase was essential to provide badly-needed software expertise. 'I can understand there have been criticisms, but I don't think they have been fair,' says Mr Umberto Silvestri, one of Stet's two managing directors. 'The important thing in any acquisition is that it should have an industrial logic, not who buys the company from whom.' He claims that Finsiel, which has a virtual monopoly in writing software for Italy's public sector, will give Stet a technological leap. Mr Francesco Silvano, Stet's other managing director, points to opportunities. Although most of Finsiel's business has nothing to do with telecoms, the link between communications and data processing is growing, he argues. Both men defend the price tag for Finsiel, which they say is in line with similar deals. Mr Michael Armitage, a Morgan Stanley analyst, also backs the transaction, even if critical of its presentation. But at hastily-arranged meetings in London and Milan last month, investors voiced very different views. Many are convinced acquiring Finsiel, which earned just L29.4bn on sales of L1,283bn last year, will depress Stet's earnings, raise debt and have little benefit for the foreseeable future. Such cynicism contrasts with the appeal of many international telecoms stocks which, in spite of heavy spending on modernisation and new value-added services, have become a favourite longer-term investment for fund managers. For state-owned companies, privatisation has added a speculative edge. For Italy's Amato government, striving to cut a huge budget deficit, telecoms could also be a rich source of privatisation revenue. However, privatisation is still a dream for Stet. Although IRI's stake has fallen to 53 per cent, the state is still in charge. Stet's own holdings in its subsidiaries have also been falling, but there, too, it retains a majority in all but Sirti, the network engineering arm where control is guaranteed through a pact with the biggest private shareholder. Attempts to rationalise Italy's telecoms companies have been fraught with political difficulties. Earlier this year, the government finally approved the long-awaited incorporation of ASST, the agency controlling inter-urban and some international communications, into IRI. That could have been the first step towards a single 'Telecom Italia', along the lines of the UK, Germany or France. Instead, IRI's proposal shuffled some ASST activities around the existing companies, while leaving the overall number unchanged by transferring other operations to Iritel, an embryonic successor. Stet executives are unwilling to discuss re-organisation and privatisation, arguing that such issues are outside their competence. But such replies are becoming unacceptable now that the role of outside shareholders is growing. 'It's a shame Stet is so atrocious when it comes to investor relations,' says one analyst. 'At L1,035 (the share's floor price in the immediate aftermath of the Finsiel deal) it was an extraordinarily good buy.' 'I hope last month's events made its executives more aware of their responsibilities to investors,' adds a banker. Like many colleagues, he complains that many state-sector executives act as if they are in a vacuum when it comes to the markets. 'They didn't like what they heard from big investors. But it may have done them good,' he says.</p>

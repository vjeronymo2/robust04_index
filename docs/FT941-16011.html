			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Observer: Pots and kettles The London Evening Standard clearly relishes the Tory party's current moral squirming. Yesterday it carried a conventional advertisement for Qantas, which by the final edition had been replaced by a 'reader offer' advertising a two-night stay and 'gastronomic dining' at a French hotel, the Chateau Tilques. On the same page was a large feature on Tory MP David Ashby, who has admitted sharing a bed at the same chateau with a male friend. Stewart Steven, the paper's editor, says the juxtaposition was 'not entirely coincidental. Our readers read about this wonderful hotel where our MPs go, and they can now sample it themselves'.</p>

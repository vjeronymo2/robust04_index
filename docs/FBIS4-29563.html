			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Powder-Reeking Military Budget" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  lashes out at the scheme of the South Korean puppet Defence  Ministry to drastically increase the "military budget" for next  year by 12.5 percent above this year's.    The analyst says:    The decision of the South Korean puppets to increase  military  spendings with blood taxes collected from the people is an  intolerable challenge to the entire fellow countrymen who are  calling for peace and reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam group is arguing for "the inevitability of  sanctions" against the North and staging war games in and around  the Korean peninsula almost every day while keeping the whole  puppet army on "an emergency alert".    It is not accidental that it has decided to largely increase  military appropriations next year. It is clear that it intends  to make a military adventure, come what may, under the pretext  of the "nuclear issue" of the North.    None of the successive South Korean rulers refrained from  seeking North-South confrontation. But there was no such a  warmaniac as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is so maliciously and  persistently kicking up the anti-national racket of  confrontation and war.    The Kim Yong-sam group seems to be hoping to get something  from a war against the North, dancing to the anti-DPRK,  anti-socialist tune of the U.S. masters. But, it is an act of  an idiot who is woefully short-sighted.    If the Kim Yong-sam group dare ignite a war, losing reason,  it will meet a miserable end.</p>

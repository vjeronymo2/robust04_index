			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Brazil leader pulled into banking row BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco has become embroiled in a growing row with Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, governor of Brazil's most important state, Sao Paulo, and a senior figure in the PMDB party, the government's biggest backer in Congress. The argument started when the president sacked one of Mr Fleury's political allies last week, after an internal squabble at the country's development bank. On Tuesday another supporter of Mr Fleury, Mr Jose Antonio Barros Munhoz, resigned as agriculture minister in sympathy, raising fears that the PMDB, with five ministers in the president's cabinet, would withdraw its support. Party leaders appeared yesterday to be trying to avoid confrontation, saying they would decide at their national convention in 10 days' time whether to continue supporting the government. Some PMDB members have said their support would depend on being given a more active role in formulating economic policy. Withdrawal of PMDB support would leave the government without a working majority in Congress.</p>

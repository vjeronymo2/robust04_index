			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Blazing oil hits Egyptian town A river of blazing oil surged through a town in southern Egypt during a rainstorm yesterday, causing a heavy death toll - possibly more than 370. A further 63 people died in flash flooding elsewhere in the region. According to one report, flooding caused a bridge to fall in on pipelines at a government oil storage depot, setting off fires and an explosion. A river of burning fuel then rushed through the adjacent town of Durunka. Another report said lightning started the fire at the fuel depot. Rescuers fear they will find more victims in the charred remains of houses today.</p>

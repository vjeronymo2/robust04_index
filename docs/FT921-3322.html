			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / US prices trend calms fears on Wall Street FEARS ON Wall Street that US inflation might rise if the economy recovers were reduced yesterday by another encouraging report on price trends. The Labour Department said the producer price index for finished goods rose 0.2 per cent last month and only 0.4 per cent in the year to February. Financial markets had expected a monthly increase of 0.3 per cent. The better-than-expected report calmed nerves in bond markets, which saw sharp price falls on Thursday following news of a surge in retail sales in recent months. Separate figures from the Commerce Department showed a 0.4 per cent drop in business inventories between December and January. Given the strong rise in retail sales, much of this fall was probably involuntary. Many analysts expect companies to begin rebuilding inventories, giving output a modest boost this spring. The most encouraging figure was a 0.1 per cent increase in the 'core' producer price index - which excludes the volatile food and energy components. This was the smallest gain since last July and reduced the annual rate of core producer price inflation to 2.4 per cent. Inflation for goods at an earlier stage of production remains subdued. In the year to February the indices for crude goods and intermediate goods fell by 6.7 per cent and 0.7 per cent, suggesting further moderation of finished goods prices in coming months.

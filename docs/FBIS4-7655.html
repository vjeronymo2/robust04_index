According to him, there is little  chance of forming a cabinet on a BSP mandate in this parliament.    The National Council of the non-parliamentary Bulgarian  Liberals Party adopted the principles of an election platform,  listing its priorities as follows: "Bread, security, private  property, preferences for Bulgarian business and a united  Eastern Orthodox church".

According to its re-elected president, Mr  Georgi Petrov, 1993 was the worst year Bulgarian tobacco  producers have ever had. [passage omitted]    The plunge of the lev against foreign currencies turned the  Deutsche mark into a main medium of payment in Kyustendil  (western Bulgaria) in the past few days, BTA's local  correspondent reported. Many of the customers are Serbs,  Macedonians [from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] or  Albanians from Kosovo.

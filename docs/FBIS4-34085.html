			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban  President Fidel Castro denied here today that he will propose  the possible return of Cuba to the OAS at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit. He said he will meet with those  presidents who wish to do so.    Upon his arrival in this northern Colombian city, Castro  said  there has been progress in all the Ibero-American summits, but  he explained that we must wait for the pronouncements by all the  presidents attending the summit.    "We have things to say, but we must wait until tomorrow,"  Castro said in brief statements to the media at the Rafael Nunez  Airport, in view of their insistence.    "We will meet with all those wishing to meet with us," the  Cuban president said, when asked about possible bilateral  meetings he might hold during his stay in Cartagena.    When questioned about a possible return of Cuba to the OAS,  Castro said he will not raise the subject in the summit of  presidents of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal.    Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962, three years after  the  revolution led by Castro.    The Cuban president arrived at 2315 (0415 GMT) and was  greeted at the air terminal by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin and author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.    Castro was the last of the 22 chiefs of state and government  to arrive here. Together with Dominican Vice President Carlos  Morales Troncoso, they will participate in the summit which  opens here, tomorrow, Tuesday.</p>

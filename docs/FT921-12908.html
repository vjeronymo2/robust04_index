			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology: Electronic standards join forces The world's leading reinsurers have agreed to work together to establish international standards for electronic data interchange and messaging. The development of standards will allow users in one market to communicate more easily with those in another, thereby accelerating the development of electronic trading internationally. Systems allowing insurance brokers (who operate on behalf of buyers) to contract business and process claims electronically are already used in London and Europe. The London Insurance Market Network (Limnet), the product of a joint effort by Lloyd's of London, London brokers and companies, was launched in 1987. In spite of some delays a pilot electronic trading scheme involving two dozen Lloyd's agencies and brokers will begin in April. The Reinsurance and Insurance Network, Rinet, set up by eight major European reinsurance companies including the German and Swiss giants, Munich Re and Swiss Re, was launched later that year. The joint approach will allow underwriters and brokers who have access to either system to trade across both. According to Michael Seddon of Limnet the move has been partially brought about by pressure from the US market. Representatives from Limnet and Rinet visited the US last year. 'The Americans said separate developments didn't make sense. They were instrumental in bringing us together,' said Seddon. Two US organisations, the Reinsurance Market Association and the Reinsurance Association of America, will back the joint initiative. Seddon says Limnet and Rinet have developed their work along slightly separate lines and that some rework will be involved. But the need for compromise is accepted. He adds that the decision to harmonise standards has been taken just in time. In a couple of years 'we'd have been looking at translation of standards rather than the development of a common standard'.</p>

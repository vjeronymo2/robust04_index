			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE AND POLICY  </P> <P> John A. Moore (Science, Common Sense and Our Public Fears," Commentary, Aug.  12) presents a reasonable-sounding position on the role of scientists in  informing social policy decisions. He also appears to be so politically naive  that he might as well be from another planet.  </P> <P> Moore would rely on the opinions of "mainstream" scientists. What this ignores  is the relationship most "mainstream" scientists have with the profit-driven  corporations that employ them. The problem is compounded because our elected  representatives are so very often beholden to the same corporations. Academic  institutions are as likely as not dependent on federal funds. In some cases  their hands are tied outright by legislation prohibiting some kinds of  research.  </P> <P> Organizations such as Greenpeace, The Heritage Foundation, and Ralph Nader's  Public Citizen provide some alternatives -- but they all have their own agendas  as well. Only when we clean up Congress -- perhaps with public funding of  campaigns -- will we begin to see real advancement.  </P> <P> JOHN D. BALTIC  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

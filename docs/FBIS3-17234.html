			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Olena Hubina report: "I Don't Trust You by 96 Percent"] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian population's confidence in all  branches of power on the eve of parliamentary elections is so  low that it is even difficult to determine whose victory is to  be preferred. In February and March 1994, the "Democratic  Initiatives" center conducted an opinion poll, which involved  1,799 respondents. It revealed that just 2 percent of the  respondents have full confidence in the government, 4 percent --  in the president, 2 percent -- in the Supreme Council chairman,  and 2 percent -- in the leadership of local power structures.  The level of confidence in Vyacheslav Chornovil, the opposition  leader, is not much higher -- just 4 percent of the respondents  were fully in his favor. Somewhat higher is the prestige of the  militia (6 percent), and 20 percent of the respondents trust the  Army.    Furthermore, 13.6 percent of the respondents stated their  unwillingness to participate in the elections; 63 percent said  that they would not like to vote for the same candidate as in  the previous elections; and just 13 percent have not changed  their preferences. The decision to vote for a particular  candidate may be positively influenced mainly by the fact that  the candidate is... in favor of a union between Ukraine and  Russia. This was pointed out by 48 percent of the respondents.  Negative attitude was expressed by 27 percent and yet another  25 percent showed indifference. Some of the respondents  considered the candidates' sex as one of their "virtues": 36  percent of them are ready to vote for a female deputy.  Thirty-one percent of the respondents like candidates who are  in favor of a capitalist economic development, 30 percent -- if  they have support of entrepreneurs, 25 percent -- if they are  not members of any party. Nineteen percent of the respondents  prefer those candidates who assert that authoritarian rule (the  "iron" order) is the best road toward democracy. Physical  attractiveness of the candidate encourages just 2 percent of the  voters.    Among the respondents, 54 percent believe that Ukraine will  most likely maintain its integrity and independence in the  future, 22 percent do not believe in that, 42 percent assume  that our country will unite with Russia and Belarus within a  Slavic Union, 31 percent believe that it will become a  constituent part of a single CIS state (a renewed union), and 28  percent find it plausible that Ukraine will become a part of  Russia.    At the same time, just 8 percent of respondents positively  assessed Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It is of interest  that even CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev got a higher  rating -- 16 percent.</p>

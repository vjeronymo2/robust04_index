			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Letter: Fresh skills required when boardroom beckons Sir, At last, your article 'The boardroom beckons' by Charles Batchelor (March 3) offers a potential board member practical insight into the appointment process. Let me add a few items to Henry Short's 10-point plan. These are drawn from the reality of serving as a non-executive board member for more than 25 American private and public, high-tech and no-tech companies. The job is not easy: American litigators are just around corner, the toil to facilitate change takes patience, and often the cross-cultures of the boardroom are tedious. However, if we do it well, the share value for the smallest shareholder will be increased. The coupling of effective directors to management through the boardroom is the most under-utilised process of our corporate world. My additions to Short's list: Understand the history and status of shareholder ownership. Take steps to establish the business background of the existing board members. Negotiate your director fee before appointment. Mr Batchelor says that a director 'should be informed' to participate at meetings. The commandment I follow is: 'The director knew, or should have known.' That really demands doing your boardroom homework.

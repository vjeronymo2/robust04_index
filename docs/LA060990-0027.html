			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RAIN EXPECTED THROUGHOUT COUNTY  </P> <P> Hurricane Boris is a shadow of its former self, but the weakening storm is  expected to drop rain throughout San Diego County today, according to the  National Weather Service.  </P> <P> "There's a lot to complain about this weekend -- the humidity, the warm  temperatures and now the rain," said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara.  </P> <P> Judging from satellite weather pictures, coastal and inland areas could receive  up to a quarter of an inch beginning this afternoon and into Sunday morning,  Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Campers traveling to the mountains and deserts should be wary of gully washers  -- brief but heavy downpours and gusty winds, Shigehara said. Those areas may  receive up to an inch of rain.  </P> <P> The core of what was once Boris will pass over San Diego late today, he said.  The weather is expected to turn cooler and partly cloudy by Sunday afternoon,  he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: The new word on everyone's lips  -Privatisation will shine the spotlight on Seita ALMOST everyone has seen, smelt or tasted something produced by Societe Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes (Seita). However, the company remains relatively unknown. This is in spite of the fact that its Gitanes cigarettes, with the swaying gypsy lady on the packet, and the Asterix-like winged helmet on Gauloises packaging have become national symbols. Seita, however, is destined to become better known following the Balladur government's decision to put it on the list of 21 companies to be sold to the public. Given the recession depressing prospects for so many other privatisation candidates, Seita's sale could be sooner rather than later. 'We are a very uncyclical enterprise,' says Mr Eric Albrand, finance director, 'and the timing (of privatisation) would depend more on finding a certain number of buyers than on the economic context.' Seita and British American Tobacco (BAT) are already eyeing each other with interest. BAT makes no secret of the fact that its recent 'financial' investment in the Banque Nationale de Paris privatisation was partly designed to smooth its political path to an 'industrial' investment in Seita. At an overall estimated value of between FFr7bn and FFr9bn ((Dollars 1.2bn-Dollars 1.5bn), Seita's sale could be easily slotted in between larger candidates. However, before it goes on to the privatisation slipway, Seita needs to be stripped of its residual monopolies. These still give it the right to manufacture all tobacco products in France and to import all tobacco products from outside the EC. However, they no longer confer any commercial advantage to the company. 'It has simply meant that other companies have set up manufacturing and import facilities elsewhere in the EC, without hindering their ability to sell into the French market,' says Ms Isabelle Okrent, communications director. Seita's performance is improving. It expects a rise in net profit this year, to more than FFr400m, compared with the FFr367m total last year (or 2.7 per cent of 1992 turnover). But with even gross profits only 5.3 per cent of turnover last year, Seita has hardly been the cash machine expected of tobacco companies. There are two main reasons for this. First, it has had to struggle with strong public-sector unions to concentrate production in five factories around the country, down from 12 a decade ago. Second, France taxes tobacco fairly heavily. The industrial price was also controlled by the government until last year. The benefits to Seita of this latest lifting of price control has been neutralised by three increases in tobacco taxes in the past 18 months. The fact that some of Seita's competitors have cut, rather than increased, their prices in order to gain market share has not helped either. Seita had nearly half the French market last year. Its overwhelming strength, however, is still in dark tobacco, a market which is declining by between 7 and 8 per cent a year. In the steadily more fashionable light tobacco, which now accounts for two-thirds of what is smoked in France, Seita was last year second to Philip Morris and just ahead of Rothmans. Both Seita and Rothmans have lost market share this year to Reynolds, which has been cutting the price of its Winston brand. Overall, the French market has dipped. After average growth of 0.8 per cent during the 1980s, cigarette consumption fell by 0.8 per cent last year, and by 3 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Mr Albrand blames the decline on price/tax increases, and on the new law banning tobacco advertising everywhere except inside France's 36,400 officially-designated tabacs, the only legal outlet for tobacco in the country. The tabac system suits the government, because it reduces evasion of tobacco tax, and tobacco sales usefully cross-subsidise corner shops which would otherwise have to close down in rural areas. The system also suits Seita. It does not own the tabacs, but it might as well do, because it is effectively their sole tobacco supplier, furnishing them with other companies' cigarettes as well as its own. Seita also makes money out of the network by distributing local communes' parking permits, and France Telecom's telephone cards, to the tabacs for sale. Seita's incestuous relationship with the tabacs will not change with privatisation; it rests on economies of scale and efficient service rather than the law. However, it is hard to see how investing in Seita would give, for example, BAT any edge in selling its products in French tabacs; the neutrality clause in Seita's distribution contracts would prevent that. Given that Gitanes or Gauloises are part of France's image in the world, Seita believes the government will seek some core domestic shareholders. So far the only French shareholder to show interest is the Bollore shipbuilding group, in which Rothmans has a stake. Seita sees a much better fit with BAT, which is strong in areas of where Seita is weak - Latin America, east Asia and English-speaking Africa. Another fit for Seita would be Reemstma of Germany. The two companies already operate jointly in Belgium, Switzerland and Italy, and the German company could provide Seita with an entree into east Europe and Russia.  -----------------------------      SEITA RESULTS (FFR)  -----------------------------        Turnover  Gross Profit  ----------------------------- 1988    9.05bn       493m 1989    10.3bn       518m 1990   11.23bn       433m 1991    12.4bn       658m 1992   13.41bn       717m  ----------------------------- Source: Company figures  -----------------------------</p>

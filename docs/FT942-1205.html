			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Deficit on the current account drops to Pounds 667m The UK's current account deficit in the first quarter of this year was just Pounds 667m - its best performance for seven years, the Central Statistical Office said. The main reason for the improvement was that the invisibles surplus rose sharply to Pounds 2.4bn, its highest level since the first quarter of 1986. However, part of the improvement was due to a rise in net investment income, a statistic which is particularly volatile. The CSO said that net investment income in the first quarter amounted to Pounds 2.01bn, the highest-ever figure, compared with Pounds 1.13bn in the previous three months. In particular, the financial sector increased its overseas earnings while the UK earnings of foreign banks fell sharply. There were also improvements in the other trade components. The deficit on visible trade fell slightly to Pounds 3.07bn, from Pounds 3.58bn in the fourth quarter of last year. The value of exports was 2.5 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, while imports rose by just 1 per cent. The surplus on services increased to Pounds 1.63bn, from Pounds 1.47bn in the fourth quarter of last year. However, the UK continued to have a deficit on travel, which amounted to Pounds 853m in the first quarter. Analysts welcomed the current account figures, which were much better than expected, but expressed caution about the quality of the data. 'The likelihood must be that future revisions will be adverse,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. According to the CSO, the UK's balance sheet improved substantially over the quarter. Net external assets were Pounds 42.1bn at the end of March, compared with Pounds 22.7bn at the end of December 1993. The figures also show that UK banks and financial institutions made substantial disposals of overseas securities in the first quarter. Banks, having bought Pounds 12.7bn of overseas securities in the fourth quarter of last year, sold Pounds 2.7bn in this year's first quarter. Other financial institutions sold Pounds 29.36bn of overseas securities in the first quarter, compared with net purchases of Pounds 25.06bn in the last three months of 1993. Meanwhile, overseas residents continued to buy gilts and UK shares, to the tune of Pounds 13.36bn in the first quarter, compared with Pounds 11.23bn in the final three months of 1993.</p>

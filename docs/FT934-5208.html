			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Leader ousted by Labour in NZ New Zealand's Labour MPs early today overwhelmingly elected Ms Helen Clark as their party's new leader, ending a gruelling battle to oust Mr Mike Moore who had led Labour to two electoral defeats. Ms Clark, a former university lecturer, is from the left wing of the party. She has indicated that she wants to turn Labour back to its socialist roots and has spoken of the need to raise taxes to help the under-privileged. The party caucus, in an apparent bid to retain the support of Mr Moore's supporters, who back the right-wing reforms of recent years, voted to appoint Mr David Caygill as deputy leader. Mr Caygill, although a Clark supporter, is considered a right-winger and was minister of finance in 1988 and 1989 after the sacking of reformist Sir Roger Douglas. Ms Clark is the first woman to lead a major New Zealand political party. She won the caucus vote by 26 to 19, attracting much bigger support than had been expected.</p>

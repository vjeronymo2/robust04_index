			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 30 May (PL) -- According to an  authorization request presented to the National Congress today  [30 May], Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will pay  an official visit to Cuba toward the middle of next month.    Salinas will fly to Havana and then continue on to Cartagena  de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. In his  request to the National Congress, the Mexican president says  Mexico and Cuba maintain respectful diplomatic relations. He  highlights the fact that the island is part of Mexico's border  in the Caribbean.    Salinas also states that the ties between Mexico and Cuba  have, throughout history and within the context of their  respectful bilateral relationship, been marked by warm ties  between the two peoples and offered a gateway for international  cooperation. This has come to symbolize the importance of such  contacts.    In his request, Salinas also points out that the profound  and  fruitful political dialogue between Cuba and Mexico, at the  highest levels, has opened the way for all of Mexico's  presidents since 1975 to visit the island during their  presidential term.    He recalls that Cuban President Fidel Castro has also  visited  Mexico on three occasions during the current administration (for  the Salinas de Gortari inauguration in 1988, then to attend the  meeting of the Group of Three [G-3] held on Cozumel Island in  1993, and to participate in the First Ibero-American Summit in  Guadalajara, also in 1993).    The request concludes that the presence of the Mexican head  of state in Cuba will serve to promote an even closer bilateral  relationship, examine the countries' joint agenda, and explore  new ways of diversifying and strengthening their ties. This  visit to Cuba was previously scheduled for last January, but was  postponed due to the armed conflict that broke out in the  southern State of Chiapas.    Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, Salinas states in his  request that this type of meeting has proven its value as a  political forum at the highest level and as an instrument to  promote agreement in fields such as education, science, culture,  Indian development, international law, and social and economic  development. He stated that among the Mexican president's  reasons for going to Cartagena de Indias is that the G-3 nations  (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) planned to sign the Economic  Complementary Agreement during their stay.    The first meeting of the presidents of Latin America, Spain,  and Portugal took place in the Mexican city of Guadalajara in  1991. It was followed by similar meetings in Madrid, Spain in  1992, and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993.    Salinas will end his six-year term in office in December of  this year after the federal election on August 21.</p>

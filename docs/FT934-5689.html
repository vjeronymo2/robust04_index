			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (4): Fog in the middle distance - Economic optimism is very tentative The government and private forecasters are in agreement that in 1994 there will be a return to economic growth after seven years of near-stagnation, culminating with a year of zero or perhaps even negative growth in 1993. As regards the longer term, however, the views of the government and the business community diverge. In a recently-published medium-term outlook, the government foresees an average annual increase in gross domestic product between 1995 and 2000 of 3.3 per cent, with private sector production increasing even faster, at about four per cent a year. But the business community fears that a return to growth will be inhibited by serious structural rigidities in the economy. 'The government doesn't seem to see the structural problems, but we do,' said Mr Hans Skov Christensen, the director-general of the Federation of Danish Industries, who suspects, too, that European recovery will have a different character than previous post-war recoveries. Demand will strengthen in West Europe, but much of the increase in production which this generates will take place in East Europe, where wage costs are only about one tenth, or less, of wage costs in countries such as Denmark. 'We shall not see the same kind of international boom we used to see,' he said. However, Denmark, says the government, has a better starting point for sustained, non-inflationary growth than most other European countries. It has a surplus on trade in goods and services which is almost seven per cent of GDP (not even Japan can beat that) and a surplus on the current balance of payments account of just over three per cent of GDP. Inflation is the lowest in Europe at just 1.2 per cent over the 12 months to September. Hourly wage rates have increased by only about two per cent this year, and after the trauma of speculative attacks on the krone in the spring and again in July this year, which forced the Central Bank to raise interest rates sharply, interest rates are rapidly coming down to average European levels again. Government finances are in deficit, showing the effects of the long recession and high unemployment, but the general government financial deficit this year will be about 4.4 per cent of GDP, which is below the average for the EU. The strong external position is being exploited by the government to give a substantial boost to domestic demand via fiscal policy in 1994, when Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, estimates that the stimulus to GDP growth from fiscal policy will be about 1.3 per cent. The fiscal boost will come more particularly from a reform of the tax system, passed by the Folketing last summer. This reduces the country's exceptionally high marginal income tax rates (the top rate will go down from 68 to about 62 per cent and the bottom rate from 51 to 43 per cent). The revenue lost on income tax will not be clawed back in 1994, although higher energy and other 'green' taxes will equalise the revenue loss by 1998, when the reform will be fully implemented. The government expects the boost to demand to lead to a surge in real private consumption by almost 4 per cent and a 2.9 per cent increase in GDP next year. Other forecasters are more cautious, but agree that demand will rise significantly. The Industries Federation, for example, predicts a GDP growth of 2.5 per cent and increase in private consumption of 3.0 per cent. The upswing will generate a few extra jobs, but neither the government nor other forecasters expect unemployment to fall by more than about 20,000 to around 330,000 from 350 000, or 12.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted), this autumn. Mr Lykketoft's medium-term report emphasises that after 1994 fiscal policy must switch to containing the government deficit in order to ensure a sustained low real rate of interest, a necessary condition of obtaining strong growth in the business sector. In the same report, Mr Lykketoft's ministry asserts that marginal changes in minimum wage levels and the country 's high unemployment benefits (benefit is 90 per cent of wages up to a ceiling which is 90 per cent of the average wage for skilled workers) will not have a significant effect on demand for labour, and drastic changes 'are not acceptable in a society of the Danish kind,' as Mr Lykketoft told the FT. For Mr Skov Christensen, however, what is at stake is not the social welfare system. 'This has to do with survival,' he said. Without action on minimum wages, the steady increase in transfer incomes (between 24 and 25 per cent of the population aged 16-66 live off transfer incomes now) will both undermine government finances and export-competitiveness. The Danish Employer's Association, the sister organisation to the Federation of Industries, put some figures on what it regards as necessary if more jobs are to be generated for the less skilled population groups. The generous transfer incomes - such as unemployment benefits - which currently place a floor on the hourly wage rate of DKr67, must be reduced to that the minimum wage can fall to DKr50, it said. At that level, the Danish minimum wage would be just eight times the average wage in Poland.</p>

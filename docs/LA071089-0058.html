			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The explosion last month of a major pipeline along the Trans-Siberian Railroad  in the Ural Mountains decreased the Soviet Union's gas supply by 20%, forcing  cuts in gas exports and supplies to domestic factories and consumers, a  government official said. Gas Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also said Soviet  consumers should conserve gas used in kitchen stoves and brace for shortages of  rubber and plastic goods made from the petroleum products the pipeline carried.  A 1,153-mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzine, propane and butane from  western Siberia burst June 4 as two passenger trains were passing. A spark from  one of the trains touched off an explosion, killing more than 600 passengers.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, 23 Jun (AFP) -- The Government of Niger and  Tuareg rebels tentatively agreed here Wednesday [22 June] to  create "homogeneous" autonomous regions for the country's ethnic  groups, each with its own elected assembly and governor.    Mano Dayak, leader of the Tuareg delegation to peace talks  mediated by France and Algeria, said the two sides had reached  agreement "in principle" on most key issues. He said the plan  was to carve out a new administrative map from the present  French-style departments taking account of "cultural and social  homogeneity".    Dayak said the two sides "agreed in principle on a fully  autonomous administration for these regions with elected  assemblies and governors to be appointed by them, parallel with  the central government structures."    The talks which have been under way for more than a week at  a  secret location outside Paris were between the government  represented by Mai Maigana, high commissioner for the  restoration of peace, and the Armed Resistance Coordination  (CRA) comprising Niger's four Tuareg rebel organisations.    Dayak said the CRA had argued for "a return to peace and  reinsertion of ex-combatants with some being absorbed into the  (national) Army." But he said there were "too many differences"  and the government would be having more consultations in Niamey  before a new round of talks in Algiers.    The CRA has long sought the right to be able to run its own  affairs in an area reserved for Niger's estimated 750,000  Tuaregs, who account for 10 percent of the population. It has  also called for a quota system guaranteeing Tuaregs a fair share  of jobs in government institutions and the armed forces. The  Tuaregs concentrated in northern Niger have been fighting the  central governments of Mali and Niger for several years. The  rebellion recently appeared to have spread to Burkina Faso which  has taken in thousands of Tuareg refugees.</p>

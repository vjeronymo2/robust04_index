			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today" column by Altan Oymen: "If It Continues </F> Like This"]    [Text] What will happen if the situation continues as it  is? What will happen if the organizers and participants in  Sunday's incidents repeat their actions on other occasions?.    What will happen if they say that they will be holding  rallies today for Bosnia, tomorrow for Azerbaijan, the next day  for Western Thrace, and the day after that for Cyprus and they  use the same methods? In other words: What will happen is they  exploit the justified sensitivity of our people toward all those  national causes to advance their own "cause"? What if they  initiate a "jihad" under the green banner against the secular  system of the state and our citizens who are loyal to that  system? What if they stone official and party buildings and  attack foreign embassies?    And what is more dangerous than that: What if the  administrators of the legal political parties do not condemn the  action of these supporters, but on the contrary, issue  statements encouraging them?    To what will this lead?    Everyone should seriously consider the reply to this  question.    Above all, Prosperity Party [PP] administrators should,  among  themselves, consider the following:    It is true that they have been most successful in the 27  March elections and they have increased their votes from 10-11  percent to 19 percent. Is this, however, what the new recruits  expect from the party? Did they cast their votes so that our  metropolitan areas could be turned into fighting arenas?    And the PP members? Is this what they promised the citizens  when they asked for their votes prior to 27 March? Did they not  say "We will bring peace and brotherhood to our people"?    Were they not sincere while they were making those promises?  Were they acting as "wolves in sheep's clothing" in order "to  get the votes and to do what they please afterwards"?    PP administrators should diagnose their situation from this  angle.    If, in an atmosphere of victory in the aftermath of the  recent elections, they believe that their promises are no longer  binding... If they seem like "wolves" who no longer need "the  sheep's clothing"... If they are saying: "We have accomplished  what we wanted. The administration of most of the metropolitan  areas is in our hands. The time has come now to occupy the  streets."    To what will this lead?    One cannot know the details of what will happen. In general,  however, the following is clear: It will not be beneficial for  anyone.    We believe that whatever is "clear" to us is also clear to  the Prosperity administrators. If so, they should make it  "clear" that their preelection promises are binding. They  should categorically issue a warning to their supporters who are  willing to wage a "jihad" against the democratic and secular  republic and 90 percent of its people. Those who do not heed  this warning should be kept away from the party and the  administrators should be the first ones to wage a struggle  against them.    We hope that they will be exercising this "foresight."</p>

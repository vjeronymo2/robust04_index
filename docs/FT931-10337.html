			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / First speed-trap camera case LEGAL HISTORY was made yesterday with the first prosecution of a speeding driver based on evidence from the new controversial speed-trap cameras. According to police in west London the cameras, four of which are rotated at 42 sites, have cut accidents significantly since their introduction in October last year. At Ealing magistrates court Mr Stephen Quashie, 19, of Harlesden, north-west London, pleaded guilty to driving at 78mph on the A40 Western Avenue which has a 50mph limit. He told the court that on October 31 he had been rushing to see his pregnant ex-girlfriend in Hammersmith Hospital when he was caught on film. He said: 'It was 1.15am in the morning. There were hardly any cars on the road. I thought it would be all right.' He was fined Pounds 156, plus costs of Pounds 25, and given six penalty points. The chairman of the bench Wiktor Lewanski said the fine 'reflects the seriousness with which this offence is being viewed'. Afterwards Mr Quashie said he was surprised at the size of the fine but philosophical about the use of cameras. He added: 'They are there to do the job and they have done their job.' But he admitted he did not think he had been caught as he did not think there was a camera in spite of the police signs. Afterwards the police said: 'Since their introduction on October 15 there has been a 38 per cent drop in accidents, a 46 per cent drop in casualties and most spectacularly a 60 per cent drop in those killed or seriously injured.' He went on: 'Motorists have reduced their speed by about 10 per cent so accidents are that much less serious.' He denied they were being used to increase the number of drivers caught, pointing out their presence obviously reduced speed. On average 250 cases are being detected each week by the four cameras rotated in the 42 sites in west London.</p>

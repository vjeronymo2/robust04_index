			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "Theater Thunder at the Peace </F> Festival"]    [Text] The stage as a message: This was unprecedented in  the history of peace agreements -- the abrupt interruption of  the ceremony in Cairo, the bizarre retreat into the wings, where  'Arafat, with his eternal theatricalism, once again grabbed the  dramaturgy to provide the map of the autonomy area with a  hand-written reservation.    An omen for what comes afterwards? The pessimists, whose  opinion has so far been confirmed by statistics in the Middle  East, can easily draw conclusions from that as to a dark future:  Distrust and hatred are rooted too deeply for the peoples to  free themselves from the prison of violence. Therefore, they  say, the noble beginning of Washington (on 13 September, when  Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat shook hands) will end in a war  of attrition about details and the enemies of peace will still  get the upper hand.    The optimists may conclude the opposite from the interrupted  ceremony. Winston Churchill once said: "It is better to  jaw-jaw than to war-war." Thus, one might understand the  tug-of-war and the haggling, which did not stop even in front of  the gathered dignitaries from all over the world, as a  reassuring omen -- because, first, 'Arafat has never missed an  opportunity to put himself into the limelight and, second, he  once again had to prove to his enemies in his own camp how tough  he is in reality; and, finally, only someone who basically  accepted the deal a long time ago tries to get an additional  advantage at the last moment.    Nevertheless, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was right when he  noted with slight irony: "We watched only the tip of the  iceberg of those problems that we still have to overcome."  Where it is not only land, but also mutually exclusive rights  that are involved, any detail becomes the symbol of the entire  conflict, which can be called a 100-year war (as Rabin did)  without any exaggeration.    Whether Gaza gets its own telephone prefix (no longer the  972  for Israel) or has its own stamps is not a postal but a highly  political problem. Whose judiciary is responsible for the  settlers in the West Bank cannot be solved pragmatically but  only on principle, and behind this there is the most tortuous  question of all: How much sovereignty for the Palestinians --  and how quickly? It is quite clear that a question like that  cannot be answered at the negotiating table, but only in  everyday coexistence. And therefore the enemies of peace keep  their bloody power of veto: Any terrorist attack is a deep  gouge in the shaky scaffolding of peace.    The Israelis can keep the extremists in check with their  tested state machinery; the PLO still has to demonstrate whether  it really has the monopoly on power, which is the foundation of  any state. The brief interruption on the stage in Cairo  demonstrated theatre, but not tragedy. Whether the latter will  indeed come to pass will be demonstrated on a completely  different stage -- there where Israelis and Palestinians will  have to practice peace as of now: in Gaza and in Jericho.</p>

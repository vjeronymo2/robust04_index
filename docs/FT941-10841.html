			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Defence outlay continues to lag behind inflation US defence spending will rise by just 1.3 per cent to Dollars 252.2bn (Pounds 170bn) next year, the 10th straight year in which the US military budget has risen by less that the inflation rate. The 1995 fiscal year budget is the first for which President Bill Clinton's Defence Department team has done more than tinker with existing military spending plans, and marks the implementation of the Bottom Up Review of force structure conducted last year under Mr Les Aspin, who handed over the defence secretary's job last week to Mr William Perry. Mr Clinton's five-year plan now projects an absolute cut in defence spending to Dollars 243.4bn in 1996 and Dollars 240.2bn in 1997. Nominal increases in the next two years are to leave defence spending down to just 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product in 1999. 'It hasn't been this small since before World War II, when people were walking around training with broomsticks on their shoulders,' a senior Pentagon official said. Departmental budget planners have tried to walk a fine line between those on their left, who complain that they are still wasting money on Cold War-style defences, and those on their right, who fear the US military will be gutted by spending cuts. The 1995 budget provides for a 4.9 per cent increase in the money available for operations and maintenance, as Pentagon officials are very eager to preserve the readiness of the smaller forces they will have at their disposal by allowing them to maintain high operating tempos. The increase in readiness spending is particularly marked for the army, where the average distance driven by each tank in a year, for example, will rise from 620 to 800 miles. Military construction, down from Dollars 6.0bn to Dollars 5.0bn, and procurement, down by Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 43.3bn, are to bear the brunt of spending cuts. The budget preserves money for the development of the next generation of major weapon systems, such as the F-22 advanced tactical fighter to be introduced in the late-1990s, the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter and the navy's new attack submarine, for which the first order will be placed in 1998. But it cancels the navy's A/F-X fighter development programme, as well as the remaining SH-60B, SH-60F and HH-60H helicopters it had planned to buy, ends purchases of the air force's F-16 fighter and cancels the Landsat satellite. In all, the Department will buy just 127 aircraft in 1995, including 42 trainers and 60 utility helicopters, compared with 943 in 1985, the peak year of the Reagan defence build-up. It will buy six ships, compared with 29, no tanks, compared with 720, and 18 strategic missiles, compared with 48. 'We can live with that because we are living off the inventories we built up during the Cold War. At some point, we will have to start procuring again,' a senior Pentagon official said. By 1995, the Department expects to have moved to 13 active fighter wings and 11 active aircraft-carriers with one in reserve, as planned in the Bottom Up Review, but it will have to cut another two army divisions to reach the planned total of 10 and drop another 27 surface ships to reach the review's target of 346. Total active military manpower is projected to fall to 1.52m by the end of 1995, and to drop another 4.8 per cent to 1.45m at the end of 1999. Reserve strength will drop by 7.4 per cent over that period to 906,000, with the Pentagon's civilian workforce falling by 9 per cent to 794,000. Research funding for the strategic defence initiative, now mainly shifted from the strategic defences envisioned in the Reagan era to more limited defences against theatre ballistic missiles, will rise again to a total of Dollars 3.25bn in 1995, having fallen to Dollars 2.7bn in the current fiscal year. Funding for the five years 1995-1999, however, has been trimmed to Dollars 17bn.</p>

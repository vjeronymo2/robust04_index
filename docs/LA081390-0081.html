This year, however, Mayor Eva G. Miner suggested a coordinated approach to the  community activities, and the council agreed. The week of Oct. 21-28 has been  set aside for the event.  </P> <P> City officials will encourage local schools and community organizations to  participate in the activities and will try to inform residents of the schedule  of events. The city's contribution will go toward distributing buttons, ribbons  and balloons, officials said.  </P></p>

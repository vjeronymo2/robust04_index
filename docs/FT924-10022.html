			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Kwik Save fined for unsafe food KWIK SAVE, the supermarket chain, was fined more than Pounds 19,000 yesterday for offences ranging from selling rancid and mouldy meat to having high bacteria counts in cheese. The prosecution was brought by trading standards officers who discovered food on sale after its 'use by' date at five stores in Knowsley Borough, Merseyside. The company pleaded guilty at Kirkby Magistrates Court to 15 charges, including selling six packs of sausages containing fat that had gone rancid and two packets of meat contaminated with mould. It was also prosecuted for offering Danish Blue cheese that was unfit because of its bacteria count, and having food on sale at temperatures of up to 20 degrees when it should have been stored at no higher than 8 degrees. The chain was fined Pounds 19,200 with Pounds 4,700 costs for the offences under the Food Safety Act. The company said it had undertaken internal investigations 'and we are satisfied that this was a one-off case. We have spent considerable time and effort to make sure this doesn't happen again'.</p>

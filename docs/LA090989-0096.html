			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A CHORUS OF APPROVAL FOR AYCKBOURN'S BACKSTAGE COMEDY  </P> <P> I've got to get colleague Michael Wilmington down to South Coast Repertory to  see "A Chorus of Disapproval." Reviewing the film version last week, Wilmington  suggested that the story was probably a good deal funnier without frantic  close-ups.  </P> <P> Exactly. Alan Ayckbourn's characters are wonderfully funny at South Coast, but  they never ask for a laugh. In fact, a laugh is the last thing they want. How  hard Ayckbourn's characters strive not to make fools of themselves, and how  seldom they succeed!  </P> <P> And although their creator is sorry for his creatures (particularly the  females), he's not awash with compassion. They may be nice people, but that's  not to say that they are good people. What crooks, what rogues, what rascals,  these mortals be. In a small way, of course.  </P> <P> "A Chorus of Disapproval" is set in a town large enough to maintain an amateur  light-opera group and small enough to make the arrangement of an extramarital  affair difficult. This doesn't stop those inclined to such affairs, and the  high season seems to coincide with the rehearsal of the annual light opera,  here a revival of John Gay's "The Beggars' Opera" (1728).  </P> <P> Who will play Macheath? Certainly not the cringing little fellow who forces  himself to try out for a part as a step in recovering from the recent death of  his wife. Actor Joe Spano makes him a man who would have some difficulty asking  his neighbor to pass the butter. It's impossible to see him as an 18th-Century  rake.  </P> <P> In the immortal way of community-theater rehearsals, however, everything that  can go wrong does. (Ayckbourn has run a small theater in the seaside town of  Scarborough for 20 years, and only has to consult his diary here.) The part  goes to . . . guess who.  </P> <P> That might be enough for a funny one-joke play. But the joke gets better. Our  hero also finds himself playing the role of Macheath offstage, more through the  efforts of the ladies involved (including the director's wife, Caroline Smith)  than through his own.  </P> <P> Here we might think of Norman in Ayckbourn's "The Norman Conquests," another  unprepossessing little man with a talent for pleasing the girls. But where  Norman thought of himself as spreading joy, Spano makes it comically clear that  our hero hardly thinks at all. He simply goes along with it -- a Macheath by  default.  </P> <P> He is also an honest man, and that gets him into trouble with the husbands. The  end of the play, and also the beginning, shows what happens on opening night.  An earlier Ayckbourn might have made it a catastrophe, with the set falling  down and the actors bumping into each other. The mature Ayckbourn has something  else in mind.  </P> <P> In retrospect, this is a sad story. In the moment, David Emmes' SCR cast makes  it a wonderfully entertaining evening. There's the fun of watching David  Schramm trying to lash his amateurs into the semblance of a performance -- if  only they were professionals, so he could fire them! -- and the parallel fun of  watching Spano innocently falling prey to the ladies, including Anni Long, who  has an extremely modern arrangement with her husband, Jarion Monroe.  </P> <P> Whether any of this is from Ayckbourn's diary, one doesn't know, but it feels  observed, and the performances are equally observant. Note, for instance, how  seldom the listener catches anyone forcing a British accent. The accent is  simply there, and we can listen to the character.  </P> <P> At the same time, we're aware that we are watching our favorite Southern  California rep company, together again for the 81st time, and as fresh as ever  -- Hal Landon Jr., for instance, a nice old gentlemen who bursts into tears if  bullied, which guarantees that Schramm, a manly chap, will bully him.  </P> <P> Anyone who feels that Ayckbourn takes too dour a view of the human race simply  hasn't been on the planet long enough. But while we're wincing, we're also  smiling -- guilty creatures at the play. Beautifully designed by Michael Devine  (sets) and Susan Denison Geller (costumes -- including some charmingly cheesy  ones), "A Chorus of Disapproval" loses nothing in the original.  </P> <P>  Plays at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, Tuesdays-Fridays at 8 p.m.,  Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. Closes Oct. 15.

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Magnet holding company in receivership MAGNET, the UK fitted-kitchens retailer, was given a new lease of life yesterday as its main bank lendersput its heavily-indebted holding company, Airedale Holdings, into administrative receivership. The move almost certainly means that the subordinated creditors and shareholders involved in the controversial Pounds 700m (Dollars 1.06bn) management buy-out in 1989 will have to write off their investments. GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric of the US, is the largest subordinated creditor, with Pounds 70m outstanding. It is seeking to upgrade its position through legal action. The eight senior lenders to Airedale Holdings, owed an estimated Pounds 450m, will also only retrieve a proportion of their outstanding loans. They include Bankers Trust, Standard Chartered, Hill Samuel, Bank of Scotland, Creditanstalt, Bank of America, Continental Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank. The banks announced that their vehicle, Magnet Group, had purchased Water Meadow Holdings, which controls the Magnet business, from receivers for a sum believed to be in excess of Pounds 10m. Insiders said that about Pounds 25m of the senior debt had been swapped for equity in the new vehicle. The banks intend to float or sell Magnet Group within two to five years. The proceeds from flotation will be paid as a deferred consideration to Airedale's receiver, who will then pay off Airedale's creditors.</p>

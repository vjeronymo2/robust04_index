			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Books: The star from absolutely nowhere - Nigel Andrews is kept guessing by the growing legend of the great bad boy of American cinema JACK'S LIFE; A BIOGRAPHY OF JACK NICHOLSON by Patrick McGilligan Hutchinson Pounds 18.99, 475 pages The oddest thing about Jack Nicholson's superstardom is the way it began; or rather for ten years did not begin. From the late 1950s to the late '60s any fan of bargain-basement American cinema could have seen this actor in any number of lead roles. I did myself. But dashed if I or anyone I knew back then ever picked him out for major stardom. He was principle juvenile in Corman's The Raven and The Terror (both 1963); lead cowboy in two back-to-back Monte Hellman Westerns, The Shooting and Ride In The Whirlwind (1966); prominent biker in Hell's Angels On Wheels (1967). In every role he was the same, combining the forgettable good looks of a young Bob Cummings (remember him?) with the acting ability of a plank of wood. But when Nicholson played a supporting part in Easy Rider in 1969 - the twangy, worldweary Southern lawyer - he became an overnight sensation. Up went the salary; up went the living altitude; and up went the adrenalin of Hollywood gossip writers, sensing new copy in this fast-living, slow-talking, high-rolling man from absolutely nowhere. Patrick McGilligan's entertaining, well-researched book spares little in the matter of cocaine, womanising and the rest. Much of this, though, is born-again newspaper stuff, skilfully re-assembled. The real piece de resistance is the account of Nicholson's childhood and genealogy. He was brought up by a grandmother masquerading as his mother, even though his real mother was alive and around. He grew up amid a sea of relatives, mostly females beginning with 'E'. (Try to keep up with the Ellas, Emmas and Ethel Mays). And his real father - well, who was his real father? Was it John J. Nicholson or Eddie King or (shortest odds) Don Furcillo-Rose, who lived and apparently still lives in New Jersey and has yet to meet his probable son. This is all grist to the legend, which as with all stars is more interesting than the facts. As the great bad boy of modern American cinema, Nicholson would have to have been born on the wrong side of the sheets. As a late starter, who needed the right off-kilter role before maturing, he had to have had all that multiple mothering. And as a chameleon actor capable of every colour from antic mockery (Batman) to high emotionalism (Five Easy Pieces, A Few Good Men) to Stanislavskian self-effacement (Ironweed), he had to have all that warring Irish-American-European ancestry in his genes. Rich as McGilligan's material is, one has to quibble that a whole, consistent portrait of its subject never quite appears. There are finally too many Nicholsons. On one page he is a pleasure-seeker who uses and abuses women and friends, much as he uses and abuses certain substances. On another, he is he a control freak and right-wing homophobe. Now he is an instinctive actor, now a cerebral one; now a miser, now a spendthrift. Greatest riddle of all: is he a Citizen Kane imprisoned by his own wealth and fame or a Jolly Jack Star, riotously indifferent to the protocols of celebrity? The guessing game keeps us reading, but by final page we are still guessing. Does it matter? Not much. En route there is plenty to enjoy and to take home to form your own theories. I loved the account of Nicholson's Z-movie apprenticeship under the mythic Corman: one of whose cost-saving devices was to tear apart a script, giving each actor just his own bit. I hung on, as if to some compulsive soap opera, to the will-they-won't-they-find-happiness romance of Jack and Anjelica Huston (sometimes ill proof-read as Angelica). And a collector of filmic tittle-tattle could dine out for life on tales of the plum roles Nicholson rejected en route to stardom: from Jay Gatsby to Michael Corleone in The Godfather. It is only when McGilligan reaches for the final brushstroke or the Big Statement that the book wobbles. Or when the writer draws himself up for some clinching epigram on aesthetics. On Nicholson's three admittedly non-brilliant attempts at directing - Drive He Said, Goin' South, The Two Jakes - McGilligan says: 'He did not lead a structured life. He could hardly be expected to make a structured film.' Ah - really? Dear Vincent Van Gogh (or William Blake or Orson Welles or Fyodor Dostoevsky), You do not lead a structured life, so you can hardly be expected . . .</p>

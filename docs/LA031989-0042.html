			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTIQUES: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> NAVAJO JEWELRY  </P> <P> THE COLORS OF the desert sky and the magic landscape of the Southwest are  reflected in the Navajo jewelry made of silver and turquoise. Because Navajo  artisans made it primarily for their own and their family's adornment and for  religious ceremonies, each piece is unique.  </P> <P> From earliest days, the jewelry was fashioned with primitive tools. The  artisans used a hand drill for turquoise, and silversmiths worked with the  simplest of equipment. Today, techniques are much the same. The forge was a  square structure of stones and adobe mud; the bellows were of sheepskin, and  the anvil was simply a hard stone, later a piece of scrap metal from a plow or  wagon. The mold for making casts was often a piece of volcanic tuff, a light  pumice-like stone found on the reservation, and molds were greased with mutton  tallow. Charcoal came from local pinon and juniper branches.  </P> <P> The art of making silver began in earnest soon after the tribe started life on  the reservation, though it is probable that the Navajo had worked in metal as  early as the 18th Century. By the 1880s, tribal artisans were mounting  turquoise (found in mines near Santa Fe) in silver, often with the Spanish  flair they had learned from the Mexicans. At first, the silver in dimes and  quarters was used. When this was prohibited, the Mexican peso was used; later  traders provided silver slugs and sheets of silver. The metal was hammered by  hand, the silversmith singing as he worked.  </P> <P> Many of the designs were of Spanish origin, such as the squash blossom, which  in reality is the pomegranate blossom. Typical artifacts include the naja (a  crescent pendant hung from bridles), the ketoh (a wrist guard to protect from  the snap of a bow string), buckles, bracelets, "squash-blossom" necklaces,  rings, pins, earrings (worn by both men and women), buttons and special jewelry  such as "mother-in-law" bells, powder horns and tobacco canteens and, of  course, the popular concha belt discs.  </P> <P> All together this jewelry forms a Native American heritage of exquisite design,  and it is sought after by collectors all over the country. United States  cavalry officers in the 19th Century brought an enormous amount of Native  American artifacts to the East, including Navajo blankets and jewelry. Today it  is sometimes easier to find antique pieces in Massachusetts than in New Mexico.  </P> <P>  One of the best sources for the finest in antique and contemporary Navajo  jewelry is the Fairmont Trading Co. in South Pasadena, by appointment: (818)  796-3609. Some examples of Navajo work in its many forms may be found at the  following: Silver Man Gallery West in Brentwood; Taos Indian Trading Co. and  Hemisphere, both in Santa Monica; Native American Art Gallery in Venice;  Ortega's Capistrano Trading Post in San Juan Capistrano; Hopitu Indian Arts in  La Jolla Shores, and American Indian Store and Apache Trading Post, both in San  Diego.  </P></p>

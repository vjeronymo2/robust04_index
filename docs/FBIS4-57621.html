			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Jorge Shafik Handal, general coordinator of the </F> Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, FMLN, on behalf of  foreign delegations, before the Sandinist National Liberation  Front, FSLN, Special Congress at the Olof Palme Convention  Center in Managua on 20 May -- live]    [Text] Sandinist brothers and sisters; friends one and all;  Nicaraguan brothers and sisters:    The FSLN and FMLN are two revolutionary forces, which arose  amid vital, deep, heroic national and popular struggles. They  were born from the longest, the most excruciating, and the most  important historical convultions of our nations. This is why we  are a real, genuine, and excluding political force in the  forging of the present and the future of our countries.    To become what we are now, during the 1970s the FMLN and the  FSLN endured dispersion, ideological struggles, and the  emulation of strategies and tactics. This was followed by a  process of rediscovery and reunification, which was the  foundation of our success and final victory and our influence on  society as a factor for progress. It was fortunate for the FSLN  that the internal struggle of the 1970s only managed to produce  three trends. These trends did not rupture the Sandinist  foundations, and because of this, the movement's reunification  process was a profound one.    In El Salvador, the struggle among revolutionary forces led  to the creation of five revolutionary parties. The rediscovery  of our ideals brought about an alliance of parties that waged  the 12-year revolutionary war. We were, however, unable to come  together as one. Once the war was over, we became a party of  parties. It is easy to imagine the operational problems that  this can create.    Now the FSLN and the FMLN are both living a renewed  political  and ideological struggle, which has flourished from our  overturnings, shortcomings, and mistakes, and also from the  crumbling of socialism in East Europe and the former USSR. The  latter opened the way to an overwhelming and overpowering global  anti-socialist feeling, bolstered a thousand times over by the  unlimited proportions of modern communications. Having said  this, we could say that we have completed the list of reasons  for our current unity crisis. The fall of socialism gave us,  however, freedom to think with our own minds and the ability to  formulate our own way of thinking and our own ideology, based on  our own reality; with much fewer distortions than those produced  by centuries of ideological, political, and theoretical centrism  around Europe. We must use this liberty and not run straight  into one of the old-fashioned enclosures, where everything is  prepared for us.    We are so unfortunate. We must draft a new revolutionary  philosophy and simultaneously defend ourselves from the  pressures of conservatives, who have certainly modernized  themselves but who are the essentially same, while poverty  multiplies itself and the growing unsatisfied social needs  demand solutions here and now.    Poor little us, because we were unable to distinguish  between  ideology, theory, and politics. That is why we need to wage a  political and social struggle to provide the necessary solutions  to the theoretical issues and to the renewal of the  revolutionary ideology.    "Today, as yesterday, we revolutionaries need this debate  among ourselves, but we also need our strategies and tactics to  be put to the test. This is decisive. However, it is much more  dangerous to do this today than it was yesterday, because we are  now facing a contender who is utilizing tactics of triumphant  psychology, with even more material, political, theoretical, and  ideological resources. Instead of being a process of creative  development, the result could turn out to be the temptation to  fill this power vacuum, following that well-known basic law of  physics. Should we then remain immobile? No. Immobility is  not the strength of a revolution. The answer is in our own  history: Our strength is in our unity." Our unity, hopes, and  the people's strength rely on our unity as well. The  possibility for us to remain faithful to the ideals of freedom,  justice, and social progress and to the revolutionary ideals  depend on the people's strength. The possibility for us to  measure our innovations, strategies, and tactics also depends on  the people's strength. Today we now need a more intelligent  union than yesterday. We need a more open, more flexible union  in which each current of thought can express its identity and  assume its role. We need a union in which each current of  thought can prove to itself and to others its successes and  virtues. We need a more intelligent and flexible unity than the  one the FSLN had in the 1970's. Unity is indispensable to  resist, to consolidate ourselves, to move ahead, and to renew  ourselves and to continue being revolutionaries.    With this outlook in mind, we greet the victorious African  National Congress and President Nelson Mandela, the pride of  humanity. He is an example of revolutionary skill. We greet so  many other leftist parties and movements that have found the  path to understand their new role, to maintain their unity, and  to come out ahead.    Receive, my brothers, the hug of all FMLN members without  exception. From our hearts, we hope this FSLN congress will  have the greatest success. The FSLN needs it, it wants it, and  the Nicaraguan people expect it. The FMLN also needs the  success of the FSLN congress. Thank you very much.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] The Russian Federation Council decision  not to send peacekeeping forces to the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict zone did not go down well in Georgia or in Abkhazia.  But Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze hopes for a positive  outcome.    [Unidentified Correspondent] The unexpected complications in  the Russian leadership over deploying peacekeeping forces in the  Georgian- Abkhazian conflict zone evoked an equivocal reaction  in Georgia. The opposition to the Georgian leadership, which  thinks that Russia has no interest in stability in its southern  neighbor, discerns in this a confirmation of Russia's  unreliability as a partner. In particular, followers of Former  President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, demonstrating outside the UN  representation in Tbilisi against the presence of Russian troops  in Georgia, organized a protest action against the introduction  of Russian troops as peacekeepers in the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict zone.    The latest complications worry the Georgian leader as well.  Eduard Shevardnadze had a telephone conversation with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin on the subject today. In an exclusive  interview for the Today program, Eduard Shevardnadze said:    [Begin Shevardnadze recording] At this point doing anything  in contradiction to what has been agreed, on which agreement has  been reached at all levels, would be irrational and unwarranted.  It seems to me there was no prior explanation. Then, I think  the Russian leadership understands that a swift settlement of  the conflict is not only in the interests of Georgia, but of  Russia as well. An unstable Abkhazia, and an unstable Georgia  as a whole, are indisputably not conducive to establishing peace  and order in the North Caucasus. So this is evidently a  temporary phenomenon, and in a few days I think another decision  will be made, one that will be conducive to settling the  conflict. [end recording]</p>

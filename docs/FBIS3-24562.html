The conventional  method of such a synthesis is expanding the magnetic induction  into a Taylor series and subsequently selecting system  parameters which minimize several first terms of the series so  as to ensure that the deviation from field uniformity will not  exceed typically the 10[.sup]-5[/] % order of magnitude.  Regions with smaller deviation are obviously smaller. A  fourth-order and thus simplest magnetic system consisting of two  Helmholtz coils is inadequate for this application, because the  region with an even larger (10[.sup]-4[/] %) permissible  deviation from field uniformity is too small. In use are now a  sixth-order magnetic system of four coils (U.S. patent No.  4276529, 1981), compensated solenoids with a sixth-order outside  groove (Ravi Kumar and P. Chaddan in Cryogenics Vol. 27, 1987),  and an eighth-order magnetic system with three circuits (FRG  patent No. 35 17818). Even in these systems is the region of  uniform magnetic field still not large enough, unless they have  a large inside diameter but then so is their weight and power  requirement. A better alternative is shown to be a tenth-order  magnetic system with only three equally spaced solenoids having  equal inside diameters and wound with rectangular conductors, a  longer one with a smaller outside diameter between two identical  shorter ones with larger outside diameters along the common  axis. The method of Taylor series expansion is applied here to  the longitudinal component of magnetic induction at any point a  distance z away from the axis of a solenoid with an inside  radius R and a length L. The geometry of the central solenoid is  characterized by two dimensionless parameters  a[.sup]1[/],b[.sub]1[/]. The two lateral solenoids are  regarded as the difference between two solenoids with  dimensionless geometrical parameters  a[.sup]2[/],b[.sub]3[/] and a[.sub]2[/], b[.sub]2[/]  respectively. Such a magnetic system is thus characterized by  five dimensionless design parameters. With the value of  a[.sup]1[/] (or any one of the other parameters) specified,  the other four are evaluated as polynomial functions of that  one. This has been done numerically for a[.sup]1[/]= 1.1,  with each of the other four parameters expressed as complete  fifth-degree polynomial in a[.sup]1[/]- 1 with a free term  each. On this basis has been built a resistive MR imager with a  two-loop water cooling system. The solenoids are wound with  tubular rectangular conductors, the central one having 10 layers  of 72 turns and each lateral having 14 layers of 29 turns, for a  nominal magnetic induction of 0.1 T and an operating current of  111 A. The inside diameter and the total length are 71 cm and  176.8 cm respectively, the larger outside diameter being 87.3  cm. The diameter of the active region with a less than  10[.sup]-5[/] % deviation from field uniformity is 52 cm.  The imager weighs 800 kg and draws a power of 39 kW.</p>

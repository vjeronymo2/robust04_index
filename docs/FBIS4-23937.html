			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in </F> Niger on 15 June--recorded, in French with Portuguese subtitles;  translated from the Portuguese]    [Text] Speaking at a news conference in the Republic of  Niger yesterday, President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos  Santos said the Angolan Government is still committed to  searching for peace in Angola. In view of that, he has made  additional concessions to UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola]. The head of state once again expressed  his dissatisfaction with foreign interference in Angola's  domestic affairs.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent, in French  fading into Portuguese translation] Mr. President, you have just  attended the 30th OAU summit. The Angolan issue was one of the  points on the agenda. What is your opinion about the manner in  which the Angolan issued was dealt with?    [Dos Santos] The question of Angola was analyzed, first at  Ministers Council level, and afterward by the summit. The  Angolan delegation gave an exhaustive briefing about the  prevailing situation in our country. Our country has been at  war for 30 years, first against colonialism, then to cope with  South African aggressions, and lately, after the elections,  UNITA contested the election results by force of arms. So, we  are in a state of civil war. We dealt with elements regarding  the correlation of forces in the military field.    We also briefed the summit about the ongoing Lusaka talks  between the government and UNITA delegations. We have made  important progress at the talks. The summit adopted a  declaration on Angola, saluting the efforts that have been made  by the government in view of its flexibility and sense of  responsibility to bring peace to the country and create  conditions for national reconciliation.    We raised the question of foreign interference -- namely,  military assistance that UNITA continues to receive from certain  countries, from Zaire in particular. We have stated our  willingness to discuss this issue at length with our brother  from Zaire, His Excellency Marshal Mobutu. Preparations are  under way for a meeting between the presidents of Angola and  Zaire. This morning I spoke to him on the phone and reiterated  our desire to talk with him [President Mobutu] as brothers and  as a family to find a solution to the problem.    [Correspondent] It is known that the Angolan Government and  UNITA have been in negotiating in Lusaka. How has the situation  developed in your country?    [Dos Santos] As you know we have been at war since the  elections because the Bicesse Accord signed in Portugal on 31  May had shortcomings in terms of monitoring and verification.  As you know there was not a significant UN role because the  number of observers that monitored the cease-fire was  insufficient. But right now, after a year and a half of war we  can say that the military situation has evolved in the  government forces' favor. We have coped with the vacuum created  by the demobilization of government forces. UNITA had hidden at  least 20,000 men. It did not demobilize its army. At the onset  that enabled UNITA to control about 70 percent of Angola.  Nonetheless, people continue to abandon the zones occupied by  UNITA guerrillas.    Like I said, right now the situation is evolving in the  government forces' favor. I can add that right now UNITA only  controls 40 percent of the territory. That means that there is  a continual and positive evolution.    We ought to uphold the will of the people who elected the  government and opted for democracy. Power is not attained  through the force of arms as used to be said in the past. Now  the ballot is the weapon people use to uphold their interests  and aspirations. [end recording]</p>

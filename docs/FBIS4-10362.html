			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies yesterday decided by a  wide margin to approve a request presented by Deputy Luis  Alberto Mauro to interrogate Justice and Labor Minister Juan  Manuel Morales. The questionnaire the minister will have to  answer has, in principle, nine questions, but other questions  may be added during the questioning session. Colorado Party  followers tried to prevent the interrogation, but the  opposition remained firm and imposed their majority. [passage  omitted]</p>

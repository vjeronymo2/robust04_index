			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F> Ya'el Dan, Itay Engel, and Udi Segal -- live]    [Text] [Dan] We have the first reaction by a cabinet  minister to Syrian President al-Asad's remarks. You heard what  President al-Asad had to say at the Geneva news conference. Are  you satisfied or disappointed?    [Sarid] First, I think we have to wait to hear more about  what took place at the Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting. What we  know so far is what is public knowledge. We all know that  President Clinton's emissaries -- Dennis Ross and his colleagues  -- will arrive in Jerusalem tonight. We will receive details  from them, and sometimes the details are more important than  what we hear at a news conference. On the other hand, the  initial reports or signals we received from the news conference  are encouraging. I think we heard things we have never heard  before: First, we heard a Syrian readiness for full peace with  Israel, and even more important -- according to the U.S.  President's testimony -- al-Asad has made a commitment to  normalize relations with Israel. I think that is something we  very much wanted to hear, and now we have heard it.    [Dan] Did we hear al-Asad's definition of the substance of  peace, as we have been waiting to hear?    [Sarid] Full peace is a good term. Of course, when full  peace is mentioned we still have to see what it means. I assume  that in a meeting between two presidents lasting three or four  hours they did not make do with such a general term. I believe  that underlines even more what I said previously, that we have  to hear the details of the meeting and then analyze them. I  believe that based on what we heard from the Syrian president,  and even more so from the U.S. President, it is obvious that it  was not a disappointing meeting. Quite the contrary. I have  already mentioned full peace and a commitment to normalization  of relations with Israel. There is one sentence, which to me  appears very important: Syria regards full peace a strategic  option. From that we learn that it is not merely a Syrian  tactical move. We must compare that to the situation which  existed only two or three years ago. At that time, when Syria  referred to strategic considerations, it referred to strategic  parity with Israel, which meant another confrontation with  Israel. Now the strategic aim is peace. I believe that when we  study the two concepts we are witness to the huge distance we  have covered in the last two to three years in the geopolitical  and geostrategic situation in the Middle East.    [Engel] You therefore sound optimistic after hearing what  was said in Geneva.    [Sarid] I am definitely optimistic.    [Segal] Minister Sarid, what does that mean for Israel? The  ball is now in your court, you will have to make the difficult  decisions.    [Sarid] The ball has still not crossed into anybody's court.  It is in both the Syrian and Israeli courts. I definitely agree  with President Clinton's term that both sides will have to make  tough decisions. I called those decisions the most important  and difficult decisions any Israeli Government has made since  the establishment of the state. I believe that the decisions  facing the Syrian regime are no less tough. If we want peace,  then both sides will have to make those decisions soon.    [Dan] Let us put it all in a very concrete context. When  the Israeli and Syrian delegations meet in Washington next week  will they begin from a better starting point?    [Sarid] I believe so. Since we heard the remarks from the  horse's mouth, then I assume that the envoys will act  accordingly.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Munitions site to close A ROYAL Air Force munitions depot at Chilmark, Wiltshire, is to be closed as part of a reorganisation of the armed forces' facilities for storing and maintaining armaments. The measures are the last in a series of cuts in military support services, and involve responsibility for many RAF weapons being transferred to the other services. The Chilmark site, which employs 250 civilians, is to close in 1995. Officials said compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum. The Ministry of Defence has also decided to begin a redundancy programme at the naval depot of Trecwn, in south-west Wales. A plan to bring forward the closure date from 1996 to 1995 was discarded, but the MoD now plans phased redundancies among the 500 staff.</p>

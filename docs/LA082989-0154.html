			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHELLING SETS TANKER AFIRE OFF LEBANON;  </P> <P> 7 KILLED, 2 MISSING IN ATTACK ON SHIP DEFYING BLOCKADE  </P> <P> A tanker carrying fuel for Lebanon's besieged Christians was struck by Syrian  shellfire today and set on fire as it tried to run a Syrian blockade under the  cover of darkness, police reported. Seven crewmen were killed and two were  missing and feared dead.  </P> <P> The incident touched off a fierce five-hour artillery battle between the  Syrians and the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Aoun in and around divided  Beirut. Police said three people were killed and 16 wounded in the barrage,  which dwindled to intermittent mortar and machine-gun exchanges by 8:30 a.m.  </P> <P> That raised the casualty toll since fighting erupted March 8 to at least 795  people killed and 2,263 wounded.  </P> <P> Police said only two Lebanese among 11 crewmen aboard the tanker were rescued.  One of the survivors, Hanna Saddiq, said the tanker was attacked with missiles  by "a Syrian gunboat" enforcing the 5-month-old blockade off the Christian-held  coast during the night.  </P> <P> But a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations,  said the ship was shelled by radar-controlled Syrian howitzers deployed along  the seafront in Muslim West Beirut.  </P> <P> Syrian artillery batteries along West Beirut's seafront also fired on Aoun's  positions and the shelling quickly spread to residential districts, police  reported.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hit Off Maameltein  </P> <P> Police said the ship, identified only as the Sunshield, was hit at least once  by radar-guided artillery about 7 miles off Maameltein, an area 11 miles north  of this war-torn capital.  </P> <P> "As the captain shouted from the deck, demanding that the engine be switched  off, I found myself trapped inside a hell of fire," Paul Issa, one of the two  survivors, told the Christian Voice of Free Lebanon in a bedside interview at  the hospital.  </P> <P> Issa said he sustained severe burns as he threw himself into the sea that was a  mass of burning fuel.  </P> <P> "I had to swim for a while under the surface and I remained in the water for  more than 30 minutes before an army gunboat picked me up," he said with a  choking, somber voice.  </P> <P> The police spokesman said he had no information on the ship's tonnage, registry  or owners.  </P> <P> The spokesman said the Sunshield was carrying 550,000 gallons of gasoline  purchased by the Christian government headed by Aoun, which is vying for power  with a rival Syrian-backed Muslim Cabinet.  </P></p>

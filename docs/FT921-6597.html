			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Marketing deal by US airline UNITED AIRLINES, one of the two biggest US carriers, yesterday announced a marketing deal with British Midland, the UK's second largest scheduled airline. The two airlines will share frequent-flyer programmes, check-in facilities and flight codes. United said: 'This is the first time that a US carrier has shared flight codes on domestic UK flights.' The Civil Aviation Authority has extended the scope of the Air Travel Organisers Licence (Atol), which safeguards passengers against the failure of tour operators. Organisers of packages which use scheduled flights and those running charter-based holidays will need a licence.</p>

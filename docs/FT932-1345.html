			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Council wants pay-offs back HUNDREDS of former employees of a local authority whose severance scheme was ruled unlawful are to be instructed to return much of their redundancy pay - more than two years after leaving their jobs. North Tyneside Council has decided it must ask 342 former employees to repay the total of Pounds 1.4m they received in excess of their statutory minimum redundancy entitlement. If the former staff - most of whom are believed to have spent the money - refuse they will be treated in the same way as poll tax debtors and could face legal action. The Labour-controlled council introduced the scheme in September 1990. A 1991 test case in the High Court ruled that the scheme was unlawful. This was up-held by the Appeal Court last year.</p>

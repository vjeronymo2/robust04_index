			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies finally approved the  constitutional reform bill this evening. The Chamber of Deputies  president released a note this afternoon explaining the reasons  that prompted the drafting of the current text, which gave rise  to some observations by the Colorada and Batlleist Union. The  bill was carried by 78 votes to one--that of Helios Sarthou of  the MPP [People's Participation Movement]. The electoral court  will now make arrangements for the plebiscite.

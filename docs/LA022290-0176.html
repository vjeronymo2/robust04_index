			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RHYME AND REASON IN ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> LIFE STYLE: A POETRY READING EXPERIMENT IS CATCHING ON. "PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF  NOT THINKING," SAYS ONE PARTICIPANT. "PEOPLE REALLY WANT THIS."  </P> <P> It was a night of poetry versus the Big Chill on Monday, but despite  temperatures that dipped into the 40s, this ancient art form showed it still  carried heat for the human heart.  </P> <P> About 100 kindred spirits turned out for the third outing in a monthly series  for which the courtyard of Diedrich's Coffee &amp; Espresso Bar is transformed  into the ambitiously named Cafe of Dreams.  </P> <P> But according to audience members, poets and promoters, battling the literal  cold is only half the problem facing the angel-headed hipsters of Orange  County. Yet such hurdles as lack of community, growing pressures to conform,  subtle forms of censorship, a steamroller mass culture and a lack of social  alternatives for the smart and the cool may have helped to spark a resurgence  in the local poetry scene.  </P> <P> "People are tired of not thinking," said Lee Clark, a Long Beach musician and  poet. "People really want this. There's people here that I haven't seen in  years."  </P> <P> Lee Mallory, a poet and professor for the Rancho Santiago Community College in  Santa Ana, explained why he attended: "People are spiritually empty. Poets are  the cutting edge of consciousness. The poet is a subversive, but always for the  good."  </P> <P> Because the organizers are hoping to foster a greater sense of literary  preparedness, it is no small poetic coincidence that their logo for the Cafe of  Dreams closely resembles that of the Civil Defense.  </P> <P> "It's stuff you've never heard before," audience member Jessica Iverson said.  "You're going to hear it for the first time and probably the last time. You'll  probably forget most of it, but some of it you will remember."  </P> <P> Much was made Monday of the prospect of a freewheeling, uncensored poetry scene  developing in a conservative bedroom community such as Orange County. Poet Joe  Williams drew laughter and applause in proclaiming: "This is Orange County and  the multitudes have come to a poetry reading. Orange County isn't what it used  to be."  </P> <P> The poetry was as varied as the audience, which was made up of young and old,  the colorful and the staid. In the course of the 2 1/2-hour evening, topics  included lost love, alienation, social ills, humor, male foibles, parents and,  naturally, freeway driving.  </P> <P> "This is essential in Orange County," said Mark Carranza, of the Institute for  the Prevention of Design, one of the event's sponsors. A computer consultant by  day, Carranza has organized poetry readings at laundromats, industrial  complexes, the beach and other less likely places.  </P> <P> "Orange County is the land of the living dead," said Carranza. "There is  nothing else."  </P> <P> Kathi Georges, a graphic designer and another of the series organizers, said  she believes that the poetry readings fill a necessary niche in Orange County's  evolving culture. "I think it's very important. There's a new tendency to  conformity. You need to have that other outlet."  </P> <P> In contrast to the dark, smoky coffeehouses of beat-generation legend, there  was an exuberance and lack of pretension at the Cafe of Dreams. Tables and  chairs sat half the audience, while others made do on makeshift benches of wood  planks across milk crates. Some listened from the second-floor balcony.  </P> <P> Flamenco guitarists John Schuster and Jon Bryant began the evening and were  followed by featured poets Mitch Teemley and Joe Williams. The evening ended  after several members of the audience volunteered to share their recent work,  some of it written that evening.  </P> <P> "People can come here and find community sustenance," said Martin Diedrich,  host of the event, held the third Monday of each month at 8 p.m. "This is very  much a community event."  </P> <P> The owner of the bright, upscale Costa Mesa shop as well as a second location  in Tustin, Diedrich represents the third generation in his family to enter the  coffee business. He grew up on his family's coffee plantation in Guatemala and  missed the sense of community he knew there.  </P> <P> "In coming to Orange County, for years I really felt lost," he said. "I feel  I'm successful if people can come here and have a good time." He said his goal  is to capture the atmosphere of the traditional European coffeehouse, "not the  fancy, artsy stuff you see in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Georges said she believes that the crowds are larger for Orange County poetry  readings than those in Los Angeles, perhaps because there are fewer venues for  poetry here, thus concentrating the audiences.  </P> <P> For those who read new cultural events like tea leaves, the success of local  poetry readings may bode significant cultural changes ahead. "It's nice to go  someplace other than a (rock) concert," Lee Clark said. "People can come  together here, where you can't hear each other talk at a concert. People are  getting tired of rock 'n' roll."  </P> <P>  Cafe of Dreams will be held next on March 19 at Diedrich's Coffee &amp;  Espresso Bar, 474 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. Admission: free. Information: (714)  646-0323.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bundesbank sees stable rates soon THE German Bundesbank yesterday said it expected exchange rates to settle down after recent turmoil which led to an effective 6 per cent revaluation of the D-Mark against other currencies in the European monetary system (EMS). However, it suggested there may have to be more adjustments in the run-up to full monetary union (EMU), due by the end of the decade. Any remaining exchange rate uncertainties could come to light after next January when the Community formally establishes the single European market. In its October monthly report, the bank reiterated its insistence that EC members should use any opportunities to change parities within the exchange rate system up to the final transition to monetary union. Meanwhile, the recent effective revaluation of the D-Mark had brought its value back into line with that achieved by the last formal realignment within the EMS in 1987. This made it easier to control inflationary tendencies in Germany, 'so that the quite considerable reductions in German interest rates achieved so far are not endangered'. Meanwhile, inflation was still well above 3 per cent, and the side-effects of recent interventions in money markets had exacerbated the difficulties of controlling money supply growth.</p>

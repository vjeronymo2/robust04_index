			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Zhuravlev article under the "Day's Topic" rubric: </F> "We Are All Hostages of the Military-Industrial Complex. Charm  of the Directors' and Generals' Budget"]    [Text] On 11 May 1994, following the heartfelt speech in  the State Duma by V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian  Federation Government, who declared that "the government has  done the maximum possible to observe the fragile balance of  everyone's interests in the draft that has been submitted," the  most important indicators of the State Budget for 1994 were  approved:    income -- 124,477.0 billion rubles [R]    expenditure -- R194,495.31 billion    deficit -- R70,018.31 billion (36 percent of the sum of  expenditure).    Votes for -- 237; votes against -- 77; abstentions -- 12.    Ten minutes after this vote it suddenly came to light that  "there is a more than two-fold discrepancy in expenditure  between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense: 87  and 37. This "discovery" was made by A. Piskunov, deputy  chairman of the Duma Defense Committee.    What is this figure "37"? It is the sum of expenditure in  Section V -- "National Defense" -- R37.126 trillion.    It turns out that the figure of R37 trillion for expenditure  in respect of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, which  features in all the previous versions of the State Budget  submitted by the government, does not suit the military  department, which secured the creation of a special commission  consisting of State Duma deputies and representatives of the  government and the Security Council. In a closed session the  commission decided on defense expenditure in the sum of R55  trillion, i.e. 50 percent more than proposed by the government  and signed by the prime minister. It is curious that the  commission's corresponding protocol on this subject supposedly  even has a corresponding conciliatory resolution of the Russian  Federation president, but the chairman of the government knows  nothing at all about this protocol. He at once confirmed this:  "...I do not know who discussed this question with whom or  where. It is possible to examine everything not only within the  limits of a 36-percent deficit." But since R55 trillion  corresponds to 41 percent [figures as puiblished] of the budget  deficit, the corresponding amendment to the Law on the State  Budget did not get through. Despite repeated attempts to force  through this additional expenditure.    They decided to return to this subject later, and a closed  plenary session of the State Duma was even planned for 27 May to  examine secret [zakrytyy] subheads of the budget. The session  did not take place. I will not repeat the sham grounds for  deferring this examination until 8 June this year. I believe  that the deep-seated reason lies in tactics, as is customary  with the military. Undisguised agitation for an increase in  military spending has been mounted in the pages of the press and  on radio and television during these two weeks. Even deputies  on the reforming wing have begun to frighten their other  colleagues with the sociopolitical consequences of underfunding  the defense sphere, with the loss of military technologies, with  a shortfall in export proceeds, etc. The recommendation which  the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly formulated at its  closed session 2 June 1994 is also along the same lines. So  /the adoption of a so-called compromise military budget, but  essentially an astronomical one forcibly extorted by the bigwigs  of the military-industrial complex, is virtually predetermined/  [passage between slantlines printed in boldface]. They will  vote, like dear little deputies wishing to please the military,  for R55 trillion for our generals and general directors  [generaly i generalnyye].    Before showing what this is fraught with, I should, for  purposes of a clearer comparison, decipher this colossal sum  somewhat:    maintenance of the Armed Forces -- R26.3 trillion    purchases and development of armament and military hardware  -- R17.4 trillion    capital construction and expenditure by the Ministry of  Atomic Energy -- R8.8 trillion    servicemen's pensions -- R2.5 trillion.    Let us note that the Ministry of Defense has 2.1 million  servicemen. And yet there are also many other military people  in Russia. There are approximately 300,000 in the Internal  Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, approximately  200,000 in the Border Troops, and almost 80,000 in the Federal  Counterintelligence Service. Expenditure on these departments  "sits" in Section VII -- "Law-Enforcement Activity and Security  Organs" -- and amounts to R12 trillion.    Let us count up, dear reader, and add on to the R55 trillion  the other expenditure on people who wear shoulder boards, as  well as other expenditure connected with preparation for war and  for other emergency situations. What used to be called "civil  defense" has now acquired the name of the "Ministry for Affairs  of Civil Defense, Emergency Situations..." and is headed by  generals, has thousands of servicemen, and uses up approximately  R2 trillion in Section XII, including R344 billion on  mobilization preparation.    Does Section XI -- "Replenishment of State Stocks and  Reserves" -- have no bearing on defense expenditure? Some R5.9  trillion is planned for this, plus almost R0.5 trillion under  Section X -- "Reserve Funds."    Section XIV -- "Financial Assistance for Organs of State  Power of Components of the Russian Federation and Local  Self-Management" -- contains the following interesting long line:    "-- subsidies for budgets of closed  administrative-territorial formations within whose bounds  installations of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and  Ministry of Atomic Energy are located."    The small town of Shkotovo-17 in Maritime Kray, or the city  of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy-50. You will not find them on the  map, but this unexpectedly slipped through in the draft State  Budget: "to transfer from the Federal Budget on account of the  first quarter of 1994..." subsidies in the sum of almost R3  billion each. Line by line -- and R583 billion has been clocked  up for a few dozen numbered cities. Is this military or  nonmilitary expenditure?    There is one more "nonmilitary" subhead of expenditure --  XIV  [figure as published], entitled "Other State Expenditure."  Military expenditure is also hidden here. For example:    -- payment of allowances for dependants and children of  servicemen -- R150 billion    -- the Russian Defense-Sports-Technical Society (the former  DOSAAF [Voluntary Society for the Promotion of the Army,  Aviation, and Navy]) -- R9 billion    -- rent for use of the Baykonur Cosmodrome -- R135 billion    -- the Federal Railroad Troops Directorate -- R282 billion    -- the Federal Road Construction Directorate under the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, and others -- R171  billion.    This subhead is particularly rich in concealed additional  expenditure of a military nature. It includes, in addition to  that enumerated, military research by the Ministry of Health,  the Committee for Convention Problems of Disarmament, the State  Technical Commission, and other departments headed by generals.  Also hidden here is expenditure by the Federal Directorate of  Special Construction with its 100,000 military construction  workers and multitude of generals, other military construction  directorates, corporations, etc. I managed to dig up  approximately R1.5 trillion in expenditure of a military nature  concealed under this subhead.    It is hardly worth denying the involvement with the military  sphere of the R755 billion on the "defense industry conversion"  line or the R837 billion under "realization of international  treaties on the elimination, reduction, and limitation of arms."    I could enumerate still more, but I have already clocked up  a  sum approaching R80 trillion. I am not sure whether the R4.2  trillion contained in line IV -- "Basic Research and Promotion  of Scientific and Technical Progress" -- (much of which will,  moreover, be used in military matters) will be realized or  whether Moscow, which is stuffed with military structures, will  get its R3 trillion in subventions to perform the functions of  the capital. I am not sure whether VUZ's [higher educational  institutions] and vocational and technical schools will get R5  trillion, and culture and art R0.86 trillion. But I do not  think that anyone is in any doubt that the aforementioned R80  trillion will definitely be spent. For at the beginning of the  year a soldier's complete set of uniform clothes along with  synthetic leather [kirzovyy] boots cost R500,000. How many  wearers of boots and uniforms we have! Not counting the  generals' expensive stars. All this unproductive,  nonreturnable, irreversible expenditure in the State Budget will  certainly be passed. This is almost 65 percent of the revenue  part of the State Budget. Truly a wartime budget.    The author has gone too far, you will say. Not at all. I  still have not added in expenditure on the current upkeep of  military commissariats, on severance pay on being drafted for  military service, on funding of military training in technical  colleges and VUZ's, expenditure under the Russian Federation Law  "On the Status of Servicemen" (running to many trillions of  rubles), the average monthly wages of enterprise workers at the  time of their participation in military training courses, etc.  In addition, hidden funding of military expenditure is provided  out of the income made from selling military property and from  the economic activities of economically accountable enterprises  -- for example, the 100 military state farms. This and other  revenue is not taken into account in the budget.    By the way. The government recently submitted to the State  Duma information entitled "On the Implementation of the Federal  Budget for 1993." Take a look, messieurs deputies, at this very  curious document.    It states, in particular: "Total revenue -- R17,124.03  billion." In the "expenditure" column: line "8. Defense --  R7,209 billion" (42 percent of the revenue part). Lines 2, 6,  7, 10, 16, and 21 also contain approximately R3,500 billion of  additional expenditure of a military nature. Altogether,  approximately 63 percent of the revenue part. This was the  budget that was realized last year. In 1994 there was an  attempt to lower this threshold just a little. But this attempt  came up against very tough resistance from the  military-industrial complex and its latter-day lobbyists in the  Federal Assembly. They make everyone knuckle under: their  colleagues at the voting desks, the government, the president,  and you and me, the taxpayers.    We are all hostages of our military-industrial complex. No  military reform is taking place in the country. The switch to  professional Armed Forces is being blocked with references to  Russia's special geopolitical position, and there are still many  millions of soldiers. Russia's technological backwardness is  being conserved. All this behind closed doors. They use  mystery to conceal lies. The economic consequences of the  militarized nature of the budget and of the resumption of the  arms race will be catastrophic. It is time to call a halt and  look back. For Russia has been living throughout the 20th  century under virtual wartime conditions and under the occupying  regime of its own homegrown military-industrial complex.</p>

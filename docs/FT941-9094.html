			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bangkok Land up 8% in quarter Bangkok Land, Thailand's largest property developer, reported an 8.5 per cent rise in third-quarter consolidated net profits to Bt1.35bn (Dollars 53m), which was roughly in line with brokers' expectations. Analysts are particularly keen to examine the balance sheet, which should be available within the next few days, for evidence that property buyers are paying promised cash instalments which could show that the company's core project, the huge Muang Thong Thani new town project on the outskirts of Bangkok, is viable. Firm signs that potentially crippling accounts receivables are being honoured could bolster the chances of Bangkok Land completing a planned Dollars 600m Euroconvertible. The proposed issue - which would be Thailand's largest - would fund the construction of an elevated urban railway for Bangkok. Nine-month consolidated net profits rose 21 per cent to Bt4.26bn. Earnings per share improved 8.7 per cent to Bt2.26 in the third quarter and rose 21 per cent at Bt7.11 for the nine months. TPI Polene, the cement and plastics maker, reported net income down 34 per cent in the first quarter to Bt287m. Brokers, however, say that foreign exchange gains of Bt346m inflated the first quarter 1993 figures resulting in the year-on-year drop.</p>

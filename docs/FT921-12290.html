			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Mountleigh It is unusual, not to say dangerous, for any property deal to be announced these days before the ink on the contract is dry. But assuming Mountleigh's Merry Hill sale goes through as planned, the company can justly claim that its disposal programme is on track. The Pounds 125m price tag, moreover, is a reminder that the market for retail and industrial sites gets stronger the further north one travels. It is worth remembering that the UK's quoted property companies, which have underperformed by 30 per cent over the last 12 months, are heavily biased towards London and the south east. Even so, Mountleigh has a formidable mountain to climb, and investors will reasonably ask what it plans for an encore. The gap between its interest bill and rental income is dauntingly wide and can only be significantly narrowed now by successfully finding purchasers for non-yielding assets. Last year's rights proceeds will presumably keep the lenders at bay, but it is hard to escape the conclusion that in practice Mountleigh is another Rosehaugh-style work-out on behalf of the banks. Yesterday's 10 per cent slide in the shares to 9 1/2 p offers chairman Sir Ian MacGregor another opportunity to average down on his personal holdings. But it will take more than a promise to keep up the attack on costs and an overdue decision to stop capitalising interest charges to persuade other investors to follow suit. In particular, there is confusion about the value of the Spanish retailer Galerias in the light of its persistently poor trading results. A company which once had the lofty ambition to pay Pounds 2bn for Storehouse can surely do better in explaining itself.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lucas sets up European component joint ventures LUCAS Industries yesterday moved to strengthen its position in European automotive components markets by announcing two joint ventures. The first, with Sagem of France, is designed to expand gasoline engine management systems sales. Lucas, in addition to technical staff, is putting its Greenville, South Carolina, plant into the venture, while Sagem is transferring two French plants to create a company with Pounds 20m of assets and turnover of Pounds 50m. Sagem will have management and equity control; Lucas will have a 30 per cent stake. The other venture is with Autobrzdy, the Czech brakes company. Initially Lucas will have a minority stake, but expects to assume majority control after 1996, by which time it will have invested Pounds 9m in the joint venture. Autobrzdy supplies brakes to Skoda, now within the VAG group, which is Lucas's biggest customer for braking systems. From the Lucas point of view, the joint venture keeps it close to a customer expanding into a new area.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / A harvest of sorrows: The impact of Europe's farm reforms For some of the UK's larger farmers, Thursday's agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will seem like a stay of execution. With luck, and assuming the details of the agreement, when they are released next week, live up to the claims of EC agriculture ministers, the most efficient and least heavily borrowed will survive for a few more years. But the Brussels deal is not a reprieve; rather, farmers are still under sentence on Death Row. The first MacSharry plan 18 months ago prepared them for extinction. It threatened to force them to take large chunks of land out of production without offering compensation for the resulting losses. Only smallholders in the UK and peasant farmers in other parts of the Community would have been anything like as well off as they are now - and that is not well off at all. It looked like a misguided exercise designed to destroy the potential to produce cheap, wholesome food; to preserve the drudgery of running small farms which non-participants perceive as the rustic charm of the countryside ; and to discriminate against the UK because of its superior farm structure and larger average size. It also seemed ready to institutionalise inefficiency. The British farming industry has already suffered severe cuts in income over the past few years and is not in good shape to tolerate further pressure. As Mr John Nix, the agricultural economist, says in the introduction to the last edition of his farm management pocketbook - the bible by which many farmers plan their businesses - 'farm incomes per hectare (in the UK) are now well below half the mid 1960s figure in real terms, while national average earnings (of the rest of the population) have risen by about a third'. Against that background, the fact that even big acreage farmers will, under this week's package, be compensated for land taken out of the production of commodities in surplus, or set-aside, seems like a breakthrough. Similarly, the agreement to raise the upper limit on sheep flock and beef herd sizes to more realistic levels and still allow at least half the rate of headage compensation paid to smaller farmers is a worthwhile concession although probably not sufficient to save significant numbers of hill farmers. Mr Nix says the future for many farmers looks bleak: 'They can only farm as well as they can, spend less (if that is possible) both on and off the farm, and wait for the eventual upturn - whenever that might be.' And that judgment was based on commodity prices before the cuts that have just been announced. In other words, the reform package will make farmers' situation worse. The NFU, for instance, estimates that arable farmers will have their net incomes cut, after area compensation, by Pounds 30 per hectare (Pounds 12 per acre) next year. With profit margins as slim as they are, that is serious. The obvious way to save that much money is to cut manpower. Indeed several of my farming neighbours have already said they intend to do just that. With 15 per cent of the land out of production, and only needing to be mown a few times a year, there will be less work to be done. A tractor driver's pay, national insurance and other costs to his employer come to about Pounds 12,000, so the decision is easily made. Or is it? On my own Norfolk farm, the labour force has been reduced for many years in response to income pressure. I now have only three men working on the arable side of the farm, and many of the jobs they do require a gang of at least that size in order to achieve maximum efficiency. Bring the number down to two, and the balance and speed of work such as sowing and harvesting would be disrupted. This would lead to less efficient work and make it more vulnerable to wet weather. The probability that other EC legislation seems set to limit the number of hours farm and other workers will be allowed to work will restrict flexibility further and can only make matters worse. More workers will have to leave the land because their employers cannot afford to keep them. The reform package, with its set-aside provisions, makes it inevitable that rural unemployment will increase. For there will also be fewer jobs in agriculture's ancillary trades. With 15 per cent of Britain's farm land set aside, there will be less grain, oil seed, sugar beet and other crops to haul from farm to processing plant. With less land being cultivated, fewer tractors and farm implements will be needed and the farm machinery trade will decline even further from its already depressed level. A Norfolk machinery dealer told me that Macsharry was the last straw. He has already decided to give up the struggle to make a profit and he will sell up as soon as possible. Sales of inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and crop protection chemicals will also decline. Moreover, fertiliser and chemical sales may fall further than the obvious 15 per cent based on the set-aside acreage. Farmers will be looking at the new pricing structures, and calculating whether the optimum levels of such products may have changed. Last year, for instance, it quickly became clear that area payment for oil seeds combined with a lower sale price meant that the optimum yield for the best return had declined from the biggest tonnage it was possible to grow (probably in excess of 1.5 tonnes per acre) to around 1 tonne per acre. From that viewpoint, the new measures may achieve reduced production, as ministers require, and bring about perceived improvements in the environment. What it will not do is cut the cost of the CAP to EC taxpayers. Indeed, it is accepted that for the first few years, expenditure will increase. On the positive side, the lower cereal prices the reform package will bring about should reduce the cost of livestock feed. And consumers? Will they benefit by being able to buy cheaper food? I suggest that this is a pipe dream. The proportion of the retail price the farmer gets is tiny and any advantage brought about by lower raw material prices may be absorbed by the food trade. Meanwhile, I must face the unpalatable prospect of more than 150 acres of my farm growing weeds instead of crops. One Lincolnshire farmer on top-quality land said that he would have to be dragged into set-aside. He would far rather sell his grain for whatever he can get and forego any area compensation. It is not clear whether such a course of action will be legal. Set aside will also be unpopular among farmers because much of the pleasure of farming lies in trying to grow better crops every year. Passing motorists are unlikely to welcome the policy either, especially when they realise that a portion of their taxes is paying me to grow nothing on that land. That alone will lead to intense pressure to cut the payments. And then there remains the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is still unresolved. Will an agreement in Geneva cut farm incomes still further? Will farmers find it even more difficult to survive in business? The hope for farmers is that the governments of the world will take so many measures, on the lines of CAP reform, in order to cut food production that they will overdo it and cause shortages. When you look closely at the rundown in world stocks of some basic commodities over recent years and discount some of the very localised rhetoric on European surpluses, that possibility does not seem out of the question. If that happened farmers would be only too pleased to sell produce at world market prices.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Lebanese budget to hit spending THE Lebanese government said yesterday it was cutting public spending and studying plans to sell off some state services to rescue the economy, Reuter reports from Beirut. Mr Michel Samaha, the information minister, said public spending for 1992 would not exceed 1,930bn Lebanese pounds (Pounds 570m) while revenue was expected to be 1,200bn pounds. 'Bringing back financial and fiscal stability is very vital to regaining confidence in the economy and currency,' Mr Samaha said. The previous government was toppled on May 6 by street protests against the economic crisis. In a draft 1992 budget, the government had forecast its revenues at 867bn pounds for the year. Speaking after a four-hour cabinet meeting, Mr Samaha said the government had decided to reduce the public sector deficit from 56 per cent of overall spending in 1991 to 38 per cent this year. Public sector deficits averaged 80 per cent of expenditures between 1984 and 1991. Mr Samaha said that the government planned to slash the deficit to 20 per cent of total spending in the second half of 1992, from 54 per cent of total spending in the first half of this year. He said the cabinet was studying plans to privatise services such as electricity and telecommunications, partially or totally, and would discuss with foreign organisations setting up a fund to support the currency. Despite the end of the civil war in 1990, Lebanon has failed to attract sufficient foreign aid and investment to bring the economy back to life and repair war damage estimated at Dollars 15bn (Pounds 7.8bn).</p>

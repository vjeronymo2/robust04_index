			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> STAGE;  </P> <P> AUGUST WILSON  </P> <P> Today among the most produced playwrights in this country, August Wilson left  high school for the reading room of Pittsburgh's Carnegie Library. He held  assorted odd jobs and wrote at night: poetry, short stories, and, finally,  plays. When his play, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," was accepted for the  prestigious Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference in  1982, then developed in regional theater en route to Broadway, black America  acquired a powerful and poetic dramatic voice.  </P> <P> The St. Paul-based storyteller, whose own grandmother walked from North  Carolina to Pittsburgh, weaves together the contemporary black experience and  its historical precedents. Turning out a play a year, the 44-year-old poet is  chronicling black America decade by decade through this century.  </P> <P> "Ma Rainey" was set in a Chicago recording studio in the '20s, "Fences" in  black domestic life of the '50s, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" in a Pittsburgh  boardinghouse in 1911. All three won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award,  while "Fences" also won the 1987 Pulitzer and four Tony awards. This season,  there are 16 regional theaters presenting "Fences," making it the second most  produced play on U.S. professional stages (after Dickens' "A Christmas Carol.")  </P> <P> His newest play, "The Piano Lesson," is due at the Doolittle Theater here in  mid-January. The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday  Calendar editor. BARBARA ISENBERG  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The minister of foreign affairs, the honorable  Molapo Qhobela, has refuted reports broadcast by the foreign  media that a task force has been set up in the country to look  into, as well to settle, the Army [word indistinct].    Briefing the Royal Lesotho Defense Force members based at  (Ha  Rakamose) today, Mr. Qhobela said there is no such task force  and there will never be. He indicated that it is only the  Commonwealth special envoys who are here to help the government  in quelling the situation. Mr. Qhobela said the government was  not hiding a thing and believes in transparency to avoid  conflicts, like the one in Lesotho that has resulted in factions  within the Army.    He reiterated that the Army belongs to the nation and no  individual church or political leader can own it. Mr. Qhobela  briefed the soldiers about meetings held by the envoys with  members of the diplomatic corps, the churches and political  leaders which he said were very fruitful. The Commonwealth  envoys, after their meeting with soldiers at (Ha Rakamose), will  then hold a similar meeting with soldiers based at Makoanyane  after lunch.</p>

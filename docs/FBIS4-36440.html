			<p>BFN     [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve  him, has said: At this stage, it has become clear to everyone  that the leadership has begun to take care of some details.  This change is for known reasons, the most important of which  is that the leadership does not want the negative details of  life to turn into a phenomena leading to laxity and apathy  toward solvable issues. In life, he who believes in grand  principles should not say that there are insoluble issues. It  could be that not all matters are as one might wish, but nothing  is insoluble. Some solutions may need time and capabilities  that happen to be unavailable. But to impair the human will,  this will lead to impotence, which starts as a feeling and turns  into an effect with universal impact. Therefore, it is  impermissible for the Ba'th state to age, grow old, or become  flabby. It should remain youthful and wise at the same time.    These remarks were made during a meeting between the leader  president and a number of writers, journalists, and editors in  chief. Hamid Yusuf Hammadi, minister of culture and  information; 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, head of the Cultural Forum in  Iraq; and Nuri Najm al-Marsumi and Naji Sabri al-Hadithi, under  secretaries of the Ministry of Culture and Information, attended  the meeting.    His excellency, may God watch over him, added: Based on  this, the leadership began to take care of issues that used to  be within the tasks of ministers or directors general. This is  because when small things impact on large and medium issues  concerning the peoples' psychological makeup, and impact real  life on the level of economics and politics, then the  leaderships' actions derive their legitimacy from what we have  just described in the people's life. The leadership wants the  people to be happy. In accordance with our concept, happiness  does not always come from material life, but when the stage and  circumstances affects the material life of the people, it is  necessary for the leadership to play a role in generating a  feeling of happiness.    His excellency said: Within the historical context of rights  and duties, the Iraqis have proven that they are qualified to do  their duties, and that they deserve to enjoy their rights.  Here, there will be no need to invoke history to interpret  citizens' stands in light of the past, but this needs constant  awareness. Under difficult circumstances, if awareness is not  as it should be, there will be no strength to overcome an ordeal  or a difficult circumstance, even though there is genuineness.    During the meeting, discussions dealt with a host of issues  related to citizens' lives and daily affairs, the role of media  in providing the citizens with new information and analyses, and  in bolstering their awareness in a way to promote their strength  and determination to overcome the effects of the unjust blockade  on our great Iraq.</p>

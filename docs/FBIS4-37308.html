We draw your attention to  our correspondent's report on this.    [Correspondent] During the inaugural session that was held  with the participation of an envoy of the United Nations  secretary general, Mr. Velayati -- stressing the Islamic  Republic of Iran's efforts to establish a just peace in  Tajikistan -- considered the existence of common cultural,  historical, religious, and linguistic bonds between the two  nations to be an indication of their ancient ties.    Referring to the regretful crisis in Tajikistan, he stressed  the need for establishing stability in the Central Asian states  and said: The establishment of peace and stability in that  region is one of the priorities of Iran's foreign policy with  regard to the expansion of cooperation with the Central Asian  states. Mr. Velayati added: We believe the resolution of the  Tajik crisis to be the bright spot of regional cooperation for  peaceful coexistence with regional states.    In conclusion, our country's foreign minister called for a  more active participation by the world states in offering  economic assistance after the establishment of peace in  Tajikistan.    During the course of the session, Mr. Ramero Piriz Ballon,  the UN secretary general's envoy at the Tajikistan peace talks,  called for a more active role by international organizations,  stressing the need to end the crisis in Tajikistan. He said:  The realization of peace in Tajikistan will not be achieved  without taking into consideration the wishes of all the parties.    Expressing his pleasure over the fact that the two sides  have  now realized that the only way to achieve peace is through the  continuation of talks and by finding peaceful means, Mr. Ballon  said: The establishment of grounds for mutual trust is one of  the factors that can play a role in the promotion of the talks.    Mr. Gyurov, representative of the Tajik Government, the  third  speaker at the session, stressing Iran's good intentions in its  past efforts in realizing peace in Tajikistan, said: We good  progenies of Ferdosi and Khayyam [famous Iranian poets] and  other great Farsi speakers are prepared to achieve fundamental  solutions for the Tajik crisis through peaceful means in our  ancestral homeland. He added: The Tajik nation is in need of  stability and tranquillity today, and we hope to attain a  definite result in these talks.    The last speaker at today's session was Mr. Latifi, the  opposition group representative. Stressing that various  dimensions of the Tajik catastrophe are still hidden, he said:  International forums have only uncovered a sad corner of this  regrettable tragedy. Stressing that opposition groups do not  seek bloodshed, he said: We stress the territorial integrity of  Tajikistan and hope the talks will bear results as soon as  possible and that the Muslim people of Tajikistan will be  liberated from this disaster.    Finally, the representative of the opposition forces at the  peace talks thanked Iran for its pivotal role in realizing peace  in Tajikistan.    Present at the second round of Tajikistan peace talks in  Tehran were representative of Iran, Russia, Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the CSCE, and the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as heads of the  diplomatic missions of foreign countries residing in Tehran.

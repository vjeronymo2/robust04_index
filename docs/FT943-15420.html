			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abolition of a floating charge too radical Sir, I was interested to read Sir Michael Grylls's letter (June 28) in support of the proposal to abolish the floating charge. The argument is that the floating charge encourages excessive gearing for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), inhibits the borrower and places trade creditors at a disadvantage; its abolition would lead to a more robust lending environment in the UK along European lines. l have a great deal of sympathy with the symptoms identified by Sir Michael  -excessive reliance on short-term finance and over-geared businesses in the SME sector. Too often in the recent recession we have seen small companies fall victim to excessive zeal in enforcing 'on demand' facilities. However, I am not convinced that the prescribed medicine is the answer. I believe that the abolition of the floating charge altogether would merely lead to a drying up of funding for SMEs. What they need is a change in the mix of funding away from short-term money in favour of medium-term or long-term debt. Fundamentally, SMEs need permanent capital for growth - that is, equity. For companies, say, with less than 100 employees, the market does not serve the needs of the SME sector at all well. In Yorkshire we are the only player seriously committed to the provision of equity at this end of the market. Here, there is a responsibility on all those engaged in this sector - professional advisers, training and enterprise councils, bank managers, and even the newly expanding Business Links, to encourage expansion through external investment in SMEs. The sensitive use of externally sourced long-term capital funding for the small business could be a significant contributory factor in strengthening this vital part of the UK's economic future.

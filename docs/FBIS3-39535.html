"There is absolutely no change in our position. We will hold  no official talks with the observer, as we believe that the EU's  involvement in the Cyprus problem is uncalled-for and completely  counterproductive," Foreign Ministry acting spokesman Ferhat  Ataman told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS.    Ataman's denial of any change in the Turkish position  followed the arrival of Serge Abou, the EU-appointed observer to  Ankara in the delegation of Leon Brittan, the EU Commission,  came as part of the delegation and not as an observer. "His  duty as observer has not yet started," diplomatic sources said.  "Ankara has made it clear that the observer would not be welcome  in Turkey."    The European Union, giving in to Greece's insistence on the  appointment of an observer, has tried to appease Turkey by  appointing a "middle-ranking Eurocrat" rather than a "star" like  Leo Tindemans, the former Belgian foreign minister. Then the  Union announced that the "observer" would only report  developments and progress on the Cyprus question, rather than  take part in the negotiations.    But these moves failed to calm Ankara which firmly believes  that Greece, a direct party to the conflict, would at the same  time become "the prosecutor, the judge and the accused" if the  EU became involved in the conflict.    Ankara's dilemma, however, lay in the fact that Serge Abou,  handpicked by the Commission with the hope of appeasing Turkey,  is decidedly pro-Turkish and regarded in Ankara as "a friend and  ally." Given these facts, it would have been awkward for Ankara  to reject the EU's "subtle diplomacy" of bringing in "Abou as  part of the delegation, particularly when he did not use the  title of `Cyprus observer.'"    "(But) the identity and the inclinations of the observer are  irrelevant. We reject the principle of the decision," a Turkish  official said.    The same official stressed that Abou had come as part of the  customs union delegation, rather than with the title of EU  observer, and that his duty had not officially started yet. But  the question of Cyprus was discussed during the official talks.  "I am pleased to note that Turkey supports the  confidence-building measures," Brittan announced in a joint  press conference with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "GE to Invest $500m in New Projects in </F> China"]    [Text] General Electric Company (GE), a U.S.-based  multinational industrial giant, is planning to take a bigger  slice of the Chinese market for its twelve major business units.    "We will invest approximately $500 million more in China  over  the next three to five years," said Jeffrey Gannon, President  and CEO of GE China in an exclusive interview with CHINA DAILY  over the weekend.    The figure excludes investment by GE Capital, a specialized  investment arm of the company, which has total assets of more  than $211 billion.    GE Capital has over $1 billion invested in Chinese aircraft  and container leasing operations, which it has run for several  years. It is planning to upgrade its representative office into  a wholly owned branch later this year, Gannon said.    GE plans to set up seven major new enterprises in China,  either wholly owned or in joint ventures, by 1996.    They will be in the areas of lighting, plastics,  locomotives,  hydropower, gas and steam turbine generators, appliances, and  financial services.    "We are planning for the next 100 years in China, and we  want  to be a Chinese company, an insider of the Chinese economy,"  Gannon said.    The best way to achieve that goal is to localize GE's  business in China, he explained.    Despite the dispute between China and the United States over  the most favoured-nation (MFN) issue Gannon said GE has decided  to increase its presence in China "without hesitation.    "We have confidence in this country and, even without MFN,  there will be significant trade flow between GE and China." he  said.    According to him, the withdrawal of MFN will have a  short-term impact on GE's business in China, but the company is  looking at the Chinese market on its own merits.    GE has reached final agreement with a partner in Shanghai  and  is awaiting approval to set up what will be China's largest  lighting manufacturing plant. GE will hold the majority  interest.    Gannon said a certain part of the joint venture's products  will be exported to balance its foreign exchanges.    GE has also set up a wholly owned plant in Guangdong  Province. The construction of the facility started 1 April.    The plant, which involves a $50 million investment from GE,  will be the first to produce hi-tech engineered plastics in  China when it comes on line .    GE is also negotiating to form a joint venture for local  service and training for its aircraft engines sold in China.    To date, GE has captured about one-third of the Chinese  aircraft engine market. Gannon predicted that the share could  increase to more than a half in the near term.    As for the power sector, GE is planning to localize the  production of gas and steam turbine generators, as well as hydro  equipment.    "We expect GE's annual sales (plus orders) in China to reach  more than $2 billion by 1996 or 1997, up from $1.1 billion last  year," he forecast.</p>

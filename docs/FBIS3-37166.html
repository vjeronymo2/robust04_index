			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ilya Bulavinov report under "Russia's Military Development </F> Program" rubric: "The Russian Army Will Become Smaller but More  Mobile"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Defense Ministry hopes as  early as this year to resolve one of the main strategic tasks --  to reach understanding with the former USSR republics and, as  far as possible, conclude with them bilateral agreements on  creating Russian military bases on their territory. The total  number of bases and Russian military servicemen will be  specified. As for the other units and formations, in spite of  the difficulties involved in redeploying and stationing troops,  it is planned to begin their withdrawal this year.    It is deemed expedient to start transferring military  districts to the territorial command and control principle: in  other words, district commanders will become sole masters of the  troops located on their territory regardless of their branch.  This should enhance the effectiveness of troop command and  control because commanders will have greater operational command  powers in the event of aggression on the part of other states.  In 1994 it is planned to complete theoretical work in this  sphere (to be subsequently approved by the president) and as of  next year, this plan will begin to be implemented starting with  the Far East region.    By 1995 it is planned to complete the process of downsizing  the armed forces. According to Pavel Grachev, "the ultimate  limit" will be an army of 2 million men, which responds to the  country's security interests and its economic capabilities.  Given that after last fall's call-up (i.e., by January 1995)  the Defense Ministry is hoping to man the army by 85 to 90  percent, the real troop strength will approximate 1.8 million.    Owing to the need to have small but battleworthy and mobile  units capable of promptly arriving at a conflict point in any  part of the country, the Defense Ministry intends to finalize  the elaboration of operational plans for a new type of  operational-strategic formation -- the mobile forces.    Bodies responsible for contacts with personnel will also be  reformed. In addition to the deputy commander in charge of  indoctrination, a psychological, legal, and sociological service  will be created in the troops. The Main Personnel Directorate  will be reorganized as the Indoctrination Directorate.</p>

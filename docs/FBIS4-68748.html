			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Economic Sciences T. Dementyeva and </F> Candidate of Economic Sciences I. Pikan, experts of the TOR  marketing center of the newspaper EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN: "Without  Embellishments and Black Paint"]    [Text] If one looks at the present situation in  Russia's economy without embellishments (which is practiced by  the governmental and presidential team) and without blackening  (as do their opponents), the following picture appears.  <H8>  Basic Results of the First Quarter </H8>   The following (based on offical data) basic factors  characterize the situation in Russia's economy in the first  quarter of 1993 in the opinion of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN's experts.    First of all, a deepening of the production crisis which has  manifested itself in a drop in the output of the majority of the  types of industrial purpose products and consumer goods. Even  though a decrease in production at the beginning of the year was  predicted by practically all experts, no one had guessed its  scale right--instead of the expected 10-12 percent reduction in  the industry-wide level of production, the real drop had come to  25 percent of the level of the first quarter of 1993.    At the same time, for the quarter as a whole the level of  inflation had come to a value that is a record-breaking low for  the last two years--146 percent. Moreover, it should be recalled  that the inflation rates in the first two-three weeks of 1994  were very high (5-7 percent a week), but have steadily declined  subsequently.    The non-payments crisis has drastically intensified. The  volume of overdue debt in industry has risen and as a  consequence problems in the sale of finished products have  increased substantially and the number of work stoppages and the  complete shutdown of enterprises has grown. The financial  instability of enterprises has increased and the amount of  profit obtained has fallen. A drastic growth in the number of  unprofitable enterprises and consequently a growth in the amount  of the losses has taken place.    To a decisive degree the activity of the government was  determined by the struggle with inflation, the rates of which it  has tried to reduce by all means possible.  <H8>  Gross Domestic Product </H8>   In the first quarter the gross domestic product (GDP) had  dropped by 4.9 percent in comparison with the fourth quarter of  1993, and by 15 percent in comparison with the analogous period  of last year. The drastic decrease in the production of GDP in  January (by 29.3 percent in comparison with December) was  accompanied by subsequent monthly growth--18.5 and 6.7 percent.  However, the situation which developed during the quarter as a  whole continued the trend of a steady decline in the GDP.    A tendency for change in the structure of the GDP has also  been noted: the share of the production of goods has shrunk  (from 49 percent to 43 percent), the share of services has risen  (from 38.5 percent to 48.5 percent), and the share of net taxes  on products and imports has fallen (from 12.5 percent to 8.2  percent).    The reduction in the volumes of GDP is connected, first of  all, with the continued shrinkage of the volumes of industrial  production. However, the rates of the fall of the GDP are  significantly lower than the rates of the fall of the volumes of  industrial production. This is due to the increase of the share  of services in the GDP. Thus, during the first quarter the  volume of industrial production had come to no more than 75  percent of the level of the fourth quarter of 1993. At the same  time the services of trade and the housing economy have remained  approximately at last year's level. The volume of financial  services increases while the decrease in other services did not  exceed 20 percent.    Thus, somewhat unexpectedly one has succeeded in achieving a  more market structure of GDP formation, as in the western  countries, where the share of services comes to no more than 50  percent of GDP. In future, in our view, the GDP structure which  has developed will not undergo serious changes--the anticipated  limited increase in the volumes of production will be  accompanied by an equal increase in the volume of services.  <H8>  Material Production </H8>   Crisis phenomena have increased in the sphere of material  production during the first three months.    The trend of a fall in production observed throughout last  year (the average-quarterly rates of the fall in comparison with  the fourth quarter of 1992, according to our calculations, had  amounted to 12-13 percent) has not only survived but has even  grown noticeably stronger. During the quarter as a whole the  drop had come to 26.6 percent in comparison with the fourth  quarter of 1993, whereas production had fallen by 13.7 percent  in the fourth quarter of 1993 in comparison with the third  quarter.    A further "weighting" of the sectorial structure took place  in the first quarter. The fall in production had amounted to  about 27-28 percent in the processing sectors and 10-11 percent  in the extractive sectors. Production is more and more acquiring  a "raw material character."    It follows from an analysis of production in the branches of  industry (see table) that the most stable situation was observed  in the fuel and power complex (the rates of fall in comparison  with the first quarter of last year were 7-9 percent). The drop  in ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy (fall rates of 15-17  percent) as well as in the food industry (18-20 percent) was  markedly lower than the industry-wide drop.

A very difficult situation in the first quarter was noted in  machine-building where the level of production had come to 55  percent of the corresponding period of 1993, in the chemical and  petrochemical industry (level of production--67-68 percent of  the level of the first quarter of 1993) as well as in the  timber, wood processing and pulp and paper industry.    The production of shoes, hosiery products, all types of  fabrics, and sewn goods had declined significantly (the depth of  the fall had exceeded 60 percent of the corresponding level of  last year for individual groups). A similar picture was observed  in the production of building materials (a decrease in the  production of materials for general construction use by 30-35  percent, of asbestos cement products by 50-60 percent, of panels  for large-panel housing construction by 35 percent, etc.).    Beginning with the end of last year the crisis of  non-payments in industry is intensifying against the backgound  of continuing inflation and the growth of wholesale prices and  the number of unprofitable enterprises has increased.  <H8>  The Financial Situation of Enterprises in Industry </H8>   If by the summer and at the beginning of autumn of last year  the situation with non-payments in industry had remained  approximately at a single level, the amounts of overdue debt had  begun to grow beginning with the second half of October 1993.  Thus, for industry as a whole the volume of overdue debt to  suppliers had amounted to 10.99 trillion rubles by the end of  January and had increased by 43.1 percent in comparison with  September. At the same time the share of overdue debt to  suppliers in the total volume of output produced had increased  during this period from 46 percent to 68.8 percent.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-054-20A>      Dynamics of the Change in the Share of Overdue Debt </FIG>      An analogous situation developed also with the overdue debt  of buyers, the volume of which had increased by 38.1 percent  during September-January. The share of debt in the total volume  of output produced had increased from 59 percent to 95 percent,  i.e., buyers are not paying for practically the monthly volume  of output produced. A situation has developed in which they  don't take products because they're not needed but because  there's no money and it's uncertain when there will be.    Analysis of the status of non-payments broken down by  sectors  indicates that the fuel industry, ferrous metallurgy, chemistry  and petrochemistry, and machine-building have the greatest share  of overdue debt. The amounts of non-payments in the building  materials industry, light industry, and the wood processing and  food industries are considerably smaller. This situation once  more confirms the pattern that sectors which work to a greater  degree for the consumer market are more stable in regard to  finances and that their output is orienting itself to effective  demand earlier than the rest. The sectors which produce raw and  other materials react significantly slower to demand, continuing  through inertia to produce what is required already in far  smaller volumes.    In January 1994 the branches of industry had received a  profit in the amount of R2.6 trillion, i.e., the volume of  profit had fallen by a factor of three in comparison with  January 1993 (taking inflation into account). At the same time,  a reduction in profit by almost a factor of two had taken place  during October-December 1993, and by 45.6 percent during January  in comparison with December, i.e., by a factor of almost 1.5.    The fall in the volumes of profit in industry was also  accompanied by a decrease of their share in the volume of  industrial production--from 22.6 percent in September 1993 to  16.2 percent in January of this year. This implies a further  curtailment of investment demand and consequently also the  absence of changes in the structure of the fixed capital of  enterprises. The latter are not buying new technologies and new  equipment and nearly not putting new products into production.  In the best case the catalogue and quality of the products  produced remains unchanged.    The dynamics of the ratio of the monetary funds of  enterprises and the overdue debt to suppliers is also  characteristic. In the first half of 1993 the monetary funds of  the enterprises exceeded overdue debt by 20 percent, by the end  of 1993 they covered half of it, and 40 percent by February.    The possibilities of increasing the effective demand of the  enterprises through credit investments are very limited.    Analysis of the dynamics of the change in the volumes of  credit investments indicates that, beginning with the second  half of 1993, the rates of their increase had begun to shrink  (in the third quarter the rates of their increase equalled 48  percent, and in the fourth--30.3 percent).    Credit investments in the economy had increased by 6.8  percent (compared to December 1993) during the month of January  and by 11 percent during January-February. For the quarter as a  whole the increase in the volume of credit investments will be  two times less than the increase during the fourth quarter of  1993.    As of the beginning of February the relative share of  centralized credits in the total amount of credits had come to  26 percent. In February its relative share had increased  somewhat and reached a level of 29 percent. However, in  connection with delays of receipts into the budget (by the end  of March 1994 more than R4 trillion had not been transferred to  the budget in the form of taxes) and the surviving high level of  the budget deficit (8-9 percent of GDP), the possibilities of  increasing the volumes of centralized credit are very limited.  The latter is allotted mainly for the needs of the  agro-industrial complex (44 percent) and the military-industrial  complex, for deliveries to the Far North, etc. The situation  with the use of the credits of commercial banks is no better.  Under conditions of instability it is not profitable for the  banks to grant credit for a protracted period. Short-term  credits take up 86.5 percent in the total volume of credit  investments and have a tendency to grow.    Against a background of the growth of the volumes of  short-term credits and of bank interest, and also taking into  account the increase in the number of unprofitable enterprises  (in January their share had come to 16.2 percent as compared  with 9 percent in December 1993, while the amount of losses had  more than doubled in the past five months), the possibilities of  increasing the effective demand of the enterprises through  credits are becoming more and more limited.  <H8>  The Status of Monetary Circulation </H8>   It follows from an analysis of the structure of the money  supply that the share of cash in the total supply of monetary  funds had a steady tendency to grow throughout the entire  preceding year and had risen during the year from 24 percent to  38 percent (for comparison--in the USA this share comes to only  a few percent). At the same time the rates of increase of the  supply of cash constantly outstripped the rates of increase of  the total money supply.    The situation had changed in the beginning of 1994.    In the first place, in January the share of cash in the  total  money supply had declined by 2.6 percent compared to December.  Secondly, in January 1994 the volume of cash and non-cash funds  had increased by 4.9 percent relative to December while the  volume of cash had declined by 2.4 percent. This trend had also  been preserved in February.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-054-21A>      Dynamics of the Change in Per Capita Monetary Incomes </FIG>     The contraction of the volume of cash in January had been  one  of the reasons for the lowering of the rates of inflation in  February and the beginning of March. The currency emission in  the amount of R1.6 trillion carried out at the end of February  will undoubtedly stimulate an acceleration of the rates of  inflation in April-May.    The velocity of the circulation of cash and non-cash money,  according to data from the State Committee for Statistics, had  been kept at last year's level in January-March: cash money  circulates twice as fast as non-cash money.    In January 1994 the volume of GDP had declined (in  comparable  prices) by 29.3 percent in comparison with December 1993, while  the volume of the total money supply in circulation had  increased by 4.9 percent.    Since the growth of monetary funds has not been supported by  a real growth in production, the money in the accounts of  enterprises will be converted subsequently into cash, which will  emerge as payment funds not backed by goods and will give rise  to a corresponding growth of prices.    In analyzing trends of the change in the money supply, one  needs to bear in mind that its growth does not mean an increase  in the capital actually circulating. An increase in prices,  especially wholesale, will result in its contraction. At the  same time capital is depreciated more rapidly than the money  supply grows. Thus, during January the money supply had  increased by 4.9 percent while wholesale prices had increased by  19 percent.  <H8>  Inflation and Wholesale Prices </H8>   Against the background of the worsening situation in  industry  a sharp surge of inflation had taken place in January of this  year with a subsequent dampening of the rates of the growth of  inflation: December 1993--113 percent; January 1994--121  percent; February 1994--110 percent and March 1994--108-110  percent. The level of inflation has come to 145-146 percent  during the quarter. This is the lowest level during the last two  years.    The surge of inflation in January was dictated by a number  of  the factors we have already mentioned. Insufficent effective  demand had restrained an increase in prices in subsequent  months. The state had not settled up its debts either with the  miners, or the agro-industrial complex, or the  military-industrial complex. The crisis in production had  resulted in a significant shutdown of enterprises (some 4,280  enterprises stood idle in February as against 3,789 in January  and 2,407 in October 1993; production had come to a complete  stop at 428 plants in February) and, consequently, in a  reduction of the volumes of wage payments to industrial workers.  The tense financial state of the enterprises had led to a growth  of overdue debt with respect to the payment of wages of 2.2  times in January and by 18 percent more in February, which had  also caused a drop in demand on the consumer market.    The state intends to retrieve part of its debts in April. To  a certain degree these measures will result in a revival of  effective demand. The seasonal surge in the demand for a number  of construction and light industry goods also will contribute to  the growth of inflation, the level of which, according to our  estimates, will come to about 15-16 percent a month by the end  of the second quarter.    Despite an anticipated convergence of the rates of growth of  wholesale and consumer prices even under conditions of a growing  sales crisis, Russian industrialists, as before, do not see  another way out besides a mechanical increase in the prices for  their products.    For industry as a whole wholesale prices had increased by 19  percent in January, 16 percent in February, and 15-17 percent in  March. The index of the growth of wholesale prices during the  quarter has come to 158-159 percent.    The correlation of the rates of growth of consumer and  wholesale prices at the beginning of the year was analogous to  the correlation of their growth rates in the second half of last  year: on average wholesale prices are growing 15-20 percent more  rapidly than consumer prices during the quarter.    The surviving financial strain in industry will become one  of  the factors in slowing down the growth rates of wholesale prices  in the second quarter. Many enterprises, in striving to survive,  will try to sell their product, even if only very cheaply.  However, at the same time the abolition of state regulation of  prices for the products of monopolists, the proposed allocation  of credit to enterprises on the strength of clearing off the  state debt, the increase of the prices for electric power and of  transport rates will stimulate a further growth of prices. The  superimposing of these two contradictory trends will lead to a  moderate growth of wholesale prices which, according to our  estimates, will amount to 60-65 percent during the second  quarter.</p>

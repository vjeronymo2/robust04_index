			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0002 GMT on 26 June carries a live interview with  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ], in its regular "Sunday Discussion" program. The  interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated by  NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki  Tanaka.    Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Murayama: "In  reference to the issue of forming a new government, it appears  that the SDPJ holds a key to it. Which party do you intend to  begin negotiations with -- the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or  the ruling coalition parties?"    Murayama replies: "We have to recognize the past. We should  return to the position we had at the time of forming the  coalition in August last year. I think the correct order to  proceed by is that all the people who participated at that time  return to that position and restart from zero in discussing how  the government should be formed."    "What you are saying is that you will begin with the ruling  coalition parties, right?" Yamamoto asks.    Murayama replies, "Yes."    The moderator notes: "But the coalition parties are saying  they want to watch the negotiations taking place between the LDP  and the SDPJ. They say their negotiations with the SDPJ on  policy adjustments have been terminated."    Murayama responds: "That may be what they are saying, but as  far as we are concerned, we have to think about the past  history, and about what the people of the nation expect us to do  and what they want from us. We have to proceed with  negotiations based on this thinking. I think the people of the  nation still strongly expect us to end the LDP governance that  continued for 38 years and to begin a new government. We need  to respond to these expectations. When we recognize this, we  come to realize we should form a coalition government once  again." The SDPJ head adds, "But after all, negotiations need  another party to talk to. If the negotiations do not go well,  of course, then, it may be possible that we will think about  what we should do next."    Yamamoto asserts that the coalition parties appear to have  changed their position on the SDPJ as a possible coalition  partner and asks for Murayama's comment.    Murayama replies: "It is only natural that we should think  about the next course of action if the negotiations do not go  well. Yesterday, Mr. Yohei Kono and Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto [of  the LDP] came to me and handed me a paper on the party's concept  for forming a new government. I told them I would like to have  time to study it. Since I have to think about the next course,  I would like to keep the door open for talks with other parties."    Guest commentator Tanaka points out: "Watching the SDPJ over  the past several days, I have noticed considerable differences  of view within the SDPJ. For you, the most urgent issue right  now is not to let the party break up."    Murayama says: "No, no. What is urgent for me is how we can  respond to the people's expectations, by forming a new  government."    The commentator then asks: "Specifically, there is said to  be two groups in the party -- one that attaches importance to  maintaining the coalition and the other group does not. This is  one of the reasons for the chaotic political situation."    The SDPJ chairman responds: "This should not be viewed as  the party being divided into two groups -- of one that attaches  importance to the coalition and the other that does not. It  should be taken as differences of view existing on conditions to  rejoining the coalition."    Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the next government will be a  caretaker government that will serve until the next general  election or a full-fledged government.    Murayama says: "It will depend on how the government will be  composed, but it is possible that the government will be a  temporary one that will serve until the next election."    Tanaka asks if Murayama thinks the LDP has changed its way  of  thinking.    Murayama says: "This question was once discussed within my  party too. At that time, I said that the fact that Mr. Kono was  elected its president shows the party recognized the party's  mood, which is looking for change." Murayama adds: "There are  people who are considered doves in the LDP. I think we can talk  to or cooperate with them."    Tanaka asks Murayama if there is a possibility of the SDPJ  cooperating with the LDP in forming a new government in case  negotiations with the coalition parties fail.    Murayama says: "Umm, yes. The Diet session closes 29 June.  If possible, we would like to name a prime minister and form a  cabinet by then -- so that it will be able to get ready for the  summit. We have a political task to form a new government. But  if there is no way of doing that by 29 June, then we may have to  extend the Diet session a little. That is what I think."    Yamamoto says some people in Sakigake [Harbinger] think they  should push for Murayama as the next prime minister, and asks  for Murayama's comment.    Murayama says: "This will be a coalition government. Its  prime minister needs to be agreed on by the parties that  participate in the coalition. Hence, I think we should not talk  about who should be prime minister." He then says: "I do not  think I am fit for that [position]. If my party is asked to  form a cabinet, there are many people who are fit for that."    The interview with Murayama ends at 0025 GMT.</p>

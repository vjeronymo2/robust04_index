			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / CSFB plans compensation scheme to unite company CS First Boston, the investment banking arm of Switzerland's CS Holding, is developing a company-wide compensation scheme as part of its efforts to meld into a single global investment bank. Compensation has been a controversial subject at the firm, which operated until recently as three separate regional entities tied together with revenue-sharing agreements. Last week the company adopted a single name worldwide. A new slogan, 'One Firm, One Name, One Mission', is intended to symbolise an end to the regional tensions that have hampered profitability. Mr Alan Wheat, chief operating officer, said that the new compensation system might not be in place until next year. 'Measurement systems in this company are not what you would want them to be,' he said, adding that not all the issues surround-ing compensation had been resolved. He said completion of the new arrangements might cause some further departures from the company, which suffered a number of well-publicised defections earlier this year. 'I think there are other people who may well leave,' Mr Wheat said. Mr Wheat's predecessor, Mr Archibald Cox, resigned in July after a string of top New York investment bankers left the firm. The departed bankers were unhappy that their annual bonuses last year were low because of the poor performance of the company's European and Asian operations. Mr David Mulford, who heads the company's worldwide investment banking division and chairs its European operations, said the previous emphasis on the performance of various geographic regions stymied the firm's ability to promote its products worldwide. For instance, the investment bank had complex inter-group agreements for dividing profits among various geographical regions that contributed to, say, an international equity offering. 'Even I couldn't understand these agreements,' Mr Wheat said. Moreover, the fact that regions competed for business separately often meant they competed against each other. 'We often had two teams, two groups, who would bump into each other in the hallway while making a presentation,' he said. Of the geographical regions likely to require the greatest change, Mr Wheat said the US, where 4,000 of the firm's 6,000 employees are based, would be the priority.</p>

What are its  achievements? What could it elaborate? What is awaiting the  Ukrainian parliament in 1994? Our correspondent talks about  this with first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council,  V.V. Durdynets.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Esteemed Vasyl Vasylyovych, the present  situation in Ukraine is difficult. The prestige of the power  structures has been shaken. Notwithstanding this, many people  still believe in our state's supreme legislative body. This  follows at least from the fact that people gather precisely  under the windows of the parliament building in order to express  their dissatisfaction with something, expound their demands, or  simply hold discussions with people's deputies. Therefore, they  hope that parliament is still capable of doing something to  build up the state. Has the eighth session justified these  expectations? Which of the legislative acts adopted by it can  be assessed by you as fundamental and leading?    [Durdynets] Well, this question is not a simple one, and I  would generally agree with the emphasis that you have placed in  it. However, one point needs to be better specified: Today,  people do not only pin their hopes on the Supreme Council, but,  to a no lesser degree, on the bodies of executive power, the  president, and the Cabinet of Ministers, which are directly  responsible for the fulfillment of the laws and decrees that  have been adopted. People gather at the square in front of the  Supreme Council mainly on the days of plenary sessions in order  to hold a direct dialogue. This is, undoubtedly, mutually  useful.    As regards the work of the eighth session, it was really  held  in difficult conditions. It is worth stressing here that this  session adopted quite a number of exclusively important  legislative acts, which may be called a political reaction on  the part of the legislators to the topical demands of our time.  The session worked very hard and was very productive.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before closing the session, Ivan  Stepanovych Plyushch quoted some figures....    [Durdynets] Yes, Ivan Stepanovych quoted specific figures.  In terms of quantitative indexes, the session differs from  others. Its 52 meetings discussed 249 questions and adopted 66  laws and 133 decrees.    However, it is not only by this that I would characterize  the  session. It must be said, first and foremost, that, by passing  the law on the early elections of the Supreme Council and  president, it responded to the need to renew the power  structures, a need that has become felt in our society.    The Law on the Elections of Ukraine's People's Deputies was  adopted and the composition of the Central Electoral Commission  was approved. In fact, the adoption of these documents marked  the beginning of the pre-election campaign. The people were  given a chance to delegate their new envoys to the Supreme  Council, and the political parties -- their representatives.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At its eighth session, the Supreme Council  repeatedly discussed the issue of the economic situation in  Ukraine and of the social protection of the population. The  "dialogue" between the people's deputies and the Cabinet of  Ministers was quite sharp. The government has changed three  times over the three years. A number of laws and decrees have  been adopted. What positive changes have taken place? What has  the Supreme Council managed to achieve, in your opinion?    [Durdynets] Economic and, in particular, social problems  were and still are the most painful ones for our society. It is  clear that the economic situation in Ukraine is also quite  noticeably affected by foreign factors and by the still severed  production ties within what used to be a single national  economic complex. Nor is the structural and technological  rebuilding of Ukraine's economy proceeding smoothly: It is too  delayed, sluggish, and has many shortcomings. However, our  misfortunes are largely due to strictly internal problems,  inefficient administration, and errors in the implementation of  reforms.    Unfortunately, the economic programs, including those  proposed by previous governments, have not produced positive  results. The expanding spiral of inflation and the uncontrolled  price increases have led to a drastic deterioration of the  people's standard of living. In the course of the eighth  session, the Supreme Council had to adopt nine legislative acts  directly associated with the social protection of the  population. I mean the Law on the Status of War Veterans and  Guarantees of Their Social Protection, the Law on the Main  Principles of the Social Protection of Veterans of Labor and  Other Citizens of Old Age, changes to the Law on State  Assistance for Families With Children, the Decree on Urgent  Measures for Overcoming Hyperinflation in Ukraine, and other  legislative acts.    It is important to emphasize that, in view of the conditions  that have recently taken shape in the state, the Supreme Council  adopted, a few days ago, a new Concept for the Social Protection  of Ukraine's Population. It has laid down the principles for  the legal and formative foundation for social protection and  elaborated mechanisms that, proceeding from the actual economic  possibilities, will ensure the fulfillment of state guarantees  regarding the implementation of the citizens' rights to labor  and unemployment benefits: Remuneration for labor and minimal  wages; provision of state assistance and other types of social  assistance for low-income citizens and families with children.    Yet another important principle, which follows from the  concept, is that the system of social protection must be built  in such a way as to prevent egalitarianism and moods of  parasitism from prevailing during the distribution and  consumption of benefits. This system must not weaken the  motivations and incentives for labor, but must create conditions  for their fullest possible manifestation.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Some politicians assert that it is  precisely the Supreme Council that raises prices....    [Durdynets] There are such politicians, but they cannot  confirm this with a single document. The Supreme Council has  not made a single decision to raise prices. On the contrary, as  you remember, last spring, it imposed a moratorium on price  increases, but owing to the government's persistent requests  (the government assured us at that time that it was the last  price increase), the Supreme Council agreed to authorize the  decision.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] How about the considerable price increases  in December?    [Durdynets] It is precisely on this that I want to stress  that the last month of work of the Supreme Council's eighth  session was particularly strained. In connection with the sharp  price increases and popular discontent, the situation called for  urgent and extraordinary measures on the part of the Supreme  Council, the president, and the government. After the  discussion, which continued for many days, of the reports by  Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Chairman of the Board  of Ukraine's National Bank Viktor Yushchenko, Minister of  Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, and Minister of the Economy Roman  Shpek, the Supreme Council passed, on 17 December, an important  decree on the economic and social situation in Ukraine with  specific recommendations for the emergence from the economic  crisis and, a week later, a decree on additional measures for  stabilizing the socio-economic situation. In my opinion, these  documents will somewhat mitigate the situation. Certainly,  provided that strict control is established over the timely and  thorough fulfillment of the regulations on stabilizing the  socio-economic situation and overcoming inflation. Here, the  standing commissions of deputies must actively interact with the  executive bodies. At the ninth session, which will start on 20  January, the Supreme Council will analyze how these decrees have  been fulfilled.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] At the beginning of the interview, you  mentioned legislative laws adopted by the eighth session as a  response to the need for a political renewal in society. Unlike  some politicians, you seem to be convinced that elections will  be held. Am I right? Another question: Will it not happen  that quite a number of those people's deputies who, today, work  actively and competently on commissions, will not be elected to  parliament for the simple reason that they appear in front of  the microphones or at rostrums less frequently?    [Durdynets] I will start with your second question: It will  be a pity if this happens. It is a fact that a professional  nucleus of legislators, highly erudite politicians responsible  to the state and the people, has formed in the present  parliament. However, I hope that these deputies will continue  to serve our country. It is high time that we created a  civilized and professional parliament.    As regards new elections, it will not be simple to hold  them.  However, I do not think that the majority of voters will not  come to the polling stations at all, as some people predict. I  hope not. It cannot happen that the majority of voters will not  care who works in parliament and who will come there. The law  passed is not as bad as some people picture it. It is  democratic. I am sure that the majority of citizens in our  society are mature enough to have a profound understanding that  it is precisely they who must form a new parliament through  elections and take care of their own future. This is,  incidentally, attested to by the political tension in the state.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Perhaps, the discussion of the draft of the  new constitution of Ukraine should be placed into the category  of key problems?    [Durdynets] Undoubtedly. The work on the draft of the new  constitution was quite time-consuming. It is the main law of  the state, and the deputies consider its elaboration to be a  particularly important matter. The eighth session discussed the  draft into which the Constitutional Commission introduced  fundamental changes and additions -- taking into account the  results of the nationwide discussions. Much time was devoted to  its discussion at plenary meetings. The deputies were able to  analyze the draft in depth.    Many important remarks and proposals were voiced in the  course of the discussion. They refer to all parts of the draft,  but in particular, to those articles that deal with the general  principles of the constitutional system, democracy, the  electoral process, forms of state power and administration, the  main principles of Ukraine's territorial system, and the  organization of state power and self-government in the  provinces. I want to stress that different points of view were  voiced in the course of the discussions, but one could feel a  constructive approach in assessing the draft constitution and  the desire to find the best variant, which would take into  account the experience of democratic countries and our national  traditions and specific features of state building.    It was decided to publish the draft constitution in the  press once more, so that all the citizens of Ukraine could  familiarize themselves with it. The Constitutional Commission,  which generalizes the proposals made by the people's deputies,  is already receiving letters with specific proposals. We expect  that the question of the new constitution will also be discussed  in substance at the conference of the representatives of local  councils of Ukraine's people's deputies, which will be held on  18 and 19 January. We are also thinking how to speed up the  amendment and adoption of the new constitution, because it is  extremely difficult to build a young state without new main law.  Ukraine needs a new constitution.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The ratification by parliament of START I  and of the Lisbon Protocol gave rise to very strong reactions,  which are also quite controversial. How would you comment on  this?    [Durdynets] Right, the adoption, on 18 November, by the  Supreme Council of the decree on the ratification of these  documents gave rise to a considerable response in the world.  The numerous reactions and commentaries by state and political  circles point to their understanding of the motivations for  adopting such a decision. At the same time, some political  figures and mass media offered interpretations of some aspects  of the decree that differ from what they really meant.    As you know, the adoption by the Supreme Council of the  decision on the ratification was preceded by an almost year-long  discussion and thorough collective analysis of possible  military, political, economic, ecological, and social  consequences of the implementation by our state of this treaty,  which had been concluded without Ukraine's participation. In  their approach to this issue, the parliament, its standing  commissions, and the temporary working group of deputies,  created to pass the corresponding recommendations, proceeded  both from Ukraine's noble intention to become, in the future, a  nuclear state and from the ideas of the inviolability of state  borders, as well as from other national interests. In the  course of the in-depth and comprehensive study of the problems,  the deputies also paid attention to such a serious matter as the  economic feasibility for our state to fulfill, to a full extent,  the obligations that are stipulated by the treaty.    We have striven to convince the international community, and  first and foremost nuclear and other influential world powers,  that it is essential for them to make reciprocal steps and offer  Ukraine reliable security guarantees and provide it with proper  financial assistance, enabling it to destroy those weapons, and  to compensate us for the nuclear warheads. Unfortunately, our  hopes were futile.    That is why the Supreme Council, while adopting the decision  on the ratification of START I with reservations, took these  aspects into account and proceeded from the real situation that  had taken shape. Incidentally, recent events, and particularly  openly anti- Ukrainian statements made by individual Russian  political and state figures, justified our position.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] The problems of combating crime in our  country continue to be acute. How were they dealt with by the  Supreme Council?    [Durdynets] The deputies analyzed these problems with great  concern, because the growth of crime, and in particular  organized crime, are a matter of serious concern to our society.  This problem is constantly within the Supreme Council's field  of vision. This session alone approved more than 20 normative  acts intended to strengthen law and order and intensify the  struggle against crime, in particular, laws on more severe  punishment for certain crimes against the state and on the state  protection of court and law- enforcement officials; the draft  law on combating corruption was given its first reading.  Important changes and additions were introduced into the  Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes and other legal acts.  Active work is under way on the elaboration of new codes.    Serious criticisms were directed against the Procurator  General's Office in connection with the shortcomings in its  work. The Supreme Council strengthened the leadership -- a new  Procurator General was appointed and a new composition of the  board approved. Changes were introduced into the Law on the  Procurator's Office that are intended to improve its work.    A number of acts that were adopted are aimed at reforming  the  judicial power and improving legal proceedings. A new  leadership of Ukraine's Supreme Court was elected.    The main task now is to strengthen parliamentary control  over  the implementation of legislation on legal issues and to combine  the efforts of executive and law-enforcement agencies in  combating crime.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] However, one does hear much more criticism  than approval of the Supreme Council's activities....    [Durdynets] All of this is understandable. Life does not  get any better, and the legal acts that are adopted do not,  unfortunately, work the way in which we would like them to.  Incidentally, many voters judge the Supreme Council's work only  by the plenary meetings. They do not see the colossal,  painstaking, and, I would say, very hard work done by the  Presidium, standing commissions, and subdivisions of the Supreme  Council apparatus. Every issue, no matter how unimportant it may  be, is subjected to expert analysis by specialists and is  discussed in deputies' groups and commissions before it is put  on the agenda of the plenary meeting. Diverse, sometimes  opposite, ideas and proposals need to be studied, substantiated,  and compared in order to enable a proper decision to be made.    For example, I mentioned two extremely important decrees  adopted by the Supreme Council at the end of the session -- on  the economic and social situation in Ukraine and on measures to  stabilize the socio-economic situation in the state. A special  working group had been created to prepare this. It included  people's deputies, ministers, and specialists -- economists and  lawyers. I happened to be the head of this group. We worked  hard for several days and nights. Everything was there -- sharp  discussions, opposite views, and some peoples' narrow  departmental ambitions. We had to go through all of this to  reach a compromise and arrive at coordinated and well-weighed  decisions that would take into account the numerous appeals from  the provinces and proposals made by people's deputies. Believe  me, this was a very difficult task. We have to make the  decisions, as people expect us to do.    I must say that, since these decisions were made, the  government has made considerable efforts to implement them.  There are great difficulties here.    [HOLOS UKRAYINY] Before the end of the last plenary meeting,  it was announced that the next session, the ninth, will start  work on 20 January. Meanwhile, one hears doubts: Will the  Supreme Council be able to work at full capacity if some of the  deputies become involved in the pre-election struggle?    [Durdynets] The ninth session will primarily discuss two  most important issues -- the plan for Ukraine's economic and  social development and the draft state budget for 1994. They  were on the agenda of the eighth session, but the Cabinet of  Ministers was unable, for various reasons, to submit these bills  on time.    Of course, this cannot be considered a normal situation,  when  a new year starts and there is still no plan for the country's  economic and social development and no state budget. That is  why the deputies at the session sharply criticized the  government for such a delay. We hope that the drafts of these  documents will be submitted to the Supreme Council within the  first 10 days of January. By the beginning of plenary meetings,  the deputies will be able to analyze them in detail in standing  commissions. Until the budget for 1994 is adopted, the Supreme  Council, by its decree of 24 December allowed the government and  the National Bank to carry out the financing of immediate  expenditure in January 1994 within the limits of real  contributions to the budget.    I will also list those issues whose discussion cannot be  delayed in view of their social significance. These are, in  particular, the draft state program for privatization meant for  next year. It must take into account the best experience  accumulated by other countries and our specific characteristics  and mistakes so that it would open the way to an intensification  of the economic reforms.    We must discuss the second reading of the bill on combating  crime and introduce the appropriate changes into Ukraine's  Criminal and Criminal-Procedural Codes. It is not necessary to  prove the great need for this law today, when corruption  seriously threatens the development of our national economy.    The Supreme Council must discuss the amended draft concept  of  Ukraine's national security (policy principles). As is known,  this global issue was discussed at the eighth session, but the  discussion was not finished.    There also are a number of bills that were already passed at  first reading. They are expected in particular sectors. Some  of the currently effective legal acts also need to be altered  and supplemented. However, is it possible to put all of them  into the "working portfolio" of the future parliament?    Therefore, I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of  the deputies will consider these questions with great  responsibility and that the ninth session will work in a normal  and businesslike manner. Now, during the period between the  sessions, standing commissions do not halt their legislative  work and also conduct checks on the implementation of the laws  and the decisions that have been made.    I am using this opportunity to greet all Ukrainian citizens  and their families for Christmas and the New Year and wish them  happiness, prosperity, peace, accord, and a better life.    Thank you for your attention.</p>

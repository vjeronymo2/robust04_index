			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Serbs' leader announces Sarajevo truce MR Radovan Karadzic, whose Serb irregulars have bombarded and besieged the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo for more than two months, yesterday announced a unilateral ceasefire starting on Monday. The statement made by Mr Karadzic in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, was cautiously welcomed by United Nations officials and the European Community, which said it would resume the peace talks in Bosnia once the UN gained control of Sarajevo airport. Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC-sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia, yesterday said he and Mr Jose Cutileiro, the EC negotiator, would travel to Sarajevo in a new effort to restart the talks about 'the future constitutional arrangements of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. Placing Sarajevo airport under UN control could pave the way for sending relief supplies into the city, whose 300,000 inhabitants are on the verge of starvation. However, UN officials said it would be difficult to demilitarise the areas around the airport held by Serb irregulars. Despite the ceasefire announcement, western diplomats yesterday said the Serb irregulars might use it as a pretext for bombarding the city over the next 72 hours. In Sarajevo, heavy shelling and gunbattles were reported throughout the city, killing at least 12 people. Croatian forces, organised by Croatia, were continuing to burn Serb villages in Hercegovina, in the west of the republic. Meanwhile in Belgrade, intimidation of the foreign press, coupled with an increasing climate of lawlessness, is increasing since the UN sanctions were imposed two weeks ago. Yesterday, Ms Dessa Trevisan, The Times correspondent, was shot while walking from her home to the state-run international press centre. Although she was not seriously injured, Ms Trevisan and other foreign correspondents have received numerous death threats and have had their car tyres slashed. A Kuwaiti journalist had a tear gas canister thrown into his home earlier this week. US secretary of state James Baker said yesterday the US was stepping up the provision of intelligence information to assist UN peace-keeping troops in Bosnia and would consider an airlift of relief aid, Reuter reports from London.</p>

Mr. Va'ezi, who was speaking to a Central News Unit  correspondent, stressed that at present, Iran and European  countries enjoy good relations, adding: Dealing with  international issues, the Islamic Republic of Iran acts on the  basis of its own independently worked-out principles.    Speaking on the efforts of the Islamic Republic of Iran to  resolve the Karabakh crisis, Mr. Va'ezi said: Following the  recent requests made by the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia  asking Iran to mediate in the Karabakh dispute, our country's  Foreign Ministry director general for eastern Europe travelled  to Yerevan and Baku to investigate the problem. He pointed out  that the Karabakh problem has entered a new phase, saying:  During his recent visit to Tehran, a Russian special envoy  presented a plan for resolving the Karabakh crisis. It was  decided that the plan be studied and the interests of the  warring sides be taken into consideration.    Our country's deputy foreign minister for Euro-American  affairs then referred to the broad support of the Islamic  Republic of Iran for the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  said: Initiated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, foreign  affairs ministers of the contact group [goruh-e tamas]  countries, represented by the Islamic Conference Organization,  will hold a joint meeting in Geneva this Sunday [16 January] to  study the latest developments in Bosnia- Herzegovina.

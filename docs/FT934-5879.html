			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: On Demand Info gets Pounds 39.8m tag A price of 78p was yesterday fixed for the flotation of On Demand Information valuing the electronic publishing company at Pounds 39.8m. ODI delivers a range of information such as directories, manuals, magazines and brochures via a computer terminal instead of the printed form. The company said that the information appears on the screen in exactly the same format as it does on paper. Albert Sharp, its broker, has placed with institutions 12.75m shares, 25 per cent of the expanded capital. The flotation will raise Pounds 9.15m, net of expenses, for the company. The prospectus, printed in Bradford, was delayed by poor traffic conditions due to fog which meant no balance sheet figures were available at time of going to print. No profits forecast has been made. Analysts said the figures available suggested the company would continue to make losses for at least 18 months. It incurred operating losses of Pounds 803,000 (Pounds 113,000) in the year to July 31. The company, which has been the subject of some adverse press comment, was started five years ago as a division of Poulter Communications, a large media communications group, the bulk of which is remaining in private control. No existing shareholders have sold in the placing and directors and their families have retained a 48.2 per cent stake. Mr Graham Poulter, ODI's chairman and founder of Poulter Communications, holding 40 per cent with his family trusts. Existing shareholders have undertaken not to sell their stock for two years.</p>

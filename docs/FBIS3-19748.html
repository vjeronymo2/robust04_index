Karayalcin  said, "What is graver, however, is for the Turkish economy to  enter the process of becoming based on the dollar, for the  Turkish lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium  of exchange." Noting that the preservation of national  sovereignty is closely linked to reliability of the Turkish  lira, Karayalcin proposed that urgent measures be started for  Central Bank autonomy. The SHP leader said that the excessive  dependence on domestic and foreign loans makes it impossible to  produce an alternative policy in the short term.    Murat Karayalcin, speaking in his party's TBMM [Turkish  Grand  National Assembly] group meeting yesterday, evaluated recent  economic developments. Karayalcin, whose criticism drew  attention, said that he was "worried" that the economy's  dependence on domestic and foreign loans would eventually create  important problems from the standpoint of exercising sovereignty  rights. Karayalcin, stressing that we are "gradually becoming a  nonproductive, but consumer society, said the following:    ``The savings rate in 1993 was a marginal 15.3 percent. This  is an incredibly low level. A country that has a marginal  savings rate of 15 percent cannot finance its own development.  For domestic and foreign loan dependency to be this extensive  makes it impossible to produce alternative policies in the short  term. Some measures have been taken. But we will not feel the  effect of the Taxation Law until after 1995. We hope the public  sector's loan requirements can be reduced by 1995. Certainly we  have to increase domestic savings to reduce the economy's dollar  dependency.''    Noting that Turkey largely lost in the 1950s the savings  structure of society of the 1930-40's, Karayalcin said, "We must  concentrate in the 1990's on measures to base growth largely on  domestic resources."  <H5>  Status of Turkish Lira `Grave' </H5>   Karayalcin stressed that for domestic and foreign loan  requirements to be this high was "grave" and continued:    "However, what is graver is for the Turkish economy to enter  the process of becoming based on the dollar. For the Turkish  lira to lose respect and cease to be a reliable medium of  exchange is a more serious problem that high domestic and  foreign loans. There is a question of an approach of indexing  rental contracts and commodity prices to the dollar. And even  more serious is that our citizens have begun to use foreign  currency as a savings medium. The SHP considers our national  currency's loss of value and respect an extremely negative  development. The preservation of national sovereignty, as well  as other elements, is closely linked to reliability of the  Turkish lira. It is impossible as a whole to speak of the  Turkish lira's gaining respect, or of fully exercising national  sovereignty rights. The problem is not just to preserve the  economic balances, but that our national currency gain respect  at the same time."    Karayalcin said that efforts toward Central Bank autonomy  must begin urgently. Stressing that there is an inverse  relationship between an autonomous Central Bank and inflation,  Karayalcin said, "The Central Bank must, within a reasonable  period of time, cease to be a body that serves the Treasury  alone and become autonomous. Autonomy, on which agreement must  be reached in the next few years and which would be implemented  at a time that would not put a squeeze on the economy, is  important from the standpoint of the European Union also."</p>

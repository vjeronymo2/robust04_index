			<p>BFN     [Text] The Portuguese Government is preparing an emergency  plan to evacuate 600,000 Portuguese nationals from South Africa  if the security situation deteriorates before or after the  elections. Reports from Lisbon indicate that the returnees would  be housed in disused buildings and military bases in northern  Portugal after being airlifted from South Africa. Portuguese  Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said he was extremely  concerned about the violence in South Africa but that he did not  think he should advise the Portuguese community in South Africa  to leave the country yet.</p>

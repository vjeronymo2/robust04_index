			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: New York coffee prices surge higher THE NEW YORK arabica coffee market, closed on Monday for Independence Day, surged ahead yesterday in reaction to the Latin American plan to retain 20 per cent of coffee exports from October 1. The nearby July contract was up 5.50 cents a lb at 69.05 cents a lb in late trading. Robusta coffee on the London Commodity Exchange followed New York upwards. The September contract added a further Dollars 24 to Monday's Dollars 24 advance, closing at Dollars 977 a tonne after touching a high of Dollars 1,000 earlier in the day. Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said the move was purely psychological, pointing out that 'the Latin American scheme does not address the problems of overproduction'. Ms Ganes also believes that estimates of 20m bags (60 kg each) in consumer hands are grossly understated, and will rise further as producers take advantage of higher prices. 'Remember that this scheme will not kick in for another three months,' she said. Much of the drive behind the price rise was short-covering, which then triggered stop-loss buying orders and attracted further speculative and fund buying. But one London trader pointed out that coffee buyers had plenty of time to take the long view, and they will be waiting to see how the details of the Latin American scheme are worked out.</p>

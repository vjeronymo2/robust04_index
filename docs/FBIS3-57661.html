Additional  personnel and arms are already been sent to the Ukrainian  battalion in Sarajevo. Despite the considerable losses  sustained by the battalion while carrying out its peacekeeping  mission -- six servicemen have been killed and about 30 wounded  over a period of 18 months -- there is no shortage of  volunteers. This is the only Ukrainian Army military unit in  which three to four candidates are competing for each post.  Indeed, many parents are asking commanders to send their sons  to serve precisely in this subunit. The reason is simple: Each  man here gets about 10 times more than the Ukrainian defense  minister. For the first time, servicewomen have been included  in the new personnel of the battalion. These Ukrainian Amazons  will be able, where necessary in combat conditions, render first  aid to their male colleagues.</p>

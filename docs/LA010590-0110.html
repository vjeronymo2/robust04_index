			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEATING TAKES STAND AT LINCOLN S&amp;L HEARING;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE EMBATTLED FINANCIER APPEARS UNRUFFLED AS HE ARGUES THAT THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENCOURAGED S&amp;LS TO MOVE INTO NON-TRADITIONAL  INVESTMENTS.  </P> <P> Embattled Arizona developer Charles H. Keating Jr. defended his five-year  operation of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Thursday, testifying that his firm  bought the Irvine thrift to take advantage of deregulation laws he saw as the  "salvation of the industry."  </P> <P> Appearing relaxed and confident, Keating told U.S. District Judge Stanley  Sporkin that he assembled a top-notch legal and accounting team to run Lincoln  and to make sure the Orange County institution complied with federal and state  rules.  </P> <P> Instead, Keating is now accused of systematically violating those rules and  orchestrating risky investments that contributed to Lincoln's colossal failure  last April.  </P> <P> The flamboyant businessman has become a lightning rod for an industrywide  debacle expected to cost taxpayers more than $200 billion. Lincoln's collapse  alone could become the nation's biggest S&amp;L failure, with a potential  cleanup cost of more than $2 billion.  </P> <P> Keating's testimony, which will continue today, came during the fifth day of a  court hearing designed by Sporkin to test the evidence used by federal  regulators to justify their April 14 takeover of Lincoln.  </P> <P> The court hearing focuses on four transactions identified by regulators as  representative of the failure of Lincoln's former parent firm, American  Continental Corp. in Phoenix, to operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and  conserve assets.  </P> <P> American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, the day before  the federal seizure. The company sued regulators a week later, claiming that  they lacked sufficient evidence to show that Lincoln was being operated  unsafely and unsoundly and was substantially dissipating assets, the grounds  cited for the takeover.  </P> <P> Sporkin is the first judge to review the merits of some of the longstanding  differences between regulators and American Continental executives. And  Keating, who has given only a handful of interviews since the collapse and  refused to testify at a House Banking Committee hearing in November, appeared  eager to tell his story in a court forum.  </P> <P> On Thursday, however, he testified mainly about the years he spent in  Cincinnati as a lawyer and a businessman and his arrival in Phoenix to take  over a struggling home-building firm. He transformed that firm into American  Continental and built it into one of the nation's largest home builders before  buying Lincoln in early 1984.  </P> <P> Keating said industry deregulation, which allowed thrifts to engage in risky  transactions that previously had been off limits, prompted him to buy Lincoln.  Deregulation was advocated by the Reagan Administration and approved by  Congress in 1982.  </P> <P> "I saw the changes in the S&amp;L industry . . . as being the salvation of the  industry," Keating testified, saying there was "government encouragement" to  engage in land development and other non-traditional investments.  </P> <P> To that end, he said, he used Lincoln to plan and partially develop large  tracts of land, which the S&amp;L then sold to home builders for immediate  construction or to land speculators who intended to cash in on the expected  appreciation of the land.  </P> <P> Lincoln was a particularly good vehicle to engage in major undertakings such as  land planning and development, Keating said, because it provided easy access to  the large amounts of capital needed to finance the projects.  </P> <P> But that capital came in the form of federally insured customer deposits, and  regulators criticized Lincoln for using those funds on risky ventures --  especially without proper documentation showing that the deals were safe and  sound.  </P> <P> The two land deals that are part of the four transactions being reviewed by  Sporkin were sales to land speculators, Keating said. As such, the deals were  handled differently than normal loans.  </P> <P> Keating testified that he had hired about 50 accountants throughout the company  and had 15 lawyers on staff to make sure that Lincoln complied with state and  federal thrift regulations.  </P></p>

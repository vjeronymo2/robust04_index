			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter de Ionno] </F>   [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] is set to  treble the election allowance paid to about 80,000 police  officers in an attempt to avert a threatened strike. An  announcement expected on Tuesday [12 April] will increase the  daily payment to police on active duty from R22.50 [rand] to  R61.50 -- equal to the total allowances granted to National  Peacekeeping Force members.    A police general said a top-level decision to back the SA  [South African] Police Union appeal to the TEC for substantial  increases in pay between the ranks of constable and colonel was  made on Friday.    A memo signed by Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe  late  on Friday supporting the daily allowance increase is expected to  be distributed in the force tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham] </F>   [Excerpts] Diplomatic and military circles consider the  written statement from the U.S. State Department in which the  government challenges the 10-mile limit of Greek airspace as a  clear sign of the U.S. desire for a summit meeting between  Greece and Turkey as soon as possible.    Inevitably, this issue will be at the center of the talks  that National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis will have next  week in Washington with his U.S. counterpart, William Perry,  following a last-minute upgrade of the visit by the United  States. He will also meet with State Department officials, U.S.  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and National Security  Adviser Anthony Lake.    It is certain that besides the issues of Aegean and  Greek-Albanian relations, the agenda will include the situation  in the Balkans.    According to initial estimates by government circles, with  the State Department statement on the 10-mile airspace the U.S.  Government chose to "attack" the substance of the problems in  the Aegean, which include the Turkish challenge of Greek  airspace since 1974 with systematic infringements and violations  by Turkish fighter planes.    The point that for the Greek side is not yet "clear" is  whether the recent U.S. move is an initiative by that country  itself following the refusal of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias to discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's proposal for disarmament of Greek planes in the  Aegean or whether it is a "promotion" of Turkish positions by  the U.S. side.    Even though the Greek Government's reaction to the American  and Turkish sides yesterday was made in low tones, it insisted  on Greece's firm position to defend its sovereign rights in the  Aegean. [passage omitted]    The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted through diplomatic  channels with representations from the Greek ambassador in  Washington to the State Department and from Ambassador Khristos  Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director general, who called U.S.  Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles into his office.    According to information from diplomatic circles, the Greek  Government wants to make it clear to the American side that it  has no intention of causing an incident with Turkey in the  Aegean. On the contrary, it intends to reestablish a low-level  bilateral dialogue with Ankara, as it was agreed in principle  during the recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the  two countries, Papoulias and Hikmet Cetin, on issues that  concern both countries but that do not challenge sovereign  rights, such as Greek airspace.

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Mood that makes peace process hard to derail - Enthusiasm bodes well for talks on the province's future Politics was never far from delegates' minds during the conference. The hardline Democratic Unionists made an appearance. Even Mr Gary McMichael, a representative for the loyalist paramilitaries, was spotted in the bar. And the walk-out by Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, although a clear disappointment to the government, failed to overshadow proceedings. In the end, the event attracted prominent members of parties from across Ulster's political spectrum, which could augur well for the prospects of the round-table talks which it is hoped will eventually be convened on the future of the province. The sheer buoyancy of the mood and the enthusiasm of the welcome given to Mr John Major and the US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown suggest the peace process is building to a point where it is increasingly difficult for the main participants, including Sinn Fein, to contemplate staying outside. The conference came at a vital time after long delays in the forming of a new Irish government. This has raised questions about the the nature of Sinn Fein's relationship with the Republic and cast doubt over the progress on the framework document, which the two governments envisage as the basis of all-party talks on the constitutional arrangements for the province. More than anything, the conference has demonstrated Mr Major's personal commitment to maintain the momentum of the peace process. It has also served to underline the practical benefits that will flow from a durable settlement. In outlining a plan for a job creation scheme, Mr Major seemed keen to counter criticism by Sinn Fein that their supporters in the deprived areas of Catholic west Belfast were being ignored by the conference. The programme will do much to underline the government's commitment to address the long-term structural problems of the economy, widely seen as having inflamed community relations. Attention now turns to the talks with the paramilitaries with an exploratory session due to start with the loyalists in Belfast today. On Monday, British officials will meet Sinn Fein for the second time and both sides are expected to draft a more detailed agenda for future exchanges. Observers do not expect the talks to broach any of the contentious issues until at least February - but Mr Major yesterday again stressed the issue of the IRA's large stockpile of weapons and explosives. For the future, much will depend on the outcome of the search for a new coalition in Dublin. Last night, a new three-party coalition seemed about to be announced led by Fine Gael, a broadly conservative party, with Labour and the Democratic Left, replacing the Fianna Fail-Labour coalition which collapsed last month over a judiciary appointment scandal. Traditionally, Fine Gael has been more sympathetic than Fianna Fail to the unionists in Northern Ireland. In exchanges in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last week, Sinn Fein is said to have expressed disapproval for Fine Gael's presentation on the problems of the province. One concern is that Sinn Fein may feel increasingly isolated from politicians in Dublin, which may strengthen the position of hardline republicans opposed to the ceasefire. Equally, Sinn Fein has poor relations with Democratic Left, the successors to the Official IRA, from which the Provisional IRA split in the 1970s to pursue the armed struggle. Sinn Fein has already voiced concern about the likelihood of a Fine Gael-led administration in Dublin and it is clear that any new coalition will still require the support of Fianna Fail if it is to steer vital changes to the constitution through a referendum, as demanded by northern unionists. The recent political crisis has left so much bad feeling between the parties that many observers believe Fianna Fail deputies will be in no mood to co-operate with a Fine Gael-led coalition even on issues as close to their heart as the settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict.</p>

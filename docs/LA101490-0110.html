			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL SPOTLIGHT / FACTS, FIGURES, COMMENTS FROM SATURDAY'S GAMES;  </P> <P> HEATED RIVALRY  </P> <P> There was a good deal of bad blood brewing after Carson defeated Banning,  41-14, Friday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Not between the players. Between the coaches.  </P> <P> Banning Coach Joe Dominguez took exception, among other things, to Carson  adding a two-point conversion after its last touchdown in the fourth quarter.  The Colts led at the time, 39-14.  </P> <P> "I'd love to play them again," said Dominguez, who is 0-4 against Carson in  three seasons as head coach. "And when we're winning 39 to whatever, perhaps  we'll go for two also."  </P> <P> Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said his team entered the game in an angry frame of  mind because of remarks made by Banning assistant coach Rocky Garibay after  Carson beat the Pilots in a passing league game last summer.  </P> <P> "(Garibay) made some derogatory remarks, not only to me, but to the team, and  the kids took offense to it," Vollnogle said. "So I knew we were going to be  ready. I knew there was going to be some god-awful hitting going on because the  players were really (mad)."  </P> <P> Answered Dominguez: "That's just talk. Talk doesn't mean anything. I think  actions do. I think for a coach to go for two points when the other team is  down like that . . . come on. If it ever happens (that we have a big lead),  he's in for a long night."  </P> <P> QUICK RECOVERY  </P> <P> Reports that Carson quarterback John Walsh would be sidelined a minimum of  three weeks after suffering a sprained ankle last week proved to be greatly  exaggerated.  </P> <P> Walsh, as it turned out, didn't miss a beat. He received a doctor's clearance  Wednesday, returned to practice Thursday and on Friday set a school single-game  record with 406 yards passing. His four touchdown passes helped Carson take a  commanding 33-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "I had therapy on my foot and it felt OK, so I said, 'I'm playing,' " Walsh  said. "The swelling went way down. I taped it up real good tonight. It's a big  game. I didn't want to miss out."  </P> <P> Vollnogle said he was "shocked" when he learned Wednesday night that Walsh  would be able to play.  </P> <P> "I was told it was three to six weeks, so that's what I assumed it was," he  said. "We practiced all week with Tarriel (Hopper at quarterback)."  </P> <P> Dominguez, however, wasn't buying it.  </P> <P> "I think it's a bunch of bull when a coach lies and says a kid's not going to  play for three weeks, and he plays," he said. "I mean, play the game on Friday  night; don't play the game during the week.  </P> <P> "We figured on him playing. We were happy that he did play. The quarterback has  to be commended. He threw the ball real well tonight."  </P> <P> SMALL VICTORY  </P> <P> Miraleste Coach Tony Bantula said just being able to play Serra was a triumph  in itself, even if the powerful Cavaliers did win, 52-3.  </P> <P> Bantula said a group of concerned parents wanted Miraleste to forfeit the game.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Why?' and they said, 'Because they're going to carry us off on  stretchers,' " Bantula said. "I said, 'Bull.' They put their pants on the same  way as us. They didn't hurt us physically. They just have speed."  </P> <P> Miraleste finished with 62 net yards, and running time was kept in the second  half after Serra opened a 44-3 halftime lead. But Bantula believes the  Marauders can learn from the experience.  </P> <P> "It's a pleasure to go out and play against these guys," he said. "Not too many  schools can say they went out and played against Serra. We got our butts  kicked, but we played them. What it does, it makes us better. After seeing  this, what else can you face?"  </P> <P> Serra finished with 400 total yards and rushed for 396 yards on 33 carries, an  average of 12 yards a carry. Running back Jerald Henry led the way with 184  yards on eight carries, including touchdowns of 43, 63, 51 and five yards.  </P> <P> NOBODY'S PERFECT  </P> <P> You might have noticed that our predictions in the Ocean League didn't start  out too well Friday. Rolling Hills, which we picked to finish first, lost at  home to Morningside, 32-6; and Mira Costa, which we picked to finish last,  defeated Palos Verdes, 23-13.  </P> <P> Actually, it's no surprise. This league figures to be as competitive as any in  the South Bay, with any of the five teams having a shot at the title.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's possible," said Rich Egan, Mira Costa's offensive  coordinator, "but there could be five teams tied at 2-2 at the end."  </P> <P> STANDING ALONE  </P> <P> If there's a finer all-around athlete in the South Bay than Morningside  sophomore Stais Boseman, we'd like to see him.  </P> <P> Already considered one of the area's top basketball prospects, the 6-foot-3  Boseman can also play a mean game of football. He alternated at quarterback and  flanker in the Monarchs' victory over Rolling Hills, rushing for 126 yards on  11 carries and completing three of seven passes for 49 yards and a TD.  </P> <P> PICKOFF ARTISTS  </P> <P> Several defensive backs in the area are compiling impressive interception  totals this season. Among them:  </P> <P> West Torrance free safety Jason Orpe had two interceptions in a 14-9 victory  over South Torrance to give him six on the year. He returned the second one 34  yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Carson strong safety Tarriel Hopper had two interceptions against Banning to  give him three.  </P> <P> Redondo cornerback John Dulmage had two interceptions in a 10-0 victory over  North Torrance to raise his total to four. Sea Hawk free safety Jeremy Veasey  had one, giving him three on the year. Another Redondo defensive back, Joey  Zeller, has four interceptions.  </P> <P> TRIPLE THREAT  </P> <P> Overshadowed in Bishop Montgomery's 24-20 loss to St. Bernard was a  three-touchdown performance by Joe McEwen. The junior tailback-free safety  scored on a 95-yard kickoff return, a 70-yard interception return and a 60-yard  run.  </P> <P> STREAKS  </P> <P> Serra defeated Miraleste, 52-3, to extend its winning streak to 18 games.  </P> <P> Carson defeated Banning, 41-14, for the sixth consecutive time. It is the  longest winning streak in the 37-game series, which started in 1963.  </P> <P> Gardena beat San Pedro, 20-14, to snap a five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Narbonne fell to Washington, 20-14, extending its losing streak to 12 games.  </P> <P> Inglewood fell to Santa Monica, 49-20, for its 15th consecutive Bay League  defeat.  </P> <P> IN QUOTES  </P> <P> Leuzinger running back-linebacker Marvin Johnson, on looking past Friday's  22-12 victory over Culver City to next week's game with rival Hawthorne: "We  can't wait for that game. That's all we've been talking about. We took Culver  City easy. We weren't even worried about Culver City. We were worrying about  Hawthorne. That's all we've been concerned about."  </P> <P> Gardena Coach Mike Sakurai, on his team's 20-14 victory over San Pedro after  starting the season 0-4: "I'm very happy for our kids because they've been  taking a lot of flak from their classmates. They've been working hard but  haven't got a lot of support. We had something to prove."  </P> <P> Bishop Montgomery Coach Steve Carroll, on his team's four turnovers in a 24-20  loss to St. Bernard that brought its season total to 27: "I offer no excuses.  Next week, I promise you, you'll see a different football team."  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy, on his team's 23-13 loss to Mira Costa, which  brought a 1-3-1 record into the game: "Mira Costa is just a strong, physical  team. They have five or six big, aggressive people that come hard and smother  you. To really be in the game with them, we would have had to play errorless  football."  </P> <P> Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas, on his team's 41-27 victory at Beverly Hills:  "We're pleased to get out of here with a win. This place has been the pits for  Hawthorne in the past." ROB FERNAS and DAVID RAATZ  </P></p>

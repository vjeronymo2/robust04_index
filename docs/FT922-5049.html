			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / PM sustains orders of vanished empire MR JOHN MAJOR'S dissol-ution honours on Saturday and the Queen's birthday honours list a week later will be trawled minutely for any hint they may give of the prime minister's intention to overhaul the complex and cumbersome honours system. The honours system is often defended as harmless and inexpensive fun, which occasionally rewards the outstanding and frequently the dull but worthy. Critics say the system represents Britain at its worst - snobbish, secretive and backward-looking - and that nothing illustrates its absurdity better than the titles awarded of commander, officer and member of orders in a non-existent empire. Nearly every state awards honours of some kind, but Britain is the only country to give honours that involve the recipients' changing their names or taking a parliamentary seat unelected. Similarly, only Britain has evolved a system of such arcane complexity that only a handful of senior civil servants, and presumably the Queen, fully understand its fine distinctions. Any shivers of apprehension in Whitehall and the Conservative party that imminent reforms might damage cherished expectations are likely to be premature - both the lists to be published this month promise to be solidly mainstream and traditional. Many hurdles have to be overcome before reforms are introduced, and the question remains whether the meritocratic Mr Major can overcome the support for the system in the Civil Service and in the government, where patronage can be a formidable weapon. How would potential rebels be kept in order if government whips could not rely on honours for the subservient and hints about life peerages to discipline troublemakers? And how would party coffers be filled? At least twice annually - with the new-year and the Queen's birthday lists - and more frequently in years when parliament is dissolved or a prime minister resigns - public worries about patronage are aired, then shelved. Mr Major has now to show he can disrupt this pattern. There are three areas Mr Major will have to reform if he is to meet the main criticisms - the way decisions are reached, which is regarded as too secretive; the ending of automatic honours; and the abolition of political honours. Although recipients are researched scrupulously, the secrecy means there is often no clear rationale behind decisions, and that leads to suspicions. For example, the relationship between businessmen who give large sums of money to the Conservative party and those who have received high political honours is close. During Mrs Thatcher's 11 years as prime minister, 17 private-sector industrialists were made peers - their companies had contributed more than Pounds 5m to the Tory party or a linked organisation. As Mr John Walker says in his book The Queen Has Been Pleased, that works out at Pounds 300,000 a peerage. He estimates that a senior industrialist doubled his chance of getting a peerage or knighthood after 1979 if his company donated to Tory funds. After the Lloyd George sale of honours in 1920, when the price of a peerage was about Pounds 100,000 (more than Pounds 1m at today's prices), a political honours scrutiny committee of three privy councillors was created to ensure that there was no further scandal. Mr Major is clearly against the award of automatic honours to civil servants and others simply because of seniority. The practice was introduced to reward poorly paid public servants, but pay is no longer poor in the higher reaches of the Civil Service. The awarding of automatic honours is less clear-cut outside the Civil Service. The heads of the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Investments Board, for example, can count on knighthoods, but one is not always bestowed on the chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Chairmen of the four clearing banks are virtually assured of a title, and the governor and his deputy at the Bank of England are also certain of honours. So-called political honours were abandoned by Lord (Harold) Wilson when he was prime minister in 1966 and were not used by Sir Edward Heath, his successor, to reward loyal and long-serving backbenchers. The tradition was revived by Mrs Margaret Thatcher and more than 100 knighthoods were given to Tory MPs during her premiership. Probably the worst job to have for anyone wanting to attract an honour is that of a profession is usually well represented in the lists, the world of entertainment is rarely recognised. Stars such as Benny Hill, Dick Emery and Tommy Cooper received no recognition, although they provided big export earnings through films and television series. There also seems to be some distinction in sporting honours. Cricket, rugby union and show jumping get proportionately many more honours than soccer, rugby league or snooker. Support for reform is widespread. Lord Hunt, a life peer and former secretary to the cabinet in the Callaghan and Thatcher administrations, said the system worked surprisingly well in identifying people who were not part of the establishment. 'But the idea that people should get honours simply because they have reached a certain level in the Civil Service is wrong.' What is not clear from Mr Major's hints of reform is the timing, and the signs are that nothing is imminent. It will depend on his judgment on whether the political dividend of radical change is seen to outweigh the aggravation caused within the government and in Whitehall.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JESSE JACKSON ON BLACK VIOLENCE  </P> <P> In response to Jesse Jackson's Column Left, "When Blacks Kill Blacks, There's  Silence" (Commentary, Dec. 16):  </P> <P> Jackson's observation that too much killing is going on is right on target; he  misses the mark, though, when he starts in with the racist harangue. Guns of  all description are equally available to all comers in our society and in  direct proportion to the law of supply and demand.  </P> <P> The apparent fact that black people are using them in greater numbers than  white people says more about the effect of his excuse-making and blame-laying  than the guns themselves.  </P> <P> If he wants to effect real change among his constituents, he should return to  his early- and mid-'60s rhetoric whereby he encouraged the disadvantaged to  personally work to improve their lot in life and not rely on government or  anyone else to do it for them. If he would join me in promoting swift and  certain punishment for criminal conduct, instead of blaming rich, white  justice, we would see a decreasing prison population and a more affluent and  productive general population.  </P> <P> DONALD R. BOYD  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

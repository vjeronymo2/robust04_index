			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Recent acquisitions help lift Waterford to IPounds 11.4m WATERFORD Foods, the Irish dairy group, has reported a 31 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to IPounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.7m) on turnover up 35 per cent to IPounds 338.5m, for the six months ended June 30. The company said all its divisions produced good performances, with the exception of its Galloway West subsidiary in the US 'which was affected by unfavourable trading conditions'. Its newest acquisitions - Express Foods Ireland and Premier Dairies - emerged as significant contributors to earnings. Waterford paid Grand Metropolitan IPounds 63m for the two companies in August 1992 and the acquisitions have given the group a 36 per cent share of the liquid milk market in the Irish Republic and 70 per cent of the Dublin market. Mr John Barry, the chairman, said the reorganisation and integration in the north of the UK of the Heald's and UCD dairy businesses - acquired in December 1991 - had also helped boost earnings and improve profit margins from 4.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Interest charges rose sharply to IPounds 7.23m (IPounds 3.03m), reflecting the new acquisitions and the exceptionally high interest rates early in the year during the ERM currency crisis. Operating cash flow however, also grew strongly by 67 per cent to IPounds 26.9m, which the company said would be used to reduce net debt and gearing to around 65 per cent by year end (78 per cent at the end of 1992). Earnings per share grew by 20 per cent to 5.16p (4.29p), which Mr Joe Gill of Riada stockbrokers in Dublin said 'was ahead of expectations'. He said however, he was not adjusting his full-year pre-tax profits forecast of IPounds 24.8m and an EPS of 11.3p 'as market conditions are not expected to be as good in the second half. This will still represent good earnings growth of 13 per cent though'. An interim dividend of 1.19p (1.15p) has been declared.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour starts campaign for London seats - Marginals LABOUR today starts a fresh onslaught on marginal seats in London amid growing party concern that voters in the capital are failing to turn to the party in adequate numbers. One Labour insider has claimed that private polling has revealed that the 'loony left' tag associated with some leftwing borough councils is continuing to dog its efforts to win the 20 to 25 seats thought crucial for a national victory. In consequence the party is believed to have decided to concentrate its campaigning on the London suburbs and peripheral boroughs where voters appear more receptive than in the inner city. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, will today visit Brentford and Isleworth. Tomorrow Mr Bryan Gould, the frontbench leader of Labour's London campaign, will visit highly marginal Streatham amid speculation that the Tories may hold the seat in spite of the slim 2,407 majority. Local Conservatives have taken heart from a by-election in the nearby ward of Lambeth St Mary's in December which showed a 23.2 per cent swing from Labour to the Tories. Mr Gould's visit will be followed by the official launch of Labour's latest policy document on London. This promises a new Greater London Authority to be elected by proportional representation. Next week the entire Labour frontbench economics team, including Mr John Smith and Mr Gordon Brown, are to tour marginal London seats. Serious doubts remain, however, about whether Labour can win long-targeted marginals such as Dulwich, Battersea and Hampstead and Highgate. A Labour campaigner in London conceded last night that the progress was at a 'gentler pace' than had been hoped. But she went on to add: 'Time and again at general elections we do far better than in local elections.'</p>

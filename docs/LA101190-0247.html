			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FIELDER GETS OK FOR JAPAN TOUR  </P> <P> Japanese baseball fans will get their chance to toast Cecil Fielder, the newest  member of the 50-homer club, now that the Detroit Tigers have given their  approval.  </P> <P> Steve Greenberg, deputy commissioner of baseball, announced in September that  Fielder would be part of the all-star team sent to Japan for a string of eight  exhibition games in November. But Tigers General Manager Bill Lajoie said the  commissioner's office failed to get permission from the club to include  Fielder. Lajoie has since given Fielder permission to play in the tour.  </P> <P> A photograph of Fielder, idolized in Japan since his stint last year with the  Hanshin Tigers, appears on the tour's program.  </P></p>

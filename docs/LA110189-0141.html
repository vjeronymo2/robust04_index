			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES DRUG WAR FUNDS  </P> <P> The House approved today a spending increase of almost $3.2 billion for the war  against drugs, $900 million more than sought by President Bush when he launched  a campaign almost two months ago.  </P> <P> "Spend we will do -- this is no paltry, penny-pinching response," Rep. Silvio  O. Conte (R-Mass.) said as the House approved the measure on a voice vote.  </P> <P> The funds, attached to a money bill for transportation programs, represent the  major congressional input into the war on drugs this year. The overall bill,  also approved by voice vote, contains a ban on smoking on virtually all  domestic airline flights.  </P> <P> The bill must be acted upon by the Senate before the measure goes to the  President.  </P></p>

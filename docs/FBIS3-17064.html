			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "At the President's Administration" report: </F> "Sincerity of Intentions Must Be Judged by Actions"]    [Text] The Russian Federation President's Administration  is keeping a close watch on reactions to Boris Yeltsin's call  for civil peace and accord in the state and in society.    As is known, on 10 March the president met in the Kremlin  with representatives of Russian state, public, and business  circles, and the meeting participants said they agreed to the  idea of preparing and signing an Agreement on Civil Peace in  Russia. They invited political leaders, public figures, and  citizens of Russia wanting to contribute to the preparation of  the Agreement on Civil Peace to join in the work.    On 18 March, a number of newspapers published an appeal by a  group of figures announcing the creation of an association that  would be called "Accord for Russia." The appeal was signed by  several people who are known for their implacable stance  vis-a-vis the president and his policy of late. They include  several leaders of communist and "national patriotic"  organizations, as well as a Constitutional Court judge, whose  functions basically preclude participation in political  organizations.    The President's Administration expects the new association  to  make a specific contribution to the preparation of the Agreement  on Civil Peace in Russia and then to its practical  implementation. It is by these actions that society will judge  the sincerity of the intentions of the appeal's authors. This  was announced by the Russian Federation president's press  service.</p>

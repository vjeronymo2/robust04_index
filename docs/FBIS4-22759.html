It  has become an impediment to the development of market relations  and stands in the way of expanding all areas of business. What  is being done to overcome the legal "inadequacy"--this is the  subject of the discussion between Russian Federation Minister of  Justice Yuriy Kalmykov and DELOVOY MIR political observer  Miroslav Buzhkevich.    [Buzhkevich] The position of our entrepreneurs is  unenviable.  In addition to objective difficulties related to the decline of  production and the disturbance of economic ties, at each step  they encounter all kinds of legal restrictions that hamper their  initiative. Is it true, Yuriy Khamzatovich, that the legal base  for entrepreneurship in our country is that weak?    [Kalmykov] The first steps to its creation were taken a  couple of years ago. The Union parliament adopted a most  important Law on Property and also the Fundamentals of Civil  Legislation. After these came analogous Russian legal acts: On  Property, On the Enterprise and Entrepreneurial Activity, On  Banks and Banking Activity, etc. So it would be wrong to say  that we do not have a base for development of the market. It is  another matter that this base is painfully inadequate and still  weak.    Not only do we not have enough concrete legal acts, but we  are lacking the main thing--an integrated system of  interconnected and mutually conditioned laws based on common  principles of market relations. We are wrong to hurry to create  special normative acts, say, concerning the coal industry or  grain without relying on specific initial positions. Throughout  the rest of the world they have begun with basic codified acts  such as the Civil Code, the Trade Turnover Code, etc. The  practice of issuing particular government decrees is being  reflected in the regulation of the entire market space. There  are still frequent cases of the appearance of legal acts that  contradict those that already exist. For example, a draft of  Fundamentals of Land Legislation was prepared in which all the  questions--conclusion of purchase and sale transactions,  leasing, inheritance policy etc.--were resolved differently from  the way they are in the Civil Code. And regulation should be  standard for all objects of market circulation. If, for example,  securities are inherited according to one set of rules and  buildings and motor vehicles according to another, if each  special law introduces its own norms--there will be no market.    [Buzhkevich] You mentioned the Civil Code. It is considered  to be the main market law and is even called the business bible.  Why?    [Kalmykov] I would call the Civil Code the constitution of  market relations. It is head and shoulders above any special  federal law and has great legal force. If particular provisions  of the latter contradict it, preference is always given to the  norms established by the Civil Code.    The first, so-called general, part of it contains  descriptions pertaining to participants in market turnover. Both  citizens and legal entities. And also the Russian state,  components of the Federation, and municipal structures. They  used to be participants not in civil relations but in  subordinate, administrative ones. Additionally, this same part  of the Code contains a practically complete description of all  subjects of civil relations: economic partnerships, companies,  associations, concerns, etc. Conditions are determined for their  creation, organization, and liquidation. It also discusses what  commercial organizations and institutions are.    The draft recognizes: Civil law applies to all  commodity-monetary relations. Including everything related to  the land and other kinds of immovable property.    At the same time the draft does not envision regulation of  market relations. And it recognizes the need for direct  indication in the law of cases where price regulation, mandatory  conclusion of agreements, etc. are allowed. Such a system is  typical of developed market relations.    It is extremely important that the new Civil Code be in  effect in a society with a socially oriented market economy. And  it envisions guarantees and means of protecting the interests of  the weak party in legal relations, which most frequently is the  citizen.    [Buzhkevich] I would like to hear the extent to which the  new  Code takes into account and protects the rights of  entrepreneurs? This interests our readers.    [Kalmykov] The entire content of the Code, its letter and  spirit, are aimed at providing for free development of civilized  market relations. But before speaking about protecting the  rights of businesspeople I would mention their responsibilities.  When engaging in entrepreneurial activity they must act in good  conscience, reasonably, fairly, observing the requirements of  the law, moral principles of society, and the rules of business  ethics.    The draft of the Code, naturally, contains many innovations  which simply could not have existed previously. I would say the  primary one is granting commercial organizations (with the  exception of state and municipal enterprises) general legal  capacity, which makes it possible for them to participate in all  kinds of business without changing their charter documents.  Further, companies and partnerships, including full  partnerships, are becoming the main participants in the  entrepreneurial practice.    All property owners are given guarantees of their rights to  possession, use, and disposition of their property. At the same  time an exhaustive list of cases in which forced confiscation of  property from its owner, which is allowed only by a court  decision, will be created.    Liability for violation of commitments related to business  is  also interpreted in a new way. Previously the entrepreneur or  firm paid for failure to observe a contract or agreement only  when this occurred because of their own fault. According to the  draft Code, the only person relieved of liability is the one who  can prove that his failure to meet his commitments was caused by  an insurmountable force, that is, a natural disaster or  something similar.    Freedom of contract has been established, whereby its  conditions are determined by the parties themselves. In order  for this principle not to lead to unlimited arbitrariness on the  part of the entrepreneurs, especially those who hold a  monopolistic position in the market, and also in the interests  of the consumers, the concept "public contract" is introduced.  It applies to commercial organizations engaging in retail trade,  passenger traffic on public transportation, electricity supply  for housing, and medical, hotel, municipal, and consumer  services. They do not have the right to refuse these services to  citizens or establish any advantages or privileges for anyone.    The second, special part of the Civil Code has to do with  specific kinds of market turnover: contracts for delivery,  purchase-sales, leasing, shipment, insurance, the procedure for  capital construction, etc. Related to it are relations involving  intellectual property (inventions, copyrights, etc.) and also  problems of bequeathment and inheritance.    [Buzhkevich] When can we expect the completion of the work  on  the Civil Code and its ratification?    [Kalmykov] I think that the special part of the new Code  will  be ready by May or June. And the first, general part was  completed long ago by scholars of the Research Center of Private  Law and other scholarly institutions as well as specialists of  our ministry. The government has approved this part and it would  be possible to examine it, but the draft has not yet been turned  over to the State Duma.    Here I would like to make a digression. The idea was that  all  draft laws related to economic problems were to be prepared in  the government and, as legislative initiative, sent to the  parliament. The whole problem is that the Cabinet of Ministers  has no mechanism for this. The prepared draft laws drown in the  waves of bureaucratic red tape. For example, the first deputy  prime minister orders that the prepared draft of a legal act be  turned over to parliament, but the bureaucrats begin to discuss  whether or not it is expedient and timely to do this. Days and  weeks pass, and during this time other structures turn in  similar drafts of their own and thus cross the road to the  government.    The same thing happens in the apparatus of the presidential  administration. It is apparently no accident that B. Yeltsin  recently said in a public statement that the bureaucratic  apparatus is holding everything in its deadly embrace.    The fate of the draft of the general part of the Civil Code  can serve as a clear example of this. As I have already said,  the government has approved it and it was turned in to the  State-Legal Administration (GPU) under the president. And they  are able to hold documents for a good long time. More than two  months have passed but the draft is still not being studied or  evaluated. I cannot understand what motivates its leaders to  create such red tape. Perhaps they never find the time to gain  an understanding of the draft. Sometimes a "seditious" idea  occurs: How can it be that such a serious action, which will  have an extremely significant impact on the country's future,  was prepared without their participation. But there is no  special point in trying to find the causes of red tape. It is  more important to get the draft of the Civil Code turned over  for discussion in the State Duma. The GPU has long been  competing with the Ministry of Justice (that began back under  Minister N. Fedorov) and it cannot understand that this kind of  "competition" only harms the cause.    [Buzhkevich] You said that the new Code or, rather, its  general part could be approved by the middle of the summer.  Where do you get your optimism? In the Duma there will probably  be people who oppose the draft.    [Kalmykov] Yes, the debates will be heated. One of the  stumbling blocks is the problem of buying and selling land. I  think that certain factions of agrarians and communists are  trying to block the point about complete freedom to conclude  such agreements.    The Duma includes representatives of the so-called economic  law, which existed in Soviet times as a part of jurisprudence  which was actually against commodity-monetary relations. They  have advised in favor of the dominance of administrative  regulation of such relations. Today supporters of economic law  have been forced to hedge their bets and are no longer opposing  a transition to the market. But they think that the movement  toward it should be different from what it is now. They assert  that instead of a civil code it is more important to adopt a  trade code. But we think that it is necessary to enact the Civil  Code and see how it "works." It is quite possible that it will  be able to encompass all problems of commercial credit as a  whole. Then there will be no need for a trade code. But we  cannot rule out the possibility of adopting a trade code after  the civil code.    [Buzhkevich] But still one cannot consider the Civil Code to  be the only and all-encompassing legal act, which removes all  legal and organizational barriers from the path to  entrepreneurship and market relations. Concrete, as you say,  special laws are also needed.    [Kalmykov] And quite a few of them. To begin with I will  mention the law on the joint-stock company. In principle its  draft is ready. But the developer, the State Committee for  Administration of State Property, having received our remarks,  will not finish "digesting" it.    There is an extreme need for a law on the state enterprise.  Regardless of how widely the market economy may spread, a  certain and considerable part of the fixed capital of the  national economy, including factories, plants, etc., will remain  in state hands. And all of these must be controlled and their  fate must be decided: Should they be reconstructed or closed  down? And this can be done by using a special law.    There is an especially great need for an act on registration  of legal entities, that is, companies, partnerships, concerns,  etc. This area is now nothing but anarchy and confusion.  Registration is handled, and far from professionally, by the  mayor's offices and other municipal structures. And dishonest  bureaucrats are blatantly getting rich at the expense of  entrepreneurs and even certain private organizations. If you do  not give bribes you risk not being registered until several  months after you submit the document, or else you might be  refused altogether.    The law on registration will put an end to this confusion  and  arbitrariness. It will introduce a standard policy for this  operation for all legal entities. A Russian State Register of  them will be created. All this will increase the protection of  the interests of civilian participants and thus market relations  as well, and it will open up to them the possibility of  verifying the real state of affairs of their partners and it  will also make it difficult to commit abuses when reorganizing  or liquidating entrepreneurial structures. The Ministry of  Justice will take charge of state registration of legal  entities. Perhaps we will create a special service.    Finally, there is the problem of transportation relations.  Today they are a Tabula rasa--a clean slate. All transportation  regulations and codes have "long beards": They are antediluvian,  the rules they set do not correspond to the present day or  market relations. Look at what is being done on the railroads.  Deadlines for delivering freight are not being met, freight is  frequently lost, and sometimes it is stolen. There is nothing  you can say about the position of the passengers either. None of  the transportation workers--neither the railroads nor the  airlines nor the motor vehicle services nor the river  transportation services is responsible to them in any way at  all. We have not come a step closer to international standards  here.    All this is completely out of keeping with the rules of  market turnover. The regulations for rail and automotive  transportation and the aviation code must be created from  scratch. And they must correspond fully to the Civil Code. And  transportation workers and those who defend them in the state  structures must understand that the stricter the demands for  service to the clients, the more the railroad workers and  airline personnel themselves stand to gain because life will  force them to work honestly and in an organized way, and they  will finally be rid of the constant insulting, although fair,  criticism against them.    [Buzhkevich] You mentioned those who protect the interests  of  transportation workers in state structures. This kind of  protection is frequently called lobbying. How do you feel about  this phenomenon, which until quite recently was considered to be  purely capitalistic and is now spreading to our country?    [Kalmykov] There is lobbying and then there is lobbying. In  countries with developed market relations lobbying has long been  an important institution of political and economic life. They  have a multitude of forms which undertake to help joint-stock  companies, commercial firms, and political parties to conduct  their transactions, projects, and programs. In a number of  countries experts of these firms are credited with the  parliament, the government, and the presidential administration.  It is not easy to obtain this accreditation. It is necessary to  be not only a specialist with a degree in the area in which the  firm is engaged but also to be well versed in public and private  law. Any concealed lobbying is punishable by law or becomes an  occasion for scandalous disclosures that cost the careers of  political figures and commercial and financial bigwigs.    And I am for this kind of completely civilized lobbying.    But now, during the period of transition to the market, the  proper conditions for this kind of activity do not exist. And  what we now call lobbying has nothing in common with it and  causes harm to society and the economy. Because it is based on  corporate or personal connections and frequently on corruption  and bribes. And most often it leads to the transfer of materials  and funds to those regions and those branches of the national  economy which you cannot call the most needy, the ones in a  catastrophic situation.    When the state budget for this year was being formed I  observed how the chairman of the government did everything he  could to hold up under the pressure from involved individuals  and groups who were trying to pull apart the cost side of the  budget in the name of branch, corporate, and other interests.  And they basically managed to do this.    [Buzhkevich] But it still stood up under the demands of the  agrarians....    [Kalmykov] Not entirely. There are such things as unpaid  debts. Under conditions of a normal economy and a rule-of-law  state, they are ruled out because there is a reliable mechanism  in place for compulsory collection of money from debtors.    Everything is different here. The economy is in a transition  period and it is far from being a normal, market economy. And  the state has to pay for this.    For instance, they say that we must not take on debts and  subsidize certain branches. They say we must stick to our guns  for otherwise we will not be able to cope with inflation. From a  formal economic standpoint this might be true. But there is the  real situation, the actual pit in which we are all sitting. And  we have to get out of it. And we have no time for formalities  because then we will not achieve anything.    Of course, we can say to the director of an enterprise: If  your debtor will not pay, take him to court. But if he does not  have a shirt on his back, you will not be able to get any money  from him. Perhaps it is better (half of our enterprises cannot  declare bankruptcy) to help him, to give him a little support  through the state. Then you might look and see that the  enterprise is on its feet. We have already said that we are in a  transition period. That being the case, the state must exert a  regulating influence on the situation. That is what President  Franklin Roosevelt did 60 years ago when the United States was  establishing a market.    I think that our prime minister was right to support the  petition to allot funds to agriculture, part of which were a  state debt. How can we leave the peasantry without funds,  materials, and fuel right before planting. From here it is not  far to disaster--the country could be left without food and  other agricultural products.    It is another matter when they demand additional credit, and  at preferential rates. Here again is a manifestation of  subjective lobbying.    Various viewpoints and opinions, mainly regarding concrete  problems, exist in any government. People frequently say that it  is a single team and must think the same, they must be playing  the same song. But that is pure utopia. In government structures  there are people who think in different ways, and this is  probably a normal phenomenon. It is important for the government  to be unified in the main thing, the overall line of behavior.</p>

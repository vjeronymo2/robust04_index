			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> MEASURE M BUCKED TRENDS, TRADITION;  </P> <P> TAXES: CANNY STRATEGY, WORSENING TRAFFIC, GOOD VOTER TURNOUT COMBINED TO LIFT  O.C. TRANSIT INITIATIVE, EVEN AS OTHER POCKETBOOK MEASURES WERE REJECTED.  </P> <P> It took ever-worsening Orange County traffic, relatively high voter turnout and  a canny campaign strategy to pull Measure M from the ashes of last year's  defeat, political experts said Wednesday as they sifted through nearly complete  election returns.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the controversial half-cent sales tax overcame formidable obstacles  -- including a sluggish national economy and recent increases in state and  federal gasoline taxes -- and still managed to pass, 54% to 46%, on a night  when statewide voters resoundingly rejected measures that took aim at their  pocketbooks.  </P> <P> "In many respects, Orange County came of age last night," said Newport Beach  political analyst Harvey Englander. "The voters here decided to shoulder  responsibility for themselves, which is actually a very conservative thought."  </P> <P> Measure M's victory was made more remarkable by the failure of two state  alcohol-tax proposals and two initiatives that proposed taxing residents to pay  for fighting crime and drug abuse. All four of those measures went down to  defeat in Orange County as well, but Measure M escaped being lumped together  with them.  </P> <P> A transportation sales tax in Los Angeles County passed as well, but voters  there had previously backed a transportation tax, so observers were less  surprised by that election. Ventura County voters soundly rejected a sales tax  on their ballot.  </P> <P> The combination of Measure M's victory and the statewide rejection of most tax  proposals created an extraordinary moment in Orange County politics: Voters  here, traditionally the most conservative in the state, found themselves ahead  of many Californians in voting to charge themselves more for government  programs.  </P> <P> "It's ironic on the surface," Reed Royalty, the Pacific Bell executive who led  the pro-Measure M campaign, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "But I think what it shows is that Orange County people aren't necessarily  averse to paying taxes," he said. "I think they're willing to pay taxes when  they know what they're getting. . . . I'm not against paying for groceries when  I know what they are. It's when I go to the grocery store and am asked to buy  an unmarked can of goods that I'm averse to it."  </P> <P> Armed with the conviction -- and the polling data -- that other county voters  would share that view, Measure M's backers directed their 1990 campaign toward  informing residents of exactly what they would get for their half-cent on the  dollar. Supporters also benefited from reasonably strong voter turnout, unlike  that of 1989, which guaranteed a broader cross-section of voters at the polls  rather than a concentration of Orange County's deeply conservative core  electorate.  </P> <P> And in the time from last year's defeat to this year's victory, traffic  continued to get worse, feeding the frustration that Measure M promises to  combat.  </P> <P> Supporters of the tax credited that combination of strategy and circumstance  for their victory; opponents, tenacious in their underfunded efforts to derail  the tax, were bitter in defeat. Voters, they said, were duped.  </P> <P> "The people were fooled into believing that these projects have merit, when  most of them don't," said Bill Ward, a spokesman for Drivers for Highway  Safety, which opposes Measure M partly because it will help pay for car-pool  lanes. "They were just plain fooled."  </P> <P> Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano slow-growth advocate and leader of the anti-M  campaign, likewise said voters mistakenly embraced a poor remedy to the  region's increasingly snarled traffic: "I think that people were so desperate  that they were willing to tax themselves for any solution to the traffic mess,  good or bad."  </P> <P> Unlike last year's campaign, in which a county-record $2.5 million was spent in  defeat, the 1990 effort consistently kept a lower profile. Supporters still  raised more than $1 million this year, most of it from developers and big  business interests, but the lower-intensity campaign drew less attention to the  measure's developer backing.  </P> <P> Still, as Election Day drew near, prospects for Measure M remained uncertain.  Polls in the closing days of the campaign showed that the proposal enjoyed a  narrow lead, but support was still short of a majority. The poll numbers, in  fact, closely resembled those in the closing days of the 1989 race.  </P> <P> In 1989, Measure M took a narrow poll advantage into the election only to fail,  53% to 47%. A 1-cent tax proposal in 1984 was even more overwhelmingly  defeated, with 70% of county voters who cast ballots voting against it.  </P> <P> Confronted with a shaky lead, Measure M backers waged a low-key, last-minute  mail and telephone campaign that many observers credited with putting the  proposal over the top. The mailers were informational and understated, part of  the campaign's intentional desire to steer away from a furious rhetorical  battle as Election Day drew near.  </P> <P> "We ran a low-profile campaign targeted to voters willing to listen," said  David J. Townsend, a Sacramento-based political consultant who advised the  Measure M campaign.  </P></p>

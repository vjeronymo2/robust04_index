			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Personal View: Recovery crafted with co-operation The longest recession in the UK in more than half a century is officially over, according to government figures. But there is much more to be done if the UK is to restore its manufacturing base, reduce unemployment and sustain recovery. The key to continued growth is a partnership of government, banks and businesses. No single group or organisation can achieve alone even a small part of what can be achieved by these parties together. For too long we have been caught up in a sterile slanging match about who is to blame for the problems of smaller companies. With corporate gearing high by UK standards and profitability likely to remain weak, pressure on company finances will continue. Smaller companies, denied access to the capital markets, will be especially vulnerable. There are three key areas where the partnership of government, banks and businesses can help: debt, equity and cash-flow. Debt: In general, businesses should be looking to move away from over-dependence on short-term financing in order to lessen their vulnerability to rising and high interest rates. The improvements to the loan guarantee scheme announced in the Budget were welcome. Increases in the loan limit and guaranteed amount and the cut in premiums should help support economic recovery and create new jobs. But these are only the first step. Introduction of a government loan support scheme, for example, would enable banks to reduce the rate charged on medium and long-term loans to 1 per cent over base. Essentially, this would act as a subsidy to industry and could be restricted to manufacturing with its need for longer-term capital investment. A similar scheme already operates in Germany. Even if a quarter of bank loans to manufacturing companies were subsidised, it would cost the Treasury only about Pounds 67m a year. Banks in turn must be prepared to lengthen the maturity of debt. Equity: While recognising the government's difficult fiscal position, I think there are a number of ways it could encourage the retention and enlargement of companies' equity bases. It was gratifying to see the importance of the entrepreneur's investment role recognised in the Budget, with the introduction of capital gains tax relief to those who sell one business and invest the proceeds in another. A manufacturing support scheme, to replace the business expansion scheme, which is phased out at the end of the year, would further encourage longer-term equity investment by individuals. Tax incentives could also be used to encourage businesses to retain surplus profits. At the moment, every incentive is the other way. Banks can also support equity investment. Through equity options, for instance, we can help the profitable, well-managed but slower growing company which does not need additional permanent equity but lacks loan collateral. Similarly, where well-managed companies, with good prospects, are overburdened with debt, we should consider using debt/equity swaps at an earlier stage, rather than as a last resort. Midland has been at the forefront of developing equity investment facilities. Midland Growth Capital, which provides equity of between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 750,000 for established customers, is one of the few national institutions to offer long-term equity finance of less than Pounds 250,000. Equity is an essential component of a sound balance sheet and businesses must accept this, even if it means allowing in outside investors. Cash-flow is also fundamental to business survival. Improved debt control, through increased use of factoring and invoice discounting, is something for both the banks and companies to consider. A statutory right to interest on overdue debts - common in some European countries - would significantly improve the cash-flow of many companies. But financial means alone will not ensure a company's future. Effective management calls for the production of accurate, prompt financial information. Adequate training is also vital. Recovery may at last be under way, but its pace looks set to be slow and fragile. Government must, therefore, join with banks and businesses to ensure we do not repeat the experience of the last decade, when the number of failures following the 1979-81 recession did not peak until 1985. Implementing any one of the proposals outlined here could help avoid a similar trend. Implementing them all, as part of a concerted tripartite effort, would have a real impact.

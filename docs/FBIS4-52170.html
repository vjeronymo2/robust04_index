			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Mervin Nambiar] </F>   [Text] SINGAPORE, May 7 (AFP) -- Singapore Saturday  summoned US envoy Ralph Boyce to the foreign office to express  displeasure over false reports on American teenager Michael Fay  caned here for vandalism, a government spokesman said.    The spokesman said that the government was unhappy over a  news agency report quoting Fay's father, George Fay and his  American lawyer, Theodore Simon, as saying that the caning  ripped Fay's buttocks and left him in continual pain.    Both men, speaking in the United States, had reportedly  quoted US Vice-Consul John Coe who visited Michael Fay on  Friday, a day after he received four lashes on his buttocks, in  their accounts of the teenager's condition after the beating.    Fay, 18, from Kettering, Ohio, who lives here with his  mother  and step-father had pleaded guilty to charges of spray-painting  cars, pelting them with eggs and keeping stolen road signs. But  he later claimed he was innocent.    Boyce, the American Charge d'Affairs here, and Coe, who were  both called to the foreign office, were not availabe for comment.    Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary Kishore Mahbubani said  that the US embassy had the moral obligation to confirm or deny  the report.    The ministry thought that the true picture would come out  when it allowed Coe to see Fay but instead was "shocked by the  tremendous amount of falsification," the Singapore Broadcasting  Corporation quoted Mahbubani as saying.    Coe was the only American to see Michael Fay after the  caning  on Thursday.    Coe did not speak to the press after the prison visit but  briefed the teenager's mother, Randay Chan who later denounced  the beating as "torture."    Chan said that the consular officer was not able to assess  her son's condition because the meeting took place "in a  controlled situation" with prison officials present.    Singapore's Prisons Department earlier Saturday called  statements attributed to George Fay and Simon "wild allegations  and misinformation," adding that Michael Fay walked back to his  cell after the caning, saying he "wanted to act like a man."    The spokesman said that the list of "misinformation"  attributed to Simon included the claim that blood ran down the  teenager's legs during the caning.    He said that while there were a few drops of blood on Fay's  buttocks, "blood did not run down his legs" during the caning.    "He sat on a chair shortly after the interview started and  remained seated throughout the rest of the interview," the  spokesman said. George Fay had reportedly said that his son  stood throughout the meeting with Coe    Fay also told Coe to tell his mother "not to worry" and tell  his father to "shut up," the spokesman said, adding: "The cane  marks are almost dry and clean."    Fay was ordered caned six times, but the Singapore  government  reduced the sentence to four lashes after President Bill Clinton  intervened.    Clinton has called the punishment a "mistake" and the State  Department called in Singapore's ambassador to the United  States, S.R. @athan, and told him that Washington was  disappointed by the affair.    Meanwhile 17-year-old Shiu Chi Ho, a Hong Kong national also  convicted of vandalism, spent his first full day in prison  Saturday after abandoning plans to take his case to a higher  court.    Shiu, sentenced to 12 lashes and eight months jail for  spray-painting four cars over two weekends, will write to  President Ong for clemency, his father, Shiu Chung On said.    He is not expected to be caned until after the government  decides on the petition, lawyers said.</p>

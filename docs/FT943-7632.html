			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Israeli shares fall 10% on tax fears Israel's stock market slid almost 10 per cent yesterday amid frantic trading by investors nervous about a proposed new tax on share profits. At the close of trading the benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 blue chip companies had fallen 18.22 points, or 9.93 per cent, to 165.18. Many smaller stocks on the Karam index fell 15-20 per cent. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange suspended a rule which allows for a halt to normal trading if shares in any company fluctuate more than 10 per cent in a day. Trading was also extended beyond the normal closing time. Officials said these exceptional moves were taken to encourage a once-off 'definitive readjustment', and to allow the market to establish an equilibrium. Analysts said the record wave of selling worth about Shk600m (Pounds 128m) was the worst single day for the market since the banks shares collapse of 1983. They believe the market panicked after the Treasury closed the exchange for two days last week and announced a 10 per cent capital gains tax of share profits from next January 1. Although the cabinet modified the proposal yesterday allowing investors to offset some of the tax against losses, market experts said investors were still jittery and expected the effective rate of taxation to be around 18 per cent. Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments, said the assumption before yesterday's trading was that the market would be discounted by 10 per cent - the face value of the new tax. But he predicted further declines this week as investors assessed the effective rate of tax they would have to pay. 'It is true that there has been panic, heavy trading and mutual fund redemptions today but so far the effects have been at the more positive or low side of expectations,' he said. 'Hopefully we have seen the major technical correction and further declines won't be substantial.' Before yesterday the market had fallen 25 per cent this year from its peak of 258 points in January because of poor company results, higher than expected inflation, interest rate rises and a clean-up campaign by the Securities Authority which resulted in several arrests. Fears about inflation, currently about 14 per cent, and another rise in interest rates could further depress the market.</p>

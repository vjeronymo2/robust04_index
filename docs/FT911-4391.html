			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Money Markets: No German move THE GERMAN Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged at yesterday's council meeting. Speculation that the central bank might increase rates followed last week's rise in the Bundesbank's fixed rate at a tender for securities repurchase agreements, but talk about higher rates was mainly confined to the foreign exchanges and overseas markets. There was no further tightening at this week's tender and traders on the Frankfurt money market were always sceptical that the council meeting would agree to increase either the discount or Lombard rates. Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.80 per cent yesterday in quiet trading. Credit conditions were comfortable, but tax payments are tending to drain liquidity at present. In London short-term interest rates maintained a downward course, but the longer end of the market was slightly firmer. Three-month sterling interbank eased to 11 13/16 -11 from 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent, while 12-month money rose to 11 7/16 -11 5/16 from 11 3/8 -11 1/4 per cent. Short-sterling futures traded in a narrow range on Liffe. June delivery opened firmer at 88.69 and touched a peak of 88.72, before closing at 88.68 compared with 88.67 previously. Day-to-day credit remained in reasonably comfortable supply on the London cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 350m, but revised this to Pounds 300m at noon and then back to Pounds 350m in the afternoon. Help of Pounds 288m was provided. The authorities did not operate in the market until after lunch, when Pounds 288m bills were bought outright, by way of Pounds 24m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 264m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 495m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Pounds 60m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 200m to liquidity and bank balances above target of Pounds 5m. In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its money market rate for special advances at 8.70 per cent when offering seven-day liquidity to the banking system. A tender for the funds will be held today to offset Fl 4.2bn draining from the market as an earlier facility expires.</p>

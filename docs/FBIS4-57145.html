			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Santiago, 11 May (NA) -- Today, Economics Minister  Domingo Cavallo and Chilean President Eduardo Frei agreed it is  necessary to advance in the physical integration between the two  countries, through joint projects like the construction of a  bridge, which links Mendoza with Santiago.    Cavallo met the Chilean president at La Moneda Palace, the  Chilean government house. They reviewed the implementation of a  number of bilateral projects including the construction of a  tunnel, 2 km below the current one.    After meeting with Frei, Cavallo emphasized that companies  with the required equipment are interested in this project.  Cavallo noted that these companies constructed the tunnel under  the English Channel, linking France with England. The minister  indicated that this project would be implemented through "an  investment system involving tolls and contributions by both  countries."    A feasibility survey for constructing a border pass in the  north is planned within the framework of integration. This  project may begin in the city of Jama in Salta Province or the  city of Sico in Jujuy Province. The chosen city will be linked  with the Chilean city of Antofagasta.    Chile is very interested in receiving Argentine gas supplies  while our country is especially interested in increasing the  volume of national products through ports on the Pacific Ocean.    Cavallo announced that formal negotiations on the latest  economic cooperation agreement will be held by the Argentine and  Chilean Foreign Ministries within 30 days.    Concerning the possibility of Chile joining Mercosur [Common  Market of the South], Cavallo said Frei "did not express a final  response," but "reacted favorably to the idea." Chile is fully  concentrating its energies on joining NAFTA and still has strong  reserves on some Mercosur points. Chile believes there must be  a gradual advancement toward free trade because it has problems  adjusting its agriculture, especially grains and meat.    Cavallo accepted this idea, noting that "any advancement  must  be gradual because it is not possible to achieve zero tariffs in  intraregional trade overnight." Cavallo emphasized that it is  necessary to remove nontariff barriers which could "affect free  trade." He noted that "realistic hygienic standards for  vegetables and animals" alone should suffice.    The minister said he trusts the free-trade zone will be  achieved on 1 January 1995, as established in the Treaty of  Asuncion, and expressed hopes that a final decision on a common  tariff system will be well advanced by then.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / UK Company News: ITV offers to buy Thames programmes Thames Television has been offered its first big independent production deal for next year - the year the company ceases to be an ITV broadcaster. The ITV companies want to buy a package of the company's most famous programmes for next year's schedule in a deal worth about Pounds 22m. The programmes include The Bill, This Is Your Life, Wish You Were Here, and Minder. After Thames was outbid by Carlton Television in last year's competitive tenders, Mr Richard Dunn, Thames's chief executive, said his main aim was to become the UK's leading independent television producer. He declined to comment last night because he had not yet received the details of the ITV offer. The deal can only be for the first eight months of next year because ITV has not yet got its new network commissioning structure in place. That structure also needs to be approved by the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

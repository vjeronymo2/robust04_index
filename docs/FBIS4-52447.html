			<p>BFN     [Text] In view of the fact that a state of emergency has  been declared in Yemen, the government now holds growing  expectations for the early approval of the Self-Defense Force  [SDF] Law revision so the SDF can be mobilized to rescue  Japanese residing abroad. This issue was shelved for further  deliberations at the last Diet session. Since the outbreak of  the civil war in Yemen, the safety of Japanese residing there  cannot be assured. Under the current situation, however, the  Japanese Government is incapable of helping them to flee the  country but has to rely on other countries. For example, they  will have "to take advantage of" vacancies on military aircraft  or vessels of other countries. And it is believed the  government has also taken into consideration the situation when  overseas Japanese have to be rescued in case of economic  sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea).    With regard to Japanese residing in Yemen, the government  issued recommendations for evacuation on 9 May. However, since  the government cannot mobilize the SDF or government aircraft  for the rescue operation, a total of 70 Japanese -- as reported  by the Foreign Ministry -- have sought safety in such places as  Djibouti in Africa by U.S., German and Italian military aircraft  or French military vessels.    In this connection, Administrative Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito stressed at a news conference on 9 May that the  SDF Law has to be revised at an early date.</p>

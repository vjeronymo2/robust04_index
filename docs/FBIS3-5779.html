			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The nation's principal data network operator  yesterday announced a trial service of new technology that will  ultimately let customers send data through the air as easily as  through phone lines. The announcement by Dacom kicks off a race  for a market share among foreign and domestic equipment makers,  as all major carriers are scurrying to tap the latest market  service, known collectively as wireless data transfer.    The idea of wireless data transfer is to use radio waves to  free traveling executives and other people on the go from having  to plug laptop computers and other data devices into telephone  lines.    "This marks our major initiative in the wireless data market  as we expect a three-way race with Korea Mobile Telecom and  Korea Telecom," said Dacom spokesman Yi Song-ki.    Dacom is installing base stations, or radio transmitters, to  launch the trial service in a 5-km radius area around its  Yongsan headquarters in Seoul by August. It plans another trial  service in Taedok Science Town near Taejon.    Dacom's system, modeled after the Modacom service of  Germany's Deutsche Bundes Post-Telecom, uses a wireless  packet-switched messaging technique. A tall powerful radio  transmitter sends data in short bursts known as packets. Each  packet holds about three- quarters of a page of text (about 128  English words). Longer transmissions are broken up and  reassembled at the receiving end.    "The real advantage of our system is that we can rapidly  establish a nationwide network through connections to our  existing (wired packet-switched) Dacom Network Service," said Yi  Un-tae, a manager at Dacom's technology development department.    "It will allow business people carrying easy-to-use wireless  devices to move into new, unexpected places," he said. Dacom  expects to offer a commercial service by the latter half of next  year.    Just as Dacom is trying to steal the thunder in the domestic  wireless industry, cellular monopoly holder Korea Mobile Telecom  plans to launch its own digital messaging system by June, which  would provide packet-switched data over its existing cellular  channels.    Korea Telecom, the nation's state-owned public telephone  operator, is working on its own wireless data system, officials  said.    Although these networks are to operate in the same general  radio- frequency range of 800 megahertz, their technological  modes are different, so they require their own terminals.    Dacom customers would have to buy one of Motorola's  palm-size  messaging device InfoTac or bigger and higher-capacity PDT-220  terminals. The prices are high: 2.15 million won for an  InforTac terminal and 5.6 million won for a PDT-220.    A Korea Mobile Telecom subscriber would have to buy a $1,000  wireless modem, the size of a cigarette box with a small  protruding antenna, that snaps onto a notebook computer and  allows data files to be sent over cellular telephone networks.    Officials expect the price of terminals to drop sharply as  more and more customers sign on. No one is sure how big the  market will be. The industry says there will be about 10,000  subscribers by the end of next year. They foresee that number  burgeoning to 100,000 to 500,000 by the end of the decade.    Dacom says one advantage of its system is that it is well  tested in the market, while Korea Mobile Telecom's rival  Cellular Digital Packet Data system is still an emerging service  overseas.    Two public radio frequency systems similar to Dacom's are in  operation in the United States: Ardis, a joint venture between  Motorola Inc. and the International Business Machines Corp., and  Ram Mobile Data, a partnership of RAM Broadcasting and BellSouth.    But Dacom says its system, with a carrying capacity of  19,200  bits of information per second, is much faster than Ardis' 4,800  bits and Ram's 8,000 bits.    Korea Mobile Telecom's CDPD system, which also uses the  clearer and faster digital format of ones and zeros of computer  code, boasts the same transmission capacity as that of Dacom.  It would allow a file containing a page and a half of text to  be sent in one second.    Although wireless data is new and virtually unheard of here,  companies hope it will thrive for some of the same reasons that  have helped the domestic cellular industry attract half a  million subscribers in its first nine years: it provides vital  mobility to key people.    Here are some of the possibilities: Credit card companies  would use wireless networks to authorize credit in places where  a dial-up (wired) service is unavailable (taxi drivers, for  example, would accept credit cards). Postal couriers would use  hand-held terminals and a wireless network to accept signatures  written with an electronic pen and to notify the company's  package-tracking center.    Delivery services and car rental companies would depend on  wireless networks to keep track of their packages or vehicles.  A small set-top box on a vending machine would send out  wireless messages telling its owner that certain products are  out of stock. Airline ticket agents would come out from behind  the counter to confirm tickets and assign seats for passengers  standing in line at airports. Department stores would exchange  price lists and sales figures instantly, making point-of-sale  management possible. Police can check, on the spot, whether a  number plate is on the wanted list in a computerized data base.    The wireless data transfer is the telecommunication  industry's latest whispered promise that soon, and very soon, it  will unite telephones and computers into a single wireless  go-anywhere device.</p>

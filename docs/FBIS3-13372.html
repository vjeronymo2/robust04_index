			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  has said that the United States, which alone is hampering the  issuance of an international resolution condemning the Hebron  massacre, recently proposed a deal to the PLO. This deal  includes the fact that the United States will agree to a  resolution stipulating an unarmed international presence in the  occupied territories in return for a Palestinian commitment to  resume the peace negotiations.    In its editorial for tomorrow, Sunday, the newspaper  expresses its derision for such an American proposal. It  wonders whether this was all the U.S. mountain [reference to the  saying "The mountain hath labored and brought forth a mouse"]  could produce. It describes the resolution as inadequate, and  says its contents have been gutted. The international force  would also be disarmed. In addition, the paper says that  Washington has not taken into account all the facts that have  been revealed about the role of the Israeli Army in the  massacre, insofar as they have to do with their Israeli ally.    AL-JUMHURIYAH clarifies that all the Zionist massacres  confirm that if the issue of settlements in the occupied  territories is not presented and pressure is not put on Israel  to remove them, or to at least disarm the settlers, then the  peace that would be established would be one of oppression and  submission.    The paper calls for an Arab stand supporting the  Palestinians  when they resume negotiations. At least the Arab cordon states  should meet to make a united decision regarding the peace  process.    It affirms that as a result of the Gaza-Jericho agreement,  Israel is every day reaping new gains. It notes that the latest  of these gains is the restoration of military cooperation  between Israel and France after 27 years of estrangement in the  wake of the June 1967 aggression.    The newspaper wonders why Israel gets all this sympathy and  protection from the West despite the fact that it has never  stopped its aggression and oppression. The paper says: It must  be the alliances between politicians and the language of  self-interest.</p>

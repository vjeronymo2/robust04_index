			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LICENSE PLATES JUDGED 2B BEST  </P> <P> It's the 20th anniversary of personalized license plates in California, so  car-care company Eagle One held a contest to find the most creative plate on  the road. The winner, chosen by a panel of TV comedy writers, was motion  picture production manager Robert P. Schneider, whose plate, IM2BZ2P, refers to  the 16-hour days he says he works.  </P> <P> The runners-up -- culled from 600 entries from 36 states -- were OUT50GZ (Out  50 G's), a reference to the cost of Linda Ressler's Mercedes in Valencia;  O4A4RE (Oh for a Ferrari) on Lou Mickley's Honda in Bethlehem, Pa.; AUDIDOD  (Audi Doody) on Joyce Matuszak's Audi in Sandwich, Ill., and BRTQLIT (Be  Articulate) on speech therapist Rita Larson's car in Burlingame, Calif.  </P> <P> Schneider won a CD player for his car and $500 in car-care products. Replicas  of the plates will go on display at the Improv comedy nightclub in Hollywood.  </P></p>

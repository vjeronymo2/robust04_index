			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Four injured in Londonderry blast Four people - including three children - were taken to hospital with minor injuries yesterday after the IRA detonated a huge landmine in Londonderry. The bomb, which was aimed at a passing British army patrol, was the first significant military attack since the Downing Street declaration. It gave a clear sign that the IRA is not observing an unofficial ceasefire while deciding on its formal response to the Major-Reynolds peace initiative.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Losses at Asarco after metal prices fall PLUMMETING copper, lead, and zinc prices contributed to a third-quarter loss at Asarco, the integrated US mining company. It suffered a net loss of Dollars 3m, or 8 cents a share, compared with profits of Dollars 18.1m, or 44 cents, in the third quarter of 1992. Sales were Dollars 425.2m, down from Dollars 490m a year ago. For the first nine months, Asarco posted a loss of Dollars 58m, or Dollars 1.40 a share, against a gain of Dollars 28.8m, or 69 cents, before extraordinary charges. Year-to-date sales are Dollars 1.3bn, down from Dollars 1.4bn in the first nine months of 1992. Asarco said its average realised price for copper dropped to 86 cents a lb in the third quarter, down from Dollars 1.13 a year earlier. Zinc prices were down 20 cents a lb, to 41 cents, and lead prices down 12 cents, to 19 cents a lb this quarter. The company's average realised price for gold and silver gained, but volumes were not sufficient to offset price declines in copper. Mr Richard Osborne, chairman, said the decline in metals prices reduced net earnings for the quarter by Dollars 33.8m from levels a year ago. Asarco realised an after-tax gain of Dollars 5.4m from the sale during the quarter of 9.9 per cent of Asarco Australia. AMAX, the diversified US aluminium and coal company, reported third-quarter net losses of Dollars 60.7m, or 77 cents a share, from last year's loss of Dollars 24.6m, or 29 cents. The company had an operating loss of Dollars 15m in the third quarter, against an operating profit of Dollars 14.4m in the same quarter a year ago. Sales for the quarter fell to Dollars 893.3m, from Dollars 959m last year. Amax, which is in merger negotiations with another large metals and mining group, Denver-based Cyprus Minerals, said depressed worldwide aluminium prices would keep the pre-merger results under pressure into 1994. Amax and Cyprus shareholders will vote on the merger plan on November 12. Under the plan Amax will spin off its aluminium operation, Alumax, as an independent, publicly-held company. Analysts say the global aluminium glut will make the spin-off difficult, but Mr Allen Born, Amax chairman, said the subsidiary was already adopting price protection programmes to stabilise revenue, and was considering diversifying into higher-value aluminium product manufacturing. For the first nine months Amax reported a loss of Dollars 170.6m, or Dollars 2.18, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 133.3m, or Dollars 1.53, on sales of Dollars 2.8bn in the same 1992 period.</p>

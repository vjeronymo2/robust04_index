			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: Corporate debt sector goes retrospective THE corporate debt market went retrospective last week, producing a spate of exotic long-dated bonds the likes of which have not been in fashion since the 1950s. Boeing, the US aerospace group, launched a Dollars 125m, non-callable, 50-year issue: and ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, sold Dollars 150m of 100-year bonds. The bank issue was priced to yield 110 basis points over the benchmark 7.125 per cent 30-year US Treasury bond. A Yankee bond denominated in US dollars, it was snapped up by yield-hungry US money managers. There have been two other 'century' bond issues this year, by Walt Disney and Coca-Cola. It is not nostalgia that is bringing these bonds back, but a return to a tranquil, low inflation environment. This has boosted real rates of return and made the leverage provided by ultra long-term securities attractive to investors who believe interest rates still have room to slide. The risk, of course, is that the leverage these issues offer cuts both ways  -and when rates rise, the price of the long-dated bonds will fall far more precipitously than shorter maturities. From the point of view of corporate borrowers with high credit quality, interest rates have fallen far enough to make a long-term lock seem prudent. The market for the ABN Amro bond and the 50-year Boeing issue was underpinned by news last week that the so-called 'core' rate of US wholesale price inflation was flat in September, and that the closely-watched consumer price index was up only 2.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis. Traders who had bought the Boeing and ABN Amro issues on Monday and Tuesday were already sitting on a profit by the end of the week, while the portfolio jockeys who had opted for a ride on the Disney century bond in July had logged an impressive gain of 900 basis points. The debate over ultra long-term debt is by no means one-sided. Some economists argue that the value added from buying a bond with a 100-year maturity is only marginal when compared with returns from more conventional 30-year corporate debt. 'There's a school of thought which says it's like using a sledge-hammer to hang a picture,' says Mr Michael Bassett, an investment consultant with Stone &amp; McCarthy. According to Mr Bassett's calculations, the extra 70 years of maturity in a century bond will deliver only one more year of duration to the average portfolio than a conventional 30-year issue. What the century bonds do deliver is 'convexity', or price appreciation in response to a drop in interest rates. Be that as it may, extra-long dated bonds have proved popular with investors who, having missed the initial stages of the bond rally, are now playing catch-up. These investors have bought the extra-long dated bonds to get a quick boost for their portfolios, and have no intention of holding them to maturity. Other interested buyers have been insurance companies, which like a long, steady stream of coupon payments to match long-term liabilities, such as life insurance claims. Century bonds are predictable, and avoid the reinvestment costs and risks posed by shorter maturities. Ultra-long bonds are essentially annuities, with buyers more interested in their coupon stream than in recovering principal. For extremely long-dated corporate issues to be successful, an issuer must be perceived as a very high-quality borrower, says Mr Fred Sturm, an economist with Fuji Securities. With the yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds rapidly approaching 5 1/2 per cent, more long-dated corporate bonds are likely to appear on the market. Their rarity and relative illiquidity will require special analysis, possibly more akin to individual equity valuation than traditional corporate bond rating.</p>

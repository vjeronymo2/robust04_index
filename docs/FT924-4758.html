			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine vows action against abuse of market power WHEN the government announced in 1987 that it intended to reform legislation on restrictive trade practices and givethe authorities stronger powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour, consumer groups complained that the government was addressing only half of the problem. Yesterday's green paper, launched by trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine, is designed to deal with the other half - abuse by individual companies of their power in the marketplace to stifle competition. The proposals are targeted at companies abusing their strength to try and drive out competitors. They are also aimed at those who use their power to take advantage of customers and suppliers. Existing legislation dealing with abuse of market power in the Fair Trading Act 1973 and the Competition Act 1980 is weak on deterrents. Under European Community law anti-competitive practices are prohibited. Companies which indulge in price-fixing or try to force competitors out of the market fall foul of EC competition rules and can be fined up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover. However, under UK law a business accused of anti-competitive behaviour will not be penalised unless and until it has been investigated by the competition authorities and has subsequently broken undertakings not to offend again. There are no powers to impose penalties for past conduct or to provide damages for victims of abuse. Because the UK law is seen as weak on deterrents many people argue that UK competition authorities need stronger powers such as those wielded by the European Commission. The government is now seeking views on whether reform of the UK law along these lines would be a good idea. But while adopting a regime based on the EC system would appear to be the easiest solution, there are aspects of the present regime the government is keen to preserve. By adopting a case-by-case approach and not automatically assuming that apparent abuse of monopoly power is against the public interest the UK system is seen to be less rigid than the EC's. The fundamental difference between the two systems comes in the definition of market power. The UK takes a more broad approach. A business is deemed to have a simple monopoly if it has 25 per cent of the market, irrespective of whether it has real market power. The existence of a simple monopoly is determined by a statistical test. Under EC rules actual dominance is the issue. The commission takes the view that a dominant position exists when a business has at least 40 per cent of the market and its rivals have significantly smaller shares. Other factors such as barriers to entry for new competitors and anti-competitive behaviour are also relevant. So instead of simply adopting an EC-based approach the government has put forward three options for change. The first is to strengthen the existing legislation. This would allow the competition authorities to retain a case-by-case approach rather than treating anti-competitive behaviour as automatically unlawful. But the government would strengthen the investigation powers of the Office of Fair Trading; give more scope to the director-general of fair trading to accept binding undertakings from companies without an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission; and make provision for businesses to be sued for damages and possibly subject to civil penalties for continuing abuse of market power after a complaint has been referred to the monopolies commission. The advantage of this is that it would retain the present flexibility. But it would not address the fundamental problem of weak deterrents and it would only offer limited redress to victims of anti-competitive behaviour. The second option would be to introduce a general prohibition on abuse of market power backed by tough investigatory powers for the Office of Fair Trading and financial penalties. The monopolies provisions of the Fair Trading Act and the anti-competitive practices measures in the Competition Act would be repealed. This would bring UK practice more closely into line with continental Europe and would offer a more uniform system for companies operating in the UK and in continental Europe. It would however cover more market situations than EC rules do, and the government would continue to allow the competition authorities to use divestment and price controls as remedies. The only real drawback to this is that it would apply in a narrower range of market situations than existing UK legislation because, for example, it would not enable the competition authorities to look at possible market abuse by duopolies or complex monopolies. The third option is to repeal measures against anti-competitive practices measures in the Competition Act and introduce a prohibition with the same scope as the EC rules, but keep the monopoly powers under the Fair Trading Act. This is seen by the government as offering the best chance of an effective deterrent while retaining the breadth and flexibility of the existing legislation. The disadvantage of this option is that operating two different systems in parallel could increase uncertainty for business. Under the second and third options companies could be fined up to 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover for anti-competitive behaviour. The government says, however, that in practice the competition authorities would apply the Euro-style prohibition where a single company is accused of abusing its strength in the market and the monopoly provisions of the Fair Trading Act would be confined to detailed investigation of markets where competition between a number of companies is not working effectively, and where a complex monopoly operating against the public interest is suspected.

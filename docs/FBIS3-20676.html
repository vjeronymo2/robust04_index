			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Drazena Peranic: "Northern Corridor of </F> Salvation"]    [Text] While dramatic appeals by hungry citizens have been  coming from Tuzla, the Bosnia-Herzegovina oasis of coexistence,  in Zupanja, a small Croatian town across the Sava opposite  Bosnia-Herzegovina, hundreds of trucks have been standing and  waiting to go to Tuzla. The news that trucks with aid for the  citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina are waiting at a military  checkpoint is certainly nothing new, but the attempt to  transport the aid to the Tuzla region through the northern  corridor, more exactly from Zagreb via Zupanja, Orasje, and  Srebrenica to Tuzla, could change not only the humanitarian but  also the political situation in the Tuzla and Posavina region.  The action for opening the northern corridor called "The Road of  Salt and Wheat -- Humanitarian Convoy of Love for Tuzla and  Posavina" is organized by nongovernment organizations, primarily  International Workers' Aid and the Tuzla Logistics Center, under  the general patronage of the European Parliament, with the  support of numerous individuals and the Croatian political  opposition (Mika Tripalo, Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, Silvije Degen,  Milorad Pupovac). We discuss this action, the situation in  Tuzla, and the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Edhem Asceric,  president of the organizational committee of the action for  opening the northern corridor.    [Peranic] How did the idea of trying to open the northern  corridor come about?    [Asceric] International Workers' Aid from London and the  Tuzla Logistics Center have been trying for five months to  accomplish the most natural thing -- the opening of the northern  corridor to Tuzla. Trade organizations from Scotland, Ireland,  Spain, France, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Italy,  and Slovenia have been included in this action. They drafted a  miniprogram of activities for opening a northern corridor at a  recent meeting in Stuttgart. The northern corridor was mentioned  for the first time when the English workers delivered their aid  for Tuzla to Split and remained there unable to continue because  of the Croatian-Muslim conflict. We explained to them that Tuzla  has never been connected with other towns or states through the  southern corridor and that a highway exists on the northern  side, which is the most natural and fastest way of linking the  region of Tuzla and Posavina with Croatia and, farther away,  with European countries. One could reach Zagreb via this  corridor, i.e. a regular road, in less than five hours.    [Peranic] Nevertheless, you used the southern corridor  through Herzegovina to central Bosnia and onward to Tuzla up to  the beginning of the Croat-Muslim conflicts.    [Asceric] The use of the southern corridor to deliver  supplies during the first year of the war was intentionally  imposed by blockading Tuzla from all the other sides. Up to the  beginning of the war, these roads were not used at all, except  for forestry work, because the distance from Tuzla to Zagreb via  these roads is about 1,150 kilometers, and one had to travel as  long as three to four days even when there were no conflicts or  war activities. Today, when this southern corridor does not even  function and when it is the site of a major flashpoint, it is  illogical to make efforts to use it for transportation of  humanitarian aid to Tuzla, and it is questionable whether the  aid would get there at all. Not long ago, in May 1993, a large  convoy for Tuzla was attacked in this southern corridor. Many of  our people died, and of the 476 vehicles only about 200  half-empty vehicles made it to Tuzla, while the others were  destroyed. Our total loss, in addition to the irreplaceable  human losses, amounted to about 35 million German marks.    [Peranic] Recently a letter was sent from the Tuzla  municipal  government claiming that the situation regarding food supplies  for residents and the numerous refugees is exceptionally  difficult and that the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees was unsuccessful in delivering any kind of aid during  the last month.    [Asceric] Humanitarian aid supply for Tuzla is very bad  indeed. There are 226,000 inhabitants, of whom 130,000 are  residents of Tuzla and the rest refugees from northern and  eastern Bosnia. The United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees specifies in its program only the provision of aid for  refugees and not for residents, and even this aid satisfies,  according to the estimates of our statistics office, only 17  percent of total needs. Unfortunately, the warehouses in the  Republic of Croatia and in other European countries are full of  goods intended for Tuzla, but they cannot be transported. Every  day we set aside money for storage charges for these goods,  because every square meter of storage area has its price. The  goods are melting away, benefactors are impatient because we are  unable to give them confirmation of the receipt of goods, and on  the other hand, the residents of Tuzla cannot believe that  nobody wants to help them. As you know, even after all the  stories that have been told for months, the Tuzla airport  remains closed, and only shells land on it.    [Peranic] In almost all the blockaded Bosnia-Herzegovina  towns, goods that should have been distributed as humanitarian  aid have been appearing on the black market. Is this also  happening in Tuzla?    [Asceric] Of course. Those who are blockading Tuzla are  bringing into the town goods which have not been allowed to  arrive legally. In this way, they extract from the citizens  their very last dinar or foreign currency which, in one way or  another, was sent to them by their closest relatives abroad. The  black market is very profitable in a war, and thus some are not  at all interested in lifting the blockade of the town. An  average salary in Tuzla is about four German marks, and prices  on the black market are going wild: a kilogram of sugar is 40  German marks, oil is 30 German marks, and flour as much as 40  German marks, depending on the quantity of goods that have been  smuggled into the town. Such a black market does not know of  ethnic borders, what is important is to earn well. It is  precisely for this reason that the multiethnically oriented  government of Tuzla is interested in opening the northern  corridor, because smuggling of food products would be hindered  and prices of basic products would be guaranteed to remain at  some rational and acceptable level.    [Peranic] If the average salary is 4 German marks, that  means  that some institutions and firms continue to work, despite the  blockade.    [Asceric] Of course. Schools, university faculties, and some  services sectors are working. Almost all the production sectors  that are working are operating at reduced capacity. All our  workers are threatened because they are dependent on the  thermoelectric system. The circle is closing here, and problems  are occuring. The Tuzla thermoelectric power plant capacity is  869 megawatts, half of which is sufficient for the region. We  used to export the rest: some of it to Sarajevo, some as far as  Dalmatia, when it was on the brink of darkness. But today, as a  result of the blockade, we are unable to bring raw materials for  the mines -- powder, detonators, explosives, and crude oil --  and the thermoelectric power plant is working at reduced  capacity. We have offered our cooperation to almost everyone in  order to obtain raw materials. We even offered to let Croatia  have their people come and distribute raw materials, in order to  convince them that they were not used for military purposes, but  nothing came of it. We cannot produce electricity because we  cannot extract the coal, and, without electricity, we had to  reduce the production of all products and resources in the  polyurethane industry and the Dita detergent factory. If we had  a roadway to transport raw materials, we could feed the entire  region without any humanitarian aid, since the products of Tuzla  are highly competitive.    Thus, if we were able to open this northern corridor, which  is the most favorable roadway to Tuzla and if the passage  through this road were open continuously, this would virtually  mean the end of the war for us. The citizens not only of Tuzla  but of other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have clear proof  that they can live together without a war and ethnic hatred.  Tuzla was and will remain the proof of this.    [Peranic] It seems that Tuzla is, in fact, blocked by all  three sides, i.e. that intolerance toward Tuzla exists in all  three ethnic groups in Bosnia- Herzegovina. The Serbian media,  for example, have published that Selim Beslagic, the mayor of  Tuzla and the president of the Reformists, has either been  killed or arrested, while the Sarajevo media constantly accuse  you of secessionism and of being autonomous.    [Asceric] Others want us to have autonomy more than we wish  it ourselves. In spite of the three ethnic options which are  against us, we believe that only two sides exist in the Tuzla  region -- those who are for Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are  against it. Nationalistic programs were unfortunate for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they only pointed to which ethnic  group.one belonged in this state. The trouble is that everyone  calls himself or wants to be called something other than what  the name of their state is. Had they been calling themselves  citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnians and Herzegovinians,  there would be by far fewer problems than there are today.    I believe that the Tuzla multiethnic option will subsist,  and  it will expand all over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mr. Selim Beslagic  is politically wise, and I think that one should listen to him.  The citizens of Tuzla are together, and that is the greatest  force. It is less important whether one is Orthodox, Catholic,  or of the Islamic faith. Incidentally, the slogan of the party  headed by Beslagic is worded like this: "Bosnia defends itself  best in the Tuzla fashion."</p>

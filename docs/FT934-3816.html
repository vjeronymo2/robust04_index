			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: HK power issue meets good demand on debut Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), the power station interests spun off by Hong Kong property and infrastructure group Hopewell Holdings, yesterday gave investors a paper profit of 20 per cent on its stock market debut. CEPA, which was sold off at HKDollars 12.50 a share in a combined HKDollars 5.94bn (USDollars 769m) offering, closed yesterday at HKDollars 15. The stock accounted for 13.60 per cent of yesterday's activity on the Hong Kong market, with HKDollars 1.08bn worth of shares changing hands. Brokers attributed the 20 per cent one-day rise in CEPA's share price to strong overseas institutional buying. Stocks generally performed strongly in Hong Kong yesterday, with the Hang Seng Index swelling 3.29 per cent to 9,609.69 on the back of a healthy HKDollars 7.9bn turn-over. CEPA hopes to cash in on huge forecast demand for electric power in Asia through its plans to construct and operate power stations in China and the Philippines. Big earnings, however, from these projects will not accrue to CEPA until 1998. Due to the lag in large scale earnings coming on stream, CEPA came on to the market on a price-earnings multiple of around 47 times 1994 earnings, compared with the Hong Kong market's overall rating of around 13 times. CEPA is forecasting a profit for the 12 months to June 30, 1994, of HKDollars 208m. The issue was split into two tranches: a HKDollars 1.17bn public offering and a HKDollars 4.77bn placement. Both were heavily oversubscribed.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters asked for a definition of ``substantial'' in regard to the quantities sold. In response, the phrase ``in substantial quantities'' is removed from the definition because the Department believes that the concept is embodied in the idea of ``being sold to the general public'' which follows in the definition. For further guidance, the FAR indicates, with respect to being sold in ``substantial quantities'', that ``[N]ominal quantities, such as models, samples, prototypes, or experimental units, do not meet this requirement.'' Further, there were suggestions that an amount such as 25 to 30 percent non JTPA sales may be useful to States and SDA's when setting policy in this area. The definition that is provided conforms to the FAR definition; therefore, it is not being changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters wondered if community-based organizations (CBO's) and non-profit organizations were included within this definition. Such organizations may be among the types of organizations that provide a ``commercially available off-the-shelf'' training package if the training packages they provide meet the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments reflected confusion about the relationship of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages'' to ``vendors'' and ``subrecipients''. It is important to recognize that the definitions of ``vendor'' and ``subrecipient'' and the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training package'' exist for different purposes and should not be viewed as related. An agreement to acquire a commercially available off-the-shelf training package may create either a vendor or a subrecipient relationship, depending on the content of the package. If the package contains elements that meet some of the distinguishing characteristics of a subrecipient (see definition), then a subrecipient relationship is created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of whether a vendor or subrecipient relationship is created, the costs of the commercially available off-the-shelf training package may be charged entirely to the direct training category. However, other JTPA requirements such as record retention, audit, etc. do apply to a subrecipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intent of the definition of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages'' is to provide states and SDA's broad flexibility to utilize generally available training services and to be able to charge those services entirely to the training cost category. It will, for example, permit states and SDA's to purchase training from a variety of educational institutions at off-the-shelf or catalogue prices. It must be recognized, however, that there are limits to the flexibility that the definition affords. One important limitation is that the definition only applies to the provision of actual training services to eligible JTPA participants. It does not apply to intermediate administrative entities or entities that pass funds through to training providers. Another limitation is that the services must actually be available to and provided to significant numbers of persons or to entities that procure training for such persons under other state or federal programs outside the JTPA system. It will not be sufficient for a training provider merely to claim that its services are available to the general public or to other training programs (like the JOBS program). The state or SDA must be able to show that the services actually are available to the public or to other programs and that the services are utilized by them. If a training provider has a history of providing training only to the JTPA program or to JTPA participants, it will not be considered a provider of ``commercially available off-the-shelf training packages''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although not a part of the definition, section 141(d)(3)(A) of the Act also requires that ``commercially available off the shelf training packages'' be purchased competitively. The requirements for competitive procurement are covered in the procurement provisions of the regulations at &sect;627.420. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

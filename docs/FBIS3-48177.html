This source well-versed in North Korean  affairs said: "I recently heard from a senior North Korean  official that North Korea is hiding nuclear weapons in an  underground warehouse in the mountains near Pyongyang and that  any thorough inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities [haek  sisol] by the United States and the International Atomic Energy  Agency will fail to locate them."</p>

"This is very important for our country," Joan Spero, U.S.  undersecretary of state for the economy, said on Thursday [3  February] after discussions with her French and European  Commission colleagues. "At the same time, we would like to find  a means of establishing a somewhat calmer dialogue."    Top U.S. and European officials met this week in the  framework of the "transatlantic declaration" which, since the  end of the 1980's, has enabled Washington and Brussels to  discuss their differences every six months instead of launching  trade wars. The audiovisual sphere is still a considerable bone  of contention, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  stepped up the pressure in January, announcing an offensive  against European aid systems, which he regards as discriminatory.    The end of the GATT negotiations in December did not make it  possible to clear up the matter. The audiovisual sector is  mentioned in the agreement, although the EU has not given any  pledge to reduce its subsidies to the producers of programs or  to dismantle legislation such as the quotas for the distribution  of European works. For the Europeans, and especially France,  this amounts to the "cultural exception" which had been demanded.    "As far as we are concerned, the matter is settled," a  Commission spokesman said. But Washington does not see things  that way and has not given up trying to force the opening up of  European borders to products of its audiovisual industry, which  generate export revenue of over $3.5 billion per year.</p>

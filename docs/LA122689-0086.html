			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORCO;  </P> <P> 850 ACRES OF DENSE CHAPARRAL CHARRED  </P> <P> Firefighters have doused a brush fire that charred about 850 acres of dense  chaparral near Norco over the holiday weekend, a state Forestry Department  spokesman said. The wildfire, which broke out Saturday afternoon, was declared  out at 6 p.m. Sunday, said Bob Ingram, a forestry official. Fire officials  believe the blaze was probably caused by children playing with matches, said  Jeff Lloyd, a dispatcher for the Forestry Department and the Riverside County  Fire Department. About 225 firefighters from Orange and Riverside counties, the  cities of Corona and Norco, the Forestry Department and the state Corrections  Department battled the blaze at its height, Lloyd said. No one was injured. The  investigation into the fire's cause was continuing.  </P></p>

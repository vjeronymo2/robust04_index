			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific buys oil and gas assets for Dollars 819m Union Pacific, the US railroad and resources group, has agreed to pay Dollars 819m for the oil and gas interests of Cypress Amax, the mining company formed by a merger late last year. Union said it had already reached agreement to sell some assets for Dollars 94.5m, retaining mainly gas producing, gathering and processing assets in Texas and Louisiana. The disposal signals Cypress Amax's intention to concentrate on its mining activities. It brings Union Pacific proven gas reserves to 550bn cubic feet, adding approximately 20 per cent to its existing reserves. In addition, the assets purchased include 550 miles of gathering lines and three gas processing plants. Union Pacific said that the properties it was acquiring were underdeveloped, and that it planned to begin drilling by the middle of this year to add to the proven reserves in the field. Union said the proven reserves accounted for Dollars 424m of the purchase price, with the pipelines and other assets making up the rest.</p>

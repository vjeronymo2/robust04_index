			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> IRVINE;  </P> <P> UCI STUDENTS SIGN UP TO HELP THOSE IN NEED  </P> <P> Scores of students at UC Irvine signed up Tuesday to help causes such as food  banks, crime victim support and refugee assistance at the second annual Have a  Heart Volunteerism Fair.  </P> <P> The purpose of the fair was to get students "into the community, doing actual  volunteer service work," assistant fair coordinator Steven K. Tajiri said. The  fair was planned for Valentine's Day, he said, because "it's the time of year  that people are thinking about other people."  </P> <P> Biology student Grace N. Hussain, 20, who signed up with the Central Orange  County Literacy Council of Costa Mesa, admitted she previously did volunteer  work to "look good and put it on a resume."  </P> <P> But Tuesday, she said, she signed up to help people learn to read. She  disagreed with students who said they were too busy to help.  </P> <P> "You always have time if you try and make it," she said.  </P> <P> Volunteer coordinator Laura Monks of Volunteer Center, Orange  County-Central/South, said the group received 10 applications from students.  The center provides volunteers to more than 600 nonprofit groups in Orange  County.  </P> <P> However, John Ngo of the Orange County Refugee Community Resources Opportunity  Project Inc. of Santa Ana said he was disappointed that only half a dozen  students inquired about his group. He said that at least "the weather is  perfect. It's like compensation."  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: U-turn was noted In one area, at least, we now know that the Bank of England takes orders from no one. 'It was our decision. You can't blame the Treasury for this one.' Thus an official from the Old Lady yesterday owning up to the redesign of the Pounds 5, Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes. The chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity as master of the Royal Mint, may look after our coinage, but in the design and issue of banknotes the Bank is sovereign. Nor is it reversing a mistake, the same official avers - the U-turn merely demonstrates its capacity to respond to the public. Whatever, the volte face is welcome news for De La Rue, the world's leading private sector banknote maker. The company would love to see the Old Lady's responsibility for note printing transferred to the private sector, and claims some Treasury support for the idea. Observer understands that it therefore proposes to make liberal use of the Bank's setback in its campaign to broadcast the merits of private banknote printing. De La Rue says that its Gateshead printing works, where it produces banknotes for the Scottish clearers, operates at twice the productivity of the Bank's Essex printing works. The Bank refutes the argument, but since it remains coy about its production details, whom are we to believe?</p>

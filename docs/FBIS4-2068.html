			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The State Science and  Technology Commission has recently approved the establishment of  a 50 million yuan, 213-hectare textile industrial city in East  China's Shanghai Municipality.    It is intended to promote the introduction of foreign  advanced technology and to lift the whole sector of the country  to a new level.    The measure aims to give Shanghai, China's largest textile  and economic center, an exemplary role for the whole country in  the transformation of the traditional Chinese textile industry  with overseas funds and technology.    Located in the eastern part of Qingpu County in Shanghai,  the  textile industrial city will be built with funds jointly  provided by China Textile Association, Huayuan Corporation and  local Qingpu government.    The whole construction project is planned to be completed in  eight to ten years.    The textile industry in the city will possess all the  features of advanced development, such as increased processing  capacity of synthetic fibres, expansion of the output of textile  products for purposes other than clothing, and close combination  of textile industry with other sectors like commerce, foreign  trade and finance.    Already, many transnational corporations, including Du Pont,  of the United States, have signed contracts and letters of  intent with the industrial city, with a total investment of 200  million U.S. dollars involving large number of high-tech textile  projects.    According to the general manager of the industrial city,  this  pillar industry of China's economy and exports has long been  strained by surplus productivity, with 30 to 40 percent of its  equipment lying idle, irrational production structure, low added  value in exports and reduction of profits.    Transformation of the sector with the help of technological  innovation and introduction of foreign funds has become urgent  and the establishment of the industrial city is only the first  step taken by the government.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / TV franchise jibe rejected THE Independent Television Commission yesterday rejected the suggestion that it had handled the Television South West bid for a new television franchise in a shoddy way. TSW, the company that lost its broadcasting licence for south-west England in last October's auction of franchises, opposes the award of the franchise to Westcountry TV. Mr Patrick Elias, QC for the commission, said at the Court of Appeal: 'This public body has taken its decision-making obligations extremely seriously. It was far from a shoddy exercise.' The hearing continues today.</p>

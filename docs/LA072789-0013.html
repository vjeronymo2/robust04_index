			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPOTTED OWLS AND LOGGERS  </P> <P> It is difficult to have much sympathy for a person who would display a bumper  sticker reading "Save a Logger, Eat an Owl." The loggers assume that humans are  unquestionably more important than a bird. There are many of us who do not  necessarily agree that the concerns of humans give them the right to drive  other species to extinction. The loggers will not starve to death.  </P> <P> Let them find a more respectable line of work. Our country has been thoroughly  butchered in the name of economic growth and "development" (a despicable  euphemism). Thank God the ranks of environmentalists are growing and that now  other species have a fighting chance. It's too late for the California grizzly  and condor.  </P> <P> LINDA BAINBRIDGE  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

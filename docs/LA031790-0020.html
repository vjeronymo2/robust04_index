			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALATHION SPRAYING FOR THE PESKY MEDFLY  </P> <P> The alleged safety of malathion fails to reflect a substantial body of data to  the contrary. It is true that malathion is among the least toxic insecticides  when measured by traditional gross toxicological measures.  </P> <P> However, malathion is a potent skin sensitizer and can cause allergic reactions  after a single exposure. Malathion has also been shown to induce persisting  neuro-behavioral, learning, and electroencephalographic disturbances in young  animals exposed to small fractions of acutely toxic dose levels. Additionally,  several studies have raised unresolved questions of the genetic hazards of  malathion.  </P> <P> More ominously, a detailed review published in a prestigious peer reviewed  scientific journal, has documented the carcinogenicity of malathion and its  persistent breakdown product malaoxon in multiple strains of experimental  animals, thus creating the strong presumption of human cancer risk. It would  thus appear reasonable to object to such risks, particularly in view of  evidence on the contrived nature of the Medfly crisis and on the highly  questionable need for the current draconian eradication program.  </P> <P> SAMUEL S.

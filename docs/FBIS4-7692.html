			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic's visit to Romania on Tuesday and his meeting  with Romanian President Ion Iliescu is a step forward in the  search for a solution to the problems of the region, Romanian  Education Minister Liviu Maior said in Belgrade on Monday.    Maior, who is the vice president of the National Council of  the ruling Social-Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR), met in  Belgrade on Monday with a delegation of the Socialist Party of  Serbia (SPS) headed by Goran Percevic -- the vice president of  the biggest party both in the republican and the federal [word  indistinct].    The major achievement of the talks was an agreement to  convene a Balkan meeting of moderate leftist parties to be held  under the slogan "Balkans to the Balkan peoples", Percevic said.    He said that there was agreement about the direct link  between peace and stability in these territories and the "fact  that only the Balkan peoples and states should shape their own  destinies."    The SPS Information Service announced that Maior said that  Bucharest is in principle opposed to the U.N. sanctions against  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which Romania, as a member of  the United Nations, has been forced to implement.    The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 imposed strict  sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its  alleged involvement in the civil war between the local Serbs,  Croats and Moslems in the neighbouring ex-Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Maior underscored that the sanctions have caused much damage  to Romania and recalled a recent statement by that country's  leadership that the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia should be  lifted out of ethical and humanitarian reasons, and because of  the damage they are causing to the entire Balkan region.    Romania said that in 1993, it has suffered damage amounting  to seven billion dollars, while in the case of the other  countries in the region this figure exceeds tens of billions of  dollars.    Percevic warned that a part of the international community  verbally urges a peace, while at the same time shutting its eyes  before the fierce Moslem offensive in the territory of the  Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) and thus threatening to annul  everything achieved so far in the peace process.    The Moslems launched an offensive on RS in mid-March  encouraged by the Washington agreement on setting up a  Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia.</p>

They cover many aspects, including running the  state, party building, running the Army, the economy, culture,  foreign affairs, and life in general. This article is going to  deal with just a very small fraction of the theory, namely, the  basic sources and characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  literature and art.    The primary origin of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature  and art is Marxist and Mao Zedong thinking on literature and  art. Based on historical materials, especially through the  newly published work by Mao Mao, My Father, Deng  Xiaoping, we learn that initially he only had schooling up  to second year in junior high; nevertheless, this gifted high  school student managed to cross the ocean and arrived in the  motherland of the Paris Commune at the age of 16; later he went  to Marx' motherland, and accepted Marxism through a part-work,  part-study program. He was a famous "Maoist" when the Red Army  was first founded. Although he was persecuted during the  Cultural Revolution, he has always been firm in safeguarding Mao  Zedong Thought in a series of speeches since the Third Plenary  Session of the 11th Central Committee. This was an expression  of his persistent loyalty as well as evidence of his profound  friendship for a comrade-in-arms. In simple words and clear-cut  views, the world outlook and methodology characterized by  dialectical materialism and historical materialism run through  many theses in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping; this also proves that he has a profound  attainment and mastery of Marxism-Leninism. The second origin  of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature and art was the positive  and negative experiences of party leadership in literature and  art work. If we put it that the party's work in literature and  art was at an infant stage during the First Revolutionary Civil  War, then, when Mao Zedong published his "Talks at the Yanan  Forum on Literature and Art" in 1942, the party's work in this  arena had already matured. On many basic points, the "Talks"  enriched the Marxist theoretical treasure house on literature  and art. Deng Xiaoping's long-term revolutionary practice and  his understanding of life in various directions has made the  profundity of his thinking quite beyond the reach of ordinary  men! The third origin of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature  and art is information on the literature and art movement during  the new historical period. What accounts for the ever- running  waters of the mighty Chang Jiang is that it has its fountainhead  in the Tuotuo River on the southern slope of Kala Kunlun Shan;  furthermore, it accepts waters from a hundred tributaries in  nine provinces at any one time. Comrade Xiaoping studied the  original works of Marx and Lenin in his early years, and  personally participated in the collective founding of Mao Zedong  Thought; all this has increased the depth and vitality of his  theory.    The major characteristics of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  literature and art are as follows:    First, combining theory with practice. This is the general  and basic characteristic of Deng Xiaoping thinking on literature  and art. Just as Marx said: Any genuine philosophy is the  quintessence of the spirit of one's times. The general  characteristic of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art  is precisely his meeting the need of the spirit of the times  during the new historical period with originality, while  adhering to the traditional principle of Marxist-Mao Zedong  thinking on literature and art and fitting the situation of  reform and opening up. We can find this by reading his  programmatic document, "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of  Chinese Writers and Artists." In addition, because Deng  Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has its origin in  reality and practicality in combining theory with practice, it  was made entirely concrete in party policy on literature and  art. Those people who are familiar with the PRC history of  literature and art should be able to see the brilliance of this  characteristic: First, literature and art should convert from a  situation of taking class struggle as the key to a situation  mainly characterized by economic construction, peace, and  development; second, expanding the scope of to whom literature  and art renders service to all people, including the  intelligentsia and other people on the broadest scale; third,  making important readjustments that fall in line with the  characteristics of the new period concerning the contents of  service, with many forbidden areas broken through, while  stressing "what subjects they should choose for their creative  work and how they should deal with those subjects are questions  that writers and artists themselves must examine and gradually  resolve through practice. There should be no arbitrary meddling  in this process"; and fourth, improving and enriching forms of  service, which everyone can see.... In the concluding part of  the "Speech Greeting the Fourth Congress of Chinese Writers and  Artists," Deng Xiaoping said with full confidence: "The  conditions are ripening daily that will enable us genuinely to  put into practice the Marxist policy of "let a hundred flowers  bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend." In a nutshell,  Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has developed on  the solid foundation of inheriting Marxist-Mao Zedong thinking  on literature and art, while linking it to the new realities of  literature and art in China, and calling forth ideological  vitality in the combination of theory and practice. Regarding  this point, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Beyond a doubt,  we should never for a moment violate the fundamental principle  of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. However, it is  imperative to link, analyze, and study actual conditions as well  as to resolve practical issues." "It is necessary to link  Marxist universal truth to the specific realities of China, take  our own road, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics;  that is precisely the basic conclusion drawn from summarizing  our long-term historical experiences."    Second, the combination of freedom in creation and  scientific  value. This finds expression in the whole process of the  production of literature and art, and is another characteristic  of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art.    Regarding literature and art undertakings, just as Lenin  stressed that "it is absolutely imperative to insure a vast  space for the individual's creativity and interest...," our  party has all along advocated the free development of different  forms and styles in artistic creation. Of course, it is  unnecessary to conceal the fact that in a specific wartime  environment, literary and artistic creation aimed at clearly  propagating a certain policy and specific political tasks at a  specific time did exist for a long time and played a certain  role; however, viewed from a long-range artistic angle, its role  in the development of the production of literature and art,  especially quality improvement, was very limited.    That being the case, Deng Xiaoping stressed: "The road  before literature and art should become broader and broader"  "writers and artists should deal with an ever wider range of  themes, increasingly vary their means of expression, and dare to  blaze new trails." "We must guard against or overcome the  tendency to be formalistic and abstract, which produces  monotonous, stiff, mechanical and stereotyped works." We may  put it that Deng Xiaoping's thinking on literature and art has  pushed the creative freedom of writers and artists to an  unprecedentedly higher plane.    The scientific value of such administrative ways lies in the  fact that it has macroscopic control while paying attention to  microscopic readjustment, and it is capable of exercising  discipline on others as well as self-discipline; furthermore, it  is characterized by its practical value.    Summing up, first, regarding the producers of literature and  art, namely, writers and artists themselves, he set out the need  to "conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to  enhance their own ability to understand and analyze life and see  through appearances to the essence," and "to become real  engineers of the human soul." Second, he set out the need to  improve leadership in party organizations in work concerning  literature and art. And third, he set out the need to augment  leadership in this scene.    The scientific guidance of Deng Xiaoping's thinking on  literature and art makes its profundity and accuracy keenly felt  on any ordinary day, especially at the critical moment of a  sudden change in the situation when right and wrong are being  confused. This has definitely been proven by the newly  published Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping.</p>

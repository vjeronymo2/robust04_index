			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 23 March carries in its "Details" program  an interview with Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State  Property Committee, by Nikolay Svanidze. Chubays explains the  second stage of the privatization process, which is due to begin  in 100 days. He says the main point of the process is that cash  will take the place of vouchers.    Svanidze suggests to Chubays that he has many opponents and  asks him who his supporters are. The main ones, Chubays says,  are the president and the prime minister. In 1993, the volume  of revenue from privatization amounted to 480,000 million  rubles. Svanidze challenges Chubays on his popularity in  parliament over the privatization process and queries the  chances of his vision of privatization being endorsed by the  Duma. Chubays says he is clear of one thing: If the Duma tries  to derail this process, it will rebound on it. Finally, Chubays  warns people to be on guard against swindlers making capital out  of vouchers they have obtained by fraud.</p>

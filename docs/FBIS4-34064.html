Brazil  is striving to enlarge its submarine fleet and is building a  nuclear submarine, while Russia badly needs nuclear plants to  replace its old reactors that run the risk of causing a tragedy  at any time. They do not need submarines, which they have in  excess and which are expensive to maintain. We do not need the  plant, which we bought without needing it and without having the  money to install it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Emil Pain, member of the Presidential </F> Council, by Teymuraz Mamaladze; place and date of interview not  stated: "Glitter and Poverty of Conflictology"]    [Text] The cobblestone -- the classic weapon of the  proletariat -- has been rejected by the activists of the  independent trade union of Russian miners. Were any latter-day  Ivan Shadr to think of portraying a hegemon's class impulse he  could sculpt him raising a weighty volume on conflictology --  the science of settling disputes by peaceful means. Meeting for  their spring seminar in Saltykovka near Moscow, the miners  strenuously studied the basics of this science.    The miners' extraordinary initiative required the commentary  of a knowledgeable person. I found him in the shape of Emil  Pain, member of the Presidential Council, who in this capacity  leads the nationalities policy working group and the problems  section of the president's analytical center.    [Mamaladze] What do you think of it, I asked Russia's chief  conflictologist.    [Pain] It is very symptomatic that the miners turned to  conflictology. It is as symptomatic as the signing of the  social accord treaty. It looks as though the idea of accord is  being confirmed in society as a significant value.    You remember how back in the fall of last year words about  war were widely current and various political groups called  themselves fronts. Today the majority of these forces are  arguing about who is more geared toward accord and who is its  main expresser.    [Mamaladze] And how do you explain this change?    [Pain] Partly by what is called "metal fatigue." The  Russians are tired not only of their own quarrels but also of  conflicts in nearby foreign parts. After all, the umbilical  cord of the common state has not yet been cut and everyone is  feeling their pernicious consequences.    To some extent the conflicts beyond Russia are saving it  from  its own conflicts. The experience of bloodshed is sobering.  During the nine months of the Tajik conflict over 50,000 people  have been killed and nearly four GNP's have been lost. Some  20,000 killed and a destroyed economy -- that is the result of  the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. There is much the same "harvest"  in Georgia.    [Mamaladze] That is entirely correct as regards the  umbilical cord. Sergey Yulyevich Vitte -- and he was from  Tbilisi and knew about the matter at first hand -- said: "Until  the troubles end in Russia it is impossible to end the troubles  in the caucasus." If talk has turned to "salvation" then we  must speak of a viewpoint quite widespread in the post-Soviet  states: These conflicts are advantageous to Russia as a  political lightening conductor on the one hand and on the other  as a means of restoring control over key geopolitical zones.    [Pain] Political interest is a leading element of all the  major conflicts we know which have developed into interethnic or  regional wars -- Karabakh, the Dniester Region, South Ossetia,  Abkhazia, Tajikistan. That means, first, the interest of  seizing power when the political opposition uses outbursts of  hostility to crush a rival. Second, this involves holding on to  power -- those who have it use the energy of a conflict to  switch dissatisfaction to particular ethnic or political groups.  Finally there is the interest of expanding power, when an  outside force turns interethnic or intergroup clashes into a  tool for expanding its spheres of influence.    In any conflict these interests are present and interwoven..    It is another question whose interests were expressed by,  for  instance, the Confederation of Peoples of the caucasus operating  in Abkhazia or by the cossacks in the Dniester region or  Abkhazia....    [Mamaladze] ...Or in Moscow in the fall of last year with an  association of politicians, retired military men, and gunmen  from the Dniester Region and Abkhazia for whom the conflicts  blazing far from Moscow were fields for their own battles and a  nutrient medium.    [Pain] Yes, here too political forces came onto the state  and also used outside conflicts in the interests of the struggle  for power like, for instance, the internal conflicts in Georgia  involving the parties of war and the Zviadist opposition. I  once made a special analysis of the timetable for the  opposition's acts of provocation and Shevardnadze's initiatives  to reach peace in Abkhazia -- each peacemaking step was followed  by a response which thwarted it.    [Mamaladze] Yet the same happened with Yeltsin's  initiatives. By analyzing the relevant timetables we would have  obtained approximately the same picture. Incidentally, it would  have reflected quite clearly the surprising synchronization of  the actions of some politicians here in Moscow, the authorities  in Gudaut, the Conference of Peoples of the Caucasus in the  North Caucasus, and the Zviadists in Georgia.    I do not think they needed the services of conflictology.    [Pain] In actual fact conflictology would be suitable for  everyone as long as expectations are not made excessively high,  of course: The myth of the omnipotence of science is an  offshoot of the myth of the omnipotence of the state. In the  West conflictology is achieving quite considerable successes  when the sides want to reach agreement, realizing how much they  are losing from the unabating conflict situation.    In ethnopolitical conflicts as a rule the groups which do  not  want conciliation gain the upper hand. Then apart from  political interests there are operating alongside them, in  parallel or interwoven, the pragmatic criminal interests of  mafia groups which extract colossal profits from the trade in  weapons, drugs, and hostages, from the appropriation of  property, and the establishment of control over sources of  material benefits.    [Mamaladze] According to some figures this business based on  blood brings its participants a profit of tens of millions of  U.S. dollars. And all this is shielded by the banner of the  national idea. In this connection it would be of some use to  touch on the role of various ideas in the kindling of conflicts.  For instance, history interpreted in a self-seeking way is most  often used to justify claims to territory and status.  Historians pave the way for detachments of gunmen. Their  disputes over "who came to this land first" are transferred to  the battle fields, turning into bloody disputes between the  peoples.    [Pain] Where there is no developed legal consciousness, no  developed legal and political culture, and they do not yet exist  and cannot exist in post-totalitarian societies, they are  replaced by so-called historical or mythological truth.  Conflicts contain no more powerful detonator than myth....    [Mamaladze] In other words we are dealing with the  exploitation of a myth for political purposes?    [Pain] Undoubtedly. In general I must say that a kind of  "philosophy of prejudice" as the basis for making political  decisions is taking shape before our eyes.    For instance, after the 12 December elections many  politicians in Russia concluded that nationalism was growing and  that it was necessary to use it to consolidate society. That  idea is utterly illusory and at the same time extremely  dangerous. The plans to adapt nationalist slogans to the aims  of consolidating society have not been successfully implemented  in Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Lithuania. Still less will  this be successfully done in Russia now, in an atmosphere of  people's mounting revulsion toward politics.    To judge by the polls of the All-Russia Center for the Study  of Public Opinion on Social and Economic Questions  Zhirinovskiy's party is losing its supporters more rapidly than  all other political parties. The same studies show that today  no more than 1-2 percent of Russians support the so-called  national patriotic movement -- that is far lower than support  for national movements in any other state of the former Union  except perhaps for Belorussia [Belarus]. The leaders of the  cossack movement, whose influence has also been greatly  exaggerated, also failed to gain support not only at the  parliamentary elections but also at the local ones.    At the same time just talking about the need to grant  special political rights to the ethnic majority or some other  population group, the cossacks, for instance, can be enough to  arouse national separatist feelings in some republics of the  Federation.    I consider the anti-Western feelings which are developing in  a particular political environment, for instance the Duma  environment, to be a very dangerous prejudice. This prejudice  can not only cast Russia's foreign policy back to the Cold War  but can also drastically aggravate the domestic political  situation since the revival of the ideas of the West's intrigues  intensifies the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in society.    But on the other hand the West is not lacking as regards  prejudices against Russia. You are simply amazed at how  powerfully some Western minds have been gripped by the prejudice  that the position of Russians in a number of countries of nearby  foreign parts is merely a question of acts of provocation by a  few Russian groups of nationalist orientation and not of the  problem of legal and actual discrimination that really exists.    [Mamaladze] Some of your Presidential Council colleagues  have developed the concept of Russia's special rights and  interests throughout the post-Soviet area, a kind of Russian  "Monroe doctrine." After it had been widely publicized you  could not convince the politicians and public of adjacent  countries that their fears regarding Russia's neo-imperial  ambitions were unjustified.    Please open the doors of the presidential kitchen. Is the  opinion that there are too many cooks in this kitchen and that  each has his own recipe for stew a prejudice?    [Pain] I am no expert in political cuisine. I shall merely  say that indeed too many cooks spoil the broth. We have about  10 departments studying the problem of interethnic relations and  conflicts.    But it must not be forgotten that there is a president and  the role of his personal decisions is great. If in some  critical situations he had not taken personal control their  greater aggravation could have been forecast.    [Mamaladze] I remember about two years ago there was talk of  a single state system for preventing conflicts in the Russian  Federation. Is it taking shape somehow?    [Pain] No, and I would not pin too much hope on such a  system. As long as there is disagreement in decisionmaking  because of contradictory department interests, no institution of  power will definitively and fully ensure accord in society?    [Mamaladze] And the Treaty on Accord?    [Pain] It is only the precursor of the authorities' ability  to lead matters toward the coordination of interests. But  neither this act nor the structural innovations themselves can  in themselves do what society as a whole cannot do.    [Mamaladze] You mean that so far it cannot rid itself of  traditional ideas and feelings?    [Pain] In society several ideologies exist at the same time  -- extremely popular and just as contradictory.. The ideology  of the classic imperial approach and its most colorful and  consistent expresser -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy. The ideology of soft  "respectable" expansionism in the approaches to the post-Soviet  area -- "we must annex not everything but only what can easily  be grabbed." Finally, there is the ideology of complete  isolationism, manifested so clearly during talks on the  unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorussia.    [Mamaladze] So where are these ideas actually circulating --  in society or in the corridors of power?    [Pain] Public opinion polls show that 70 percent of Russians  oppose the imperial idea in the "Zhirinovskiy" or respectable  packaging. You only have to put the question specifically: "Do  you want an association in which the inflation level will  increase still further?" for the majority to answer "no."    How the authorities interpret and use public feelings is  another matter. These people today are more great  power-oriented, more nationalist, than the population. I  repeat, there is no mass chauvinism, there is the "philosophy of  prejudice" which serves the political interests of certain  groups in the power structures, and it is particularly dangerous  when it is made out to be the voice of the people.    [Mamaladze] Who is making this out? Which authorities?    [Pain] A very substantial proportion of the middle-echelon  management apparatus and local apparatus -- the former party and  economic aktiv. "We do not have the right to fail to consider  the masses' feelings," they say, as though they were not  speaking on their own behalf. In fact this is nothing other  than attempts to grab the banner of great-powerdom from the  opposition, which has monopolized this idea and will not  surrender it for anything.    [Mamaladze] We are talking in the building of the former  CPSU Central Committee, your office once belonged to a  department chief. Someone called you and those like you  "democratic flies" which have flown into the thick soup of  autocracy. What are you doing here? To what extent are the  results of your research called for by those for whom you work?    [Pain] Clearly not 100 percent. Even ideally they cannot by  called for 100 percent: There is a big difference between the  responsibility of the expert and the responsibility of the  political decisionmaker. But our opinion -- I am not only  talking of myself -- is heeded and some ideas are put to work,  often producing a positive result.    [Mamaladze] I would be delighted at this fact but reality  prevents it. "Nationally minded people" continue to nurture  destructive plans. The experience of bloodshed is by no means  sobering, on the contrary.... Some "preserved" conflicts are  smoldering under the "cover" of emergency measures. Territorial  wars are continuing. And talks on a full-scale political  settlement of conflicts are being disrupted before our eyes time  after time.    What is your prediction on this score?    [Pain] There are no eternal conflicts, sooner or later they  subside -- that is the postulate of conflictology, checked by  historical practice. And although, most unfortunately,  interethnic wars have a corrupting effect on specific people,  adapting their awareness toward the horrors of living in an  atmosphere of violence and fear, "metal fatigue" does  nonetheless ensue. The politicians' task is to catch that point  in the conflict's trajectory at which talks will produce the  best result.    Despite the disappointing results of the talks an analysis  of  the situation leads to the prediction that a favorable political  situation will take shape in a number of trouble spots. An  understanding is developing of the fact that military victory  cannot be one either by our own forces or by those of a "third  party."    However much we may be concerned for peacekeeping operations  they will not achieve their aim unless they are supported by the  implementation of joint interests. Armies are good when you  have to separate sides but it is not armies that extinguish  conflicts but banks, corporations, joint ventures, and projects  for mutually advantageous undertakings. And I can only rejoice  that this idea is finally in political circulation on an equal  footing with formulas for demilitarizing conflict zones and the  safe return of refugees.</p>

Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow,  who was addressing the nation's elected representatives  yesterday, announced the definite measures taken by his  government to tackle the devaluation. For the rural people, an  increase in the producer price of cotton has been decided. For  first-grade cotton, the price is henceforth fixed at 115 CFA  francs per kilo for the 1994-95 season, compared with 85 CFA  francs previously. For the 1993-94 season, an anticipated  rebate of 12.5O CFA francs per kilo is granted cotton seed  producers.    With regard to income, the government has conceded a 10  percent general increase of indexed wages, military pensions,  and civil pensions, effective 1 April. All arrears owed under  the social pact will be fully paid over 24 months starting 1  March. The interoccupational minimum wage and the agricultural  guaranteed minimum wage have also been increased by 8 percent,  effective 1 April.    The prices of essential goods have also been fixed as  follows: powdered sugar, 325 francs per kilo; rice RM [expansion  unknown] 40, 210 francs per kilo; bottled oil, 455 CFA francs  per liter; refined oil in drum, 412 per liter; household soap,  100 CFA francs for a 200g cake. For hydrocarbons, premium-grade  gas, 423 CFA francs per liter compared with 325 CFA francs  previously; regular-grade gas, 390 CFA francs compared with 300  CFA francs; gas oil, 275 CFA francs per liter compared with 210  CFA francs; DDO [expansion unknown] heavy-duty fuel, 199 CFA  francs per liter compared with 147 francs; fuel oil, 223 francs  per liter compared with 117.38 CFA francs; mixed fuel, 430 CFA  francs compared with 340 CFA francs; the price of kerosene  remains 200 CFA francs; butane gas, 3,500 CFA francs per 12.5kg  bottle compared with 3,000 CFA francs previously.    The head of government stated that the increase in the price  of fuel was inevitable as a result of the increase from supply  sources, and this in spite of the efforts made by importers.  This increase remains however below the prevailing price levels  in most neighboring countries. The prime minister further  stated that the opportunity offered by the change of parity  should be seized by our country with a view to improving  significantly the competitive edge of the economy and  reestablishing swiftly the major macroeconomic balances.  According to him, if the devaluation -- which has been accepted  by all -- is well handled through consultations, the nation's  economy can be boosted and the country developed on a sound and  productive base.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> Choreographer Alvin Ailey has resigned his $80,000-a-year professorship at City  University of New York following complaints that he paid others to teach his  classes. Professors and former dance students at CUNY told the New York Post  that Ailey paid other students from his Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater  Company to teach his ballet and modern-dance courses. Distinguished professors  at CUNY must spend some time teaching and the university forbids the use of  surrogates, the newspaper said. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

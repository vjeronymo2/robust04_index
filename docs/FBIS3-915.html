Prime Minister Marcolino Moco  today took his team to parliament to argue for the government's  State General Budget. Despite the war, the economy and society  will have a budget totalling 85,334,556,405 new kwanzas. The  new finance minister, [Arnaldo Craveiro], outlined the 1994  budget.    [Begin Craveiro recording] Although the proposed budget is  restricted by the country's real possibilities, and its drafting  followed strict austerity measures, it does not mean that one  cannot expect the budget to contribute to the fulfillment of our  economic goals. In addition to upholding national defense and  correcting the deficit, the budget also deals with social  imbalances through a new price policy, the guarantee of basic  commodities, and the creation of a reserve of basic food  commodities to cope with inflation.

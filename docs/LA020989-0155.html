			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR, CHIEF PROPOSE LAW FOR EVICTING DRUG DEALERS  </P> <P> A city law requiring the eviction of tenants arrested for selling drugs at  their rented apartments or homes was proposed Wednesday by Mayor Tom Bradley  and Police Chief Daryl F. Gates.  </P> <P> Patterned after a New York City law enacted last June, the ordinance would  require landlords to launch eviction procedures against an arrested tenant  within five days. Failure to do so could cost the landlord up to $5,000 in  legal costs if the city attorney is then required to handle the eviction.  </P> <P> "We will not surrender one inch of our city to gangs and drug dealers," Bradley  said. "Any renter in the city should know: If you want to stay in your  apartment, don't deal drugs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Tool for Police  </P> <P> Gates said that state law already allows police to seize cars and homes used by  drug dealers and that the proposed ordinance would be an additional tool for  the Police Department. Gates said evictions would occur only if drug peddling  occurred, not if the tenant was only using the drugs.  </P> <P> Gates added, however, that the eviction law will be applied regardless of the  quantity of drugs being sold out of an apartment or rented house.  </P> <P> "My policy is, if they are drug dealing and we have this ordinance -- zero  tolerance, out they go," Gates said.  </P> <P> Eviction proceedings could be started without a conviction for drug peddling,  Bradley and Gates said. The mayor said the eviction would result from a civil  proceeding requiring a reduced standard of proof than in a criminal trial.  </P> <P> "If this ordinance is to be effective, we could not wait for the criminal  justice system; the trials may drag on for months or even a year or more,"  Bradley said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holden Has Doubts  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden, who is opposing Bradley in the April 11 municipal  primary, said he questions the proposed law's legality.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to get every dope pusher out of the city of Los Angeles. But at  the same time, we should design laws that will not infringe on the rights of  the innocent," Holden said.  </P> <P> "Just to get at the criminal, you don't want to violate the rights of the  law-abiding citizens who may also be using that apartment or house," Holden  said.  </P></p>

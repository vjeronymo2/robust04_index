			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Consumer Credit Swells by $2.6 Billion: Americans took out $2.6-billion more in  consumer credit than they paid off in March as borrowing to buy automobiles  rebounded from February, the Federal Reserve reported.  </P> <P> The Fed said consumer credit increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  4.4%, up from a scant 0.1% rise in February. That represented a sharp revision  from the 5.7% rate estimated earlier for February and made the month the  weakest in a year. Automobile loans in March advanced $1.8 billion, a 7.5%  annual rate, after falling at a 5.2% rate in February. The total consumer debt  at the end of March was $721.5 billion.  </P></p>

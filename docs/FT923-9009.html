			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: On Golden Pond THE loons, the loons] You old poop] Oh, look at you] Remember Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda in the 1981 film? Well, here is the stage original, at London's Richmond Theatre, and here are real-life husband-and-wife team Googie Withers and John McCallum. On Golden Pond enables two ageing actors to be relentlessly adorable all evening long - a pursuit in which they involve anyone else who passes by. The scene is the Thayers' summer house in Maine, and out there through the windows is Golden Pond. (The name is presumably mixed from two real New England lakes - Goose Pond and Walden Pond. Julian Saxton's set catches the luminous look of the water and the architecture of such a house to perfection.) Over there in the water, the loons call; the loons mate. Meanwhile, indoors Norman Thayer is getting older and Ethel is coping gamely with his loss of memory. ('You old poop.') He is difficult in one adorable way, and she is practical in another adorable way. Their childless, no-longer-young daughter, Chelsea, arrives ('Oh, look at you]'), and every stereotypical failure of communication between father and daughter pops to the surface. However, Chelsea - her parents' daughter - knows also how to be adorable. And she has at last found Mr Right, and has brought along both him and his 13-year-old kid Billy. Billy fits right in, for he too is non-stop adorable. Norman teaches Billy to fish, Ethel picks berries, the loons keep up their bit. Chelsea marries Mr Right, Norman recovers from an angina attack, the months pass, and everything in the world of nature helps everyone in this great big lovely learning process: How To Stay Adorable Till Death Us Do Part. On Golden Pond - in whatever version - is not the place to look for good acting. It is just a vehicle for determined loveableness, and - thanks to Christopher Renshaw's direction and the script's surefire sentimentality - everyone rides it for all it is worth. Julia Foster is charming as the daughter, though she overdoes the winsomeness. Matthew Hearne is duly sweet as Billy. Most of the play has Norman and Ethel alone together, and these scenes are the gooiest. John McCallum is fine as Norman once he has settled into brisk speech, but otherwise he plays a distracted old dear by exaggerating one or two obvious shticks - isolating his vowels and letting them slide away like toboggans. The best fun is to watch Googie Withers. She retains the same arched brows and mobile lips that made her famous 40 years ago. Her figure is even more Edwardian today and her voice is now a husky baritone. But, whereas she used to be dark and sultry, now she is a model of bright, no-nonsense energy. She is the person least obviously engaged in tugging the heartstrings, and her Ethel is the most nearly three-dimensional character. Ends Saturday. Box Office 081-940-0088</p>

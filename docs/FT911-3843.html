			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / UK Company News: Boddington makes strong attack on Devenish board BODDINGTON yesterday launched a blistering attack on Devenish, the West Country brewer, accusing it of wasting millions of pounds of shareholders' money. In a document sent out to Devenish shareholders, containing details of its Pounds 127.7m hostile takeover bid, Boddington, the pubs, hotels and health-care group, accuses the Devenish board of wasting more than Pounds 80m on advertising new brands marketed under the Newquay Steam label. Boddington says the investment by Devenish 'was ill-conceived from the outset' and alleges that its failure has had an adverse effect on the company's profitability. It accuses Devenish of U-turns in its strategy in first buying wholesalers only to sell them later, and queries the value attributed in the company's accounts to the brewery. For good measure, it says plans by Devenish to expand the number of its pubs 'has failed to materialise'. Mr Hubert Reid, managing director of Boddington, said: 'Devenish's decision to invest in brewing and brands was a grave mistake. 'It was also badly executed. Its board is guilty of poor judgement and then poorly carrying out those decisions.' A spokesman for Devenish denied the charges and said there was nothing substantially new in the document which still failed to address the fact that Boddington's hostile bid 'substantially undervalues' the company.</p>

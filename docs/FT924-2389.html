			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Somali warlords agree to immediate ceasefire SOMALIA'S two main warlords, who have plunged the country into anarchy and starvation over the past two years, yesterday agreed an immediate ceasefire. Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the feuding clan-barons who control parts of the divided capital Mogadishu, met for the first time in more than a year. Afterwards, they shook hands, smiled and announced a seven-point peace plan. The meeting, organised by Mr Robert Oakley, the US ambassador-at-large, took place in the temporary US embassy which was ringed by Marines and secured from the air by Cobra helicopter gunships. Both warlords, forced to the table by the speed and efficiency of the US and French military deployment in the capital, said they had also agreed to withdraw their armies from the streets, end hostile propaganda and demolish the 'green line' which divides the city. The two will meet again today aboard a French aid ship. Many Somalis questioned how genuine the hasty reconciliation was, given the deep bitterness which divides the two men and which had defeated the best efforts of the United Nations to reach a settlement. Differences also emerged as Mr Mahdi, the self-styled president, asked the US to disarm all Somalis and to bring the UN deeper into the intervention - two steps strongly resisted by Gen Aideed. The US military build-up continued in Mogadishu with the arrival of more troops. There were further incidents between Somalis and US and French forces who have mounted impromptu road blocks across the city to help end the piracy of relief food. On day three of the military intervention, tempers flared as Somalis tested the nerve and authority of the foreign troops. A few warning shots were fired, a journalist was shot in the leg and another stabbed by increasingly hostile Mogadishu residents. Somalis also gathered at the site where French paratroopers shot dead two Somalis who, the French alleged, tried to break through a roadblock on Thursday night. UN representatives called for an inquiry into the incident. David White, defence correspondent, reports from Brussels: The US plans to withdraw most of its forces in three months, Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said yesterday. Speaking after a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Brussels, he said he hoped that withdrawals could begin by late January through arrangements to transfer authority in some areas to UN peacekeepers. However, certain specialised US forces such as logistics troops and combat engineers might have to stay longer. Reuter adds from Little Rock, Arkansas: President-elect Bill Clinton said last night that he could not put 'a fixed timetable' on the US operation. City of death, Page 5</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOVEL FEE SOUGHT TO CLEAN BAY  </P> <P> A new financing plan, charging fees to homeowners and businesses for their  pollution, was proposed by Los Angeles city officials Tuesday to clean up one  of the worst sources of Santa Monica Bay contamination -- runoff from streets,  sidewalks, parking lots and other paved and built-over areas.  </P> <P> The plan was developed by city public works officials and aides to Mayor Tom  Bradley and Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica).  </P> <P> Runoff of rain and other water polluted by street, motor vehicle and animal  waste and other urban grime is one of the two biggest polluters of Santa Monica  Bay. The other is sewage treated at the city's Hyperion plant. The quality of  that plant's treatment, under a court order from the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, has improved sharply recently.  </P> <P> Under the runoff treatment financing plan, special taxing districts would be  created by the City Council, in which property owners would be assessed to  finance new facilities to clean up the filthy water before it hits the bay.  </P> <P> The special taxing areas, called benefit assessment districts, have been used  for years to put up street lighting and make other civic improvements. They do  not require votes by affected property owners.  </P> <P> What is unique about this plan, city officials said, is that the taxes would be  levied according to the amount of asphalt or concrete, or buildings, on a  property. Such covering prevents storm water from percolating into the soil.  </P></p>

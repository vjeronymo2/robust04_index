			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Guatemalan reforms agreed Guatemala's President Ramiro de Leon and Congress have reached a deal to reform the constitution, breaking an 11-week impasse that had brought the government to a standstill, Reuter reports from Guatemala City. Under the agreement, congressional elections due to be held in 1995 will be brought forward as soon as legally possible, new appointments will be made to the judiciary, and a plebiscite will be held to approve the proposed constitutional reforms.</p>

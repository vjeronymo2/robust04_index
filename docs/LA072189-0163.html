			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> JAIL ESCAPEE CAPTURED IN CASTAIC  </P> <P> A man who slipped away from a minimum-security lockup in Saugus was captured  this morning, a short while after he knocked on a Castaic resident's door and  said he needed a change of clothing because he had escaped from jail, the Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> Edwardo Osuna, 18, was captured at 1 a.m. outside a McDonald's restaurant in  the 27700 block of Lake Hughes Road in Castaic, Deputy Pat Hunter said.  </P> <P> About six hours earlier, Osuna and another inmate, Ismael Mendoza, 25, had  walked away from the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho, Hunter said. Mendoza was  still at large. Both men had been serving short terms at the Saugus facility  for narcotics convictions.  </P> <P> About midnight, deputies were alerted by a Castaic resident that a man had  knocked on his door and asked for a change of clothing, admitting he needed the  clothes because he had escaped from prison.  </P> <P> The resident said he gave the man a red T-shirt with a slogan printed on it.  </P> <P> Deputies later spotted a man wearing such a shirt and arrested him after he was  identified as Osuna. He is being held at the Santa Clarita sheriff's substation  jail, a maximum-security jail.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After a thorough review pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 884.15, the Director finds, as discussed below, that Arkansas' October 6, 1993, proposed plan amendment is in compliance with SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM required at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that Arkansas submit a revision to ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to limit operations eligible for AML funds because of insolvency of a surety company to those operations whose surety became insolvent during the time frame provided by section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA. Section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), provided that the period of time during which such an operation would be eligible for AML funds because of the insolvency of the surety company would begin on August 4, 1977, and end on the date of enactment of the revision to SMCRA, which was November 5, 1990. Because Arkansas revised ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to specify a period of time beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November 5, 1990, ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) is no less stringent than section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director approves ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) and removes the required amendment at 30 CFR 904.26(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments from the heads of various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Arkansas plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated October 29, 1993, (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;22), the U.S. Bureau of Mines responded that it had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated October 29, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;23), the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) responded that the proposed amendment would not impact NPS program responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

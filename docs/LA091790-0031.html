			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> L.A. FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> A MORALLY CHASTENING PLEA FOR SANITY FROM SOME BEASTS OF BURDEN;  </P> <P> THEATER: BREAD AND PUPPET THEATER OF VERMONT OFFERS A VISUALLY ARRESTING  'UPRISING OF THE BEAST' TO A SOLD-OUT CROWD IN SANTA MONICA.  </P> <P> Of all the companies to have appeared in this sprawling populist picnic that  was the L.A. Festival, few worked their way into our hearts and minds as  unself-consciously as the Bread and Puppet Theater of Vermont.  </P> <P> That group's final show, "The Uprising of the Beast," took place over the  weekend in a giant hangar at the Santa Monica Air Center before a sold-out  audience of more than 1,000 people.  </P> <P> They had all they could do to keep up with constantly shifting playing areas  (Bread and Puppet is running-shoe theater; you earn your rewards). But the  chase Saturday delivered a visually arresting, morally chastening plea for more  sanity in the conduct of our lives, more respect for our planet and our fellow  creatures on it.  </P> <P> It was not always a pretty sight. After a lighthearted pre-show outside the  hangar, the huge doors parted and the audience followed the company inside.  There, its members were introduced to a large family of endearing goats that  were eventually attacked, wrenched from their young (to simulated screams) and  subjected to the rituals of the slaughterhouse. In the end, there was a mass  insurrection and a quaking of the Earth during which dining tables rattled, and  a Divinity (that shapes our ends?) swooped from the rafters to protect, reject,  embrace all naked and misguided souls.  </P> <P> A large, printed manifesto warned of the doom we are negotiating unless we mend  our ways, ending the proceedings on a poetic, quasi-spiritual, quasi-didactic,  quasi-beatific note.  </P> <P> All was not perfect. The undefined playing areas caused some traffic jams. The  audience did not always know where it was supposed to be and sometimes got in  the way of the players. As peripatetic as this show gets, B&amp;P seemed less  well in charge of crowd management if not control (which it would find  abhorrent).  </P> <P> But of all the festival shows that B&amp;P presented, this was the most  technically and philosophically complex -- a more finely engineered, if still  deliberately paced, ceremonial theater of images.  </P> <P> The giant 40-foot puppet representing the enfolding Divinity was manipulated by  a sophisticated network of pulleys. The systematic slaughter of the goats was  achieved with another pulley device that slipped the goat's head and "hide" off  its frame leaving a cowering skeleton behind. The slaughterhouse butchers, in  blindfolds and bloodied aprons, looked intentionally like executioners.  </P> <P> It was no accident that the piece is subtitled "The 1989 Insurrection  Oratorio." An a cappella chorus was an integral part of the performance, along  with the B&amp;P's unconventional mix of percussion and music. As usual, the  company employed traditional instruments combined with others made out of  nothing less imaginative than a chain touching a hubcap or an old Pepsi can  rattling with seeds.  </P> <P> Nearly everything this company of rags and tatters utilizes is the clever  recycling of something else.  </P> <P> The climax of "Uprising" found the company leaving the hangar in an emblematic  "boat" of blue and white cloth borrowed from the show they did at Griffith Park  called "The Same Boat." Advancing hordes -- a strong image -- consisted of  painted flats made of nothing more mystique-laden than corrugated cardboard.  When artistic director Peter Schumann says he believes in Cheap Art he's not  talking out of both sides of his mouth, even if he does play two trumpets at  once that way.  </P> <P> Although this company -- a 30-year-old national treasure -- has toured the  world over, this L.A. Festival engagement was the first time it was invited to  be part of an American festival or of our city. Let's not wait another 30 to  invite it back.  </P></p>

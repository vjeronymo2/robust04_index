			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: MIM to buy UK zinc smelter for ADollars 100m MIM, the Australian mining and metals group, is to buy the UK's only zinc smelter, at Avonmouth, near Bristol, and associated downstream businesses in the West Midlands, for ADollars 100m (USDollars 67m). Pasminco, the financially-stretched rival Australian zinc producer, put the smelter up for sale in February last year after reporting a net loss of ADollars 118m. The deal takes MIM into zinc smelting for the first time, although it has copper and lead smelting facilities. The group produces about 20 per cent of the world's mixed lead/zinc concentrate (an intermediate material) and this will go up to almost 50 per cent when its planned MacArthur River zinc mine in Australia comes into operation in the late 1990s. Consequently, the Avonmouth smelter had a unique value to MIM, said Mr Norman Fussell, MIM's managing director, yesterday. 'MIM's strategies include growth in zinc production as one of our core products,' he said. 'We seek to build upon our Australian base into the three major market areas of the world of which the UK/Europe is one.' The Avonmouth plant, which has an annual capacity of 105,000 tonnes of zinc and 45,000 tonnes of lead, is the largest in the world using the Imperial Smelting Process, the most suitable technology available for processing the mixed concentrates MacArthur River will produce, he added. A production improvement programme is expected to lift capacity to 120,000 tonnes of zinc and 55,000 tonnes of lead. MIM is also buying the associated Bloxwich facility which makes a range of products using zinc from Avonmouth and other European smelters and does some recycling. MIM has been operating in the UK for many years through ownership of the Britannia Refined Metals silver-lead refinery at Northfleet, Kent. It will pay USDollars 67m, subject to adjustment for actual working capital, plus up to Pounds 3.9m (USDollars 5.85m) for a capital expenditure adjustment. Pasminco said the consideration would consist of USDollars 15m cash, with the balance in negotiable promissory notes. Funds would be applied to reducing Pasminco's debt and the deal would result in a book loss of about ADollars 6m. Pasminco, formed in 1988 when North Broken Hill Peko and CRA pooled their zinc and lead interests, originally wanted to sell all its European operations to reduce debt and concentrate on its Australian operations. However, it decided to keep its 50 per cent share of the Budelco smelter in the Netherlands, jointly owned with Billiton, the mining and metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Budelco's future is under a cloud because the Dutch authorities are insisting it must treat its solid waste rather than store it.</p>

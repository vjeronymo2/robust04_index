			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ANTICLIMAX: CONVICTED KILLER'S STATEMENT UNREAD  </P> <P> Convicted killer John Galen Davenport, the last of four Orange County men to  win new death penalty trials by order of the old state Supreme Court under  then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, had prepared a six-page statement he  wanted to read to jurors Wednesday.  </P> <P> The highly unusual defense request had been approved by Orange County Superior  Court Judge Everett W. Dickey.  </P> <P> But when the time came, Davenport's lawyers backed down, providing an  anticlimax in the trial of a man fighting to avoid the death penalty.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys had also asked Dickey to guarantee that prosecutors would not  be allowed to question Davenport about his crimes after he read the statement.  The judge refused.  </P> <P> Davenport did testify Wednesday, but did not read the statement, and answered  only one question. His lawyers had introduced paintings and sketches that  Davenport produced while in prison. Davenport was asked only to confirm that  the artwork was his own, which he did.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Victim Was Impaled  </P> <P> Davenport, now 34, was convicted 8 years ago in the March 27, 1980, stabbing  death of Gayle Ann Lingle, 30, whom he had met at a Tustin bar. She was found  nude in a vacant field at Myford Road and Michelle Street in Irvine. She had  been stabbed 16 times and, significantly to Davenport's trial, had been impaled  on a 4-foot-long wooden stake. Jurors found that the stake met the legal  definition of torture, which allowed them to return a death verdict.  </P> <P> Davenport had been released from prison only a short time before Lingle was  killed. He had served four years for a stabbing attack on another young woman.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court upheld Davenport's conviction in the Lingle death. But the  court threw out the death verdict on technical grounds and ordered a new  penalty trial. Three other defendants in Orange County -- Rodney Alcala,  Marcelino Ramos and Theodore Frank -- won similar new trials from the Bird  court. All have received new death sentences and are back on Death Row.  </P> <P> At Davenport's new trial in Santa Ana, both sides completed their cases  Wednesday. The new jury must decide only one issue: whether Davenport should be  returned to Death Row, or receive a lesser sentence of life in prison without  parole.  </P> <P> The defense lawyers used Davenport's family, who live in Utah, in an attempt to  show jurors his more positive side.  </P> <P> One Davenport sister, Lori Fausett, told jurors that "Johnnie is my backbone .  . . when he calls (from jail), he always makes things better."  </P> <P> Another sister, Joy McKendrick, testified that "it's Johnnie we turn to when we  have troubles. . . . When Leslie (a Davenport brother) died, it was Johnnie who  got us through it, even though he was in prison and could only call."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Niece's Testimony  </P> <P> A 14-year-old niece tearfully testified that she had been raped, and that  emotional support from her uncle, Davenport, had helped her the most in dealing  with it.  </P> <P> On cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, one nephew  testified that his uncle has always denied killing Lingle.  </P> <P> Defense lawyer Gary M. Pohlson has avoided letting jurors know that Davenport  still maintains his innocence. But prosecutor Robinson will no doubt emphasize  the point, based on the testimony.  </P> <P> Lawyers on both sides Wednesday were wondering whether the show of family  support for Davenport will offset for jurors the devastating testimony against  him from the first stabbing victim, Suzanne Tewes. She miraculously survived  more than 20 stab wounds from an attack after he broke into her apartment.  </P> <P> Tewes fought back tears last week when she testified about the 15-year-old  incident. Jurors at Davenport's 1981 trial said Tewes' testimony was the key to  their vote for the death penalty.  </P> <P> Judge Dickey on Wednesday declined to release a copy of Davenport's statement  until he discusses the matter with defense lawyers.  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Increase in planning applications Councils in England received 123,000 applications for planning permission and other related consents in the first quarter of this year, 5 per cent more than for the corresponding period in 1993. It is the third successive quarterly increase in planning applications, government figures show. There were small quarter-on-quarter increases in applications in all regions except the north-west, where there was a 5 per cent fall. The largest increase - 10 per cent - was in Greater London.</p>

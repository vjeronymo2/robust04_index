			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / International Company News: Somic returns to the black with Pounds 81,000 Cost reductions enabled Somic, a maker of yarns and woven fabrics, to return to profits in the year to March 31 with Pounds 81,000, compared with losses of Pounds 114,000. Mr Richard Blackburn, chairman and managing director, said that turnover remained depressed but planned reductions in costs had helped ensure a return to profits in the second half. The result was also helped by higher investment and interest income of Pounds 106,000 (Pounds 73,000). Turnover was Pounds 3.59m (Pounds 3.5m). Earnings per share were 3.86p (2.83p losses) and the proposed single final dividend is 1.5p (1p).</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / George plans shake-up as role changes The Bank of England is planning an internal restructuring that could result in its operations being grouped in two broad 'wings'. One wing would focus on achieving monetary stability and the other on ensuring the stability of the financial system. Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, and its senior directors worked out the plan to replace the Bank's present tangled allocation of responsibilities in more than a dozen divisions and three departments at a special weekend meeting earlier this month. The plan, which is viewed in Threadneedle Street as a separate issue from the debate over whether to give the Bank greater independence from the Treasury in its conduct of monetary policy, is still being thrashed out. If carried through, it will be the Bank's first significant internal restructuring since 1980. The plan follows last July's change of top management when Mr George moved from being deputy governor to governor and Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, former editor of the Economist, was appointed deputy. Mr Pennant-Rea has formed a working party to handle the restructuring. The plan to create a monetary wing responsible for price stability recognises the more explicit counter-inflationary role that has been given to the Bank since Britain left the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in September last year. The wing would include the parts of the Bank responsible for monetary operations, including the markets section, as well as some banking activities and the economic analysis division. Banking supervision would be the main responsibility of the financial stability wing, which would also take over the Bank's duties for making the City function well. These include the non-statutory supervision of bullion and foreign exchange markets and gilt-edged marketmakers (Gemms) as well as its work on payments-and-settlements systems, stock exchange dealings systems and Lloyd's, the insurance market. Officials stressed yesterday that the plans were still a 'strategic vision' that would be refined over the next six months. There is no intention to reorganise the Bank in one 'big bang' and no timetable for the full implementation of the ideas. The personnel consequences have still to be worked out. It is unclear how the Bank's executive directors fit in the new structure, although the imminent departure of Mr Andrew Crockett, the international director, to head the Bank for International Settlements in Basle and the approaching retirement of Mr Tony Coleby, the director handling monetary issues, should create some flexibility. The proposed restructuring would not affect the Bank's 'court', which advises the management on policy. Any big change in the court's structure would require an act of parliament, which is unlikely unless the Bank is given independence. The planned management changes would be compatible with a more independent Bank, however. The movement to give the Bank greater freedom is expected to be boosted on Thursday when the Commons Treasury and civil service committee publishes a report that is widely expected to support more autonomy for the Bank. New capital issues by UK borrowers last month totalled Pounds 4.635bn of which Pounds 3.592bn was denominated in sterling, the Bank said yesterday.</p>

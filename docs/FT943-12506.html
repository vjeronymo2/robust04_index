			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts (Openings): The Lyric Josette Simon takes the title role in Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea'. This role, played by actresses from Duse to Vanessa Redgrave, is one of Ibsen's most probing studies of femininity: a woman frigid within marriage, haunted by the terrifying claims of a past lover, unable to give herself to the husband she loves. The production comes to the Lyric, Hammersmith, from the West Yorkshire Playhouse.</p>

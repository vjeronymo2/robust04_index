			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Moscow has no intention of taking the side of any  party involved in the conflict in former Yugoslavia, said the  head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, upon his return from  a trip to Greece, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.    "The essence of Russian initiative is to nudge Bosnia's  warring sides toward a peaceful solution to the problem," he  told Russian journalists who accompanied him. "Russia must use  its historically established ties with the Serbs to nudge them  toward dialogue, not to encourage aggression."    The issue of Russia's policy toward the former Eastern bloc  countries cropped up more than once during his conversations in  European capitals. Kozyrev assured his partners in the talks  that Moscow is nurturing no "imperial plans", that it is  prepared "to cooperate with everyone on the basis of  neighborliness and mutual benefit".    According to him, the intention of Central and East European  countries to join NATO is no obstacle to this. "We do not rule  out the possibility that Russia will also become part of NATO  some time, but today the idea of partnership is of key  importance," Kozyrev stressed.    In this context NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program  acquires special importance, the head of Russian diplomacy said.  "There is a need to create a system of "cross-guarantees" by  means of signing corresponding agreements with each European  state separately," he said.    Wednesday morning, addressing a conference on the prospects  for Russian-Polish relations in Krakow, Kozyrev formulated  Russia's concept of European partnership, which provides for  transforming the Conference for Security and Cooperation in  Europe (CSCE) into an "effective regional political  organization, and the North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation  into an independent structure of politico-military cooperation  closely connected with the CSCE.    When asked about his attitude to the Liberal Democratic  Party  and its leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Kozyrev said: "I  instructed the Foreign Ministry's press service to neither read  what Zhirinovskiy says, nor react to it".</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Exporters warned of payment delays UK EXPORTERS to other parts of Europe 'are facing very seriously increased risks', according to NCM Credit Insurance, Britain's leading private sector export credit insurer. Overdue accounts rose by more than a third in 1992 as recession and bankruptcies led to defaults in countries once regarded as virtually risk-free, the insurer said. 'The environment is very dangerous,' Mr Colin Foxall, NCM's chief executive, said. 'It is important that people should realise that doing business in Europe involves increasing risks.' The warnings come just two weeks after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Needham, his deputy, launched a broad-ranging initiative to boost exports across the EC called Business in Europe. It is part of a wider UK government strategy to revive the economy through export growth rather than domestic demand. 'Ministers are trying to encourage exports in Europe, but are not alerting them to the dangers,' said Ms Conni Randall, NCM's director for business strategy. The value of overdue accounts in the EC in 1992 amounted to Pounds 72m, up from Pounds 53m in 1991. The company describes an even more stark deterioration over the five years from 1987 to 1992, where real losses reported by UK companies exporting to the EC have more than trebled. Veiling actual numbers for reasons of business confidentiality, NCM says losses reported on exports to Portugal have soared 27-fold between 1987 and 1992. Losses reported for Spain have risen by 805 per cent, those for Belgium by 530 per cent. Even Germany was up 300 per cent. 'The opportunities that devaluation in the UK are going to present are not going to be easily absorbed because of the state of these economies, which are slowing down or presenting considerable difficulties in terms of defaults,' Ms Randall said. 'Efforts to capitalise on export opportunities will be blunted.' Mr Foxall insisted yesterday that, while NCM's data was not comprehensive, it was unquestionably representative. The company provided export credit insurance for exports worth Pounds 14bn in 1992, involving 6,000 companies trading with 222 countries, accounting for 80 per cent of the policies written for UK exporters. Trade Indemnity, which is the UK's second most important export credit insurer, reported on Monday that a survey of 600 companies showed the trading outlook for UK companies remained 'ominous', with under-capacity, cancelled orders, and cash flow problems still rife.</p>

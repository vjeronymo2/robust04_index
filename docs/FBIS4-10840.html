			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] The Executive Branch and the National Assembly today  agreed to work more closely with each other. Council members of  five Assembly factions went to the presidential building to  discuss with Minister Antonio Lacayo three points on which the  two branches disagree but on which some progress was made today.  One point is the procedures to create and eliminate taxes in  the country. The two branches agreed to establish mechanisms to  do away with unilateral decisionmaking.    [Nicaraguan Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman] "The  basic principle underlying the agreement is that the government  presents fiscal policy proposals and the National Assembly will  decide on the contents of the proposals."    [Lacayo] "It would be much better if these taxes are  established by joint agreement, as mentioned by the Assembly  president, and do away with unilateral decisionmaking."    Another point discussed was constitutional reforms.  According to the Assembly president, the government is willing  to cooperate on the promulgation of articles that would pave the  way for the constitutional reforms.    [Lacayo] "If we can reach an understanding or an agreement  next week, I do not see why President Chamorro cannot sign the  proper document when she returns next week."    Lacayo said that today's meeting shows there is no crisis  between the two branches but only disagreements that stem from  the branches' independence.    [Lacayo] "May I stress that this disagreement can always be  settled through dialogue. We made some progress in today's  meeting, which we are concluding."    One result of the dialogue is that it was clarified today  which obligations the government could sign with international  banks.    [Lacayo] "We will never set down in an international public  document an obligation in the name of another branch. We will  set down the Executive Branch's will. But we will never commit  neither the National Assembly, nor the Supreme Court of Justice,  nor the Electoral Tribunal, to things to which only they can  commit to."    He also said that the possibility of vetoing the Labor Code  was not discussed and that the Executive Branch made a  commitment so the Code benefits workers. He announced that a  meeting with all Nicaraguan sectors will be held on Wednesday to  discuss the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]  document and settle any remaining doubts.    [Lacayo] "Some drafts have been distributed. Some people  have reacted to these drafts. We will share with them the most  recent versions, which in some respects are more positive than  the previous drafts."    Regarding the military organization bill, Lacayo said the  government and the Army together intend to complete the bill  before 25 April.</p>

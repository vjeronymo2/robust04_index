			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 2 May (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist  Party (MSZP) believes that Hungarian State Television --  contrary to its role as set down in the electoral law -- takes a  biased and active role in the ongoing election campaign, and  thus violates the electoral law. In a communique forwarded to  MTI on Monday [2 May], the MSZP announced that it will lodge a  complaint against Hungarian State Television to the National  Election Committee.    According to the MSZP, Hungarian Television ensures  publicity  for unverified statements, unfounded accusations, and unmerited  slander in some of its political programs.    The MSZP asks the National Election Committee to take a  stand  on the public service media carrying out independent political  campaigning during the election campaign period. It also asks  the Election Committee to call on the deputy chairman of  Hungarian Television to immediately take the necessary steps to  ensure the cleanness of the elections and the impartiality of  the public service media he leads.</p>

			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Gardening: Why not host a hosta in a civilised setting? Whenever something improves, other people complain. Why ever do we listen? For nearly five years, they turned me off a gardener's godsend; they let me shelter behind the excuse that my new garden was too dry. In the 1970s, I grew hostas like an adventurous madman. They revelled in my beds of pure pig-manure. Then, people started complaining that they were over-bred and over-priced. Their great suppliers in America seemed to have lost sight of reality: could you really face up to owning a hosta called Zounds? Even if you cannot identify a hosta, you have probably got one. They are those richly-leaved plants which re-appear in spring in shades of green, blue and green-yellow and which are about to flower on long stems with mauve and white tubular buds. Since the 1960s, the fanciers have moved in and the rest of us have found that these boldly-leaved plants are almost indestructible. Today, there are hosta-groups, hosta-freaks and I suspect that people swap them like horticultural Tupperware. But slugs remain their greatest admirers. If we can kill off the slugs, we may one day have a hosta war. The balance of trade is tantalising. In the wild, the best hostas grow in Japan. Hosta fluctuans is grown beside many Japanese doorways and its leaves are used in a clever recipe for rice. There were Japanese breeders of hostas in the 1950s, but the Americans saw their potential, took parents home and made them a plant for the family yard. Their market is enormous, but the Japanese are returning to the children of their heritage. They are continuing to breed new forms and are planning to bring wild varieties into London. In Britain, we use them fully, encouraged by all the experts and well served by our leading nurseries. Hostas belong in the most civilised and fashionable settings. The big grey-blue leaved sieboldiana Elegans is the perfect foil for the taller older-fashioned roses where it was often used by that great garden-planter, the late Lanning Roper. Hostas now turn up in pots on their own, a favourite feature of no less a designer than David Hicks. There are now so many that you can host a hosta in any good garden: seven years in a row, Sandra Bond, of Goldbrook Plants, Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk, has won gold medals for her stunning exhibits at Chelsea. She has the biggest list, both home-bred and American. From the Hosta Society, you can also try the Bowdens at Cleave House, Sticklepath, Okehampton, Devon. The ins and outs concern pots, stamina, scent and naming. First, the matter of pots. Hostas should not be lost in the potted jungle which I otherwise champion: they look and grow best in a pot to themselves. The problem is that most of them develop very deep roots over time: they have split a clay pot with me and will do the same in terracotta. There are golden rules, endorsed by Sandra Bond. It is best to pot a hosta in stages, from a small to a greater size over the years: do not start it in a large urn when it is young. Always pot it in a plastic pot which is expendable: put this plastic holder inside a clay or terracotta pot, both to ease the watering and to guard against the power of the roots. Against slugs, use greasing. The hosta's greatest enemy is not a gardener on holiday: it is our slimy friend. An experienced reader tells me that she smears Vaseline on her pots' collars and that it keeps off the invader. Slugs cannot ooze their way across grease. Next, scent and stamina. In pots, the best forms are the fortunei group because they have the most shallow roots. They are also good in gardens. I have gone off the highly popular Frances Williams, which was the star of the early 1980s, because its stale yellow edging on the blue leaf turns down in dry weather and is slow to develop. My new stars are Sum and Substance, the blue-leaved Blue Angel and Halcyon and the scented Sugar and Cream and Summer Fragrance. Of all these forms, Sum and Substance is the most remarkable. It makes a clump of green-gold leaves for which one plant suffices in isolation. It grows in sun. It is starting to flower today in its second year and, after a preliminary defence with slug bait in April, it is left alone by slugs. Its leaves are too tough, like cheap steak. At Pounds 8 a plant, it is well worth it, especially as it can soon be divided. Scented hostas are also on the way up. For years, I battled with the old Edwardian favourite, plantaginea, which Gertrude Jekyll used so prettily in her green shaded courtyard which linked the house and garden. Its white flowers are hugely pretty and do appear with me, but I realise that they refuse to show in the Midlands and the North. The new Sugar and Cream is variegated and far stronger, even in colder areas. We can expect great things from the new Fragrant Bouquet, which costs Pounds 19 and is a top Bond recommendation: one for a bond-dealer's birthday. Lastly, the names are a serious problem. At Hampton Court flower show, even I could see that some of the exhibitors were giving hopeful names to hostas which the experts would not validate. It is essential to buy from specialists, as many of their plants will be divisions from a supervised stock-parent. The trouble is that hostas are re-emerging and are stunning value for small urban gardens. Price is slightly less important where you can only house a few good features and, although a hosta disappears in winter, it has the quality of a natural sculpture in a slug-free area. Wherever there is money, there is muck. It takes several years for a young hosta to develop its full quality and you should never judge one on its first three seasons. Inevitably, general traders may fail to realise that their promising young plant is not the true speciality which experts can identify. The last five years on the sidelines have taught me how much has changed among the scattier innovations with names such as See Saw. Already, breeders have blue-leaved forms with the elusive white edge. They will soon be within our reach and, meanwhile, everyone is after a better texture. The state of the art is to breed a hosta too solid for slugs. Let us hope that it is not too leathery for gardeners who share a slug's view of beauty.</p>

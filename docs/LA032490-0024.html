			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HUMOR WEARS THIN IN 'GREATER TUNA' AT WESTWOOD PLAYHOUSE  </P> <P> "Vacation in Texas -- and see why it's like visiting a whole other country."  </P> <P> This was the first commercial message I heard from my car radio as I drove home  from "Greater Tuna" at the Westwood Playhouse Wednesday. It almost could have  been part of the show.  </P> <P> The denizens of Tuna, Texas' third smallest town, are definitely different from  you or me. This is not an affectionate tribute to our common humanity. It's a  cartoon that depicts Tunans as intellectually and spiritually blighted folk who  deserve nothing more than a few guffaws.  </P> <P> They get those guffaws in "Greater Tuna." For those who have never seen Joe  Sears and Jaston Williams playing 10 Tunans apiece, in the show they co-wrote  with director Ed Howard, that may be enough.  </P> <P> However, for those who already saw Sears and Williams do their show at Las  Palmas Theatre in 1984, or at one of their other venues around the country or  on Home Box Office, another visit to "Greater Tuna" may seem more like "Lesser  Tuna."  </P> <P> On second viewing, admiration for the performances, the costumes and the wigs  gives way to impatience with the thinness of the writing and the supercilious  quality of the laughter that results from such a shallow script.  </P> <P> Not that the performances, costumes and wigs have slipped. Sears plays the big  movers and shakers of Tuna, while Williams plays the little whiners, and  neither of them indicates that this is their umpteenth time around the track  with these characters.  </P> <P> The two of them are funniest in drag. Williams endows the gun-hawking Didi  Snavely with a ragged, nobody-knows-the-trouble-I've-seen voice; sighs  magnificently as teen-aged Charlene Bumiller, who's traumatized over not making  cheerleader; and minces majestically as Vera Carp, vice president of the Smut  Snatchers.  </P> <P> Sears' Bertha Bumiller is the most rock-solid characterization on stage,  despite (or because of?) the mismatch between her girth and that sickly-green  pantsuit she wears. His Aunt Pearl is a not-so-distant relative of Jonathan  Winters' Aunt Maude.  </P> <P> Linda Fisher's costumes are still a hoot, if hardly unexpected. For example,  old Aunt Pearl wears lots of pearls, even on the hottest day of the summer,  even as she goes about poisoning dogs in order to protect her chickens. R.R.  Snavely (Sears again), who witnessed an unidentified flying chalupa, has a  belly that will never stop sticking out from behind his denims. Vera's little  hat looks like it, too, might be an unidentified flying object.  </P> <P> There's a disdainful quality to most of the laughter this show provokes. The  bigotry and narrow-mindedness of the Tunans and their ghastly fashions will  allow enlightened Westsiders to congratulate themselves for not living in small  towns. This is the cheapest kind of satire -- it makes its audience more  comfortable.  </P> <P> The writers hardly bothered with hypocrisy, which should be a mother lode for  small-town humor. For example, the title of a winning school essay is "Human  Rights: Why Bother?" This gets a quick laugh, but it would have been a richer  joke if the essay praised values that the writer's behavior then mocked.  </P> <P> The only slight exception to the detachment we feel toward these people is with  Bertha. In the big city, people have to cope with impossible children just as  Bertha does. But some of our connection with her derives from hearing her admit  that life isn't so rosy in Tuna. In other words, even Bertha confirms our  prejudices.  </P> <P> The show doesn't sound updated. When Bertha discusses books that should be  removed from the library, her first targets are "Roots" and "Bury My Heart at  Wounded Knee" -- '70s books that would probably have been replaced by fresher  targets by now. While a change on this level would be superficial, at least it  might give this "Tuna" a sharper hook.  </P> <P>  At 10886 Le Conte Ave., Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 6 and  9 p.m., Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m., indefinitely. $17.50-$25; (213) 410-1062.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Valeo in Dollars 80m US purchase Valeo, the French vehicle components group, yesterday took a further step in the expansion of its North American operations, announcing that it is to buy Lake Center Industries (LCI), a US supplier of electronic and mechanical equipment, for Dollars 80m. The French company said the acquisition would strengthen its position with North American vehicle manufacturers, in particular Chrysler, General Motors and Ford. LCI's main product lines include control panels for heating and air conditioning systems, switches and electronic assemblies. Its annual revenues amount to Dollars 110m and are expected to reach Dollars 140m in 1995. The company, a subsidiary of Guy Atkinson, has six manufacturing plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin, with a workforce of 1,380. The US company will become a division of Valeo Electronics, and should push sales for this sector of Valeo's operations to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 410m) in 1995. Turnover for Valeo as a whole is expected to reach FFr22.5bn this year, with more than FFr3bn coming from North America. Its principal products include cooling systems, clutches, heating and air conditioning systems and windscreen wiper equipment. Valeo said it would pay for the acquisition in cash. Following the purchase of Borg Instruments of Germany, and majority stakes in joint ventures in Argentina and China, Valeo said its total financial investments for the year should total about FFr850m. The company added that strong cash flow should enable it to reduce its debt to equity ratio to below 10 per cent at the end of the year, compared with 14 per cent at the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Bangemann warns on telecoms delay EC member states risk jeopardising their competitive position if they delay further telecommunications liberalisation, the EC's industry commissioner warned yesterday. Mr Martin Bangemann told EC telecoms ministers in Luxembourg that it would be against member states' own interests to postpone the European Commission's proposed 1998 deadline for opening all telephone calls to full competition. Poorer and smaller member states were last night chipping away at the Commission's deadline in an attempt to win temporary opt-outs from the ambitious programme, which follows earlier liberalisation of the market for telecoms equipment and specialised services. Under a compromise, Belgium and Luxembourg - which are classified as 'small networks' - would not have to liberalise telephone services until the year 2000. Less developed networks - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece - would have until 2001, with the possibility of a two-year extension. Ireland and Spain were last night attempting to persuade the larger countries, led by Britain, Germany and France, to accept a general deadline of the year 2000.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 IN GOP HELP ASSAULT GUN BAN PASS STATE SENATE UNIT  </P> <P> Legislation to ban the sale and possession of military weapons such as the  assault rifle used to slay five schoolchildren in Stockton last month received  a big boost Monday when two Senate Republicans joined Democrats in voting to  approve it.  </P> <P> On a 9 to 2 vote, the Senate Appropriations Committee endorsed the politically  sensitive measure by Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who  pronounced himself "very optimistic" that it would clear the full Senate as  early as Thursday.  </P> <P> To secure favorable votes from the committee, Roberti weakened the bill  somewhat with amendments, a tactic that failed to win over or neutralize the  National Rifle Assn., which has mounted a major campaign to defeat the  proposal.  </P> <P> NRA representative David Marshall complained to the committee that the  amendments, rather than clarifying the legislation, would create more confusion  over the difference between a legal sporting firearm and an illegal gun.  </P> <P> But Roberti, flushed with victory, declared after the committee vote that "it  is clear we are getting Republican support. . . . They recognize that the  purpose of the bill is to just get assault weapons out of the hands of the  general public and it has nothing to do with banning legitimate sporting  weapons."  </P> <P> Last week in the Judiciary Committee, the bill was barely approved, receiving a  "no" vote from each Republican member along with two Democrats. Although the  gun control issue has always been politically delicate for members of both  parties, Republicans traditionally are more reluctant than Democrats to vote in  favor of additional restraints on gun ownership.  </P> <P> But in the Appropriations Committee on Monday, Republicans Marian Bergeson of  Newport Beach and Robert B. Beverly of Manhattan Beach joined seven Democrats  in voting "aye." The bill needed at least seven favorable votes.  </P> <P> GOP Sens. William Campbell of Hacienda Heights and James W. Nielsen of Rohnert  Park voted "no." Democratic Sen. Bill Lockyer of Hayward, who voted against the  measure last week in the Judiciary Committee, abstained in the appropriations  panel's vote.  </P> <P> Roberti, who a few weeks ago described himself as moderately cautious about the  bill's prospects, upgraded his confidence rating to "very optimistic" Monday  and said he believes both Democratic and GOP senators "now recognize that we  have a common obligation to get assault weapons out of the hands of the general  public."  </P> <P> The bill is sponsored by top law enforcement officers throughout the state, who  maintain that gang members and drug traffickers with semiautomatic military  combat weapons are outgunning police officers and that such criminals are  terrorizing entire neighborhoods in Los Angeles and elsewhere.  </P> <P> The bill would ban the manufacture, sale, general possession and transfer of  semiautomatic military assault weapons, such as the Chinese-made AK-47 that  Patrick Edward Purdy fired at least 106 times into the Stockton schoolyard on  Jan. 17, killing five children and wounding 29 others and a teacher.  </P> <P> Purdy's weapon was purchased over the counter in Oregon, where rifle ownership  laws are similar to those of California. In California, anyone 18 years or  older can buy such a gun by showing standard identification and filling out a  federal form declaring that he or she is not, among other things, a drug addict  or fugitive.  </P> <P> To meet the concerns of lawmakers such as Sen. Robert B. Presley (D-Riverside),  Roberti agreed to weaken the bill so that an appointed "assault weapons"  commission would be purely advisory rather than a powerful regulatory entity.  </P> <P> Originally, the panel would have had the authority, whenever a new gun came on  the market, to determine whether it should be exempt from the ban on  semiautomatic arms. But many lawmakers objected to the notion of a commission  appointed by the governor and Legislature deciding which guns were "good" and  which were "bad."  </P> <P> Roberti agreed to make the commission an advisory agency, whose recommendations  to approve or ban new guns would be made to the Legislature. The final decision  would be left to the Legislature and governor.  </P> <P> In the Assembly, a bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (R-Los Angeles) proposed a  similar commission, but he abandoned the commission in the face of major  opposition. The Roos bill also would outlaw about 40 semiautomatic firearms by  model and manufacturer.  </P> <P> By contrast, the Roberti bill contains a generalized definition of the  semiautomatic assault weapon, which would encompass a vast array of firearms.  Law enforcement organizations that drafted the legislation insisted on this  feature. Supporters maintain that such a broad definition is necessary to  prevent the manufacture and sale of "look-alike" assault weapons, those that  closely resemble weapons that would be banned.  </P> <P> Roberti also added to the bill another 10 semiautomatic rifles that would be  exempted from the prohibition, all of them currently considered hunting arms.  The bill previously listed about 27 "good" guns that would be exempted.  </P> <P> Here is how the Appropriations Committee voted:  </P> <P> Democrats voting aye (7) -- Alfred E. Alquist of San Jose; Ruben S. Ayala of  Chino; Daniel E. Boatwright of Concord; Wadie P. Deddeh of Bonita; Ralph C.  Dills of Gardena; Art Torres of Los Angeles, and Presley.  </P> <P> Republicans voting aye (2) -- Bergeson and Beverly.  </P> <P> Democrats voting no (0) -- None.  </P> <P> Republicans voting no (2) -- Campbell of Hacienda Heights and Nielsen of  Rohnert Park.  </P> <P> Abstaining (1) -- Lockyer (D-Hayward).  </P></p>

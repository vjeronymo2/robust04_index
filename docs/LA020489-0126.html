			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCKNIGHT SAYS HE MIGHT SEEK FULLERTON JOB  </P> <P> Gary McKnight, the phenomenally successful Mater Dei High School basketball  coach, said Friday he plans to apply for the Cal State Fullerton job, provided  Fullerton indicates he would be a contender.  </P> <P> "I would be very interested, but I don't want to waste my time," said McKnight,  a Cal State Fullerton graduate who has guided Mater Dei to a 190-17 record,  five Southern Section championships and one state championship since becoming  coach in 1982. "I'd be very interested to make a move like that."  </P> <P> McKnight said he will talk with Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll before  making a decision.  </P> <P> Fullerton named assistant coach John Sneed as acting basketball coach for the  season when George McQuarn resigned Nov. 3. Sneed has said since that day that  he is a candidate for the job.  </P> <P> Carroll announced last week that because of a school affirmative action policy  Fullerton will not make a separate decision on Sneed, but will consider him  along with the rest of the applicants. Carroll set a Feb. 24 deadline for  applications, and said he would like to name a coach soon after the Big West  Conference tournament, which concludes March 11.  </P> <P> In addition to Sneed, one other coach contacted by The Times said he has  applied for the job -- Iowa assistant Rudy Washington, formerly an assistant at  USC and head coach at Compton College and Verbum Dei High School. At Verbum  Dei, he succeeded Sneed, who had replaced McQuarn.  </P> <P> Washington also is the founder and executive director of the 2,000-member Black  Coaches Assn.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great situation," Washington said. "It's home for me, and I'm  working as hard as I can (to pursue the job)."  </P> <P> A number of potential applicants -- including UCLA assistant coach Paul  Landreaux and UC Riverside Coach John Masi -- apparently are waiting for an  indication of their chances.  </P> <P> "If (Fullerton) calls me and shows an interest, then I may look into it,"  Landreaux said. "I've been looking for a Division I job. If they're interested  in me, I'm sure they'll contact me. If they contact me, I'll talk to them."  </P> <P> Masi, whose Riverside team upset Iowa in December and is 17-2 and is ranked No.  1 among Division II teams, said he has talked with Carroll and "probably will  apply," although he, too, is awaiting an indication of Fullerton's interest.  </P> <P> McKnight's only experience as a varsity head coach is at Mater Dei. He has been  an assistant at Ocean View High School, an assistant at Saddleback College  under Bill Mulligan, and coach of the freshman team at San Clemente High  School.  </P> <P> He has turned down offers to be an assistant in major college programs.  </P> <P> "Being at Mater Dei is a unique situation; it's like being at a college,"  McKnight said. "I won't leave unless it's a really good situation. I wouldn't  consider the Chapman (College) job (where Rich Prospero is interim coach). . .  . But this is an opportunity to go Division I."  </P> <P> McKnight stressed his background in Orange County as a qualification for the  job.  </P> <P> "I think they need to recruit in Orange County, and get some financial backing  in Orange County," McKnight said. "I've got it working here."  </P> <P> McKnight's lack of major college coaching experience clearly would be his  biggest disadvantage in seeking the job.  </P> <P> "Ron Palmer at Long Beach State, (football coach) Gerry Faust at Notre Dame,  they didn't make it," said McKnight, referring to men who jumped from high  school jobs directly to Division I coaching jobs. Palmer's teams were 23-64 in  three seasons at Long Beach.  </P> <P> "But there are others that have," McKnight said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tom Hamilton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

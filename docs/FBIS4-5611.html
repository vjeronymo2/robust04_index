			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Akira Naide, Industrial News Department, third </F> in the series: "Field Report on Market Opening"; this one  entitled: "Semiconductors: U.S. Offensive Hits the Vulnerable  Part"]    [Text] "Expansion of market access is making steady  progress in ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit)."  Norman Chanoskiy [name as published], president of the Japan  subsidiary of a U.S. semiconductor maker, LSI Logic (located in  Minato Ward, Tokyo), is very confident about this. The ASIC  business inherently requires a certain extent of "design in," or  participation in product development from the design stage. LSI  Logic expects to increase income by more than 20 percent in 1994  alone. The business expansion of this company, mainly in ASIC,  is a barometer of the openness of the Japanese semiconductor  market.  <H5>  Sega Procured 26 Percent Foreign Semiconductors </H5>   According to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan,  the number of "design-in" projects by foreign semiconductor  makers and Japanese users increased from around 500 in 1986 to  more than 3,300 in 1993. "As far as U.S. companies are  concerned, there are no ill feelings with regard to market  access." Behind the confidence expressed in such a statement by  the Association of Foreign Semiconductor Users (chairman,  Hidehiko Yoshida) is its positive record in expanding market  access.    Yet, the United States came up with a new controversial  issue  at the regular Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks in March. It  designated automobiles, telecommunications, and electronic games  as the three priority areas for expanding purchase of foreign  semiconductors.    The section on semiconductors in the U.S. Trade  Representative's (USTR) "Foreign Trade Barriers Report"  [National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers] again  raised this issue.    These three sectors, accused of "inadequate efforts in  purchasing foreign semiconductors," are quite at a loss as to  "why they are singled out."    At the end of 1993, Sega Enterprises, a major manufacturer  of  electronic games, had actually procured 26 percent foreign  semiconductors. This represents a significant increase of more  than 16 percentage points compared with 1992. The lion's share  of Sega's semiconductor procurement consists of mask ROM's  (read-only memory). In 1993, foreign share in its mask ROM  purchase was 25 percent, but this is expected to increase to 50  percent in 1994.    Furthermore, Sega buys almost all of the CPU's (central  processing units) used in its 16-bit electronic game systems,  its top product line, from Motorola. Sega and Motorola formally  started doing business in 1991. Eikichi Utsugi, deputy chief of  the First Purchasing Department of the Materials Division,  recalls that, "In the beginning, we set a very tough price  level. Motorola made admirable efforts to meet our demands."    Sega was given a "Good User" award by Motorola in 1992. A  Sega home electronic game system, "Genesis" is displayed at  Motorola's plant in Austin, Texas. This is a symbol of the  "honeymoon" between the two companies.    On the other hand, Sega also makes strict demands on  European  and U.S. semiconductor makers. The 1 megabit (1 mega = 1  million) DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) used in Sega's  16-bit game systems has 16 input/output ports. At present, only  Toshiba is able to supply this product. Utsugi points out, "If  they want us to buy more, they should be able to make products  we need."  <H5>  The Whole Picture Remains Unclear </H5>   An even wider gap exists between the views of Japan and the  United States regarding semiconductor procurement for  automobiles and telecommunications. The U.S. Semiconductor  Industry Association (SIA) expresses quite straightforwardly its  discontent with the fact that "the major Japanese carmakers'  procurement rate of foreign semiconductors is less than 10  percent." However, Mitsubishi Motors managing director Shigeru  Nakagawa refutes this claim, saying, "We believe the foreign  share exceeded 20 percent three years ago." There is a glaring  gap between the two figures.    Texas Instruments Japan expects Toyota Motors and Honda  Motors to use quite a number of its digital data processing IC's  [integrated circuit] in their new models to be introduced around  1995. Motorola Japan has a team of marketing personnel devoted  exclusively to the Toyota Group in Nagoya. It has been actively  engaged in IC "design-in" for a few years. Both sides are  moving steadily in their efforts.    However, automobile makers mostly procure their  semiconductors through parts makers. Since the whole picture of  the Toyota Group remains unclear, it is difficult to refute U.S.  charges effectively.    Lack of Concrete Counterarguments    In telecommunications, while SIA officials complain that  "foreign semiconductor makers' participation in IC design-in for  large equipment is still inadequate," the international  procurement office of NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation] claims that "NTT is not a party to the  semiconductor agreement." NTT says that it announces  specifications for equipment it intends to purchase, and the  suppliers are determined by bidding. It has no say in the  semiconductors used in this equipment, since they are left to  the discretion of the suppliers.    What makes the position of the automobile makers and NTT  difficult is the fact that unlike Sega, they do not have actual  data to refute U.S. charges. Of course, they can insist that  "the issue of semiconductor procurement concerns the parts and  equipment suppliers." However, if they want to convince the  United States of the openness of the market, they may have to  involve the suppliers in a major effort to compute the  procurement rate of foreign semiconductors and to evaluate the  progress in design-in. These two industries are now faced with  the tough decision of whether to fight the battle in an arena  prepared by the United States.    At present, after the 20-percent share of foreign  semiconductors has been achieved, the United States is now  focusing on opening up specific sectors. Automobiles and NTT  are both considered sectors where the Japanese Government's  demand will easily be met, and where it is easy to apply  pressure to expand imports. U.S. companies, which learned how  to pry open a closed market during the 1980's, are indeed  hitting Japan's most vulnerable parts quite deftly.    Business leaders in the semiconductor industry are truly  distressed about the fact that "after we have been able to  achieve certain results in the market as a whole, they now come  up with new disputes."</p>

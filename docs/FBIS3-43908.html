			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Police Commissar Gaspar da Silva told the media  yesterday that the Luanda Province National Police Command is  not to ignore any form of demonstration that could threaten  citizens' lives as well as national unity. That police officer  also said that unidentified groups are distributing pamphlets in  Luanda inciting people to engage in demonstrations to mark, on  22 January, the first anniversary of the so-called bloody Friday.    [Begin Silva recording] Considering that the anniversary of  the frightful so-called bloody Friday is around the corner, we  assessed the situation and found that it had been aggravated by  the distribution of certain pamphlets seeking to reignite  tribal, regional, and even racial hatred. In view of that, the  police must urgently take preventive measures to ensure that the  aforesaid problems do not happen again. With that in mind, the  Luanda Province National Police Command hereby urges the people  to behave in a dignified manner and assume a responsible and  patriotic posture by uniting behind the ideals of a prosperous  fatherland that seeks progress.    By the same token, the Luanda Province National Police  Command hereby alerts the people to the fact that it will not  allow public order and calm -- both of which are much needed for  our country's development and reconstruction -- to be disrupted  by certain members of the public who obstinately and  intentionally refuse to along with society's norms of  coexistence.    The Luanda Province National Police Command hereby  reiterates  its call to the people of this city to cooperate with the forces  of law and order, irrespective of their skin color, ethnic  background, or the areas from which they come. The National  Police Command will take the necessary preemptive and repressive  measures to deal with all those insisting on committing unlawful  acts that could lead to criminal proceedings in terms of Article  188 of the Penal Code, which provides for a punishment of up to  three months in jail.

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Naming names if companies fail Sir, There is little doubt that more directors of failed companies deserve to be disqualified for misconduct ('Insolvency service fails to speed up', November 17), and it is gratifying to learn that more resources are being devoted to achieving this objective. In the meantime, while this backlog of outstanding cases is being cleared up, the business community's interests would best be served if the Insolvency Service actually published the names of directors receiving an adverse report from company liquidators. Moreover, since misconduct by directors is such an important contributory cause of corporate insolvency, greater resources also need to be devoted to enforcing company law more generally. Sample vetting of accounts submitted to Companies House could play a key role in deterring much of the malpractice that persists. Nigel Wilkins, 9 Petersham House, Harrington Road, London SW7 3HD</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Court quashes Bond's conviction MR Alan Bond, the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, was yesterday released after 90 days in jail, when the Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a fraud conviction against him. Mr Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation, was jailed for 2 1/2 years in May after being convicted of acting dishonestly during the ADollars 370m (Pounds 133m) rescue of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells merchant bank, five years ago. The charge alleged he persuaded a Perth businessman to contribute to the rescue, while concealing the existence of a ADollars 16m success fee to be paid by Rothwells to Bond Corporation. His release follows fresh evidence given to the appeal court by Mr Maxwell Healy, a former Perth building contractor. Mr Healy said Mr Connell had told him he would lie at Mr Bond's trial to ensure a conviction which would divert attention from his own forthcoming trial on Rothwells related charges. The appeal court dismissed five other grounds for appeal and Mr Bond was remanded on ADollars 100,000 bail until October 5, when the Perth district court will set a date for a new trial.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie raises Pounds 11m from South African sale McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, has raised Pounds 11m from the sale of Cobra, its sole South African investment, and has further built up its presence in Australia through a Pounds 6m acquisition. The company sold Eachairn Holdings, which holds an 18.8 per cent stake in Cobra, a bathroom products manufacturer, to Delta, the UK electricals company. Mr Michael Ost, McKechnie's chief executive, said: 'The disposal of McKechnie's last remaining interest in South Africa would provide funds for the development of its other businesses.' Over half of it is already invested, through the purchase of Regency Group for ADollars 12.5m (Pounds 5.99m). Regency manufactures shower screens and wardrobes and also produces and markets security doors and pool fencing. Regency fits in with McKechnie's other Australian interests in bathroom and security products. It demonstrates the Walsall-based company's determination to expand its core businesses in what has already become an important market place for the group. Last year, it acquired businesses in New Zealand and Australia, and in the six months to January, the Pacific region contributed Pounds 5.3m to profits before interest, representing 38 per cent of the total. The company is also expanding in the UK, and recently announced the agreed Pounds 28m takeover of Linread, a Midlands manufacturer of fasteners and precision components.</p>

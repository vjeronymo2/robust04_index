			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / US to reopen Gatt dispute over Airbus state subsidy THE US plans to file a second and much broader complaint in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) against European government support for Airbus aircraft programmes. Washington has already taken the European consortium before the Gatt subsidies committee on the issue of Bonn's exchange rate support for Daimler-Benz, the German partner in Airbus. It plans to file a much broader complaint against direct subsidies for development and production costs. It is also considering taking unilateral action against Airbus, including special duties and quotas on Airbus aircraft sales in the US market. 'Airbus still continues to distort trade although it now claims to be operating profitably,' Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman of Boeing, Airbus's main international competitor, said in an interview in Seattle. 'We feel subsidies for both development and production are no longer necessary for Airbus.' Mr Shrontz said the US aircraft industry was especially concerned by increasing subsidies for Airbus sales in the US. Airbus granted large loans last year to Northwest Airlines and America West. Although Boeing also advances finance to support purchases, it does so out of its own resources, Mr Shrontz said. In contrast, a substantial amount of Airbus financing in the US is done with European government support, he alleged. Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, has become increasingly frustrated by long and unsuccessful efforts between the US government and the European Commission to negotiate a compromise. Mr Raymond Waldman, Boeing's director of government affairs, said the US had made a good offer to the EC to try to settle the dispute last December. The US is seeking to limit government launch aid for new aircraft programmes to 25 per cent of their overall development and production costs instead of 45 per cent as proposed by the EC. Mr Waldman said the US had agreed on a 45 per cent ceiling for a three-year transition period provided the Europeans accepted the 25 per cent limit after that. 'At Boeing, we did not like the compromise because it was an open invitation for European governments to throw money at Airbus during the transition period,' he said. But the European Council of ministers rejected the compromise and changed some of the working assumptions, according to Mr Waldman. The original plan was for launch aid restrictions to apply to all aircraft of 100 seats or more. The EC said the new limits should cover only 140 seats and over. The US suspected the Continued on Page 20 EC of trying to support European plans to develop new 100- to 130-seat regional jets. Germany, France and Italy are considering a new Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn) regional jet programme. British Aerospace and Fokker of the Netherlands also have plans to build a larger, 130-seat version of their BAe 146 and Fokker-100 jets respectively. On the German government's exchange rate support scheme for Daimler-Benz, Mr Waldman claimed it was equal to a Dollars 2.5m subsidy for each Airbus aircraft produced last year. Although Boeing claimed Airbus was selling aircraft below cost in the US market, Mr Waldman said Boeing was pressing the US government to concentrate at this stage on the general issue of direct launch aid subsidies. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, warned last month that the EC would use 'every legal weapon' to defend the interests of the consortium. He claimed that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas had received between them over the past decade about Dollars 23bn in indirect support from the US government. Washington says Airbus has received direct subsidies totalling Dollars 25.9bn.</p>

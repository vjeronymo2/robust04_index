			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC NEWS: DELOS EMERGES ON THE ROAD TO SOLVENCY  </P> <P> Delos International, the Southern California-based recording company which  filed for protection under Chapter 11 last October, is beginning to emerge from  the shadows cast by the bankruptcy proceedings.  </P> <P> "The process of coming out of (bankruptcy) involves a lot of steps," said Delos  founder and president Amelia Haygood.  </P> <P> "We're on the first one now. But, it's like getting A's in school: If you can  continue doing it, and put in the time, chances are, you'll graduate."  </P> <P> One of the more positive moves toward Delos' eventual graduation is its recent  signing of a distribution agreement with its colleague and Hollywood neighbor,  A&amp;M Records. In this arrangement, A&amp;M carries out an expanded  distribution and marketing program for Delos.  </P> <P> According to Rudi Simpson, Delos' director of promotion: "Though (Delos) will  be working with A&amp;M on both advertising and marketing, those areas will be  mostly in their hands."  </P> <P> Among the potential positive effects of this new division, Simpson said, are  "an increase in unit sales and a reduction in overhead costs." In the meantime,  "we will continue to develop the artistic side. Delos will remain Delos."  </P> <P> The 16-year-old recording company, founded by Haygood in 1973, has a reputation  as a high-quality, audiophile-pleasing house. It holds the distinction of  having produced Eugene Ormandy's final recordings with the Philadelphia  Orchestra; its current roster of artists includes pianists John Browning and  Carol Rosenberger, soprano Arleen Auger, conductors Gerard Schwarz and James  DePreist and their respective Northwest orchestras -- the Seattle and Oregon  Symphonies -- clarinetist David Shifrin and the Orford Quartet, among others.  </P> <P> Expansion in the artistic arena can now proceed, Simpson says, promising to  announce new recording projects -- as well as new artists -- in the near  future. He expects to begin recording in August.  </P> <P> "Now that we are up and running," Simpson said, "This period of reorganization  starts to look very interesting. Among other things, we have streamlined our  operation. And we've learned who our friends were."  </P> <P> OLD SONGS: First in a series of two lectures sponsored by the California Museum  of Ancient Art, Ann Kilmer's "Music of the Ancient Near East: The World's  Oldest Song" will be delivered June 21 at 7:30 p.m. in Piness Auditorium at the  Wilshire Boulevard Temple, 3663 Wilshire Blvd. Kilmer, professor of Near  Eastern studies at UC Berkeley, has produced a recording titled "Sounds From  Silence" on which she presents, on a replica of an ancient Sumerian,  bull-headed lyre, a song 3,400 years old, which she deciphered on a clay tablet  found in Syria. The tablet contained two sections of cuneiform text. The first  section turned out to be lyrics to the song, a religious hymn in praise of the  Hurrian moon goddess, Nikkal. Utilizing a number of other ancient texts known  as "Theory Tablets," Kilmer and an international team of experts translated the  second section, which was musical notation for the words in the first section.  Information: (213) 762-5500.  </P> <P> PEOPLE: Dudley Moore will serve as host of the awards ceremony at the Eighth  Van Cliburn International Piano Competition next Sunday afternoon in Fort  Worth, ending the quadrennial event.

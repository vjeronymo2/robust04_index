			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Cofinoga takes 20 per cent in Sodira COFINOGA, the credit card unit of Galeries Lafayette, has taken 20 per cent in Sodira, a company controlled by France Telecom which is a service provider in France for a new pan-European digital mobile phone service, Reuter reports from Paris. Insurance group Europ Assistance has also taken 5 per cent of Sodira, the companies said. France Telecom, France's national phone company, is one of two operators in France launching digital cellphone networks which allow users to use their phone anywhere in Europe. Its service, Itineris, began early this year and is marketed through 11 service companies of which Sodira is one. A commercial accord reached between the partners provides for Galeries Lafayette and Bazaar de l'Hotel de Ville to sell subscriptions only for Sodira's mobile phone services, called Cellway. The rival French operator in the European digital cellphone market, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephonie, a unit of Generale des Eaux, launched its service in April. A subscription to Cellway costs FFr360 (Dollars 66.79) a month after a connection fee of FFr350, with a variety of possible extra charges for things such as changing a number, replacing a lost telephonecard or paying bills other than by direct debit. Cellway also offers a service through which a subscriber can get travel information, reserve hotels or flights or find telephone numbers, for no extra charge. SFR set a subscription level of FFr315 francs a month with an initial connection fee of FFr350.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: NEC sees sharp upturn in profits NEC, the Japanese electronics company, has revised upwards both its parent company and consolidated sales and profits forecasts for the year to March 1995, mainly on the strength of firm demand for the company's personal computers and semiconductors. The company is forecasting a particularly sharp upturn in sales and profits in the six months to September. Parent pre-tax profits in the first half are now expected to reach Y20bn (Dollars 199.6m), or double the May forecast of Y10bn and compared with an Y8.5bn loss in the first half of fiscal 1994. Net profits are forecast at Y10bn, compared with a Y9.3bn loss previously and an earlier forecast of Y6bn. Sales for the half-year are expected to be Y1,380bn for the parent company, up 4 per cent from the same period last year, rather than the Y1,370bn forecast in May. NEC said that it had seen strong demand for its PCs in the home market. PC sales were forecast to rise 4 per cent to Y490bn in the year, but NEC has revised this upwards to a 15 per cent rise to Y540bn. The company has also enjoyed the benefits of a strong pick-up in worldwide demand for semiconductors. NEC expects demand in Asia to rise 50 per cent over last year, while demand in the important Japanese market is forecast to rise 9 per cent. However, the company is slightly more conservative in its forecasts for the full year, due to the uncertainty over theyen's strength. For the full year NEC expects parent company sales of Y3,030bn, up from an earlier forecast of Y3,000bn, and pre-tax profits of Y60bn rather than Y50bn. On a consolidated basis, NEC expects sales to rise 5 per cent to Y3,760bn, pre-tax profits to be Y70bn and net profits to be Y35bn for the full year. The new forecast compares with an earlier one for sales of Y3,720bn, pre-tax profits of Y60bn and net profits of Y30bn.</p>

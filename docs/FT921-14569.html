			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Gandhi daughter declines role Ms Priyanka Gandhi, the 19-year-old daughter of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the assassinated former prime minister, yesterday turned down a position in her father's political party, a family spokesman said, AP reports from New Delhi. The Congress Party chairman of Uttar Pradesh state had announced on Monday that Miss Gandhi had been elected to the party's state governing committee. Later Mr Mahavir Prasad, the chairman, made clear that Miss Gandhi had not yet accepted the position. It appeared that her name was put up for nomination without her knowledge. Many Gandhi loyalists would like to see her assume the mantle of the political dynasty that governed India for 37 of its 44 years of independence.</p>

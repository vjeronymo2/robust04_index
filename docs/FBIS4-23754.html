			<p>BFN     [Text] The choice of a capital for KwaZulu/Natal has  resulted in a new political dispute. The three ANC members in  the executive committee of KwaZulu/Natal today agreed to boycott  meetings of the provincial legislature in Ulundi.    This follows the Inkatha Freedom Party's choice of Ulundi as  capital. The ANC alliance and the National Party prefer  Pietermaritzburg. The province's premier, Mr. Frank Mdlalose,  said the problem will be discussed at a session of the  provincial parliament later this month in Ulundi.    [Begin Mdlalose recording, in English] It will not be the  determination of a capital itself on those days, but it will be  the way to go about it. You will realize that there could be a  number of things, for example, it could be by referendum which  would have, of course, its own implications. It could also be  by way of a commission that would look into the whole issue and  report back either to the cabinet or to the parliament of  KwaZulu/Natal. [end recording]</p>

These questions center around the recent speech of the  president of the Republic. We have come to you for  clarification, especially in your capacity as participant in the  political consultations. We would like to have more of such  meetings for the better understanding of the developments in the  country. My first question, Mr. Minister, is that the public  has been wondering whether President Mobutu Sese Seko actually  dissolved the High Council of the Republic [HCR] and the  parliament? What do you say to that?    [Luwowo] You know, things are very clear but it is only  those  who do not want to see democracy advance and to see an end to  the transition period that are complicating matters. In his  address to the nation the head of state did not dissolve the  High Council of the Republic or the parliament. The head of  state simply took note of the decision made by the two major  political families of Zaire which were engaged in negotiations  at the Palais du Peuple. These two political groups, at the end  of their negotiations, decided on a certain number of things  among which is the creation of an HCR- Transitional Parliament.  That is to say, a single parliament which will comprise the  present National Assembly, the HCR, and participants in the  political negotiations. [passage omitted]    The head of state, who is the guarantor of the nation, did  not refer to any constitutional provisions contested by any one  of the groups. He referred exactly to what was agreed upon in  the protocol agreement and said the HCR as it is now composed  ceases to exist, the National Assembly as it is presently  composed also ceases to exist, and of course, participants in  the negotiations, having arrived at the end of their  negotiations, cease to exist as an entity.

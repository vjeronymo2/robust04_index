			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group  must ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its  development of nuclear weapons stepped up behind the facade of a  nuclear row against the fellow countrymen and remove its heavy  water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor before it is  too late, says a MINJU CHOSON analyst today.    The news analyst goes on:    The puppets' nuclear row is aimed at hurling abuses and  slanders at the DPRK to create the impression that its reactors  are being used to develop nuclear weapons. However, it is the  pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong and the  multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, not the  graphite moderated reactor in the North, that are actually being  used to develop nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.    The South Korean puppets has stockpiled spent nuclear fuel  containing more than ten tons of plutonium obtained through the  PHWR and the multi-purpose research reactor they put into  operation for the purpose of development of nuclear weapons. It  will increase to twenty-four tons by the year 2000.    Referring to the aim sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in  raising a hue and cry over the fictitious "North's nuclear  problem," the analyst says:    The puppets seek in this to create the impression that the  North is developing nuclear weapons and thus mislead public  opinion and find an excuse for keeping the U.S. troops and  nuclear weapons in South Korea. At the same time, they intend  to use their nuclear row as a smokescreen for covering up their  own nuclear arms development, while pretending to have any  concern for a solution of the nuclear issue.    If they are really interested in a solution of the nuclear  issue, they must stop taking issue with the fellow countrymen in  a far-fetched manner and demand the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear  weapons from South Korea. And they must discontinue their  nuclear row, immediately give up their own nuclear arms  development and prove this through the elimination of the PHWR  in Wolsong and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok.</p>

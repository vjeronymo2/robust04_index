			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Between 2 and 3 January, though the populations  of Isale and Mugongomanga had been celebrating happily, 64  houses were set ablaze by the populations of the two communes  who lived in total harmony last year. Christophe Nkurunziza  visited Mugongomanga commune.    [Begin recording] [Nkurunziza] Bujumbura rural is a province  which had become peaceful after the tragic events experienced in  Burundi. However, after the New Year's festivities, a  resurgence of violence has been seen in the communes of Isale  and Mugongomanga.    The governor of the province of Bujumbura rural, Dr. Aloys  Hakizimana, will give us the facts. [passage omitted] How many  houses were burned, how many people died, and how many were  injured?    [Hakizimana] According to a report sent to me by the head of  the Kibuye Zone on 2 January 32 houses were burned down with  five people seriously injured and one very seriously. Three of  them were transferred to [words indistinct] Kamenge while 15  others who were slightly injured were treated at the health  center in Kibuye, and they have returned home. In Kibuye [words  indistinct] we counted [words indistinct] 20 houses burned. In  Mugongomanga, [words indistinct] reports of the commander of the  district of Bujumbura say that ten houses were burned down. [end  recording]    After investigations, the number of houses burned down is  put  at 12 for Mugongomanga, while 52 were burned down in Isale. The  reported violence has an ethnic connotation. The governor of  the province of rural Bujumbura has this to say:    [Begin Hakizimana recording] It is very clear. Mugongomanga  Province is predominantly Tutsi while the Isale commune is  predominantly Hutu. On both sides, in Mugongomanga and Isale,  there are Hutu who fled some localities of Gisagwe where there  were confrontations during the crisis. The second phase of the  crisis was in Mugongomanga commune. In Mugongomanga there is a  Tutsi population which was displaced, which fled Isale commune.  So, it can be called ethnic.

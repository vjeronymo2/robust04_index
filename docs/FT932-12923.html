			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / International Company News: Anagen valued at Pounds 40m in June float ANAGEN, a biotechnology company with no sales to date, plans to raise about Pounds 10m through a flotation in June. About 25 per cent of the company's capital will be sold in the float through its brokers Albert E Sharp, giving a total market valuation of some Pounds 40m. Anagen is developing a line of automated medical diagnostic systems following development of a fully automated immunoassay system. The initial product, to be known as AN2000, is a fully automated immunoassay system which is an ultrasensitive method of measuring the presence of cancer markers, fertility hormones and other substances in blood. Mr Mervyn Sennett, managing director, said the company will not be ready for commercial production until November 1993 although its product is currently in pre-production. Its development costs - so far at Pounds 14.5m - are financed by a consortium of venture capital firms led by Schroder Ventures and including CINVEN, the venture capital arm of the Coal Board pension fund, Electra Capital, Norwich Union Venture Capital and Questa. Anagen has signed a marketing agreement with Organon Teknika, a subsidiary of Dutch pharmaceutical chemicals company Akzo. Teknika already markets a line of tests for such diseases as hepatitis and HIV, considered complementary with the product line contemplated by Anagen.</p>

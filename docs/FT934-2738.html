			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / As They Say in Europe: British disease is catching on It was another miserable week: self-flagellation took over where self-doubt left off and new realms of Euro-misery were revealed in the press. Ruling centre parties were again crushed by supposedly discredited opponents as the papers grimly acknowledged the errors of the past. This time, though, I was often caught off balance. Sometimes, you read a phrase in a paper and then look again to see if it is the paper you thought it was. The fact is that everybody is suffering from a new form of the British disease. One such example, a headline over an editorial, was: 'Wanted: a new political class.' I thought it must be the Guardian or the Observer in London, which run such items most days. But it was Tagesspiegel in Berlin. Another came in a quotation from a trade union leader admitting to mistakes in the past: 'The unions went along with the short-sightedness and greediness that almost became an ideal.' Not the Daily Mail banging on about the 1970s' unrest but Dagens Nyheter of Stockholm quoting a union leader of the '80s. So, Sweden is passing through an experience familiar to British readers while Tagesspiegel was sharing worries common to most German commentators about the resurrection of the eastern German communists, the PDS, in the Brandenburg elections. The resurrected Italian communists, also the PDS, emerged similarly triumphant, so now we have two leading members of the European Union haunted by ghosts from the past. It is an experience, as I noted a couple of weeks ago, to which Europeans will have to get used. This should, in fact, be easy in spite of German attempts to whip up paranoia. Communists were a danger when they acted as the agents of an outside power, or as a gathering point for domestic totalitarians with utopian and transcendental tendencies. Today, communist parties merely fill the gap left by the disappearance of socialist parties. Each country invents its own reasons for extreme forms of anxiety - the surge of the far left or, even worse, the far right. Humiliating departures from the World Cup. When old chickens come home to roost, the grass often looks greener elsewhere, to coin a phrase. If one's own nation has been defeated, another must have won. Nevertheless, it was still a surprise to come across a third striking pronouncement of the week, this time in Nice Matin. It told readers: 'France will be weak in Europe because it has not been able, in these past few years, to enforce its conception, against that of Britain, of an integrated Europe capable of constituting a real commercial power which could stand up to the United States and Japan. 'Twenty years after having entered the Common Market and having left Efta, which it had created, Britain will have achieved its aim: Europe should be nothing more than a free trade area without the ability to integrate and unify its interests and without its own methods of self-defence.' This was predicated on there being what the paper called a 'bad Gatt agreement' which, when translated, means any agreement that seems likely to be achieved at this stage. France sees itself as a defeated nation, and no amount of shouting by ministers about their trade triumphs serves to diminish the country's self-contempt. But some of the old spirit is still there: one always enjoys the blithe assumption of the French that their interests coincide exactly with those of Europe. Imagine Nice Matin, or anybody else in France, admitting the fundamental truth that it would be in Europe's interest to eliminate French farming as a significant political force. With any luck, this weekend could be the last that we shall have to concern ourselves with the minutiae of the Uruguay Round and international trade policy. It is the moment when the future of the world economy hangs in the balance (I believe that is the appropriate cliche) in Geneva. And as its leaders are locked in fateful conclave in Brussels, western Europe looks to the future with trepidation. Fortunately, at this time, I have available a commentary from the daily paper that obviously should have been recognised earlier as the bellwether of European opinion, the Luxemburger Wort (which is, symbolically, two-thirds German, 30 per cent French and 3 per cent native). Luxembourg's top commentator wrote that the crushing of Christian Democracy and PDS victories in Brandenburg and Italy proved that 'excessively rapid trade liberalisation would destroy jobs and social benefits . . . In the two cases, the Asiatic challenge has fed fear of the future.' This should be taken seriously, for the Wort is not a paper given to overstatement. On the same day, its splash headline was: 'Gatt talks more difficult than expected.' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

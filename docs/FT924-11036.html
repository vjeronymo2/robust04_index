			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brussels speaks out on standards THE European Commission has told the groups which set Europe's technical standards they must make those norms available to all users on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, or risk losing their privileged status. The Commission's warning is contained in a paper published yesterday, which tries to reconcile the often contradictory requirements of efficient standardisation and intellectual property rights. The Commission believes the process of standardisation is essential to achievement of the single market. It has encouraged a small number of European standards institutes to develop common European standards, giving priority to high-technology areas such as telecommunications. The Brussels paper says 'all persons wishing to use European standards must be given access to these'. If standards bodies discriminate against outsiders, for example, Japanese companies wanting to break into the EC market, recognition of the standard under EC law could be withdrawn, or the status of the standardisation institute 'reviewed', the Commission adds.</p>

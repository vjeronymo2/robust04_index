This decision is strictly applied and those who  return to Kosova are fined, punished with 30 days imprisonment  or are taken their passports for three years. In conformity  with the decision, passports were taken from thousands of  Albanians who travelled to Albania through Macedonia or Greece.    It is difficult for the Albanians of Kosova to get visas for  Albania. Those who ask for visas have been maltreated and asked  to collaborate with police. That is why there are very few  requests for visas.    The Serbian authorities hinder all kinds of communication  between the Albanians in Kosova and the Albanians in Albania.  In many areas of Kosova, Serbian authorities have put jamming  devices in order to impend the transmission of the Albanian  radio-television programs. The devices are under the control of  the Serbian police and army. The exchange of artistic,  scientific and cultural values is also prohibited. The  University and National Library of Kosova, the Academy of  Sciences and Arts, the Albanological Institution and other  institutions in Kosova can not receive any publications from  Albania.    The Serbian police punishes the persons who keep a book or a  newspaper from Albania. The wall between Albania and Kosova is  so impassable that there are no telephone links with Albania.    Although the Albanians in Kosova live in an ethnic compact  territory, their mother-land Albania is very far away.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The agreement on the unification of the Russian and  Belarusian monetary systems, signed by the prime ministers on  Tuesday, differs from the original draft, leader of the Russia's  Choice faction Yegor Gaydar told Interfax in an exclusive  interview.    He said that among the most essential amendments was the  integration of the National Bank of Belarus with Russia's  Central Bank.    This circumstance gives hope for a better regulation of  Russian-Belarusian monetary relations and is expected to enhance  the efficiency of this document, said Gaydar. However, the  agreement does not specify during what period the National Bank  of Belarus will become a branch of the Central Bank, he  continued.    He expressed deep concern about the decision on exchanging  the Belarusian citizens' deposits and cash. According to the  agreement, every Belarusian citizen is to exchange 200,000  Belarusian coupons at the 1:1 rate, so the total sum to be  exchanged at such a rate will amount to two trillion rubles.    As the worth of the Belarusian coupon will be artificially  increased, and given the difference between the worth of the  cash and non-cash Belarusian coupon, large-scale manipulations  of cash in both countries are likely to take place, said Gaydar.    Before the agreement goes into force and is ratified by the  Russian and Belarusian parliaments, fantastic opportunities will  emerge for financial machinations involving sums worth billions  of dollars, he went on to say.    He pointed out that the agreement makes the economy hostage  to political games, especially on the eve of parliamentary  elections in Belarus.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Daf allegation Brussels is to examine the possibility that illegal state aid has kept Daf, the Dutch truck maker, in business for the last three years, writes Andrew Hill from Brussels. Daf went into receivership in February, putting 13,300 jobs in the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK at risk. Its Belgian and Dutch operations were transformed into a new company in March with the help of equity capital and loans from the Dutch state and the Flemish region of Belgium. The Commission opened an inquiry on Wednesday. If the aid is found to be illegal, the company's liquidators may have to repay the subsidies.</p>

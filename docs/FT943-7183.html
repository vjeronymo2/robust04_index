			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Computer price war in US as IBM matches cuts by Compaq A price war erupted in the US personal computer market yesterday as International Business Machines slashed prices on many of its PC products by up to 27 per cent. The move came in response to similar price cuts by Compaq Computer, the US market leader. Compaq threw down the gauntlet last week by cutting US prices on PC models sold primarily to businesses by up to 22 per cent. IBM has responded by matching Compaq's prices on similar models. High-performance desktop PCs with large capacity disc drives formerly selling for around Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,610) are now expected to be widely available for just under Dollars 2,000. 'Today's actions clearly demonstrate IBM's continuing commitment to respond quickly in resetting prices to meet changing market conditions,' said Bill McCracken, general manager, marketing and customer fulfilment at IBM PC Company. Other PC manufacturers are now almost certain to follow suit as the battle for market share unfolds. 'In the near future you can expect that we will undercut Compaq's prices,' said Mr Boris Elisman, product marketing and programs manager for Hewlett-Packard's PC business. He said he expected to see continuing price reductions in the fourth quarter as competition intensified. Digital Equipment is also expected to cut its PC prices within the next few days. The company is reported to be informing computer dealers of the impending reductions. IBM yesterday broadened the pricing battle by reducing prices of its PC servers to about 5 per cent below Compaq's current levels. PC servers are computers used to control office computer networks, and represent the most profitable and fastest growing segment of the corporate PC market. Compaq is currently the dominant supplier of PC servers, but IBM is making an aggressive push into Compaq's territory. The price war comes as the industry is entering its peak selling season and is expected to boost sales in an already rapidly growing market. Fuelling the PC battle are sharp cuts by Intel in the prices of its microprocessors, the 'brains' of PCs. Intel reduced the prices of its 486 and Pentium chips by about 40 per cent in the second quarter. Also adding to the momentum is the broad availability of products in a market that has faced shortages during the past two years. Lex, Page 14 PC price war, Page 15</p>

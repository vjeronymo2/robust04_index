			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: LESSONS IN THE MAKING OF A DEMON  </P> <P> In six days now Robert Alton Harris is scheduled to take his slow walk into San  Quentin's death chamber. When he does, Harris will carry with him a demon  mythology that has grown out of his crime. Is there anyone in California who  doesn't know that Harris ate his victim's hamburgers? That he murdered and  laughed?  </P> <P> This demonizing of the condemned is part of the tradition of American  executions. The demonized are easier to kill. They no longer resemble you or  me. They are monsters from the night, and their demise brings relief and a  certain sense of revenge. A demon's death is worth savoring.  </P> <P> In Harris' case, demonizing has been no problem. Didn't he murder kittens when  he was 9? Yes, yes. Didn't he organize the gang rape of another prisoner while  awaiting trial? Yes, yes. Didn't his very colleagues on Death Row claim they  would party on the day he died? Yes, yes.  </P> <P> So Harris has gotten the treatment. We, the people of California can strap him  to the green chair in the gas chamber without remorse or ambivalence. We did it  regularly to guys just like Harris -- and an occasional woman -- 23 years ago,  and we can do it again.  </P> <P> But for anyone who's interested, there is a difference now. In the intervening  years, we've come to understand the origins of a Robert Alton Harris and the  way any young boy or girl gets turned into a Frankenstein. Maybe this knowledge  doesn't affect the question of whether Harris should die. It does, however,  make demonization more difficult.  </P> <P> The laboratory of that transformation is known as the family. Over the years of  his appeals, details of Harris' family life have grown ever richer, and a  complete picture has emerged. It is instructive.  </P> <P> Here's a description of Robert's day of birth, offered by his sister in a court  declaration. "Mother was bathing (two other children) in the bathtub, and  father came in and starting kicking her in the abdomen, screaming that it was  not his baby, and she fell into the bathtub. He then kicked her in the crotch  with his combat boots on, and she began hemorrhaging. He kicked her several  more times."  </P> <P> Thus Robert was born, three months premature. Mom was a drunk like dad, and the  fetal alcohol had taken its toll. Robert had tremors and sleep disorders.  </P> <P> From the start, he was beaten by both parents, virtually every day. Mom  preferred bamboo sticks. Dad just used his knuckles.  </P> <P> The sister described it this way: "Robert couldn't walk into a room without  father kicking or beating him. Sitting at the table, if (Robert) reached out  for something without father's permission, he would end up with a fork in the  back of his hand." At age 1, Robert's jaw was broken.  </P> <P> The father remains convinced that Robert was sired by another man. When Robert  would seek affection by rubbing against his mother's leg, dad would beat both  Robert and the mother. In this family, everyone got beaten by dad.  </P> <P> Sometimes, for no apparent reason, dad would load his guns and tell his loved  ones they had 30 minutes to hide outside the house. He then hunted his family  like animals, promising to shoot anyone he found.  </P> <P> Here is the list of drugs, divided by ingestion technique, taken by Robert from  age 6 through adolescence. Sniffing: airplane glue, gasoline, oven cleaner,  paint, typewriter correction fluid. Injection: cocaine, heroin. Oral: Seconal,  methamphetamine, PCP, LSD.  </P> <P> Robert had no friends, did poorly in school, received no help for his problems.  Before he was a teen-ager, he revealed the pattern that would dominate his  life. He started killing neighborhood pets. The need to hurt and destroy was  directed at everything, even himself. Once mom told Robert and a brother to go  get switches so she could beat them. The brother brought back a small twig.  Robert brought back a club.  </P> <P> The parents were consistent to the end. Dad went to prison for sexually  molesting his daughters and last year killed himself with a shotgun. Mom drank  and smoked herself to death.  </P> <P> We know now that families like this one create demons. We know that, contrary  to the happy endings of Dickens' novels, most children never overcome cruelty  on this scale. Rather, they repeat it. Death Row is full of people like Robert  Alton Harris, and most of them have histories just like his.  </P> <P> We know all this, but we haven't a clue what to do about it. Harris was well  known to the state of California from his prior brushes with the law. He was no  secret, just as a thousand others are no secret today. But little was done  until he murdered. Now Harris will be a ritual sacrifice.  </P> <P> The demon will be dead, long live the demon.  </P></p>

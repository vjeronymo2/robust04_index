			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with economist Attila Karoly Soos, member of the </F> Alliance of Free Democrats and chairman of the Parliamentary  Budget, Tax, and Finance Committee, by Istvan Varga; place and  date not given: "Enterprise Stimulation in the Forefront --  Attila Karoly Soos on the Importance of Reducing Taxes"]    [Text] What would be your first economic policy measures  if the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] came to power after  the elections?    [Soos] The SZDSZ wishes to conduct an economic policy based  on tax reductions. We would abolish the source tax [forrasado]  from next year which is now 10 percent and Parliament actually  reduced it from 20 percent to this level on our suggestion. The  abolition of this tax would reduce the difference between the  interest rate on deposits and loans, which would have a positive  effect on the population's will to save. The abolition of  minimum tax rates is another SZDSZ proposal. We consider  taxation on income [bevetel] totally unjustified from an  economic point of view, and constitutional problems also arise  here. Third, in the case of enterprises that have less than a  50-million-forint turnover, we would introduce a flat rate tax.  This would make it possible for a large amount of sums paid by  small enterprises to tax advisers to come into the treasury.  Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, would pay less tax and have  less administration. Another of our proposals is to expand  investment preferences. Unlike the current rules, the  preferences could be used by anyone, regardless of government  permits.    [Varga] For capital-rich enterprises, the abolition of the  profits tax would be important because they are still paying a  flat rate tax.    [Soos] The government would remit part of the profit tax if  the enterprises use their profits for reinvestment. This  benefit would generally encourage the capital-rich enterprises  and would at the same time help boost the economy.    [Varga] It seems that the SZDSZ is leaving too much to  private initiatives; however, large investment with state  support cannot be given up.    [Soos] Rather than state investment, we should be talking  about infrastructural developments. In certain sectors, private  capital cannot be mobilized. Highways or telephone systems can  easily be created on a concession basis but hospitals or schools  can only be built from the state's finances. State resources  can also be used for the development of the regional  infrastructure.    [Varga] In connection with investment, we have to talk about  the World Expo. If it came to power, would the SZDSZ, in  accordance with its previous view, withdraw from organizing Expo?    [Soos] At the time, the country resounded with calls for the  world exposition to be organized on an entrepreneurial basis.  Now we know that this is not at all the case. It is almost  entirely a state investment and this is precisely the reason  that the SZDSZ was against organizing it. However, preparations  have reached a level where it would cost more to halt the  investment than to organize the Expo. In addition to this,  canceling the World Expo would also mean a loss of prestige  because many countries have now applied to participate in it.    [Varga] An enterprise-friendly policy definitely has to take  steps to put the banking sector in order.    [Soos] It is impossible to boost the economy in any way  without developing the banking sector. The SZDSZ would  stabilize the banking system and then it would begin to  privatize it. We would sell off two banks even in 1994. It is  important to implement cashless banking techniques as soon as  possible. It is absurd that entrepreneurs are walking about  with millions of forints in their pockets.    [Varga] Where would you find the financial resources for  investment stimulation and tax reductions? How much revenue  loss can the current position of the budget accept?    [Soos] Our proposal on tax reductions represents a small  part of the whole budget, so there is no point in talking about  the reserves for it. The loss of the source tax means 11  billion forints; however, parallel to this, the profits and the  profit tax from enterprises would increase. The abolition of  the minimum tax would mean the loss of 6 billion forints, which  would be regained through the payments of flat rate tax. I  expect that many people would choose this form of taxation and  this would increase budget revenue. We wish to find funds for  reducing the personal income and profit taxes, which is to be  implemented later, through a stricter collection of taxes.    [Varga] Entrepreneurs are complaining about high wage costs,  rather than high taxes.    [Soos] It is a fact that Hungarian wage costs are very high  in international comparison. However, it also has to be known  that the proportion of pensioners is very high in Hungary.  Stricter collection is again one way of reducing health and  pension contributions. However, in the more distant future,  only the introduction of private insurance can be the solution.    [Varga] The stock market could be one of the most  significant investment possibilities for citizens but, at the  moment, it is playing a modest role in the economy.    [Soos] It is vitally important to change the system of  investment support if we want to boost the turnover of the stock  exchange. If someone sells his shares then he automatically  loses his preferential treatment. The opposite of this should  be the case because the stock exchange is intensified when  people implement changes in their share portfolios.    [Varga] By now, some 200 billion forints of compensation  notes have entered the market and maintaining the current price  of these is awkward and costs very much. Would you accept the  costs of maintaining the prices of these at a certain level?    [Soos] Recently, demand through privatization has not kept  pace with the amount of compensation notes. The SZDSZ would  certainly ensure a demand for the necessary quality and amount  of shares.    [Varga] At the moment, the price of compensation notes is at  around 70 percent. Would you set the price higher or lower than  this?    [Soos] It certainly would not be lower than the current  price.</p>

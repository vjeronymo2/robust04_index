			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Allied London Props A reduced exceptional provision against the housebuilding division enabled Allied London Properties to return to profits at the pre-tax stage for the year ended June 30 1992. The profit was Pounds 1.49m, compared to a loss of Pounds 4.76m, after a provision of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 10m). Rental income increased from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 17.1m and virtually twice-covered the interest payable. After the preference dividends, losses per share were 1.5p (10p). The final dividend is again 2.455p for an unchanged total of 3.53p.</p>

			<p>Cocaine   <F P=102>   AU1705103494 Hamburg DPA in German 0832 GMT 17 May 94 </F> <F P=103> AU1705103494 </F> <F P=104>  Hamburg DPA </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [17 May] the coalition  meeting, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, clearly came out  against the release of so-called hard drugs and thus against the  line of North Rhine-Westphalian Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek  (Social Democratic Party of Germany). After the meeting  Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel stated that the coalition  agreed that the Anti-Crime Law should be adopted as quickly as  possible. This law is to be discussed at its third hearing in  the Bundestag this week.    Among other things, the coalition politicians discussed drug  policy after the ruling of the Constitutional Court that, even  though the possession of small amounts of cannabis products,  such as hashish and marijuana is not permitted, criminal  prosecution of such cases should be left to the discretion of  the public prosecutor's offices. In Krumsiek's view, this  ruling by the judges in Karlsruhe also covers his plan to no  longer make the possession of small amounts of heroin and  cocaine liable to criminal prosecution. This has been opposed,  above all, by Internal Affairs State Secretary Eduard Lintner  (Christian Social Union), the Federal Government's drug expert.</p>

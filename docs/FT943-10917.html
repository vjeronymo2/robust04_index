			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US heading for record rice crop The US Department of Agriculture yesterday said the country's rice production could jump by 17 per cent this year to a record level. Farmers in every rice-growing state except California have increased the acreage devoted to long-grain rice. Medium-grain rice acreage rose by 18 per cent. As a result production could hit 9.4m tonnes. With imports expected to reach 400,000 tonnes total supplies could rise by 8 per cent to a record 10.95m tonnes. Rice growers have enjoyed good weather, which is increasing yields by about 3 per cent. Farmers got off to an early start with their spring planting and favourable conditions since then have produced a crop of which USDA officials have rated as 7 per cent 'excellent', 74 per cent 'good' and 19 per cent 'fair'. Demand has also been increasing, although not as much as production. US consumption is also forecast to reach a record - 5.05m tonnes. Exports are likely to rise by 2 per cent to 4.15m tonnes, despite the decline in Japanese demand. After last year poor harvest, Japan is also having a better year. This could drive both US and world prices down to between Dollars 100 and Dollars 130 a tonne, according to USDA figures. Last year's average US price is estimated to have been between Dollars 165 and Dollars 169 a tonne.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: GE faces more losses at Hungarian unit GENERAL Electric, the US engineering company, is facing a third successive year of losses at GE-Tungsram, its Hungarian lighting subsidiary. The Hungarian government's reluctance to devalue the currency in line with cost inflation means that GE-Tungsram is continuing to lose money in 1992, Mr George Varga, the subsidiary's chief executive officer, said yesterday. Recession in GE-Tungsram's main west European markets has depressed prices for lighting products and compounded the effects of rising local costs. Mr Varga admitted that GE-Tungsram was under pressure to make money from its parent company and that with hindsight General Electric would probably have invested less than the Dollars 310m it has put into Tungsram. The earnings outlook remains gloomy in spite of a far-reaching cost-cutting exercise which the unit announced this March. GE-Tungsram announced at the time that it would reduce by 25 per cent employment and the investment that it had planned for 1992 and temporarily halt some production to draw down excess stocks. The retrenchment came in the wake of figures showing that GE-Tungsram lost Ft1.1bn (Dollars 13.6m) on 1991 sales of Ft26.6bn on a Hungarian accounting basis.</p>

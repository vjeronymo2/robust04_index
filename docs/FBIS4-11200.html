The Solidarity Action Movement (MAS) legislator, who held a  seat during deposed coupist President Jorge Serrano's  (1991-1993) administration, claimed that the call for elections  violated his political rights.    In confirming the temporary suspension of the electoral  process, a Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) magistrate said  today that his organization accepts but does not share the CSJ  ruling.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH GROUPS URGE FAST-FOOD CHAINS TO HALT FRYING WITH FAT  </P> <P> A coalition of health organizations and scientists today called on hamburger  chains, including McDonald's and Burger King, to offer their patrons healthier  food and stop cooking french fries in beef fat.  </P> <P> "We are troubled by many of your products, but especially by the unnecessary  use of shortening made largely from beef fat," said a letter from organizations  that included the American Heart Assn., American Public Health Assn. and the  Center for Science in the Public Interest, Ralph Nader's group.  </P> <P> "As you know, a small serving of your french fries contains more beef fat than  your regular hamburger," they said.  </P> <P> The letter was also sent to the fast food chains Wendy's and Jack in the Box.  </P> <P> McDonald's has already stopped frying chicken, fish and pies in beef fat, and  announced last week that it is testing french fries cooked in vegetable oil in  500 of its restaurants.  </P></p>

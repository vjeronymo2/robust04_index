			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Israel upset by UN Jerusalem reference ISRAEL has asked the US to explain why it supported a resolution which refers to Jerusalem as part of the occupied Palestinian territories. The resolution, which strongly condemned Israel's plans to expel 12 Palestinians from the occupied territories, was passed unanimously by the UN Security Council this week. The term 'occupied Palestinian territories' appears twice in the resolution. Israel is extremely sensitive to international declarations which cast doubt on its sovereignty over Jerusalem. Official US policy holds that the status of the city should be determined in negotiations, but that it should not be divided. Opinion polls show Israelis willing to make territorial concessions involving the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but not Jerusalem.</p>

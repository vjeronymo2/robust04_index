			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Wakeham seeks coal improvement BRITISH COAL must improve its productivity even further, Lord Wakeham, the leader of the Lords, warned yesterday, highlighting competition from cheaper coal imports from countries such as the US and Australia. 'British Coal has more than doubled its productivity over the last seven years and this is a major achievement. Over the last few months it has done even better,' he said. 'However, further improvement is essential. British Coal's productivity is still only 20 per cent - 35 per cent of that in America or Australia, its deep mined costs are two or three times higher.' In the Commons last night, a Labour motion protesting at the end of production at 18 collieries and accusing ministers of 'failure to develop a long term strategy' for meeting energy requirements was defeated by 163 votes to 111.</p>

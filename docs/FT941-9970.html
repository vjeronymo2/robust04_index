			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Harry Ramsden's advances 34% to Pounds 815,000 Harry Ramsden's, the fish and chip restaurant operator, increased pre-tax profits by 34 per cent to Pounds 815,295 in the year to October 3, on sales ahead 15 per cent to Pounds 3.29m. The Yorkshire-based group now has eight restaurants in the UK, following successful openings last summer in Edinburgh and Birmingham. It plans to open another five this year - in Bristol, Liverpool, Nottingham, Cardiff and Dublin. Site searches continue with existing joint venture partners in Belfast and Aberdeen and the group has made new commitments to joint venture franchises with partners in Southampton and Chester. It said: 'Our experience in Hong Kong has enabled us to secure a franchisee in Singapore and we anticipate concluding a franchise agreement shortly with an operator in Melbourne. Our franchise partner in Jeddah has now acquired a site for development.' Net debt increased from Pounds 237,379 to Pounds 1.65m, giving gearing of 35 per cent, as the group invested in new joint venture franchises and purchased for Pounds 600,000 an amusement arcade and fairground beside its original Guisely Restaurant on the outskirts of Leeds. The group invested in Welbourne Ramsden's, a new fish and chip take-away chain of 11 small outlets in the south of England, which will not trade under the Harry Ramsden's name. It also completed an agreement with Ross Young's, a member of the United Biscuits group, to endorse the batter used on a new range of frozen fish sold under the Ross Chip Shop brand. Earnings per share rose to 6.7p (5.4p). The final dividend is held at 3.5p for a maintained total of 4.5p. Because group pre-tax profits had exceeded Pounds 800,000, the 2m B ordinary shares this week converted into ordinary shares, which are eligible for the final dividend.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: 'STRESS BUDDY' CREATOR BELIEVES A FRIEND TO KNEAD IS A  FRIEND INDEED  </P> <P> Think of him as Gumby for yuppies.  </P> <P> Worry beads for the upwardly mobile. Low-cost therapy to get you past the 4  p.m. won't-this-day-ever-end hump.  </P> <P> He's Stress Buddy, the invention of Bob Armstrong, who chucked his job as a  computer salesman to give birth to what he hopes is the perfect under-$10 gift  for the ulcer set.  </P> <P> It's cheaper than psychiatry and healthier than a double martini.  </P> <P> Armstrong, 45, who lives in Rancho Bernardo, says the idea came to him late one  afternoon as he was staring out his office window in downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> "I look at stress as nature's message for you to lighten up," he said. "That  afternoon, I realized I was the poster child for Mid-Life Crisis."  </P> <P> What the world needs, he decided, is a 6-inch, flexible plastic figurine that  can be kneaded and bent and twisted and placed in various spots around the  torture chamber known as the modern work station.  </P> <P> The road to Stress Buddy was anything but stress free. Enough faxes went to and  from Armstrong's agent in Hong Kong to fill a big-city phone book.  </P> <P> "It's been a two-year exercise in frustration and persistence," Armstrong said.  "But I'm confident that persistence is going to win out."  </P> <P> A deal has now been struck with a plant in China. Distribution agreements are  signed with PlayCo and Host International (which runs gift stores in airports  and hotels) and maybe more later.  </P> <P> Stress Buddy comes complete with his own mini-briefcase.  </P> <P> He can sit atop your desk or computer or Pet Rock. His hands can beckon  skyward, cover his eyes or grab his pounding head. His legs can be crossed or  twisted.  </P> <P> And what's next?  </P> <P> Ms. Stress Buddy, of course. The modern lady executive, dressed for success.  </P> <P> Available by this summer's angst season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Council Vote Won't Hold Water  </P> <P> How toxic is the political atmosphere at San Diego City Hall?  </P> <P> The week began with the council's ruling coalition reacting angrily to Mayor  Maureen O'Connor's proposal to cut $1 million from her office budget if the  council will make a similar cut in its budgets.  </P> <P> By Monday afternoon, the coalition seemed to strike back.  </P> <P> By a 5-4 vote, the council summarily rejected the mayoral nomination of Fred  Thompson to a spot on the County Water Authority board.  </P> <P> Unqualified, said Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer. Thompson was allowed to speak  only after the vote.  </P> <P> In case you're interested, here's the resume of someone deemed unqualified to  do unpaid public service:  </P> <P> Graduate of San Diego State University. Owner of a public  relations/marketing/entertainment management firm.  </P> <P> Service on the Mayor's Committee for the Homeless and the boards of the Police  Athletic League, Aztec Athletic Foundation and Old Mission Beach Athletic Club.  </P> <P> Also, a leadership role in rebuilding the San Ysidro Boys Club, St. Jude's  Academy and the Southcrest Little League facility.  </P> <P> Thompson, 46, who is Hispanic, would have been the only minority member on the  water board. Among those recommending him was banker-civic activist Murray  Galinson.  </P> <P> Voting no were Wolfsheimer, Linda Bernhardt, Bob Filner, John Hartley and Wes  Pratt. Only Wolfsheimer offered a reason.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Same Old Rodent Race  </P> <P> Roundup.  </P> <P> * The Del Mar Fair has hired animal fancier and trainer Donna Kingsley of  Ramona as supervisor of the Fancy Rats and Mice Show for the 1990 Fair.  </P> <P> She promises daily Rat Chats. Sounds Mickey Mouse to me.  </P> <P> * The California Catholic Conference, made up of the state's 27 Roman Catholic  bishops, meets Thursday and Friday for its semi-annual meeting in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Among the topics to be discussed will be whether the church should censure  Catholic politicians who support keeping abortion legal.  </P> <P> Translation: Was it smart for Bishop Leo Maher to scold Lucy Killea during her  successful race for a State Senate seat, or did it just provoke a pro-Killea  backlash?  </P> <P> The debate, expected to be spirited, will be behind closed doors.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Fears of delay over HK airport SENIOR British and Chinese officials meet in Beijing today to try to break the deadlock over financing Hong Kong's HKDollars 175.3bn (Pounds 11.9bn) new airport and related infrastructure. However, the British and Hong Kong side is still unsure whether China is looking to settle the issue quickly. The talks are expected to last less than a week. Beijing was given details by the Hong Kong government more than three months ago but has still not communicated its view on the financing of all aspects of the project. The British team is led by Sir John Coles, deputy under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office, who is acting as the personal emissary of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Major agreed the talks with Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, during discussions at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last month. Discussions so far have centred on a rail link between the airport and urban areas of the colony, but the Chinese have not yet discussed the airport. The cost of the railway has risen from HKDollars 12.5bn to HKDollars 22.2bn, in March 1991 prices, and Beijing doubts the government's ability to control its cost. Beijing has also expressed doubts about a form of guarantee, known as 'callable equity', which the Hong Kong government wants to give the two main public corporations responsible for the project. This equity can be called if the projects get in trouble, but Beijing regards it as a potential burden on the post-1997 government of the colony. Discussions about financing offer China its last opportunity to exercise political leverage on this issue. British officials are seriously worried that the Chinese government will link its consent on financing to political developments in Hong Kong. Approval might then be delayed for months as Mr Chris Patten, the governor designate, is not expected to make any big political changes until the autumn. Such a delay could threaten the undertaking Britain gave last September to finish the project before June 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong reverts to China. It could also undermine the international financial community's readiness to lend the project money. The government needs China's consent before the local legislature rises for its summer recess towards the end of this month. The finance committee of the legislature has to approve the financing before the Provisional Airport Authority can let a contract to construct the platform for the airport. The PAA wants to do this in early August.</p>

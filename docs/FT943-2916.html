			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: German stake to cost T&amp;N Pounds 118m T&amp;N, the UK automotive components group, said yesterday that it would pay up to DM282.6m (Pounds 117.7m) to acquire a 52.5 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt, a leading German motor components producer. The deal must be approved by the competition authorities in the US, Germany, France and the UK. If it goes ahead, it will make T&amp;N one of the world's leading producers of engine pistons, vying for the number one position with Mahle of Germany. In bearings it will rival Federal Mogul of the US for world leadership. According to the terms of the deal disclosed yesterday the UK group has acquired options to purchase up to 1.413m shares in Kolbenschmidt representing 52.5 per cent of the equity. T&amp;N said that a 24.99 per cent stake in Kolbenschmidt had been acquired by Commerzbank on its behalf for DM124.4m. This stake will be held by the German bank at T&amp;N's risk with the UK group taking any loss or gain, if the holding has to be sold in the event of the deal not going ahead. Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals, mining and engineering group, is selling its 47 per cent holding in Kolbenschmidt, while Magna International, the Canadian automotive components group, is reducing its stake from 12.5 to 2.5 per cent. German institutional investors will take over 32 per cent of the Kolbenschmidt shares, with T&amp;N holding options on the majority of this stake representing 25.01 per cent of the Kolbenschmidt equity. It addition it has an option to take over Magna's remaining 2.5 per cent. Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition of a majority holding in Kolbenschmidt would make T&amp;N into 'the most innovative and competitive supplier of automotive pistons and bearings in the world'. It would greatly strengthen the group's position in the pistons market in Germany, the biggest vehicle-producing country in Europe and where T&amp;N had been weak, and it would take it for the first time into the Brazilian market, which has been growing rapidly in the last two years. Kolbenschmidt designs and manufactures a wide range of diesel and petrol engine pistons, plain bearings and bushes. It also produces oil and water pumps and aluminium castings. In the year to the end of September 1993 it made a pre-tax loss of DM124m on a turnover, excluding businesses since sold, of DM1.2bn. Mr Hope said that T&amp;N group turnover next year would exceed Pounds 2.5bn, if the deal goes ahead as planned by January.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Russia enlists Goldman Sachs to attract cash THE Russian government yes-terday announced it had hired Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, as an adviser to help attract badly needed foreign investment to Russia. Mr Robert Rubin, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, said he saw the bank's main contribution as persuading companies around the world to invest in Russia. It would also give advice on attracting venture capital to the republic. Illustrating the dramatic turn of Russian economic policy, the US advisers will occupy office space in the building which used to accommodate Gosplan, the now defunct state planning agency. Mr Rubin said that Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister, had asked Goldman Sachs to help identify a 'relatively small number of realistic projects' in key areas such as natural resources, consumer goods, and food processing, and to see them through as quickly as possible. Mr Leonid Grigoriev, chairman of the government's Foreign Investment Committee, declined to specify how Goldman Sachs would be paid for its services. But it is probable that the bank, which will benefit from free publicity as well as direct access to the government and its secrets, will not be getting cash. Mr Grigoriev said 400 firms had competed to get the position, which was awarded to Goldman Sachs because of its 'aggressiveness'. He admitted, however, that there were a number of basic questions which Moscow would have to resolve before large-scale investment would be possible. He said the government had not yet decided whether to use a special exchange rate for foreign investors in the privatisation of state property. An alternative, to prevent Russian investors from being squeezed out of the race, was to limit the number of assets offered to foreigners. But until one or other method was chosen, investors could not take part in the privatisation process. He also could not say when President Boris Yeltsin would sign a long-awaited decree on mineral rights and concessions to foreigners in the oil industry. Although he said the committee would be pressing for new benefits to encourage investment, the government was divided over whether to grant special tax exemptions at a time when its key priority was to balance the budget and strengthen the rouble.</p>

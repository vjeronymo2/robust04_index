			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Algerian Fraternity in France, which is  considered to be very close to the Islamic Salvation Front, has  strongly condemned the killing in Algeria of two French  religious figures. For officials of the fraternity, this double  killing is probably the work of the enemies of Algeria. It is  provocation.    It is the case that 34 foreign nationals, including 10  French  citizens, have so far been killed in Algeria since September.  Jerome Bony and Bruno Giraudon, our special correspondents in  Algiers, report:    [Bony] People are dismayed in Algiers' Casbah after the  killing yesterday of Paule-Helene Saint-Raymond and Henri  Verges. Among those who miss the two religious figures most and  who dare to say so is the imam of the neighboring mosque:    [Begin unidentified imam recording] They were people who  helped the needy. They were on the side of the needy. Some  people needed them to fill in forms for retirement in France.  They came to see them for help. They asked them to write  letters to the social security services in France. They did  favors for everyone, both men and women, without any  distinction. Without any distinction among human beings.  [passage omitted] We are asking God ... [pauses] These people  must be exterminated with God's help. This is all I can say.  [end recording]    [Bony] Yesterday, after the killings, the Casbah district  was  cordoned off by the police and, according to information we  gathered on the ground this morning, four young people are  believed to have been arrested. More police operations are  taking place in Algiers right now, but it is impossible to say  who are those behind the double killing of Sister Paule and  Brother Henri, who will be buried here, in Algiers, soon.</p>

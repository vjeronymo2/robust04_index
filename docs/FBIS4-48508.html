			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Now that the new democratic South Africa has come  into being, other countries in southern Africa are beginning to  wonder whether the new South Africa will dominate the region  economically. Already a lot of international aid has been  pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600  million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with  its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries  most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid.  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state  visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now  competing with South Africa for international aid.    [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable,  and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South  Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are  also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we  have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say  that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than  South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and  progress than South Africa because of the problems they have  had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that  needed advantage.    [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe  -- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the  continued prosperity of the country?    [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming,  and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just  more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need  greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete.  So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the  commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to  affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no  other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white  commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe.    [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of  the equitable redistribution of land?    [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must  come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the  peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement  of their economic position.    [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white  population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your  message to the white people in South Africa?    [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why  community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have  reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela  has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and  national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and  I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way,  reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the  majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to  enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there  will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in  South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of  retributions in the future -- if this happened.

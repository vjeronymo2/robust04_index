On December 31, 1998, B's adjusted basis in the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument and the adjusted issue price of the debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are increased by the $125.54 total daily portions of interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in income under the modified projected payment schedule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reduced by $300, the amount of the fixed payment on December  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31, 1998, that is reflected on the modified projected payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Timing contingencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph (b)(9)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides rules for debt instruments that have both payments that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are contingent as to time and payments that are contingent as to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of certain options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a taxpayer has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option to put or call the debt instrument, to exchange the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument for other property, or to extend the maturity date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the debt instrument, the projected payment schedule is determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by using the principles of &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5). If an option to put,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> call, or exchange the debt instrument is assumed to be exercised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the principles of &sect;1.1272&hyph;1(c)(5), it is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable to assume that the option is exercised immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it expires. If the option is exercised at an earlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, the exercise is treated as a sale or exchange of the debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other timing contingencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of deductions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of &sect;1.861&hyph;8,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any amount treated as an ordinary loss under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(6)(iii)(B) or (b)(8)(ii) of this section is considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction that is definitely related to the class of gross income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to which interest on the relevant debt instrument belongs. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other deduction or loss relating to the debt instrument will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the general rules of &sect;1.861&hyph;8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special rule when all contingent payments become fixed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining contingent payments on a debt instrument become fixed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially contemporaneously, any positive or negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment on the instrument is spread over the remaining term of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the instrument in a reasonable manner.

For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, paragraph (c) of this section generally applies to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payment debt instrument that is issued for nonpublicly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traded property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separation into components. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the case of a debt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instrument subject to paragraph (c) of this section (the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt instrument), the noncontingent payments and any quotable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent payments (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section) are subject to the rules in paragraph (c)(3) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, and the nonquotable contingent payments (as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) are accounted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately under the rules in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of noncontingent and quotable contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The noncontingent payments and any quotable contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments are treated as a separate debt instrument. The issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of the separate debt instrument is the issue price of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall debt instrument, determined under &sect;1.1274&hyph;2. No interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments on the separate debt instrument are qualified stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest payments (within the meaning of &sect;1.1273&hyph;1(c)) and the de  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimis rules of section 1273(a)(3) and &sect;1.1273&hyph;1(d) do not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the separate debt instrument. If the separate debt instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for a quotable contingent payment, the rules of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (b) of this section apply to the instrument,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of nonquotable contingent payments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, the portion of a nonquotable contingent payment treated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as interest under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includible in gross income by the holder and deductible from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gross income by the issuer in their respective taxable years in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the amount of the payment becomes fixed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Recharacterization of certain nonquotable contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Amount treated as principal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonquotable contingent payment is treated as a payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal in an amount equal to the present value of the payment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by discounting the payment at the test rate from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed to the issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date.

This separate debt instrument is treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a debt instrument to which section 1274 applies. The stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal amount of this separate debt instrument is the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the payment that becomes fixed. An amount equal to the issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price of this debt instrument is characterized as interest or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal under the rules of paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accounted for under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if this amount had been paid by the issuer to the holder on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed. To determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue price of the separate debt instrument, all payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the separate debt instrument are discounted at the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate from the maturity date of the separate debt instrument to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date that the amount of the payment becomes fixed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of a contingent payment is treated as fixed even if, once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed, the payment is payable in the future together with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest that is subject to further contingencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> A SHORTAGE OF JOCKEYS HITS TRACK  </P> <P> The way jockeys were becoming increasingly scarce Wednesday, George Taniguchi  and Emile Ohayon probably thought they might be pressed into service at  Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Neither the long-retired Taniguchi, now a paddock judge at the track, nor  Ohayon, the press box mutuel clerk, saw action, but a lot of unfamiliar names  popped up on the day's card.  </P> <P> By the end of the afternoon, six of the eight leading riders were absent for  one reason or another.  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye and Gary Stevens, 1-2 in the standings heading into the  final week, are on mini-vacations, awaiting Santa Anita's opening Tuesday.  </P> <P> Chris McCarron, who is seventh, called in sick Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Alex Solis, sixth among the riders, stayed home because he was concerned about  family and friends in his native Panama.  </P> <P> Apprentice Corey Nakatani, tied for third place with Laffit Pincay, missed most  of the program after being dumped in a gruesome incident in the third race.  Hammerin' Hank, a 2-year-old making his first start on the turf, suddenly  veered into the rail near the three-eighths pole. Failing in his attempt to  jump the fence, the Gold Stage colt severed his right front leg and bled to  death.  </P> <P> Nakatani was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays of his  left knee were negative. He could return today, according to Dr. Robert Kerlan.  </P> <P> Robbie Davis, who rode the longshot winner in the third, Short Timer, asked to  be taken off the remainder of his mounts.  </P> <P> McCarron lost three winning mounts through his absence. Aaron Gryder, recently  returned to the Southland, picked up one, Peppy's Kingdom in the second race,  and Pincay got two -- favorites Snow Perch in the fifth and Sumthing Rare in  the ninth.  </P> <P> Solis forfeited Short Timer, and George Almeida replaced Davis on Oh Sweet  Thing, who rallied to take the sixth.  </P> <P> Even if Nakatani comes back today, he'd have to finish with a rush to wrest the  Hollywood Park jockey title from Delahoussaye.  </P> <P> The Covina-born teen-ager would need nine victories in the final four days to  pass Delahoussaye, who was also the top rider at Del Mar and Santa Anita's Oak  Tree meeting.  </P> <P> While the local title would be a definite boost for Nakatani, he has another  objective in mind these days -- specifically, the Eclipse Award for  apprentices. Riding against the nation's deepest and strongest colony, he has  held his own, but whether he has the numbers to impress enough voters remains  to be seen.  </P> <P> His 106 winners this year places Nakatani well down the list among apprentices.  Unofficially, however, he leads in terms of money won, having passed  Maryland-based Mike Luzzi, who has the most victories.  </P> <P> With the Eclipse election under way, Luzzi would have to be considered the  favorite, primarily because he's more familiar back East, where the majority of  the voters reside.  </P> <P> In 1986, Corey Black's mounts earned roughly $1 million more, but Allen Stacy,  another Eastern-based apprentice, had more wins and walked off with the  Eclipse.  </P> <P> "To win the Eclipse is my main goal," said Nakatani, who will keep his  five-pound weight allowance until the end of Santa Anita's meeting next April.  "I think I have a good chance. I know it's going to be difficult, but I think  this is probably the toughest circuit in America and the toughest place to  break in."  </P> <P> What has helped Nakatani establish himself is having Tony Matos, Pincay's  longtime partner, as his agent. And Pincay, too, has been a positive factor.  </P> <P> "To me, Laffit is the best rider, and I've always liked his style," Nakatani  said. "He was my idol. I've got to credit a lot of my success to him. He's  really helped me in a lot of ways."  </P> <P> A wrestler in high school, Nakatani became infatuated with his current sport  when he visited Santa Anita one morning with his father.  </P> <P> "I went to watch the workouts with him when I was 15 and I told him I wanted to  (be a jockey)," he said. "I said I could do that."  </P> <P> After attending a jockeys' school and working horses at Galway Downs, Nakatani  rode his first race during the 1988 Del Mar season, while spending weekends at  Caliente to gain experience, then came to Santa Anita last winter.  </P> <P> He picked up his first win in the big leagues March 16 on 15-1 shot Silver  Sabina.  </P> <P> "The feeling is something that is hard to explain," he said. "It just felt so  good to win a race at Santa Anita against this kind of competition.  </P> <P> "I still have a lot to learn and I still have some improving to do, but I have  confidence in my talent. Riding against these guys, I learn a lot, and they are  willing to help you."  </P> <P> Pincay said Nakatani, 19, "reminds me of me when I started," adding: "He looks  a little like I did on a horse.  </P> <P> "The most impressive thing about Corey is his desire. He wants to win and he'll  do anything to win a race. He's strong and he doesn't give up on horses. I  think he's going to do some good."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Oh Sweet Thing's victory enabled David Hofmans to regain the lead in the  trainers' standings. He has 10 wins, one more than John Sadler and Ron  McAnally. . . . Laconda, who was almost scratched, won the $32,000 feature,  beating stablemate Trick Question by 1 1/4 lengths in the 1 1/8-mile race.  Ridden by Russell Baze, who had two victories, Laconda returned $16.20 to win  and provided trainer Gary Jones with his seventh victory of the meeting. . . .  Apprentice jockey Jesus Castanon was also absent. Like Gary Stevens and Eddie  Delahoussaye, he elected to take some time off for the holidays. . . . There is  a Pick Six carryover for today of $59,193.15.  </P></p>

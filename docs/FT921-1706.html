			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (11): The losses mount up - Norway: Banks have been doing badly LAST YEAR Christiania Bank, Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, Norway's top three commercial banks, posted combined net losses of NKr16bn, a four-fold increase on 1990. Combined losses on loans and guarantees shot up to NKr13.35bn from NKr8bn, as net interest income dipped to NKr8.58bn from NKr9.56bn. However, last year's losses were not restricted to commercial banks. The savings banks sustained losses on loans and guarantees in 1991 of NKr4.17bn, or 2.07 per cent of assets, compared with NKr4.54bn in 1990 and NKr4.75bn in 1989. Combined savings banks' operating losses rose to NKr1.96bn last year, or 0.97 per cent of assets, from NKr1.08bn in 1990 and NKr580m in 1989. Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, saw net losses increase by NKr188m to NKr806m. Although loan losses were reduced by NKr123m to NKr1.54bn, non-performing loans swelled to NKr3bn from NKr2.3bn, representing a loss of NKr100m in interest income alone. The state-backed Bank Investment Fund - which is different from the state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) - agreed to invest NKr700m in a convertible bond as part of a deal in which Sparebanken Nor will acquire Sparebank Kreditt, a mortgage company. This is the Investment Fund's first placement since it was set up last autumn. Separate plans call for the Investment Fund to guarantee full subscription of a preferential share issue to be launched by DnB as part of a deal in which it acquired Realkreditt, a mortgage group. The commercial banks face new problems as well as lingering ones such as soaring costs and dwindling earnings. In a long uphill struggle to improve earnings, they have suffered draconian demands from the state, their new owner, as they are under-capitalised in an over-banked market. Some of the difficulties, however, are more of a psychological nature, arising out of their new 'national' status. There is a trend for customers to be less willing to service loans after the state last year transferred large sums of money - about 1 per cent of mainland GDP - to prop up the banks. According to Mr Tormod Hermansen, chief of BIF, with the knowledge that the state has injected taxpayers' money into the banking system, customers think they may be paying for the banks' sins twice. Another problem - which the banks can do little to influence - is the structure of the industry. Until now there has been muted political discussion about this. 'Norway's policy. . . is based on an implicit commitment to maintain three big commercial banks. This policy is 10 years old and outdated,' one banker points out. Some banks would like a political consensus allowing one or two strong banks to emerge with agreement on market share based on an implicit understanding that foreign competition will increase in the 1990s. The Norwegian Banks' Association estimates that if a joint giro payment system was used by the commercial banks, savings banks and the post-savings bank, annual savings of NKr1.5bn could be achieved. In the meantime, the banks' earnings potential continues to be obstructed by the effects of Norway's recessionary economy. Unemployment, including those on government training schemes, is nearly 9 per cent, a post-war record, and there are bankruptcies, commercial and private, continue to set new records. Commercial bankruptcies rose by 29 per cent in 1991. The value of real estate, the main source of the banks' collateral for loans, has dropped in the past five years by an estimated 40 per cent, forcing the banks to make big write-offs against accounts. During 1987-91, housing investment was halved as households struggled to reduce indebtedness. Fixed investment in the mainland economy since 1987 has plunged by 35 per cent. The Central Bureau of Statistics sees 1.6 per cent growth in mainland economy GDP this year while investments may rise 7 per cent by 1993, from minus 2 per cent in 1991-92. According to Christiania Bank, a further decrease in investment in commercial property is expected in 1992, but by 1993 the fall may level off. The top three are also struggling to stem continuous rises in non-performing loans, which reached NKr25.8bn by the end of last year, up NKr2.6bn since the end of 1990. The banks have general loan loss reserve funds called 'en bloc' funds. For the three banks, at the end of 1991, combined loan loss reserve funds were NKr6bn, compared with NKr4.1bn at the end of 1990. However, in terms of capital adequacy there is no legal Norwegian definition of the reserves to determine whether they count as core capital, tier capital or if they are neutral. 'If these reserves are included in defining the capital adequacy of the bank, it would overstate the solidity of the banks,' says one banker. Norway's banking system saw state transfers of close to NKr20bn last year, but the banks need additional capital. Fokus Bank says that it expects the BIF to provide fresh support in 1992 while Christiania Bank estimates it needs NKr2.5bn just to meet new capital adequacy requirements. Analysts believe the bank would be better off if it got more than NKr5bn. Further state transfers of between NKr5-10bn are not being ruled out for the ailing banks. But DnB says that it has no plans to make a new call on the BIF. In the struggle to reduce costs, the three banks have cut 3,436 jobs since 1989 to a total of 13,292. In the last three years operating costs by the three amounted to NKr31bn. DnB is the only one of the three which has managed to reduce operating costs. Since 1989 these have fallen by NKr870m to NKr4.97bn at the end of last year. Christiania's costs rose by NKr700m in the period while Fokus saw a NKr290m increase. Mr Hermansen believes it may take up to four years before the banks make sufficient earnings to service their equity capital on a stable basis. By that time they will face a new competitor; this year the government plans to establish a post bank.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our guidelines consist of the following steps: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step 1_Policy Information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency obtains information on all group health plans available to the Medicaid recipient. The Medicaid recipient is responsible for providing the State with all the necessary plan information and reporting changes with respect to plan benefits. This information must include the effective date of the policy, any exclusions to enrollment, the services covered under the policy, the employee's share of premiums paid to the health plan and other costs that may be necessary for enrollment in the plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step 2_Average Medicaid Costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), the agency obtains the average total annual Medicaid costs of persons having characteristics similar to the applicant (age, sex, categorical group and geographic data). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step 3_Medicaid Costs for Included Services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency determines the amount of the total yearly Medicaid expenditures for services covered by the specific group health policy. Compute the percentage of expenditures for group health plan services to expenditures for Medicaid services. Then adjust the average total annual Medicaid costs specified in step 2 by this percentage. This is the ``Medicaid average covered expense amount.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step 4_Group Health Plan Costs for Included Services.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency adjusts the Medicaid average covered expense amount (amount calculated in step 3) for the higher prices employer plans typically pay. The agency may use a single State-specific factor derived from experience with third party liability (TPL) claims or use group health plan specific information. Alternatively, the agency may use a national average factor which HCFA supplies and updates periodically. The Medicaid covered expense is multiplied by this factor to produce an estimated covered expense as recognized by the employer health plan. This is the ``health plan cost.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Step 5_Adjustment for Coinsurance and Deductible Amounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The health plan cost (amount from step 4) is multiplied by an average employer health insurance payment rate to obtain the ``employer recognized covered expense'' amount. The agency derives the average employer health insurance payment rate from State specific tables, if available, or group health plan specific information. Alternatively, for State agency use, HCFA supplies and periodically updates national tables. This health insurance average payment rate number will vary in relation to the amount of the average employer recognized covered expense.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Sicilian bank chief quits Mr Guido Savignone, chairman of the Banco di Sicilia, the island's leading financial institution, has resigned following sharp criticism of the management by the Italian Treasury, writes Robert Graham. The attack on the failure of management to improve results after a shake-up two years ago represents a significant toughening in the authorities' attitudes towards financial instititutions in which the state has stakes. The Treasury has 14 per cent of Banco di Sicilia, the remainder being held by a foundation controlled by the regional government. The bank is understood to have just balanced its books in 1992 but risks a loss this year. Some L3,000bn (Pounds 1.24bn) of bad loans are reported.</p>

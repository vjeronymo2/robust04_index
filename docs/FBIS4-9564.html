			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gjorgji Ristevski: "Liberation From Myths and </F> Illusions"]    [Text] Sofia, 27 April -- "I am very satisfied and it was  not by pure chance when I said that the visit of President Kiro  Gligorov to Bulgaria was of a historic nature. Not because it  is the first official visit, but because it represents the end  of a period in the relations between Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Bulgaria, and the  beginning of a new one." At a news conference held yesterday  afternoon, these were the words with which the President of the  Republic of Bulgaria Zelyu Zhelev assessed the visit and the  discussions held with President Gligorov.    "This is our fourth meeting and my feeling is that we can  urge the promotion of relations between the two countries. The  Republic of Macedonia, as an independent country, has proven to  be a condition for the stability in the Balkans. Macedonia is  opposed to any alliances or prominences, because they can lead  to new divisions in the Balkans. The Balkans are mixed, so we  must respect each other and must not allow constant repetitions  of Balkan wars, which brought nothing good to any of the  nations." This is how President Kiro Gligorov assessed his  first official visit to Bulgaria at yesterday's news conference.    In front of hundreds of journalists, the two presidents  answered a number of "ticklish" questions, such as what was the  number of Bulgarians in Macedonia. President Kiro Gligorov  replied that, according to the last census, around 3,000 persons  declared themselves as Bulgarians, but Macedonia will soon have  a census under an international control, and that it was in our  own interest to know who lives in Macedonia and in what number.  A similar question was asked of Bulgarian President Zhelyu  Zhelev, to which he replied that according to the last census  around 7,000 persons declared themselves Macedonians, and only  600-700 did not state their mother tongue was Bulgarian.    There were several questions concerning the non-signed  agreements between the two states. The dispute came out when  Macedonia refused to sign the documents which said that the  "documents will be signed in the official languages of the two  states," because the Macedonian side considered it should be  stated that the agreements would be signed in Macedonian and  Bulgarian.    The documents are to be signed in the official languages of  the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria.  Therefore, in two languages. "Our side insisted on accepting  this formulation," President Zhelyu Zhelev said, adding that the  languages are a reality and that there should be no obstacles in  promoting the relations.    "If we think of a language in different formulations, it is  a  problem of great concern. We cannot sign anything that is not  written in our own language, because the language is a part of  the identity of a nation. We should not go back to the past, we  should go to the reality instead, and the language in which the  documents will be signed is one of the questions. I believe  that democratic Bulgaria will soon take off that issue from the  agenda," President Kiro Gligorov said.    After the afternoon news conference and the solemn farewell  at the "Boyana" Residence, the two-day official visit of the  Macedonian president to the Republic of Bulgaria was  accomplished. In the morning President Gligorov visited the  Embassy of the Republic of Macedonia in Sofia and held  discussions with some Macedonian representatives in Sofia.    The working part of the visit continued also in the  afternoon. President Gligorov met Mr. Evgeni Matinchev, deputy  prime minister of the Republic of Bulgaria, with whom he  discussed the agreements that are expected to be signed soon.  First of all, the agreements are related to the railroad links  between the two states, the economic and cultural cooperation  between the two countries. On the other hand, according to the  protocol, President Gligorov was supposed to meet Prime Minister  Lyuben Berov; however, this visit was canceled due to sickness.  After the discussions, the deputy prime minister and his wife  organized lunch for the Macedonian president, and in the  afternoon President Gligorov addressed the delegates of the  Bulgarian National Assembly, which was broadcast by radio and  television. The delegates and the numerous diplomatic  representatives greeted the arrival of President Kiro Gligorov  in the Parliament with loud applause.    After the introductory speech of the Bulgarian Chairman of  Parliament Yordanov, President Gligorov addressed the Bulgarian  parliamentarians.    "Today we all share the responsibility of taking history as  a  guide, and using our own and other people's experiences to the  maximum. It is indispensable for us to learn the lesson about  living our own lives, but all of us near each other. I firmly  believe that the conscious commitment to coexistence and mutual  confidence can be the key to peace and stability in the Balkans.  It is particularly important to abide by the principles of  respect for the existing borders between the states, of respect  for the rights of minorities, and to solve all problems through  political and peaceful means. We managed to contribute to peace  and stability in the region. We are convinced it is of real  interest to other nations, too, including the Bulgarian people  and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria," President  Gligorov said.    In his speech Gligorov reviewed the infrastructural  connection with the East-West axis. "We consider that action,"  Gligorov said, "for which purpose financial means from  Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Turkey and Italy have already been  engaged, as an investment for the future and as an outline for  the development of the whole region of southeast Europe."    Toward the end of his speech, Gligorov also reviewed the  relations among the Balkan countries and nations. Recalling the  historical complexity in their relations, Gligorov emphasized:  ``It is also filled with many conflicts and misunderstandings,  often for and about Macedonia.    Unfortunately, some have still been maintained in some  areas. However, some of the illusions covered with crust are  being destroyed. We would like, and would be very happy, if  that became the prevailing opinion in the Balkans, so as to  liberate this region from the historical illnesses and myths  once and for all. We must construct mutual confidence on a  long-term and responsible basis as an indispensable premise for  any agreement, as the key which will eliminate, on a long-term  plan, all roots of conflicts and instability in the mutual  relations throughout the region.''  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Reactions in the Bulgarian Media </H5>   All Bulgarian newspapers and the radio and television of our  eastern neighbor gave great publicity to the two-day official  visit of Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. The  distinguished STANDARD assessed yesterday that "Gligorov and  Zhelev decided to put an end to the political dispute,"  explaining the importance of the information that the Macedonian  president provoked a great interest not only with the Bulgarian  and Macedonian journalists, but also with the numerous  detachments of Greek and other foreign journalists following  this visit.    Nearly all reports pointed out the "misunderstanding about  the use of the languages" for which the Bulgarian side still  claims that the interstate agreements should be signed in the  "official languages of the two countries." The newspaper 24  CHASA, with a large circulation, went farthest in assessing the  visit of Kiro Gligorov to Sofia, saying: "The language scandal  between the two countries continues."</p>

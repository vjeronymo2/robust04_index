			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls suggest Labour is increasing lead in marginals THE FIRST full week of the election campaign was dominated by the tax issue. Conservative strategists believed the March 10 Budget would reinforce their image as the 'low tax' party. Meanwhile Labour claimed that eight out of 10 families would benefit from the shadow Budget of Mr John Smith. During that week, Financial Times reporters visited Davyhulme in Manchester, Birmingham Hall Green and Brentford &amp; Isleworth in London - three socially typical Tory-held marginal seats in the regions where the election will be determined. This week, they have returned to those constituencies to gauge the impact of the campaign upon the electorate. The three regions - north-west England, the Midlands and London  - contain 65 of the 94 Conservative-held seats that the Labour party probably needs to win to gain an overall majority at Westminster. The regional breakdown of the opinion poll carried out last week for the Press Association by ICM with 10,000 voters - the largest sample used during the campaign - suggests that Labour will capture Birmingham Hall Green and is close to winning Brent-ford &amp; Isleworth and Davyhulme. A Gallup 9,000 poll, carried out between February 19 and March 17 as the campaign opened, gave the Labour party a 1 per cent national lead. The ICM poll for the Press Association finds Labour's lead up to 2.5 percentage points. Labour seems to be picking up the extra support in the right places. The two polls found a broadly similar swing to Labour (6 per cent and 7 per cent) in London, but the ICM/Press Association poll suggests an increasing swing to Labour in both the Midlands and the north-west as the campaign has progressed. Polls have shown tax far behind the National Health Service, education and the economy in terms of issues which are important to voters. However, Conservative managers insist that - regardless of what the pollsters are told - electors will vote with their wallets once in the privacy of the booth. The psephologists call this 'pocket-book voting'. As the campaign draws to a close, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has returned to the theme of tax and insisted that only a Conservative government will end the recession. The polls still show a Conservative lead on 'ability to manage the economy' and as the party under which people feel they will be best off financially. How do voters respond in the crucial seats?</p>

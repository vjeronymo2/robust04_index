			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Packer finds his investors obliging 'Anyone know any good jokes?' quipped Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman, as yesterday's unquestioning acceptance by shareholders of a plan to merge his two publicly-quoted media companies into a ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.47bn) combined group necessitated a lull in formal proceedings. The complex series of shareholder votes had been scheduled at appropriate intervals to allow for discussion. So obliging were the investors in Australian Consolidated Press, the Packer-controlled magazines business, and Nine Network Australia, which runs Australia's leading commercial TV network, that business from one meeting was completed early, and shareholders left to twiddle their thumbs before the next could start. Under the circumstances, Mr Packer's cheeriness was scarely surprising. By the end of the day, he had won approvals from ACP and Nine shareholders for the creation of a new three-pronged media group, and now requires only court sanction for the transaction to go ahead. With the deal being effected by a share swap arrangement, Consolidated Press, the private Packer company, will emerge with a 45.7 per cent interest in the new group - to be known as Publishing and Broadcasting  - in contrast to its 47.9 per cent stake in ACP and 44.5 per cent of NNA. Mr Packer will become chairman of the new entity, with Mr Brian Powers, managing director of ConsPress, taking on the same role at P &amp; B as well. The new group will be made up of three divisions: television, magazines, investments (this will include Nine's interest in John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper publisher, and the potential stake in Optus, the telecommunications group). P &amp; B is likely to have a market capitalisation above ADollars 2bn, revenues of more than ADollars 1bn, shareholder funds of ADollars 1.7bn, and immediate borrowing facilities of ADollars 1.3bn. All this, it is argued, will make acquisitions much easier. The deal will also take some immediate pressure off the magazine interests, which have been battling against highly-competitive conditions. The big question is what acquisitions the merged group will pursue. The prospectuses make clear that on the magazine front, the focus will be on Asia, where ACP has already picked up a stake in the Vietnam Investment Review, rather than the more mature Australasian markets. Nine, meanwhile, has already been edging into the multimedia industry. Aside from the Optus connection, for example, it has joined forces with Village Roadshow, a cinemas group, to run 'out-of-home' entertainment centres, including indoor theme parks in shopping centres across Australia. Nine was also one of the vehicles through which Mr Packer pursued his abortive bid to build Sydney's new casino. The price, for ACP shareholders, will be some dilution of earnings per share, but Nine's stronger growth prospects mean that it is already more highly rated, and if the acquisition opportunities look good enough, the shares of the new company should trade on a higher multiple that those of ACP. Such thoughts, at least, seemed to be buying peace from shareholders yesterday.</p>

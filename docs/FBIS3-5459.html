South-North  trade fell by 34.1 percent to 12,578,000 U.S. dollars last month  from a year earlier. The drop was attributed to a 49.8-percent  decrease in South Korean purchases of metals, including gold and  zinc ingots, from the North compared to a year ago. However,  South Korea's sale to the North soared, although the figure was  still low compared to purchase. The South sold about 699,000  dollars worth of goods to the North last month, compared to  43,000 dollars the year before, thanks to increased shipments of  textiles and raw and subsidiary materials for "processing on  commission trade."</p>

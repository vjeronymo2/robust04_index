			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to clarify the availability of pesticide record information to facilitate medical treatment, USDA proposes to amend &sect;110.5(a) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> When a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, determines that any record of the application of restricted use pesticide required to be maintained under &sect;110.3 of this part is necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual who may have been exposed to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is or will be maintained, the certified applicator required to maintain the record shall promptly provide the record information and any available label information. If it is determined by a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, to be a medical emergency, the record information of the restricted use pesticide, relating to the medical emergency, shall be provided immediately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.5(b)_Release of Record Information by licensed Health Care Professionals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the current regulations, licensed health care professionals may release record information obtained through &sect;110.5(a) only when necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual who may have been exposed to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is maintained. Concerns were raised that some confusion could exist among licensed health care professionals as to the extent to which they could share or utilize pesticide record information. Concerns were expressed that licensed health care professionals, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, could be reluctant to release pesticide record information to other medical professionals, who may need to be consulted, to provide proper medical treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues also were raised concerning the release of the record information as it relates to pesticide poisoning incident reports, and the need to assure licensed health care professionals that they could release pesticide record information for this purpose. Some States require pesticide poisoning incident reporting to a designated State or county agency. For example, California has a law that requires physicians to submit a pesticide poisoning incident report to the California Worker Health and Safety Division. Additionally, in States which do not require the filing of a pesticide poisoning incident report, physicians or other medical professionals are encouraged to report incidents to the local poison control centers. These local poison control centers then may send data to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) database, which provides an annual compilation of poisoning statistics from around the United States. USDA believes the release of pesticide record information for this purpose is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USDA also recognizes that a licensed health care professional may deem it necessary under their responsibility to a code of medical ethics to utilize pesticide record information to prevent additional poisoning or injuries. For example, as a result of treating an individual who had been exposed to a federally restricted use pesticide, the licensed health care professional may feel it necessary to release the record information to the proper State or county authorities in order to remove workers from an area where pesticide exposure could be occurring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in order to clarify the circumstances under which the federally restricted use pesticide information can be utilized and released, and who has authority to release this information, USDA proposes to amend &sect;110.5(b) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional, may utilize and release record or record information obtained under paragraph (a) of this section when necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual or individuals who may have been exposed to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is or will be maintained. Further utilization and release of such record or record information is limited to licensed health care professionals who may use it: (1) To submit pesticide poisoning incident reports to appropriate State or Federal agencies, or (2) where consideration of medical ethics may necessitate such utilization and release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> To all the people who worked on "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue," the  anti-drug cartoon for children, I would like to say a big thank you! My  children loved the show and learned a lot.  </P> <P> It's so nice to see everyone pulling together for the children. They are our  future. Here's to the children, for a bright and drug-free future!  </P> <P> Judy Ingels, Culver City  </P></p>

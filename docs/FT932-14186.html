			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Chrysler returns to black on strong new model sales CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer which is bouncing back from financial difficulties, yesterday underscored the success of its new model introductions by reporting first-quarter earnings of Dollars 530m, excluding accounting changes. The profits compared with a loss of Dollars 231m, excluding special factors, in the same period of last year, and were struck on sales and revenues up 33 per cent to Dollars 10.9bn from Dollars 8.19bn. While the US vehicle market has been recovering only gradually from recession, Chrysler's sales and market share have been rocketing due to the introduction of several boldly-styled new vehicles, including its LH series of full-sized cars. The company's share of the US new vehicle market rose 2.5 percentage points in the quarter to 15.5 per cent, while its sales volume rose 24.2 per cent. First-quarter earnings per share totalled Dollars 1.57 before accounting changes, ahead of the Wall Street consensus forecast, yet the company's shares dipped Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 42 on the New York stock exchange. Mr David Healy, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities, said the share price reaction was a 'bit of a mystery' in view of the results and was probably due to profit-taking by investors. A contributory factor could have been confirmation by Chrysler that its plants would be affected by a lot of model changes in the third quarter. The company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 4.15bn, or Dollars 12.81 a share, after taking a one-time non-cash charge of Dollars 4.7bn for a change in its methods of accounting for retirees' health benefits. However, it warned Wall Street of the size of this charge at the start of April. Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported first-quarter earnings of Dollars 37m before a one-time Dollars 29m charge for the same accounting changes. That compared to Dollars 60m of earnings in the first quarter of last year before a Dollars 51m gain from changes in new accounting standards for taxes. Chrysler Financial said the figures had been hit by higher borrowing costs and lower levels of non-automotive assets, partly offset by lower credit loss provisions. In the first quarter of last year, the Chrysler group reported a net loss of Dollars 13m, or 7 cents a share, after a one-time gain of Dollars 218m for new tax accounting methods, a gain of Dollars 88m from a sale of shares in Mitsubishi Motors, and a Dollars 63m loss on investments.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark slightly weaker The D-Mark weakened slightly against some of the currencies in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, with the French franc and Danish krone hitting new highs since the ERM's revamp last summer, writes Conner Middelmann. The German currency has been easing on expectations of more domestic interest rate cuts, as well as unwinding of long D-Mark positions against short positions in other ERM currencies. 'Most of the price action has been driven by position adjustments rather than by real fund flows,' said Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets. Germany's call money rate eased again amid ample money market liquidity, slipping to around 6 per cent, from some 6.07 per cent on Wednesday. The three-month Euromark future edged ahead 0.01 point to 93.91. The downward revision of western Germany's November inflation rate had little impact, although traders said it added to the D-Mark's softer tone. Month-on-month inflation was 0.2 per cent, with the year-on-year rate at 3.6 per cent. That was below the 0.3 per cent and 3.7 per cent preliminary rates initially published. Denmark's stocks, bonds and currency were buoyed by comments from Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the governor of the Danish central bank. In an interview with the Danish financial daily Boersen, he said he saw the present strength of the krone as paving the way for more rate cuts. He was also reported as saying that the central bank would test the market with a series of gradual, small rate cuts, allowing Denmark to eventually lower its rates to the German level. The Danish central bank has cut money market rates six times in the last 11 weeks. The Danish krone rose to its highest level since the ERM shake-up on August 2. After hitting an intraday high of DKr3.9040 against the D-Mark, it ended at DKr3.918, barely changed from DKr3.915 on Wednesday. The Dutch guilder set a five-year high against the D-Mark on the back of heavy foreign buying at this week's government bond tap issue, which raised Fl 11bn in three days. The guilder peaked at Fl 111.87 per DM100 before ending at Fl 111.90, unchanged from Wednesday. The currency's strength had some dealers calling for another cut in the Dutch special advances rate at the next open-market operation on Tuesday. Some traders expect to see a small rate reduction on that day, while others said the Dutch central bank could set a two-day pact expiring on Thursday to coincide with the next meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council. The French franc continued to strengthen against the D-Mark, breaching technical resistance at FFr3.4230 and approaching the key FFr3.4180 level. After reaching a high of FFr3.4193, it shed some of its gain in the afternoon and ended little changed at FFr3.427, after FFr3.424 the previous day. Subduing the franc in the afternoon were reports that the Bank of France was selling francs against the D-Mark and the dollar in a continued effort to shore up its foreign currency reserves, which were sharply depleted during last summer's currency crisis. Its latest statement for the week ending December 2 indicated that French net currency reserves rose by FFr1.8bn, putting reserves some FFr11.02bn in the black. 'That was rather less than we were hoping for,' said Chris Furness, a currency analyst at market analysis firm IDEA. Most traders do not expect the franc's recent appreciation to trigger more aggressive easing by the Bank of France. This was reflected by the March Pibor futures contract, which slipped 0.01 point to 93.50. The pound finished a slow session unchanged at DM2.5500 against the D-Mark. Money market conditions remained on the tight side, and traders said the Bank of England's market operations indicated a desire to quell market speculation of near-term rate cuts. A money trader commented: 'They are putting a small brake on by keeping liquidity tight - I am getting the impression that they do not want the market to roar ahead.' However, he does not expect any strong signals from the Bank ahead of Wednesday's data on retail price inflation and Thursday's Bundesbank meeting. The December short sterling contract eased 0.02 point to 94.67. The Bank announced a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn which was later revised to Pounds 1.9bn. In an early round, it purchased Pounds 110m of bills outright and Pounds 592m for resale to the market at a later date. In further operations, it bought a total of Pounds 655m and provided late assistance of around Pounds 550m. The US dollar edged slightly higher to end at DM1.7055, up from DM1.7050 at Wednesday's close. Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y108.65, compared with Y108.60 a day earlier. New York trading ended with the US currency at DM1.7036 and Y108.65. US producer price data had little overall affect on the currency. While the headline rate was unchanged on the month, the core rate was up 0.4 per cent, slightly above expectations but not enough to fuel speculation that the Federal Reserve would start tightening soon. Traders will be looking to today's CPI numbers for a clearer picture on US inflation.</p>

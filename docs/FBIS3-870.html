			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix arrived in  Kigali early yesterday evening leading a delegation of 13  parliamentarians and about 20 journalists. The minister  discussed his visit in an interview with (Seraphin Byiringuru):    [Begin Delcroix recording] First of all, I am here to visit  the Belgian soldiers who are members of UNAMIR [UN Assistance  Mission to Rwanda]. I came here to encourage them. This is my  first concern.    Second, I am taking the opportunity of this first visit to  make contacts with my colleagues -- my colleague at the Defense  Ministry, my colleague at the Foreign Ministry -- and to see the  president, to hold talks on the situation in the country.  [passage omitted]    You know that Rwanda is the only country with which we have  very special military cooperation. We have maintained it. We  had similar cooperation with other countries, but it was  suspended. It continued with your country, and I am happy about  this. I will try to continue with it over the coming months and  years, but there must be conditions to help me convince our  public opinion and my colleagues within the government that it  is worth continuing. That is why it is really necessary for the  situation to improve within the next few weeks. This is the  message I also want to address to your people. [end recording]</p>

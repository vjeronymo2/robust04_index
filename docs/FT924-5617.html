			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Plan for Lloyd's 'success fees' is attacked A PROPOSAL to pay 'success fees' which could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds to representatives fighting to recover losses on behalf of Lloyd's Names was strongly criticised yesterday. The 12-man committee of the Gooda Walker Action Group - which represents some 2,000 loss-making Names - is proposing it should receive 1 1/2 per cent of any legal settlement, less a contribution to legal costs. With the group seeking to recover up to Pounds 500m, some past and present members of the committee could earn over Pounds 300,000 a head if the action is successful. Mr Norbert Mallet, a Gooda Name, said yesterday: 'There is no way you can justify sums of this kind. Frankly I think it's absolutely obscene.' Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the action group chairman, said the proposal would be put to the group's annual general meeting on Monday. At present the group's rules say committee members should be unpaid. 'If group members don't like it, they can vote against it,' said Mr Doll-Steinberg, who is expected at the meeting to ask members to back legal action against Lloyd's agents. He said an 'incentive package' was needed because 'negotiations are a nerve-wracking and all-consuming process. A skilled negotiator gives his all to get the last item in a deal'. The Association of Lloyd's Members said: 'We are aware of strong objections being expressed by members.' Mr Raymond Nottage, a deputy chairman, said 'action groups are important businesses with a lot of money at stake. If you have able people, they need remuneration'. He admitted that, if the group were successful in obtaining a good settlement, the amounts that committee members might earn 'seemed large'. Over the past two years Lloyd's has recorded losses of over Pounds 2.5bn, ruining several thousand Names, the individuals who provide capital for the market. Council post, Page 6</p>

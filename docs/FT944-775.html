			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Wheelock 13% ahead at halfway stage Wheelock and Company, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir YK Pao's listed corporate empire, yesterday announced a 13 per cent rise in interim net profits, to HKDollars 1.06bn (USDollars 137m) from HKDollars 940.3m at the halfway stage last year. Profits were lifted by an exceptional gain of HKDollars 79.2m on property sales. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 52.6 cents from 46.1 cents, and shareholders are to receive an interim dividend of 10.5 cents, up 10.5 per cent from last year's 9.5 cents a share. The government's measures to curb speculation in the property market, which were implemented in June in an attempt to temper overheating home prices, were partially blamed for the relatively modest growth. Developers' inability to book profits from sales because of the lack of government pre-sale consent means units not sold will be deferred to later years. However, Wheelock believes its landbank, accumulated at a low cost relative to that prevailing in the secondary market, will ensure a good cushion of profit in future years. In addition to Hong Kong, Wheelock has about 25m sq ft of landbank in South China. Mr Peter Woo, group chairman, said the profit rise was solid when viewed against the unfavourable property and retail environments, and the fact the company has been in a building mode. He said: 'In a tough cyclical economic environment we see an opportunity to build, since the group's debt position is low. The group will continue the process of value building, recognising that expansion during the start-up years often results in marginally lower profits.' On the retail side, luxury department store group Lane Crawford saw profits slump 47 per cent to HKDollars 52.7m from HKDollars 99.2m over the six-month period. This was attributed to significant start-up costs of new stores in Hong Kong and Singapore, general weakness and over-supply in these two markets. and a wet summer in Hong Kong. Poor conditions in the retail market notwithstanding, there are plans to build Lane Crawford's franchise. About 66 per cent of the interim profits came from group associate The Wharf (Holdings), Wheelock's 44 per cent-owned associate whose interests include property, infrastructure and hotels.</p>

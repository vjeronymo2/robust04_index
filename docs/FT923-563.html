			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Battered regions escape fresh storms FRESH storms moved across southern France yesterday, leaving three people dead and several missing, AP reports from Paris. But the rains eased before reaching regions battered last week by the deadliest floods on record in France. Authorities said the worst damage from the new storms occurred in the departments of Aude and Pyrenees-Orientales, close to the eastern part of the French-Spanish border. Rivers swollen by torrential rains overflowed their banks. In the Aude village of Rennes-les-Bains the floodwaters smashed a home, killing a 65-year-old women and sweeping away two other people. Floodwaters a metre deep were reported in parts of the city of Narbonne. The national weather service had warned that severe storms could hit much of south-east France yesterday, but in most areas rain was too light to unleash any new flooding. Flash floods on Tuesday in the south-central departments of Vaucluse, Drome and Ardeche killed 38 people. Vaucluse authorities yesterday lowered their estimate of missing people from 40 to 15, saying the others had been accounted for. Officials said 150 homes in Vaucluse had been destroyed or seriously damaged, and 12 bridges washed away. An overall valuation of the damage has not been released, but insurance companies have already arranged for payments totalling about FFr980m (Pounds 112.38m).</p>

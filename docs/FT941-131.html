			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Fab Five adrift in Hamburg - Cinema BACKBEAT (15) Iain Softley KALIFORNIA (18) Dominic Sena THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA (U) Tran Anh Hung BELLE EPOQUE (15) Fernando Trueba Some films seem created entirely out of 'almosts'. Consider Backbeat. Stuart Sutcliffe was famous - or almost - as The Beatle who never was - or almost never. Ian Softley's lithe, evocative but in the end maddeningly inconsequential film recreates the Fab Four's formative visit to Hamburg in 1960 when they were the Fab Five. Sutcliffe, played accent-perfect by American Steven Dorff, was the bass player destined to be left behind in Germany. For as well as getting up the nose of Paul McCartney as a musical performer, Sutcliffe fell in love with photographer Astrid Kirchherr, played by another American Sheryl Lee. Sutcliffe had a rival career as an almost-famous painter of Jackson Pollock-ish abstracts. And to complete the misfit-genius credentials, he had a doomed kismet as a man who would die young: in April 1962, from a brain haemorrhage. Many ingredients, many flavours, but . . . what are they meant to add up to? Softley begins promisingly, with an Olympian crane shot that descends into 1960 Liverpool like a visiting god of hindsight seeking vital clues. Soon the famous ones are picked out from the Swinging Britain identity parade - John the witty, deadpan drawler (Ian Hart, looking and sounding startlingly like David Thewlis in Naked), Paul the one with vertical lift-off eyebrows (Gary Bakewell), George the scowly-handsome one hanging back from the limelight (Chris O'Neill). And Ringo? Ah, he is just a fella dropping by in Hamburg, because as all Beatlologists know Pete Best was Mr Percussion at that time. Interesting themes are picked up, looked at and then put back, as if by a high street shopper dazed with indecision. Was John Lennon bisexual? (Astrid thinks he fancies Stuart and there is much ambivalent banter between the two lads about sharing a Reeperbahn bunk bed). Was Paul or John really running the show? And did Astrid's former boyfriend Klaus, who went on to design the lads' Revolver album, also influence their mophead hairstyles? The film starts to tackle each of these questions; then it doesn't. Perhaps everyone thought it was enough for the Anglo-American market - and you see the ocean-straddling mentality in the two American leads and the easy-to-digest view of British cultural history - that the larky legends should just get up there on screen, strum their stuff for immortality and the tie-in album, and leave a few interesting bodies in their career wake. * Kalifornia gives us another, not-so-fab foursome adrift in wonderland. Imagine that you are an aspiring writer (David Duchovny) contemplating a book on serial killers. You wish to visit famous murder spots across America. But you and your photographer girlfriend (Michelle Forbes) need a ride-sharer to co-fund the trip. So you pick up this ragged, bearded Antichrist figure (Brad Pitt) with his deeply dippy girlfriend (Juliette Lewis). And what should he turn out to be? Yes: a serial killer. Just imagine all those Hollywood producers yelling 'High-concept]' at this idea. Soon the American dreamscape is crackling with menace, as the car rumbles from one famous killing ground to another and Mr Pitt's character, named 'EarlyGrayce' for symbolism addicts, graduates from petty theft to mild brutality to murder. Duchovny and Forbes should have noticed the Early warning signs. This man picks his toes through the holes in his socks; whips his girlfriend in the privacy of his own motel room; and has a Southern accent that sounds as it was bought at an Actor's Studio Halloween sale. Writer Tim Metcalfe and director Dominic Sena so load the journey with menace and inevitability that there is no room left in the boot for humanity or serendipity. Even the laughs the film extracts from Early's backwoods philosophising - 'People think quicker out there (California) 'cos of all that warm weather]' - are too arch and programmed. And when we come to the film's own final message, to the effect that Duchovny and Forbes's pseudo-scholastic prurience is bloodbrother to Early's enacted viciousness, we hear the sound of Hollywood itself dressing up blood-and-thunder in the robes of moral enlightenment. * The Scent Of Green Papaya won its Vietnamese writer-director Tran Anh Hung the Camera D'Or - or best first film prize - at last year's Cannes festival. Set in 1950s Saigon, for controlled beauty of imagery it should leave every other movie this year standing. It is meant to be about a young country girl Mui (Tran Nu Yen-Khe), drawn into the timeless trap of female servitude as she ministers to a middle-class family. It is more about the film-maker's lyrical eye, drawn into the timeless trap of reckless beautification. The camera glides over floors, across latticework screens, through palm fronds, even into the eye of a steaming, sizzling wok. Or we linger on a row of towels or pair of slippers, bathed in the silvery musk of night. The announced theme of female oppression barely gets a look in. And if it did, how could we believe that living in this ocular paradise is oppressive? Even when the local urchin turns up to break wind or to pee into the priceless vases, we admire the balletic way he does it. And when we fast-forward a decade to glimpse Mui in conjugal bliss with one of the sons, we know that the film has given up all pretence at social-domestic realism. This is a masterpiece of sort. One just wonders if it is the masterpiece Tran Anh Hung intended. We are led by the maker's own dicta to expect a feminist fable gritted with everyday truths. We get something that at worst resembles a Vogue magazine 'Vietnam edition' - ravishing to the senses, full of l'exotique voile - and at best announces a director whose visual sense may soon outleap not just his material but many of his modern rivals. Green Papaya should have won last week's Best Foreign Film Oscar. Instead Spain's Belle Epoque beat it to the bronze doorstopper. But then think of those poor academicians: force-fed with homegrown movies for the whole of March and then faced in the arthouse category with a choice between opiate-imaged Eastern minimalism and this raunchy, simple romp - a sort of Iberian Tom Jones - about a handsome servant boy (Jorge Sanz) bedding all four daughters of his mangy, goodhearted employer (Fernando Fernan Gomez). Director Fernando Trueba probably intended a fable about the timeless trap of servitude. If so he forgot about it at the first shout of 'Action'. There ensues much rumpy-pumpy, much giggling in the servants' quarters, and much juggling with goldlens-filters by cameraman Jose-Luis Alcaine, as if trying to impart distinction to this long and stubbornly lightweight shagging-dog story.</p>

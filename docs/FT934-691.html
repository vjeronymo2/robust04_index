			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Clouds spoil a starry horizon: Hollywood has had a bumper year of hits, but competitors are catching up Movie of the Year', trumpeted the front cover of Newsweek. 'The most demanding and emotionally overpowering American movie in years', said New York magazine. Schindler's List, the true story of the rescue of 1,200 Jews from the Holocaust by a raffish German industrialist, opened in US cinemas last week to superlative reviews, capping a year of extraordinary achievement for producer-director Steven Spielberg, Hollywood's master showman. Jurassic Park, his film about dinosaurs rampaging through a theme park which opened in the US and Europe last summer, has taken more than Dollars 860m in worldwide box office receipts so far, making it the most successful movie of all time, breaking Spielberg's own 1982 record of Dollars 700m with ET. Now Schindler's List is bringing him the artistic recognition that a succession of blockbuster adventure films has not achieved, and it might even win him his first 'best director' Academy Awards Oscar. Spielberg's remarkable year is one of several factors making the mood in Hollywood more optimistic this Christmas than for several years - even though the industry still faces some formidable challenges. First, 1993 has been a good year at the box office. US cinema receipts are likely to be some 10 per cent higher than in 1992, thanks in particular to Jurassic Park (from Universal Studios), but also to hits such as The Fugitive (Time Warner) and The Firm (Paramount). Despite a relatively weak Christmas film line-up, the US gross could top 1989's record Dollars 5bn, and several leading studios are planning significant production increases in 1994. The US box office - which has hovered just above or below 1bn admissions a year since the 1960s - now accounts for less than 20 per cent of Hollywood revenues, thanks to the growth of the video rental market and showings of films on TV. However, US cinema receipts are still an important, though not infallible, gauge of how well films will do in the video market and overseas. Second, the industry has been electrified by the Dollars 10bn takeover battle that has raged for the past three months around Paramount Communications, owner of one of the last big Hollywood studios not affiliated to a multinational or multi-media conglomerate. It will be the most important shift in Hollywood ownership since two takeovers by Japanese electronics groups at the start of the decade - Sony's Dollars 3.4bn acquisition of Columbia Pictures and Matsushita's Dollars 6bn takeover of the MCA group, which owns Universal Studios. The Japanese bids were based on the theory that entertainment 'software', such as films and records, and 'hardware', or the equipment on which they are displayed, were becoming increasingly interdependent. That argument remains unproven, though America's rapidly advancing communications revolution - bringing the promise of multi-media, interactive, home TV-based entertainment - makes it look rather more plausible. The battle for Paramount - between cable company Viacom and television shopping group QVC Network - has already produced bids well in excess of what most Wall Street analysts think the company is worth, as did the Japanese deals before it. The bidders are gambling that the price of scarce Hollywood assets will rise, because of the central role the industry is expected to play in the multi-media revolution, bringing with it many new television channels. 'The demand for content is going to be astronomical,' predicts one leading Hollywood figure. 'Demand will far outstrip supply.' The same thinking lies behind the industry's other recent significant takeovers - the purchase of independent studios Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, by Mr Ted Turner's television empire, Turner Broadcasting System, for Dollars 670m. A third reason for optimism is that Hollywood's revenues are growing particularly fast in international markets - a fact underlined by this month's row, in the final stages of the Gatt Uruguay Round negotiations, over US demands that its audiovisual products be granted freer access to the European market. The two sides decided to put the issue to one side, for later resolution. Veronis, Suhler, a New York investment bank, forecasts that while US spending on filmed entertainment will rise at an annual average of about 7 per cent to 1997, Hollywood's international sales will grow by 12 per cent and make up just over 50 per cent of the sector's revenues by 1997, compared with 38 per cent in 1987. Reasons for such optimism - and the increasing ties between US and foreign entertainment companies - include the rising number of households with video cassette players; the renovation of old 'flea-pit' movie theatres or construction of new 'multiplex' cinemas in countries such as the UK; the growth of satellite broadcasting; and the increasing penetration of western culture into former communist countries and the newly industrialised nations of Asia. Many US films already do much better abroad than in the US. For example, Sliver, a thriller from Paramount starring Sharon Stone, got poor reviews in the US early this year and brought in only Dollars 38m of domestic box office revenues. Yet it has produced over Dollars 70m internationally. Jurassic Park has grossed Dollars 336m in the US and Dollars 527m abroad. However, Hollywood's outlook is hardly unclouded. For one thing, rising production and marketing costs in the 1980s mean the industry's operating margins - net operating income as a percentage of revenues - have gyrated in recent years between 7 and 10 per cent, well below the 14-17 per cent enjoyed in the 1970s. The industry's profits have recovered over the past two years since 1991, when box office receipts fell sharply, thanks to a crack-down on costs. But some analysts worry that plans to ramp up production next year will boost its costs without a commensurate rise in revenues and profits. Many also argue that Hollywood has become too dependent for its profits on a small number of blockbusters with expensive special effects, a handful of costly superstars, and high marketing costs. This increases the financial risks from flops (seven out of 10 Hollywood movies generally lose money) and makes it harder for smaller, independent studios to raise the capital needed to compete against the leaders - producing a consolidation of the industry. The increasing importance of the international market seems likely to encourage the blockbuster trend, since global audiences can relate more readily to established stars and dramatic special effects. Some sceptics even question whether the interactive home entertainment revolution will be a boon to the industry. For one thing, it may be further off than its proponents predict. And it may simply shift film consumption patterns - for example, from video rental to pay-per-view TV films - rather than increase the number of hours people spend watching movies and TV shows. Crystal-ball gazing aside, the large Hollywood studios are bracing themselves for a more immediate challenge: increased competition in an area they have dominated for a few decades - prime-time network television shows. A recent court ruling relaxed a ban that had prevented the big three television networks - ABC, NBC and CBS - from owning a financial interest in most of their prime-time programmes, and they are gearing up to increase their output, though their past record at producing hits has been mixed. The court ruling also makes it more attractive for Hollywood studios to merge with the television networks, and some analysts predict deals will be struck in the next few years involving each of the big three. Rumours also persist that Sony or Matsushita might seek outside partners for their studios, which have yet to produce a strong return on their Japanese parents' investments. The Paramount battle, in other words, marks just the latest stage in a Hollywood marital soap opera that has a long way to run.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets lifted by rise in oils, bonds Wall Street RISING oil stocks and a buoyant bond market gave US stock markets a big lift yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35.39 at 3,292.20, close to its high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 3.91 higher at 440.02, while the Amex composite ended up 3.16 at 409.52, and the Nasdaq composite 5.32 firmer at 706.95, another record close. Trading volume on the NYSE was 289m shares. There were two distinct factors behind the market's gains. First, oil stocks were in strong demand on news that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is close to agreeing to a Saudi Arabian proposal to cut production by up to 1m barrels a day. Second, equity investors were buoyed by further gains in bond prices. The benchmark 30-year government bond jumped more than a full point, sending the yield down to below 7.2 per cent for the first time in more than five years. Ironically, the bond market's advance was prompted by comments over the weekend by treasury secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen on taxation policy that would normally have been bad news for stocks - he cast doubt on whether the new administration would cut taxes paid by the middle classes, and talked of the possible introduction of energy and consumption taxes. Equity investors, however, chose to ignore the tax issue, and concentrated instead on the latest decline in bond market rates, which they hope will provide fresh fuel for the slowly recovering economy. Oil stocks were ablaze, not just because of the Opec news but also because of strong quarterly earnings from a number of big companies. Texaco rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 , Exxon added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 60 5/8 , British Petroleum rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 , Chevron firmed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , and Royal Dutch Petroleum gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 81 5/8 . Airline stocks, however, were lower on the news of possible Opec production cuts, because they would push up the cost of aviation fuel. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta dropped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 , and UAL slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 122 1/2 . Sears rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 5/8 in busy trading after the company announced plans to close its catalogue business and discard about 150 retail outlets, with the loss of 16,000 jobs. Sears is taking a Dollars 1.7bn after-tax charge to cover the changes, investors welcomed the measures. General Motors class E shares, which represent the company's Electronic Data Systems (EDS) subsidiary, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 on speculation that BT, the UK telecommunications group, is ready to buy a large stake in EDS. On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed, with Intel up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 112 3/4 but Microsoft down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 88 1/2 . Canada Toronto share prices ended higher in active trading. The composite index rose 19.67 points, or 0.60 per cent, to close at 3295.64. Advancing issues led declines by 336 to 277. Volume of 39,740,000 shares was off from 44,816,000 shares on Friday, and trading value was CDollars 361.5m against CDollars 408m.</p>

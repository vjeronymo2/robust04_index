			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A senior U.S. trade  negotiator on Wednesday [12 January] urged Tokyo to redouble its  efforts to improve American access to its markets in line with  last year's accord to forge a new bilateral trade framework.    "By almost any measure, be it the stock of foreign  investment  in Japan as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or the  import penetration of foreign manufactured goods, Japan's  economy is markedly less open than any other developed economy,"  said Joan Spero, under secretary of state for economic, business  and agricultural affairs.    Spero is on a four-day visit to Japan to push stalled talks  on a bilateral trade framework before U.S. President Bill  Clinton meets Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in  Washington on February 11.    "Quite frankly, progress to date in the talks has been  disappointing," Spero told a news conference at the Japan  National Press Club. "We are looking for real results in these  (framework) talks and not cosmetic agreements."    Saying Japan is responsible for 60 percent of the U.S.  global  trade deficit, Spero added, "clearly, there is something wrong  in the basic structure of our economic relationship."    "While this imbalance is due in part to broad macroeconomic  forces, it also is a consequence of the structural relationship  between Japan and the global economy, and the inadequate market  access that foreign firms encounter in Japan," she said.    Spero dismissed what she views as "repetitive and inaccurate  claims" going around in pubic debate in Japan in the past few  months that Washington is seeking specific market share targets.    Spero said, "This misinformation, or disinformation, has  obscured an understanding of the purpose of the framework."    She said the framework is aimed at addressing macroeconomic  imbalances, reducing sectoral and structural barriers and  promoting an open and freer economy in Japan.    During the July 1993 talks between Clinton and then Japanese  Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Tokyo committed itself to  "significantly" decrease its current account surplus and expand  its global imports of goods and services, she said.    In order to correct chronic economic imbalances and market  access problems, Japan and the United States agreed last July to  come up with "a variety of qualitative and quantitative  indicators" to assess whether they are "moving in the right  direction," Spero said, calling for "results" in specific  bilateral trade areas like autos and financial services.    "These are changes that will benefit not just foreign firms  but Japanese as well," she said.    Elaborating on the indicators as sought by the U.S. under  the July accord, Spero cited U.S. auto dealers planning to  operate in Japan.    As a quantitative measurement, the number of U.S. auto  dealerships should increase in Japan, she said. But qualitative  aspects, such as their location and how they are operated, are  also important, she added.    "The constant portrayal by some Japanese that our framework  proposals are managed trade is wrong. Our goal is to unmanage  trade in Japan, not to manage it," she said.    It is not time for the two countries to discuss whether or  not they have agreed to adopt trade measurements but it is time  for them to "get down and begin serious discussion" on ways to  open specific markets, she said.    Spero voiced hope that ongoing negotiations between Japan's  ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp on political  reforms will not hinder progress in Japan-U.S. trade talks.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Greene King - Other Companies Full-year results from the East Anglian regional brewer are due on Thursday. Greene King's interim results were particularly disappointing with profits almost unchanged. Since then, the shares have been among the weakest in the sector. Last year's pre-tax profits were Pounds 20.1m, down from Pounds 20.3m the year before. Any improvement this time will be regarded as progress.</p>

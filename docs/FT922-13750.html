			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Dublin's abortion dilemma deepens THE Irish government's dilemma on abortion deepened yesterday, following a decision to hold a new referendum on the issue after a referendum to ratify the Maastricht treaty tentatively scheduled for June. Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, told members of his Fianna Fail parliamentary group that he wants to avoid the two issues become 'entangled' and that the ratification of the treaty is the government's top priority. Mr Noel Dempsey, the party chief whip, said: 'It would be devastating for this country and future generations if we were to let these two issues become entangled. . . we are not going to be stampeded into making hasty and ill-judged decisions by any groups. We don't want to rush into another abortion referendum as we did in 1983 with the results that we have now.' It looks increasingly likely, however, that the abortion issue will become central to the debate on the Maastricht treaty. EC law guarantees the right of all citizens to travel freely within the community to avail themselves of services legally available. Dr Mary Lucey, president of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC), said yesterday: 'The Maastricht treaty will sell Irish unborn lives for a mess of pottage, for money - as it's going this referendum on Maastricht will be a referendum on abortion.' SPUC is the principal pro-life lobby group in Ireland and played a key role in inserting the right-to-life amendment into the constitution in a referendum in 1983. The abortion referendum would be aimed at guaranteeing the right of women to travel abroad for an abortion, and for them to receive abortion information in Ireland. It would also seek to rectify the situation created by a Supreme Court ruling last month which permits pregnant women who face a threat to their lives to obtain an abortion abroad, but not otherwise.</p>

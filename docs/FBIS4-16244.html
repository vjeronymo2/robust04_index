			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- The meeting of the Council of  Heads of Government of the CIS member states has ended at the  President Hotel in Moscow. The prime ministers and authorized  representatives of the 12 countries of the Commonwealth signed  17 documents proposing a deepening of economic integration on  the territory of the CIS and solutions to a number of social and  military-political problems. All 20 items on the agenda were  examined at the session. An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned  from informed sources that no fundamental differences arose on  any of the items on the agenda.    Of the agreements which were signed, five will be sent for  endorsement by the Commonwealth heads of state who, at 1400,  will sit down at the conference table, together with the prime  ministers, in the President Hotel. Among these documents are,  in particular, agreements on Ukraine's joining the economic  union with the rights of an associate member and on the  establishment of a permanent body -- a Commission of the  Economic Union -- under the CIS Coordination and Consultative  Committee.</p>

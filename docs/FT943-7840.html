			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on weakness in bond markets Renewed weakness in bond markets, and inflation worries in the US gave bourses an uncomfortable run into the weekend, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT went tamely into the expiry of the Dax option, the key index easing 3.99 to 2,149.57, down 1.2 per cent on the week, against a striking level of 2,150. The Ibis indicated Dax fell further to 2,143.84 in the post-bourse. Turnover stayed low, down from DM5.9bn to DM5.2bn. The two main stories of the day were in second rank blue chips: Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, and Lufthansa, the airline and prime privatisation candidate. Schering, which fell DM42.50 to DM915 on Tuesday on news that two of its drugs were under official scrutiny, lost another DM9 to DM899, 6.1 per cent down over four days. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt said that around 10 per cent of Schering's revenues could be affected. Lufthansa, initially, reacted well to an interim report which indicated that recovery was on the way, hitting an intraday peak of DM217; the euphoria did not last, and the shares closed 70 pfg lower at DM214.80 before subsiding to DM211.50 after hours. PARIS finished the session in a subdued mood with the CAC-40 index slipping 9.21 to 2,001.33, barely changed on the week and, as last week, just holding the 2,000 support ahead of the weekend. The session saw a low point of 1,993.89, against an intraday high of 2,0209.51. Turnover remained modest at FFr2.2bn. Generale des Eaux, which reported a slight increase in half year sales, lost FFr3 to FFr533 while Eurotunnel, which reported sales figures for the first time - FFr19m for the second quarter - slipped 15 centimes to FFr25.55. Danone, which denied reports that it might sell its jam making division, lost FFr12 to FFr832. AMSTERDAM featured activity in Fokker, the aircraft manufacturer, following disappointing half year results which came after the close of business on Thursday. The group's shares dipped to a day's low of Fl 15.10 before closing off 90 cents at Fl 15.90. The AEX index slipped 1.72 to 412.45 as it faced further pressure from options expiry, a week's fall of 0.5 per cent. MILAN made progress as investors bought shares in BCI and Telecom Italia. BCI rose L130 to L3,680 while Telecom Italia, whose shares began to trade on Thursday, gained L120 to L4,310. The Comit index rose 16.32 to 661.15, up 2.6 per cent on the week. Kleinwort Benson,in a comment on the Italian equity market, said that the recent decision by the Bank of Italy to raise interest rates had not only dispelled doubts over its independence but also placed the government in 'the most uncomfortable position at the worst possible time . . . The only good thing about the recent events is that the pressure on the government to act has increased'. Kleinwort's said that it expected the government to follow a tight monetary policy and forecast that the market would rise to the 800 level in the next three months. ZURICH fell by a percentage point on the day and by much the same on the week, the SMI index losing 25.9 at 2,556.8 in low volume. In banks, selling turned to CS Holding, down SFr14 to SFr535 while UBS, the most active stock, lost SFr19 at SFr1,091. SBC, this week's villain in the sector, recovered SFr2 to SFr376. MADRID declined for the sixth consecutive session, the general index closing 0.90 lower at 306.18, 2.1 per cent lower on the week in turnover of Pta27.5bn. One or two construction stocks bucked the trend, with Cubiertas up Pta290 at Pta10,400 and Uralita Pta75 better at Pta1,535. HELSINKI had another good day after Thursday's 1.35 per cent gain, the Hex index rising 38.1, or 2.1 per cent to 1,876.1, 3 per cent higher on the week. Economists looked at budget plans and said that the Finnish government had lived up to its promise by keeping next year's budget expenditure, and the deficit with set limits. This, they said, was good news for the economy, and for financial markets.

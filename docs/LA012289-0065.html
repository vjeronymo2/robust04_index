			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL ABOUT TRAVEL  </P> <P> In Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips (Dec. 4) there was a recommendation for  "personalized itineraries" under the heading of "Tailored Itineraries." What  caused us to take notice was the assertion that "travel agents are skilled at  obtaining bargain fares," but it is necessary to go to a consultant who is not  an agent for expert itinerary planning.  </P> <P> We at Newport Travel Concepts pride ourselves on providing our clients with the  most up-to-date faring and routing expertise and thoroughly researched and  personalized itineraries. We have created specialized trips throughout the  globe, including Africa, Asia and literally around the world. We provide  service with respect to every aspect of travel and believe that your readers  should know that there are travel agents who "do it all."  </P> <P> FLORENCE FELDMAN  </P> <P> TISH HILBERT  </P> <P> JACKIE MANION  </P> <P> JODY VAUGHAN  </P> <P> Owner/agents  </P> <P> Newport Travel Concepts  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

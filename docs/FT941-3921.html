			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Advertising Employing the appropriate hyperbole, the prospects for the advertising industry seem absolutely fabulous. WPP has just reported a near-sevenfold increase in annual pre-tax profits - admittedly from an extremely depressed base - after its revenues grew 4 per cent in constant currency terms. Abbott Mead Vickers, which is more heavily exposed to the UK market, has reported a 26 per cent increase in underlying trading profits. The Advertising Association forecasts revenue will grow by 4 to 6 per cent in 1994 while many more bullish predictions abound. Those rising revenues flowing over trimmed cost bases should ensure rapid earnings growth and popping champagne corks in many a West End bistro. Sadly, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi is unlikely to share in the excitement when it reports its results on Tuesday. Rumours of board room friction have dogged the company. The remaining management time appears to have been absorbed in its attempts to get its bloated cost base under control. Whether that has proved successful will be revealed tomorrow, although the market has its doubts. The bigger worry is that Saatchi has taken its eye off the trading ball, shedding an embarrassing amount of market share. It warned in December it would lose Pounds 30m of revenue in 1994 following the loss of accounts with Chrysler and Helene Curtis. Saatchi has underperformed the market by 24 per cent over the past year when its rivals have substantially outperformed. That calls for no more creative excuses but some concrete solutions instead.</p>

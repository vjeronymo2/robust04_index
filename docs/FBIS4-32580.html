			<p>BFN     [Text] President Arpad Goncz has evaluated the results of  the coalition negotiations. We connect you with correspondent  Laszlo Gardai at the parliament building:    [Gardai]] I am glad that the two parties could agree on the  programs: In the future, good cooperation will depend on  goodwill, dialogue, and teamwork, the president said. He  expressed his hope that disputes can be resolved later, just as  they can now. The two sides' flexible attitude is promising for  the future, he said. The coalition cannot be avoided, and the  result of the elections was not surprising for me, Arpad Goncz  said, though the Hungarian Socialist Party's very large victory  made the assumption that a social-liberal government was to be  formed a bit doubtful. Arpad Goncz repeated that the second  free elections had been more important than the first. The  large turnout indicated that the country cares about its fate  and wants a say in its affairs.    In connection with the coalition negotiations, Arpad Goncz  said that he had not found any intention to shut out the  opposition. Modest optimism is justified for the future, Arpad  Goncz said. In reply to a question he said that he hopes the  whole country will be able to cooperate in a harmonious way. He  asked the coalition partners not to forget the opposition and to  understand its role, if only because they represent one-third of  the country in the parliament.</p>

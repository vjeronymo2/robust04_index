			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from V. Kvasov, Russian Federation minister and </F> leader of the Government Apparatus, dated 20 June 1994, followed  by reply from NYG Managing Editor Dmitriy Muratov under the  "State Secrets" rubric: "We Report, Mr. Kvasov: This Is 1994!"]    [Text] For official use    To S.N. Kozheurov, chief [glavnyy] editor of NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA    Dear Sergey Nikolayevich!    On 16 June this year your newspaper carried a report  divulging the contents of Russian Federation Government  directives stamped "Not for the Press" on the purchase from the  FRG and Austria of special property for the needs of the Russian  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and FCS [Federal  Counterintelligence Service].    I ask you to conduct an investigation and to report to the  Russian Federation Government Apparatus on the source of the  aforesaid information and the grounds on which it was printed.    [Signed] V. Kvasov, minister of the Russian Federation and  leader of the Russian Federation Government Apparatus.    Dear Mr. Minister!    In a letter sent by courier you demand an indication of the  grounds on which the information about the government's purchase  of a large quantity of foreign weapons (Walthers, Colts,  Winchesters, Parabellums, etc.) and ammunition for them was  published.    I report: The grounds are that this is interesting  information.    You ask for its source to be reported.    I reply: in accordance with the Law on the Press... only in  court.    If you deem it possible to shift onto us the responsibility  for the regime of secrecy in the Government Apparatus, I will  point out that it is not journalists who must keep your terrible  secrets but you yourselves.    We really do not understand very well why Tula or Vladimir  "products" are not purchased for the FCS and the MVD and the  government is evidently more attracted to deals outside Russia's  "Golden Ring." Incidentally, as our newspaper reported 21 June,  Boris Nikolayevich personally bought himself a rifle in Tula for  14 million rubles.    A final point. The Government Apparatus has not reacted so  harshly to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA's articles about lobbyist  edicts on the part of Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin in respect of a  number of firms. But in general this makes me feel better: If  there are state secrets, could this mean that the state exists?    [Signed] [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Managing (vedushchiy)  Editor] Dmitriy Muratov.</p>

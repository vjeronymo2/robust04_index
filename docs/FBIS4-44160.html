			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "Toward a Head-On </F> Collision"]    [Text] Europe is heading straight for an internal crisis, a  head-on collision between Germany and Great Britain, if German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major do  not succeed in reaching agreement on the future president of the  European Commission prior to the special summit of 15 July.    The British veto against [Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc  Dehaene is so categoric and seems so irrevocable that it has  placed Mr. Major in a situation from which there is no escape:  He must either climb down over Europe, which would split his  Conservative Party that little bit more, or enter into open  conflict with his European partners at a time when Germany and  France are getting ready to take over, the one after the other,  the European Union's presidency.    John Major, who adopted a very Thatcher-like position in  Corfu, chose his camp, alone against all the rest, and unable to  rally to the consensus that formed around Jean-Luc Dehaene.  This inflexibility would be to his credit if Major was  defending a worthwhile cause. But it rather seems like a  political move designed to win support at home at Europe's  expense. Several British newspapers applauded his "courage" in  their Sunday [26 June] editions. The aim has been achieved.    Nobody can dispute Great Britain's right to demonstrate its  difference and its insular nature. The problem today, with the  lame compromise of the Maastricht Treaty, is that Great Britain  is playing a double game. It is sufficiently involved in Europe  to stop it moving forward, and sufficiently distanced to do what  it likes.    Jean-Luc Dehaene was right on Sunday to stress that the  Corfu  veto threatens to fuel the arguments of those who are arguing  for a multispeed Europe. How can we not conclude from the  British attitude that only a variable-geometry Europe can both  accommodate the British and absorb an increasing pace of  enlargement? A hard core would serve as a test and as an  example. [sentence as published] And you can bet that London  would very quickly be seeking to join it.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses steady after painful morning Bourses, trailing US equities, had a painful morning after Tuesday's Wall Street plunge; but, in the afternoon, they seemed in no hurry to follow the Dow's extended decline, writes Our Markets Staff. Morgan Stanley's European strategist, Mr Richard Davidson, followed the lead from his US colleagues and cut the weighting of equities in his European mixed asset portfolio from 58 to 50 per cent. He moved the money into bonds, reckoning that equities will underperform over the next two quarters; yet he emphasised his house's longer term view that stock prices should outperform over the course of the cycle. FRANKFURT dropped 2 per cent on the session, the Dax index losing 41.46 at 2,033.31; however, it had recovered to 2,040.05 by the end of Ibis trading for a 24-hour drop of 1.6 per cent. Dealers said investors were seeking refuge in relatively high bond yields. Turnover in German equities, reflecting the switch, moved up from DM5.5bn to DM7.5bn. Individual stocks still managed to respond to events. Deutsche Bank, a major shareholder in, and creditor to Metallgesellschaft, dropped DM21.80 or nearly 3 per cent to DM722.70 on the session after the troubled trader unveiled capital reduction, and new share issue plans. Deutsche recovered to DM727.50 after hours. BASF and Bayer were relatively strong ahead of the chemicals results season, down just DM1.20 to DM304 and DM1.10 to DM335.40 respectively. BMW led carmakers down with a drop of DM26 to DM749 after a fall in October registrations. ZURICH was still preoccupied with developments at UBS, although the SMI index fell 25.7 to 2,546.1, with the weakness of the dollar adding to its more general concerns. UBS bearers shed SFr34 or 2.9 per cent to SFr1,125 after a low of SFr1,115, with the bank again said to be a large seller. The registered gave up SFr16 to SFr252, further reducing to 12.0 per cent their premium over the bearers. The premium, which stood at 34.4 per cent when battle lines were drawn with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision on September 29, had shrunk to 15.6 per cent by Tuesday, when shareholders voted to support the board's proposal for a single class of equity capital. Nestle eased SFr9 to SFr1,196, its 10-month figures proving in line with expectations, although forecasts for volume growth during 1995 helped the shares up from a low of SFr1,181. Holderbank gave up a further SFr15 to SFr1,015, still awaiting the outcome of the European Commission's five-year investigation into alleged illegal market-sharing agreements between some of Europe's biggest cement companies. PARIS managed to recover some of its early losses, helped by some institutional short-covering on the last day of the account. The CAC-40 index shed 18.32 or 1 per cent to 1,893.09, after a session's low of 1,872. Turnover was FFr4bn. Societe Generale went against the trend with a rise of FFr3 to FFr601. However, it had its rating reduced yesterday by Merrill Lynch, which said that the stock was now fully valued after a strong performance over the last three months. According to Merrill, the stock had outperformed the market by 12 per cent in that period. Alcatel Alsthom was another stock to rise, by FFr4.60 to FFr419.60, as some bargain hunters emerged. The shares hit a year's low of FFr411 earlier in the week as the head of a subsidiary was detained over allegations that France Telecom had been overcharged for equipment supplied. MILAN's Comit index fell 11.63 or 1.8 per cent to 623.64 as investors worried that the anti-corruption magistrates' investigation of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, risked the parliamentary passage of the budget, and threatened its deficit-cutting measures. Mr James Cornish at NatWest Securities said, however, that political developments were unlikely to halt the country's economic recovery. The market was not yet cheap enough to be an irresistible buy, and the likelihood of further political upsets meant it was likely to become cheaper in the weeks ahead. Mr Cornish viewed further weakness as an opportunity for selec-tive buying. AMSTERDAM dragged itself back from an AEX index session low of 399.46, closing 4.40 down at 402.00. Akzo Nobel fell Fl 4.00 to Fl 193.50; it said it planned an investment of SKr575m in two Swedish factories. In the finance sector, ING slipped 40 cents to Fl 78.20. There were domestic media reports that the group intended to shed approximately 1,500 employees, which could result in savings of some Fl 735m. ING is expected to show an improvement in its third-quarter earnings today. Fokker announced job cuts of 160 at its special products division, due to falling sales, and the shares dropped 2.7 per cent to Fl 14.50. MADRID, once again, registered a lower than average decline, the general index clawing back around half of its early loss to end 2.65 or 0.9 per cent off at 299.72 in turnover of nearly Pta27bn. Pryca climbed back from an early decline of nearly 4 per cent to finish Pta55 or 2.5 per cent down at Pta2,130. Mr Christopher Cooper at James Capel said there had been stories in the Spanish press about limitation of opening hours for supermarket groups.

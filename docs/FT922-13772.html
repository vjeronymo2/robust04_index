			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Bidders raise terms in LTV aerospace sale THE FATE of LTV Corporation's aerospace and missiles business hung in the balance last night as two rival bidding groups - one of them including France's Thomson-CSF - twice increased their offers for the company in a New York bankruptcy court hearing. LTV has been operating under the protection of the court for the past five years and needs its approval for the sale of any business. Martin Marietta and Lockheed, the US defence groups which made a joint offer for the LTV company, late yesterday raised their bid to Dollars 385m. However this was still below the Dollars 430m offered by Thomson-CSF and Carlyle, a Washington-based investment firm. Thomson wants the LTV missiles business, while Carlyle would take the aircraft side. Northrop, another US defence contractor, decided against a last-minute bid in conjunction with the Carlyle group.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Summary] Recently the Ministry of Internal Trade convened  a meeting with circulation department leaders from Guandong,  Guangxi, Yunnan, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, Sichuan  and Liaoning, and the president of the Sugar and Alcohol  Corporation in order to adopt swift and vigorous measures to  stabilize sugar prices.    The government will immediately place some sugar reserves on  the market to stabilize prices. Localities and enterprises will  sell current sugar stocks to support a rational price level.  The meeting decided to decrease the current spot price of  first-grade granulated sugar from sugar-producing regions in the  south from 3500-3600 yuan to 3000-3200 yuan per ton.    The government will put 300,000 tons of sugar reserves on  the  market. The amount of the first batch of reserves are:  Shanghai 6,000 tons, Sichuan 7,000 tons, Tianjin 5,000 tons,  Shandong 20,000 tons, Liaoning 10,000 tons, Beijing 10,000 tons,  and Jiangsu 15,000 tons. The amount of the second batch of  reserves will be based on the market situation.</p>

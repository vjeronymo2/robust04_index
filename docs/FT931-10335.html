			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Tesco may challenge over video sale ruling THE USE of a child by trading standards officers as an agent provocateur to catch retailers illegally selling goods to children such as video films classified for adults was upheld by the High Court yesterday. Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, rejected an appeal by Tesco, the supermarket chain, against a conviction by magistrates in Willesden, north London, for supplying an 18-rated film to a boy of 14. Lord Justice Staughton said the boy was given Pounds 10 by a trading standards official and told to buy a video with an 18 classification. He was told to give his true age if asked. The boy obtained the video and Tesco was later found guilty of a breach of the 1984 Video Recordings Act, fined Pounds 750 and ordered to pay Pounds 416 in costs. Tesco argued that if the boy was acting as an agent for the officer, the video was supplied to the official, not the boy, and was therefore lawful. Tesco said it was considering challenging the ruling in the House of Lords as 'a matter of general public importance'. Lord Justice Staughton said it was no doubt 'fairly common for children to arrive at shops and say they wish to buy cigarettes or alcohol for a parent or some of other adult, and the same may happen with video recordings'. Even if the child was telling the truth, it was doubtful that it could be said that the supply was to the adult and not the child.</p>

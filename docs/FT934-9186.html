			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Closure plan for lead smelter - European companies to share cost of eliminating overcapacity EUROPEAN LEAD producers are preparing a scheme to eliminate overcapacity in the region by the permanent closure of a smelter. The cost would be shared between all the producers. The scheme is nearly identical to the so-called 'shut down' agreement European zinc producers are pressing ahead with and hope to complete within a few months. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chairman of Metallgesellschaft of Germany, said the lead shut-down scheme was being considered because there was a crisis in the European lead-zinc industry, caused mainly by a flood of exports to Europe from the former eastern bloc countries but also by a fundamental structural imbalance between supply and demand. 'There is over-production of zinc and, to some extent, of lead,' he said. He was 'cautiously optimistic' that producers would soon reach agreement on a zinc smelter shut-down 'and I hope there will be one for lead later'. The zinc shut-down arrangement must receive approval from the European Commission. Mr Schimmelbusch said: 'We have a good case because there is a structural crisis in the industry. But we cannot take approval for granted.' Mr Schimmelbusch also insisted that the European industry could not ignore the equally pressing import problem. 'The flood of metal from the east must be addressed,' he said. He said MG was working on some ideas to alleviate the problem. He would not be drawn into giving details but admitted his group was talking to government representatives and individual smelters in the former eastern bloc. 'We know the main locations because MG has worked in the region for many, many years. 'We hope that in the medium term we can come to some sensible arrangements. They (the former eastern bloc producers) must understand it is wasteful to pour metals at below cost into a region that already is over-supplied.' Mr Schimmelbusch acknowledged that the import problems were easing because ore grades were falling at mines in the former eastern bloc and, consequently, smelters there were finding it difficult to maintain output at previous levels. Mine output has also been falling steeply in western countries, leaving lead smelters in particular short of essential raw material. For this reason analysts suggest that the outlook for lead is better than that for any other metal traded on the London Metal Exchange. Mine output in the west is forecast by the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group to fall this year by 14 per cent to 1.98m tonnes while metal production is predicted to fall by 3 per cent to 4.31m tonnes. A small decline in consumption, from 4.46m tonnes to 4.42m, is also expected. According the ILZSG, lead imports from the former eastern bloc to the west last year jumped by nearly 110,000 tonnes to 173,000 tonnes. The Brook Hunt consultancy is among those making lead the 'star' metal for 1994 and it forecasts an average price of 23 cents a lb (Dollars 507 a tonne) for next year. Most forecasts are clustering around that price: Ord Minnett, Lehman Brothers and Rudolf Wolff have predicted that 23 cents would be the 1994 average. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts lead will start 1994 at 23 cents and reach 26 cents by December to give an annual average of 24.3 cents. Last night three-month lead closed in London at 19 cents.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   EUROPEAN PRIMARY LEAD SMELTERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country   Company              Location           Capacity (000 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria   BBU                  Gailitz                           26 Belgium   Union Miniere        Hoboken                           90 France    Metaleurop           Noyelles-Godault                 110           Metaleurop           Noyelles-Godault (ISF)            40 Germany   Berzeluis            Stolberg Bindfeldhammer (QSL)    100           Berzeluis Duisberg   Duisberg (ISF)                    45           Metaleurop           Norddeutsche Nordenham            95 Italy     Nuova Samim          Porto Vesme (ISF)                 30           Nuova Samim          Porto Vesme (Kivcet)             100 Sweden    Boliden              Ronnskar                          65 UK        Brittania Zinc       Avonmouth (ISF)                   40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                                                           741  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

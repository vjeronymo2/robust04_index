			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Capital connections If the multimedia hype continues, phone company executives may soon have to stop talking telephone numbers and start spending them. MCI's announcement yesterday of Dollars 20bn-worth of strategic plans falls mostly into the talk category - the investment in long distance super-highways and local capacity will be phased, shared with partners and is partly an upgrading of existing facilities. The gambit is also politically inspired; MCI wants to cut the amount it pays local phone companies for its final connection to consumers, so threatening to compete with them is a useful spur. Still, even with the rhetoric stripped away, it does point towards the high capital investment that phone companies will need. AT&amp;T and MCI may well move from long distance traffic to compete for local calls. While that investment would be costly, there is little doubt that the Baby Bells' monopoly margins could be cut. That, however, would probably prompt the regulator to open the US long distance market to local companies, increasing competition and cutting margins there too. Several expensive fibre-optic super-highways may be built, providing the US with vast capacity. As such systems could carry almost limitless traffic, phone companies will struggle to avoid prices falling to commodity levels. Some value-added services will help maintain margins, and even if video conferencing becomes as cheap as using the fax, network operators will benefit from the increased usage of their systems. Yet phone companies will be relying on lower prices stimulating demand in order to recoup most of their capital spending. MCI's strategy is a sensible response to the development of real competition in US telecoms, but shareholders may yet view the old cosy cartel with nostalgia.</p>

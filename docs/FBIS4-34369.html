			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jun (NA) -- The bloc of Socialist  Unity (US) deputies has presented a draft resolution proposing  the impeachment of President of the Republic Carlos Menem for  the alleged crime of "misconduct in office."    Hector Polino, the U.S. deputy for the federal capital,  sponsored the resolution. He explained that the petition is  based "on the liberal use of emergency decrees" by the executive  branch "and a wide variety of anticonstitutional decrees with  which Congress is being overwhelmed."    Concerning the latter point, the socialist legislator  emphasized "the liberal use of illegal legislative delegate  powers and the practice of partial promulgations of bills that  have been approved by Congress and then partially or totally  vetoed by the executive branch."    Polino stressed: "Decree No. 660, eliminating a dollar  guarantee established by the retirement law for those joining  the National Bank's AFJP [Retirement and Pension Fund Managing  Companies], is among the 310 emergency decrees that President  Menem has issued since July 1989."</p>

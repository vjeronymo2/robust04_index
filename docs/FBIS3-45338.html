On 15 January, the  provincial party committee and the provincial government  cosponsored a forum to explore new ways for enlivening  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and solving the  problems in these aspects.    Eleven examples, including Liaoyuan (Jiancheng) machinery  plant, the Jilin chemical fiber corporation, the Hunchun gold  mine, and the Jilin (Fengyuan) cement plant, introduced their  experience in reforming the wage system and the property right  system, developing various forms of management system,  optimizing the industrial structure and the product mix, and  accepting the challenges on domestic and international markets.    Provincial Leaders He Zhukang, Gao Yan, Wang Jinshan, Liu  Xilin, Feng Ximing, Liu Yazhi, and Wang Guofa conscientiously  heard the speeches made by these examples. Present at the forum  were vice mayors of the city, prefectural, and autonomous  prefectural governments in charge of the industrial work;  chairmen of the city, prefectural, and autonomous prefectural  planning and economic commissions and restructuring commissions;  directors and managers of the units that introduced their  experience at the forum and relevant enterprises; and  responsible comrades of the provincial-level departments  concerned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The sides that signed the Bishkek meeting's protocol  on the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh problem--which was  signed by Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, Russia, and Kyrgyzstan but  not by Azerbaijan--have declared that the agreement is open for  signature.    Rasul Guliyev, the chairman of the Azerbaijani Parliament,  telephoned Babken Ararktsyan, the chairman of the Armenian  Supreme Council, on 7 May informing him that Azerbaijan will  sign the Bishkek protocol. This was reported by the Supreme  Council press service, which also noted that the Armenian  Supreme Council has not yet received the document ratifying that  protocol.</p>

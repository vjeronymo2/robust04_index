			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: The fewer 'food miles' in the consumer's basket the better Sir, In his letter to you ('Many 'food miles' apart', August 16) Hugh Raven introduces the intriguing concept of 'food miles' representing the distance that agricultural products have travelled before they reach the consumer in the supermarket. He feels that anyone concerned about Britain's food trade gap and about the quality of life in general should take 'food miles' into account before buying a product. Does he or any of your readers have a notion as to how, in practical terms, these could be calculated? What would induce the retailer or supplier to bother to do so? And would it be possible to devise a scheme, presumably a variant on those promoted by many airlines, whereby consumers or retailers benefit from collecting 'food miles', presumably the less the better?

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY ISSUES DELAY EX-CIA MAN'S TRIAL  </P> <P> The Justice Department, citing national security concerns, obtained a delay  Monday in the Iran-Contra criminal case against the CIA's former station chief  in Costa Rica.  </P> <P> A U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals judge in Richmond, Va., issued an emergency  stay to temporarily block the trial of Joseph F. Fernandez.  </P> <P> The ex-CIA operative's trial was to have started Monday, but the CIA wanted to  stop Fernandez's lawyers from identifying as part of his defense three CIA  programs in Costa Rica and the sites of three CIA stations and facilities in  Latin America.  </P> <P> The Justice Department sought the emergency stay after U.S. District Judge  Claude Hilton rejected prosecutors' proposals to substitute numbers for the  three CIA sites and to drop parts of one criminal charge against Fernandez to  avoid mentioning the CIA programs.  </P> <P> Hilton said Fernandez must be allowed to mention the names of the CIA programs  and that substituting numbers for names of the three CIA sites was not  acceptable.  </P> <P> Ron Noble, a deputy assistant attorney general, told the judge that the  department would seek a delay of the trial.  </P> <P> With a pool of prospective jurors waiting in a room adjacent to the court, the  judge, obviously irritated, asked Noble why the Justice Department had not  taken such action a week ago.  </P> <P> "This is a very difficult thing for the department to do," Noble replied. He  said that the proposals from the prosecutors "would allow this trial to go  forward. We have no alternative."  </P> <P> At the appeals court, the Justice Department is seeking to formally intervene  in the case and wants the court to review Hilton's denial of the prosecutors'  proposals.  </P> <P> Fernandez is charged with lying about his involvement with Oliver L. North's  Contra resupply network. He faces two counts of obstruction and two counts of  making false statements.  </P> <P> The Justice Department went to the appeals court instead of filing a national  security affidavit with the court. Such a document would categorically bar  disclosure of certain classified information and could kill the case.  </P></p>

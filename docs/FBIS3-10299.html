Pedro Noyola Nolasco, Mexican foreign trade undersecretary,  noted that NAFTA's successful implementation has resulted in  large commercial flows, increased exports, and the strengthening  of the Mexican textile and manufacturing sectors. Interviewed  within the framework of the 10th meeting of the Mexican-Canadian  Ministerial Commission, Noyola said that the customs problems  NAFTA faced at the beginning have been resolved satisfactorily.    Regarding Chile's integration into NAFTA, Noyola said that  no  specific date exists but Chile is a good candidate and that  according to the admission clause its incorporation is feasible.  Noyola stated that although there are no negotiations in this  regard yet, the three signatories (Mexico, the United States,  and Canada) have expressed their interest for Chile as well as  other countries from the area to join NAFTA. He recalled that  Mexico was the one to propose the admission clause in NAFTA,  arguing that it constitutes a mechanism that strengthens  international trade and helps create an open area instead of a  closed fortress that restricts commercial growth.    Noyola added that agreements of this type and the one that  is  expected to be signed by the G-3 [Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela]  have the greatest possibilities of promoting global trade and  are more efficient than other former agreements such as the  Latin American Integration Association, which did not help  Mexico to broaden trade with the region. Noyola went on to say  that negotiations among ministers to sign the G-3 trade  agreement "have concluded." Therefore, the technical groups are  only working on the final details. He disclosed that from these  last meetings a final document will be issued to clearly  establish the chapters regarding the place of origin and  protection regulations. However, he denied that there is  currently a specific date to sign and initiate the commercial  agreement with the G-3.    Noyola announced that on 2 March Trade Secretary Jaime Serra  Puche will travel to Costa Rica to meet with his counterpart  Roberto Rojas and conclude NAFTA negotiations.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item from the FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA section]: </F> "Foreign Banks No Longer Attract Close Attention"]    [Text] Fundamental restrictions imposed on the  development of foreign banks in Russia by the Central Bank are  much more significant than restrictions on operations with  rubles that have been set forth in a presidential edict.    Questions about the attitude of the domestic business  community toward the presence of foreign banks in Russia come up  at virtually all meetings between bankers and journalists.  However, it is now becoming absolutely clear that this question  is no longer topical. Nobody recalls any longer the norm of 12  percent of the combined capital of commercial banks to which  foreign banking capital is restricted. Meanwhile, it is  precisely this norm that currently determines the market share  of banking institutions with foreign capital.    The combined statutory capital of foreign banks is about  $100  million. Meanwhile, the Inkombank alone will increase its  statutory capital from $50 million to $100 million during 1994.  The Yugorskiy Bank is placing the third issue of shares and  counting on an increase in its statutory capital to R50 billion.  According to the latest rating, the Inkombank ranks eighth, and  the Yugorskiy Bank, 25th.    The might of a Russian bank no longer hinges solely on a  broadly advertised name and a rapidly developing chain of  branches, but also on the division of the client market. Large  clients and special exporters who are welcome guests at all  banks have long opted for their domestic banking institutions.  Large clients frequently purchase the stock of banks in which  their accounts are open, which results in additional advantages  for these enterprises. Russian banks that have attracted these  clients provide the greatest possible range of services; they  have grown to be large financial institutions by European  standards. The final partition of the market of large clients is  also confirmed by the fact that large banks are now fighting for  clients who are private individuals. It is quite symbolic that  the Yugorskiy Bank, which has been nurtured by the domestic  exporters of oil and refinery products, rapidly implemented the  restructuring of the bank and, effective 16 May, began to work  with private individuals.    At the beginning of 1994, the MMB [Moscow International  Bank], the oldest foreign bank in Russia, revised its market  strategy. The bank shifted from international currency  settlements and the distribution of the credit lines of  international financial institutions to full-fledged services to  Russian and Western enterprises, also developing debit  operations. As a matter of fact, the MMB, which was founded in  1989, joined the competitive struggle as late as four years  later.    Even now, new banks are not under any illusion as far as  attracting currency clients is concerned. They bet on  sufficiently large and medium-size Russian enterprises and  organizations. The effectiveness of settlements, the accrual of  interest on accounts, and opportunities for taking out credit  and performing fiduciary operations are becoming the main  points. The banks are vigorously developing stock market  instruments--bills of exchange and deposit certificates, which  ensure tax relief for their clients.    Therefore, the development of a customer base is becoming a  great problem for foreign banks. This base is turning out to be  quite narrow in Russia because foreign banks go after large  commercial and industrial customers. The offices of foreign  banks do not allow them to establish services for nonresident  private individuals who might prefer a domestic bank over a  local bank [as published].    Foreign banks must obtain a license for each new branch. For  this reason, they are now based in Moscow and St. Petersburg  where the market is the most saturated. A branch of the Austria  Bank sometimes acts as a clearing bank of sorts, an intermediary  between regional credit institutions. However, this can hardly  be called the rule. Interregional and interrepublic settlements  through foreign banks are difficult. This factor also reduces  the attractiveness of Western banks on the Russian market.    Fundamental restrictions imposed on the development of  foreign banks in Russia by the Central Bank are much more  significant than restrictions on operations with rubles, which  have been set forth in a presidential edict. This is all the  more so because, with a tacit approval from Neglinnaya Street,  foreign banks have embarked on operations with Russian currency  quietly and in a planned manner. The Central Bank came out  against the presidential restrictions right away. In turn, the  presidential edict does not provide for sanctions against  violators. The developed draft Law on the Bank of Russia and the  draft Law on Banks and Banking envision that, in the future, the  Central Bank will continue to regulate the operation of joint  and foreign banks and their branches in the Russian territory.</p>

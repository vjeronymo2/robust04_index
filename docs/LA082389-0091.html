			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder is returning to television. Snyder, who lost his job  with CBS sports 19 months ago after telling an interviewer blacks were better  athletes than whites because they were bred for strength during slavery, will  handicap pro football games this seasons for FNN's sports network. Snyder will  appear Saturday and Sunday nights on "Who Beat the Spread," a live football  analysis show, the cable network said Tuesday. The longtime handicapper, who  was part of CBS' "NFL Today" on-air team for 12 years, has been away from  television since his controversial statements, except for a show he did on the  NCAA basketball tournament for Black Entertainment Television.  </P></p>

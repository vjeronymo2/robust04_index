			<p>BFN     [Text] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] would like UN  Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] to stay in Rwanda, and has no  objection to the presence of Belgian blue helmets in the force.  We spoke to Jean-Baptiste Ndahumba, RPF spokesman in Brussels:    [Begin recording] [Ndahumba] We think that UN forces have to  stay in Rwanda, UNAMIR must continue its mission, perhaps under  different circumstances, but we need the help of the  international community, we need the help of Belgium, which must  return to our country once security is guaranteed. We want to  maintain cooperation with the international community and with  the United Nations.    [Unidentified correspondent] So the blue helmets will always  be welcome?    [Ndahumba] They can stay if their security is guaranteed,  and  we think that as soon as the foreign nationals have been  evacuated, we will do everything to bring back peace, order and  security to Kigali, and to the rest of the country.

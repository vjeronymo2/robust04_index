			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Drink: An Italian pioneer - Wine IN GREAT demand in Italy, widely exported, particularly to Germany and the US, the wines of Collio and Colli Orientali are known in the UK only in specialist circles. Indeed, not many wine amateurs in Britain could readily place them on the Italian wine map, for they come from a little-visited district on the extreme north-east frontier, pressing on the borders of what is now Slovenia: the region of Friuli-Venezia-Giulia. Two-thirds of the Collio vineyards are actually in Slovenia, and some Italian growers possess small vineyards across the border. Their particular quality derives from the micro-climatic position on the first folds of the Julian Alps that protect the vineyards from northerly winds and ensure moderate weather from the Adriatic. The controlled appellation applies only to the hillside slopes. The huge, flat vineyards, extending to the sea, produce enormous quantities of modest- quality dry whites, notably Grave del Friuli. Altogether Friuli contributes 1.5m hl to Italy's average output of 60m hl of red and white wine, but of this Collio produces only 120,000 hl and Colli Orientali 150,000 hl. Ninety per cent of the former is white; 70 per cent of the latter. The success of the wines is, by historic standards, recent. Generally, Italian white wine lacks distinction, although the wines of the Trentino and Alto Adige are improving and there is a small amount of very variable, expensive Gavi. However, 25 years ago Collio wines were almost unknown outside Friuli and were not all that special then. Much of the initiative for improvement is generally attributed to Mario Schiopetto, a man born in Udine, who studied engineering in the 1950s but did not finish the course. Instead, Schiopetto says, he drove trucks all over Europe and played rugby. In the early 1960s he opened an hosteria in Udine. The only wines available for sale were just plain rosso and bianco of undisclosed origin. If any were varietal this was not advertised. However, Schiopetto visited vineyards in France and Germany, and in 1964 he began traditional vinification methods by leasing 16 ha, which he acquired in 1988, from the Archbishop of Gorizia in the leading wine commune of Capriva. He said he used German techniques and French finesse on Italian grapes, and produced most of the wide range of white wines common in Collio, including Tocai, Sauvignon, Pinot Grigio, Malvasia and Ribolla Gialla. He sold these in his hosteria to those who liked what he described as natural wine, not sugared, not excessively high in alcohol nor blended with wines from other regions. He took his wines to exhibitions in Bologna, Milan and elsewhere, where he won gold medals between 1967 and 1969. In 1969 he sold his hosteria in order to concentrate on wine production. He wrote letters to professional men in Bologna, Milan and Turin, and took wine samples in a cold box to those who responded. This helped him introduce his wine to restaurants, where supplies tend always to be dominated by the big concerns. But his well-off private customers started to ask there for his wine. Since 1978 he has started using French barriques to ferment his wine - but only for red wines. He, like most of the other leading Collio growers, is against oak barriques for the local whites, which have good varietal qualities, because oak produces tannins that are not natural, and change a wine's character. This was echoed by another leading producer, Puiatti, whose wines are available from Wine Cellars, 153-155 Wandsworth High Street, London SW18. (Tel: 081-871-3979/3970). Puyatti says that oak 'standardises' the wines. He puts 30 per cent of his red wines (made from Merlot Cabernet) into barriques for one year; they are bottled after almost three, and the whites after six months. Ninety per cent of Schiopetto's wines are sold to restaurants all over Italy. His latest vintage was sold out by January at the fairly high price of 12,200 lire (Pounds 6) a bottle. His production averaged 140,000 bottles. The elegant, flowery Tocai 1991 that I tasted would, he said, be better after two years, and I agreed. I also sampled the typical but not aggressive Sauvignon 1991, with lots of flavour, and a delicious Pinot Bianco, from 1990 which contained 35 per cent Chardonnay and showed it on the bouquet. A 1990 Cabernet-Franc, just bottled, was closed but a Merlot '87, very light in colour, had a real 'claret' nose - a light wine to drink, for the Collio reds are not for keeping.</p>

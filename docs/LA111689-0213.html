			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: HEALTH/MEDICINE;  </P> <P> COMPANY WILL SELL ITS 7-MINUTE AIDS TEST KIT IN SWEDEN  </P> <P> Disease Detection International of Irvine has been given approval to sell test  kits in Sweden that, according to the company, indicate in just seven minutes  whether someone is infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> So far, the speediest test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to win  approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is one that takes about 90  minutes. Disease Detection said it intends to apply for FDA approval for its  seven-minute kit early next year.  </P> <P> Each kit is about the size of a credit card. To use it, a drop of blood is  placed on the surface, to which a clinician adds several chemicals. Infection  with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is indicated by a blue dot.  </P> <P> Disease Detection President and Chief Executive H. Thad Morris said these kits  are not intended for home use. The reason, Morris said, is the prevailing  belief that HIV diagnoses should be made in settings where professional  guidance is available.  </P> <P> "Our tests should only be used in the hands of professionals," Morris said.  </P></p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Mideast extremists lurking in the wings: Israeli withdrawal from Gaza-Jericho is fraught with danger Failure to achieve substantial progress at a summit yesterday between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, will leave Palestinians and Israelis feeling even more insecure in a land already rife with anxiety and violence. Israel had been due today to begin dismantling the military apparatus which, for more than two decades, has controlled the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho - captured during the 1967 Six Day War. It was unclear last night whether Israel would proceed as planned with the symbolic gestures designed to mark a historic, and probably irreversible, step towards Palestinian national self-determination. Both sides will have to face the consequences of delay. Even if a protocol is agreed within the next 10 days, the way ahead is fraught with danger. Public support for the peace process is at its lowest point since the September signing; violence, mistrust and suspicion have replaced enthusiasm. The PLO and the Israeli government will have to move fast to ensure that extremists do not exploit the lingering vacuum. For Palestinians that means an explicit demonstration by Israel that it is really handing over substantial power to a Palestinian authority and easing its military grip. For Israelis it largely means the PLO taking up the responsibility of office and using its embryonic police force to rein in attacks by Palestinians against Jews and increase security, which remains the touchstone of Israeli concern. The tasks will not be easy but both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat are badly in need of a boost. The most urgent need is to iron out the last remaining points of disagreement on a protocol which lays the framework for a phased four-month Israeli troop pull-out from Gaza-Jericho and the transfer of power from the Israeli military-run civil administration to Palestinian hands. Although Israel could begin a symbolic withdrawal today - dismantling barricades, redeploying troops away from some Palestinian-populated areas and releasing up to 1,500 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners - the real withdrawal cannot go ahead before the protocol is in place. Three key issues remain to be resolved: the size of the Jericho area, the role and number of Israeli troops who will stay behind to safeguard Jewish settlers, and control over border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and Jericho and Jordan. Despite the pessimistic tone of yesterday's meeting both sides believe agreement is within reach. But once the protocol is signed there are likely to be tough times during the months leading up to April 13, when Israeli military withdrawal must be completed. Detailed plans are in place for the transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinian hands - that part of the peace talks went relatively smoothly. However, implementation will be more difficult and will try the patience of both Palestinians and Israelis. Two critical concerns hang over the PLO. The first is whether the former liberation movement is ready to assume administration of the economically decimated, faction-riven Gaza Strip - home to 900,000 Palestinians. The top leadership of the PLO is deeply split, with mounting criticism about the authoritarian leadership of Mr Arafat and his preference for political appointees of his own generation, rather than professionals, to staff administrative bodies. Several key officials have resigned recently, charging Mr Arafat with an inability to respond to the challenge of governing or reforming the bureaucratic and centralised decision-making system. Secondly, there are deep doubts about Mr Arafat's willingness or ability to move against Palestinian extremists both inside and outside the PLO. Will he, for example, dispatch his police force to confiscate weapons from Islamic guerrillas intent on launching attacks across the Gaza border into Israel? Even if Mr Arafat wishes to do so he may be constrained by the domestic political situation and the prospect of elections next July (although to many Palestinians that date already seems optimistic). On the Israeli side the challenge of the next four months is equally formidable. Once the protocol is signed and Israeli withdrawal is in full flow Mr Rabin will have to rely on the safeguards enshrined in the peace accord and on the goodwill of the Palestinians. How long will the prime minister, already under intense domestic pressure, be able to hold out if Palestinian attacks do not subside? And can Mr Rabin, hanging on to power with a wafer thin parliamentary majority and an almost permanent coalition crisis, risk a showdown with increasingly militant Jewish settlers? Without more concrete peace dividends - such as better security, an end to the Arab boycott or peace with Jordan - the government will face an uphill battle selling its peace policy to a sceptical public. For both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat the real challenge ahead is managing their own constituencies. Both men will need each other's patience, goodwill and courage to make the process succeed and defeat the extremists waiting in the wings.</p>

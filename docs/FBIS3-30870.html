"They prove that a dangerous policy is currently  conducted in the Republic of Moldova, either for political  reasons or because of pressure from elsewhere. An anti-Romanian  policy comes to the fore, which we have mentioned before. We  were contradicted then, were told that the anti-Romanian policy  was not a policy deliberately conducted in Chisinau. Now, we  see that in fact these things were being secretly articulated in  the basements of the policy of the Republic of Moldova. I  believe our brothers across the Prut will know how to adequately  react to these shifted stresses and even changed road in the  policy promoted by the leadership in Chisinau. As for  ourselves, we will have to draw the necessary conclusions for  the future as concerns those with whom we can develop important,  constructive and efficient political links in the period ahead,"  the Chamber of Deputies speaker said.</p>

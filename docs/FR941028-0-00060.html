			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM has determined to adopt the proposed rule at &sect;773.22 as a final rule with minor modifications which are now described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, paragraph (b) of the proposed rule would have required that, if it appeared from information provided in the application pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of &sect;778.13, that none of the persons identified in the application had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority had to inquire of the applicant whether anyone other than those persons identified in the application would own or control the mining operation as either an operator or as another type of owner or controller. The final rule imposes the duty upon the regulatory authority to both inquire of the applicant and to investigate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, there may have been an implication that the regulatory authority could simply conclude its inquiry in reliance upon the applicant's explanation. Such an implication was not intended. Accordingly, OSM has added explicit language to paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.22 to insure that, if none of the persons identified in the permit application has had any previous mining experience, the regulatory authority will not simply rely upon the applicant's explanations. Instead, the regulatory authority will go forward to investigate whether any persons other than those identified in the application will conduct the mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final version of &sect;773.22, OSM has retained language from paragraph (c) of the proposed &sect;773.22 requiring the regulatory authority to take action in accordance with the provisions of &sect;843.23 or the State program equivalent. However, OSM has deferred action on the adoption of proposed &sect;843.23 for a later rulemaking. See 58 FR 34652  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (June 28, 1993). The reference to that rule has been left in final &sect;773.22 in the event that a final version of &sect;843.23 is adopted. The inclusion of such reference, however, does not prejudge whether OSM will ultimately adopt such a rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, paragraph (d) of the proposed rule would have required that, upon completion of the information review mandated by &sect;773.22, the regulatory authority promptly enter all ownership or control information into AVS. OSM has adopted the final version of this paragraph to require that, upon completion of its review, the regulatory authority enter ownership or control information ``into'' AVS. If such information is already on the system, the regulatory authority is required to ``update'' such information. Such changes have been made to provide better clarity to the rule language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 773.23_Review of Ownership or Control and Violation Information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM proposed &sect;773.23 as a new section which would delineate the regulatory authority's review obligations with respect to a permit application after the regulatory authority had completed the process of verifying ownership or control application information as described in &sect;773.22. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of paragraph (a) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required the regulatory authority to review all reasonably available information concerning violation notices and ownership or control links involving the applicant to determine whether the application could be approved under the provisions of 30 CFR 773.15(b). With respect to ownership or control links involving the applicant, such information would have included all information obtained under 30 CFR 773.22 and 778.13. With respect to violation notices, such information would have included all information obtained under &sect;778.14, information obtained from OSM, including information shown in the AVS, and information obtained from the regulatory authority's own records concerning violation notices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In substance, the proposed regulation was designed to assure that the regulatory authority considers complete ownership, control, and violation information in making the decision required by 30 CFR 773.15(b)(1) with respect to a permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;773.23 were proposed to provide the course of action which a regulatory authority would be required to take if the review conducted pursuant to paragraph (a) of the section disclosed any ownership or control link between the applicant and any person cited in a violation notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, paragraph (b)(1) of proposed &sect;773.23 would have required that the regulatory authority notify the applicant of such link and refer the applicant to the agency with jurisdiction over the violation notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

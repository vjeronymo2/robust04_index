			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / French Elections: Shocked ecologists see hopes collapse THE unexpected victims of yesterday's right-wing landslide were the two ecology parties, which received a possibly terminal blow to their hopes of becoming a force in national politics. According to early exit polls, Les Verts and Generation Ecologie pulled in a mere 8.5 per cent of the votes. That is around half of their score at the peak of their popularity at the turn of the year and well below the nearly 14 per cent they recorded in regional elections a year ago. As the count continued, it looked as if their first-round score could fall below 8 per cent, at which level they would win no seats. Their fate questions the commonly held belief that the Green movement was the main beneficiary of the Socialists' decline. 'A crushing majority (for the right) would bury France in concrete,' mourned Mr Antoine Waechter, leader of Les Verts, the more hardline of the ecology pair. He called on his election candidates to fight on to the second round 'however few in number'. He claimed the Greens had been victims of 'political manoeuvres and false candidatures'. The one positive element in yesterday's setback was that 'ecology was a confirmed part of the French political landscape', he claimed. His partner, Mr Brice Lalonde, a former Socialist environment minister, was less cheerful. The result was a 'disappointment' due partly to France's majority voting system and partly to the fact that other political groups had sought to steal the Green vote. Pre-election polls had shown that support for ecologists lay in what had been traditional Socialist territory - the young, graduates, middle managers and religious agnostics. Many observers believed the two parties' decision to make an electoral pact, as Entente des Ecologistes, after months of wrangling, would help them build on last year's regional election success. However, the pact failed to reconcile splits on a whole series of issues, from nuclear power to the strategy to adopt with a new government - a failure which appears to have sapped their credibility.</p>

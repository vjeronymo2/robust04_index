			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ismael Romero] </F>   [Text] The National Action Party [PAN] says a transition to  democracy and a state of law demands transformation of the  presidential institution. Consequently for the next six-year  term, PAN is proposing a government platform to limit the  executive's powers and an ample and in-depth reform of the  Constitution and bylaws regarding at least 50 key areas of  national aspects.    If Diego Fernandez de Cevallos wins the 21 August  presidential elections, he will stimulate during his first 100  days of government great respect for the separation of branches  and the federal pact, and he will encourage through the proper  legislative channels a reform of the fundamental Constitution  articles, such as 27, 123, 115, 4, and others, as well as of  basic laws, such as the Labor Law, the Law on the Congress of  the Union, the Law on the Responsibilities of Public Officials,  the Law on Foreign Trade, Energy, and National Fund for Workers'  Housing.    In addition, and as part of an in-depth administrative  reform, he will take firm steps to reinforce the executive,  legislative, and judicial branches, unincorporate the national  railroads, dissolve the Agrarian Reform Secretariat, and create  a national ombudsman's office for general rural development, a  general judicial council, a federal education council, and a  national housing committee.    Regarding human rights, PAN and its candidate suggest  reorganizing the national commission in charge of protecting  personal rights. PAN and its candidate have also outlined the  following government programs and plans: a national plan to  lower the level of poverty; a national housing plan; a national  plan for a balanced regional development; a new fishing  strategy; and a national program for the industrial and  commercial development of goods and services, among others.    The PAN government proposal is included in its 1994 to 2000  political platform in which the party and its candidate propose  four great challenges and five commitments "in view of the  national situation, full of uncertainty and injustice."    The challenges are: to stimulate the country's general  development to improve the lot of 40 million poor Mexicans; to  develop and reinforce national culture in a world inclined to  globalization; to abolish the sociopolitical system of abuse,  oppression, and impunity that has been imposed on Mexican  society; and to establish a system of freedom and full social,  civil, and political rights.    The commitments are: to create a state of law; to establish  a  training-education system in the country; to develop a humane  and modern economy; to provide the social and environmental  conditions to give the Mexican people dignity and a high  standard of living; and to practice an active international  policy, aimed at the national common good, which stimulates the  universal common good.    For PAN, "it is not hatred, overflowing revengeful passions,  a single-minded obsession to seize power, or the perversion of  politics and corruption but, rather, respect for humans and love  of the homeland and its virtues, and what can inspire programs  to solve the country's problems."  <H5>  Genuine State of Law </H5>   The result of an in-depth and extensive consultation among  its more than 140,000 active members, PAN's proposal states that  for the Mexican people the political system of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI] has reached "a dead-end" due to its  marked corruption and simulation of legality. For this reason,  this system cannot work in a state of law.    Human and political rights are violated; the Presidency  remains an "irresponsible" institution; the legislative branch  does not perform its proper functions; the judicial branch is  not autonomous; there is a "suffocating" centralism; there is no  democratic electoral system; dehumanization, depersonalization,  and depoliticization are reinforced through formal and informal  educational systems; crime and corruption worsen.    In sum, due to a lack of a state of law, the Mexican public  administration is plagued with corruption. As a result, the  public administration constantly affronts the people.    The party believes the creation of a state of law should  quickly be based on the following fields: political ethics;  structure and form of the Mexican state's organization; how the  people can participate; education and the formation of a  democratic culture; civil security; and the fight against  corruption.    The strategies and guidelines PAN is proposing are aimed at  protecting man's rights, given he is conceived until he dies.  For this purpose, PAN will insist on the need to reform Article  4 of the Constitution and establish that every human being, due  to his dignity, shall enjoy legal protection from the moment he  is conceived. PAN's proposal will reject the legalization of  abortion and suggest dispatching adoption procedures  expeditiously.    If he wins the presidential elections, Fernandez de  Cevallos' administration will call a nationwide human rights  conference aimed at revising the Constitution and laws and  adjusting our national legislation to the international human  rights framework, thus eliminating all reservations or  incompatibilities with international human rights treaties and  pacts signed and confirmed by Mexico.    Fernandez de Cevallos' administration will strengthen and  fine tune the government bodies created for the protection and  promotion of human rights and will promote legal reforms to  eliminate the authorities' influence on the labor unions'  internal affairs, their records, changes in leadership, and  right to strike. Other reforms will be made to guarantee  respect for "broad" rights, such as calm, public peace, life in  a healthy atmosphere and public decorum.    The Constitution will be subjected to further reforms to  limit the powers of the federal executive branch and to  eliminate its "metaconstitutional powers." For example, the  "secret allotments" granted the executive will be reduced.    The Congressional Organic Law and corresponding Internal  Regulation will be reformed to dignify the legislative branch  and expand its powers to include, among other things, the  investigation of serious and specific cases through special  commissions.    The judicial branch's autonomy will be respected, and a  general judicial council will be created to execute a system of  legal guarantees for appointments and impartial promotion for  members of that branch, and to resolve complaints by individuals  concerning the administration of justice.    PAN will also offer political decentralization and respect  for federalism. Thus, institutions and municipalities will be  granted powers that have been inappropriately assigned to the  executive.    Decisionmaking will be federalized, and to this end a  Federal  Tax Council and a contingency fund will be created to provide  timely help and resources for states and towns affected by  natural disasters or acute economic problems.    Municipal life will be respected and reforms to Article 115  will be promoted, thereby making it possible for municipalities  to impugn laws and actions by state or federal authorities who  violate their autonomy, deny, or withhold resources from them,  and so that town councils can come together under the  proportional system of representation with a dominant majority.  The democratic formation of metropolitan councils will be  promoted in cities and conurbations.    The federal government led by PAN will take "firm steps"  toward definitively establishing the legal foundations for fair  competition for power. To this end, it will seek to establish  actions for relief pertaining to electoral matters; to guarantee  the impartiality of the electoral authorities; to punish  behaviors that violate freedom and the secrecy of the vote; to  establish equality in competition; to foster and regulate public  debates between candidates and prohibit all parties from using  the fatherland's colors and symbols on their emblems.    Meanwhile, in addition to demanding the abolition of the  party-government system and guaranteeing equitable, honest, and  democratic elections, PAN will propose constitutional and  regulatory reforms to establish referendums, plebiscites, and  popular initiatives at the federal, state, and municipal levels.    Freedom of expression will be protected and respected as a  natural right and not as a state concession. The system of  discretional concessions for radio and television stations that  is in place will be replaced by a regulatory system of  authorization.    To guarantee citizens' security, constitutional and legal  reforms will be pursued to make the Attorney General's Office  autonomous; security and police corps will be reformed; the  Ministerial Police Force will be created; a national security  program will be designed; a national registry for police data  will be established; and citizen public security councils will  be formed.    A federal code of administrative procedures will be created  to reform the public administration. The Comptroller General's  Office will perform internal public administration tasks, and  the Chamber of Deputies Finance Accountancy [Contaduria Mayor de  Hacienda de la Camara de Diputados] will conduct audits. The  law on the responsibility of public workers will be made  stricter and more effective, and the National Human Rights  Committee will be authorized to receive complaints about  government officials who adversely affect the rights of  taxpayers and public service users. Likewise, the law will be  amended to recognize the state's civil responsibility toward  citizens and provide for their indemnification when required.  <H5>  New Relationship With The United States </H5>   On the international front, PAN believes that Mexico does  not  have an overall political strategy to face the challenges posed  by the new world order. Mexican foreign policy has been  fashioned according to the regime's interests, not to encourage  and defend national interests. This has resulted in the  adoption of "shameful" positions with tragic results for the  country.    There has been a heavy bias toward the U.S. option, which  prevents greater and more effective international pluralism.  World changes have heightened the Mexican political regime's  internal decadence, thus diminishing the country's negotiating  capacity and the honorability of its foreign policy.    PAN, therefore, includes in its government program a new  foreign policy that will not be just a trade proposal. The new  foreign policy will encourage review and renewal of diplomatic  practices and will respond to national interests. It will be an  active foreign policy not just a defensive foreign policy.    PAN will struggle to become multi-directional and pro-Latin  American. It will fight for overall reform of all multinational  organizations, the formation of a world parliamentary assembly,  a Latin American community of nations, and a Latin American  parliament.    In terms of Mexico's relations with the United States, PAN  believes they must be renewed based on five points: respect  between two democratic states, trade association, recognition of  socioeconomic differences, coordination in the solution of  conflicts, and vigorous defense of migrant Mexicans.    PAN argues that Mexican diplomacy will no longer be an  opportunity for prizes, political sinecures, or a pretext to  send adversaries into exile. The Mexican foreign service will  become professional and specialized.    Lastly, with a PAN administration, constitutional reforms  will be sought to broaden the foreign policy powers of the  Chamber of Deputies as well as to create a legal framework that  will allow control over economic and noneconomic aspects of  NAFTA and which will protect national interest. PAN will oppose  any NAFTA renegotiation that could reduce opportunities and  benefits.</p>

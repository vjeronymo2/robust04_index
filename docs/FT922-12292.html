			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / A kiss of life from across the border: Nicholas Denton explains why Hungary is looking to western investment to modernise industry and fuel an economic recovery Economic reform has created more pain than gain for most of east and central Europe, which is grappling with rising unemployment and falling incomes. But there are growing signs that Hungary could become the first post-communist economy to halt the spiral of decline as foreign investment rises to take up the slack created by weakening state industries. Hungary, the smallest of the three post-communist central European states, is quietly attracting the lion's share of western investment into the region. Foreign capital of more than Dollars 1.7bn flowed into Hungary last year as multinationals built greenfield plants and took over privatised state companies. The cumulative total since investment was liberalised in 1988 has now surpassed Dollars 3bn, about 60 per cent of the total for all of eastern Europe. Even so, foreign investment can only be supplementary to the mobilisation of domestic savings and the development of financial and other institutions needed for the more efficient capitalist utilisation of Hungary's own resources. Hungary's small size makes foreign investment more visible. Capital inflows came to more than 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1991 - a proportion more common in the rapidly growing economies of east Asia than eastern Europe. Foreign companies already dominate some industrial sectors. General Motors, Suzuki Motor Corporation and Ford have set up Hungary's car and component industry. Privatisation sales have placed the bulk of the cigarette, distilling, sugar, confectionery, bread, newspaper, paper, cement and glass industries in the hands of western groups. The prospect, in the more technology-intensive sectors of the economy at least, is one of western economic domination. Yet Hungary views this with an equanimity which marks it out from its neighbours. Hungary does not share the fears of German influence that fuel economic xenophobia in Poland and Czechoslovakia. It has no territorial disputes with Germany, and the two countries have been allies for much of the period since the First World War. Rather, the Budapest government is more wary of the potentially destabilising effect of the disintegration of Yugoslavia to its south and the fate of several million ethnic Hungarians in other neighbouring states. Consequently, Hungary views the western presence as securing rather than limiting its independence. 'National security can only be guaranteed by those big countries that have investment here and an interest that nothing happens to it,' says Mr Istvan Forrai, personal secretary to the prime minister, Mr Joszef Antall. Mr Forrai would doubtless appreciate the presence of Suzuki Motor Corporation's factory at Esztergom, which begins assembling cars this summer. The Japanese motor manufacturer is a more welcome occupier of the site than was its predecessor - the Red Army. Under the assembly line lies buried the firing range of the old Soviet military base. Budapest seeks foreign investment not only to introduce sophisticated technology and manufacturing techniques, but also to ease domestic financial constraints. Hungary is burdened with a foreign debt of Dollars 20bn, and has the highest per-capita borrowings in eastern Europe. Servicing such large borrowing is made possible only by inflows of foreign funds. The government has taken steps to draw in western capital by implementing an attractive investment regime. Ten-year tax concessions are available for joint ventures in manufacturing and licences for foreigners are required only in banking. Policy-makers have also taken a liberal stance towards the disposal of state industries. Privatisation has been as far as possible to state company managers and foreign buyers have been encouraged. Last year, about 80 per cent of privatisation sales were to foreign companies. Cost considerations and market potential have also played their part. Labour costs are a fraction of those in western Europe, though the gap is gradually closing. Even at General Motors' new Szentgotthard car and engine plant, which pays well above the average, labour costs of DM 4 (Pounds 1.40) per hour are about a tenth of west German levels. But productivity is also low, and companies such as General Electric have laid off thousands of workers as part of their reorganisation. What they have found, however, is that highly educated research and scientific workers are significantly cheaper than in the west. GE has moved four of its nine lighting research centres to Tungsram, its Hungarian lightbulb-making subsidiary. Investors, particularly from Japan and the US, have also been attracted by Hungary's location. Situated alongside the European Community, and having concluded a free trade pact with the EC which took effect last March, Hungary provides a strategic export base from which to exploit western Europe's market. Many western companies are looking not only to meet EC demand but to establish a presence in the Hungarian market in anticipation of the country's eventual economic take-off. The logic is straightforward for companies such as Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company, which recently took over the margarine, detergent and soap business of Hungary's NMV. Mr Jan de Jong, Unilever's regional director for continental Europe, describes the investment as a bridgehead to establish a market share and to provide a base for expansion. The twist is that the potential of the Hungarian market itself depends on the ability of foreign investors to invigorate the local economy after last year's 8 per cent drop in GDP. Some effects of foreign capital inflows are visible. Already, these funds have eased Hungary's balance of payments, allowing the central bank to quintuple foreign exchange reserves from a nadir in 1990 of Dollars 800m to more than Dollars 4bn. In individual companies, where foreign involvement has had time to work, the results have been impressive. In two years at its Tungsram plant, GE has raised production by 28 per cent with 30 per cent fewer employees. The company has made Hungary its worldwide centre for producing small fluorescent lamp bulbs. Joint ventures, collectively, have also performed much better than the average Hungarian company. Sales and profits per employee are about double the average, and hard-currency earnings per head almost triple, according to the most recent official statistics. For the foreign companies which have moved into Hungary, as for the Hungarian government, the question remains whether the influx of capital and expertise will reach the level needed to trigger general economic expansion. When growth does resume, possibly as early as the end of the year, much of the benefit will accrue to foreign companies. But Hungary, impatient to raise living standards to those of its western neighbours, believes that part of the loaf is better than none.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HUNGARY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10                           Partner/                     Investment Investors       Nationality       venture      Sector        (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Motors   US-Germany    GM Hungary      Car &amp; Components      289 Suzuki, C Itoh        Japan    Magyar Suzuki   Cars                  235  &amp; IFC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General Electric         US    GE-Tungeram     Lighting              200 Sanofi               France    Chinoin         Pharmaceuticals       190  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Guardian Glass           US    Hungard         Glass                 115 Ferruzzi,     Italy-Neth-UK    NMV             Food &amp; detergents     100  Unilever  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Electrolux           Sweden    Lehel           Fridges                90 Ford                     US    Ford Hungaria   Car components         83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prinzhom Group      Austria    Dunapack        Paper                  82 Sara Lee                 US    Compack         Food                   80  (Douwe Egbert)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Ministry of International Economic Relations, Janos Martonyl  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

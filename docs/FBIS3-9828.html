			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Solidarity: We Expected To Be Treated </F> Seriously"]    [Text] Solidarity ["S"] is outraged at the statement by  Deputy Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, who, following  the session of the Social-Political Committee of the Council of  Ministers [RM] and the Economic Council of the RM, stated that  there are no formal obstacles for discussing the "S" demands in  substantive negotiations. However, the negotiations should be  held in the Trilateral Commission and in teams negotiating  social guarantees. "S" is waiting for the RM to make a  statement on the talks of the union and government experts. "Any  delaying of the date will be treated by us as a breach of the  agreement," we were told by "S" Experts' Team Chief Stanislaw  Alot.    Today [30 March] in Katowice, the "S" Protest Headquarters  will convene. It is possible that, if the government rejects  this information, we will decide to stage a general strike.    In the context of the above-mentioned statement by  Cimoszewicz, National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak  stressed that, "during talks with government experts, the `S'  experts proved that all demands submitted by our union, except  those demanding state property for citizens and the introduction  of a 40-hour workweek, must be negotiated only between the  Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and the government."    "By making a statement on the issue of representativeness,  Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a lawyer, justice minister, and deputy  prime minister, demonstrated compromising ignorance. One cannot  mistake the representativeness of a party in parliamentary  elections for the representativeness of organizations of  employers and employees--that is, trade unions," declared Zak.  It is worth recalling that Cimoszewicz said in the television  program "Panorama" that the issue of representativeness had not  been resolved so far, and that "the labor world decides through  its membership, paying subscription fees, and voting in  parliamentary elections": "Because of that, the  representativeness of "S" might be questioned. We are not doing  that; we are treating this union seriously; however, we will not  allow anyone to dictate anything to us," said Cimoszewicz. "S"  demands that the representativeness of unions be observed,  especially in the Trilateral Committee negotiations.    "For the time being, the deputy prime minister is not the  RM," stated Alot, and added that they are awaiting the  government opinion. "The declarations were unequivocal: The  information will be submitted at the next RM session."    According to Alot, the "S" demands have been presented in a  better form than the election programs of some parties: "We  expected to be treated seriously."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said  NATO's recent air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces made him  cancel his April 21 trip to Brussels to seal Russia's membership  in the North Atlantic alliance's Partnership for Peace program.    Kozyrev told Interfax on Thursday that he had repeatedly  said  April 21 was only a tentative date for the start of his visit to  the Belgian capital. "I'm getting the impression that Russia's  partners in the West, especially in NATO, have not yet found  correct solutions" concerning Russia's participation in the  Partnership for Peace, he said. "We are interested in a much  more serious approach and not merely in the discussion of some  kind of framework document. The Foreign and Defense Ministries  of the Russian Federation have formulated proposals to that  effect, and now they are thinking about a more serious format  for a relationship with NATO," Kozyrev said.

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROOKIE'S 4 RBIS POWER ANGELS, 9-4  </P> <P> Lee Stevens was not quite 3 when Bert Blyleven made his major league pitching  debut in June of 1970. Stevens has grown up since then, but Blyleven has only  grown a beard.  </P> <P> Stevens' first major league home run helped Blyleven earn the 279th victory of  his career Friday, providing the first three runs as the Angels beat the  Indians, 9-4, at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Blyleven (8-5) lasted only five innings, giving up three earned runs and 10  hits before yielding to Mike Fetters, but it was enough for the Angels' chief  prankster to get his first victory in five starts since June 21.  </P> <P> Blyleven, 39, acknowledged that he was lucky to win, but Angel Manager Doug  Rader was somewhat more charitable. "The bottom line is that the kid won," he  said, before realizing his error. "Our elderly child. Our aging adolescent,  however you want to say it."  </P> <P> Stevens acknowledged feeling some awe when he became a teammate of players he  had always watched from afar. But he showed no respect for a changeup thrown by  Bud Black (8-5) in the first inning, lining it off the facing of the  terrace-level seats in right-center field. That ended Black's streak of 23 1/3  scoreless innings and made Stevens the first left-handed Angel hitter to homer  off a left-handed pitcher since Wally Joyner did it against Milwaukee's Tony  Fossas May 27.  </P> <P> "It's kind of weird playing with players I've seen on TV over the years," said  Stevens, who drove in a run in the sixth as the Angels scored four runs.  </P> <P> "Going out there and seeing Keith Hernandez (Cleveland's first baseman)  especially. But once you get out there, you realize you're on the same field  and you've just got to do your job."  </P> <P> The bullpen did its job in two aspects Friday. First, the relievers coaxed  Stevens' home run ball away from a fan, who had caught it after Cleveland's  Mitch Webster retrieved the ricochet and tossed it into the stands.  </P> <P> "The guys in the bullpen traded a different ball for it," Stevens said. "I'm  real happy they did. I'm sure I'll keep it forever."  </P> <P> The bullpen's more traditional role was filled honorably by Fetters, who gave  up only two hits in four innings to earn his first career save -- in the majors  or minors -- and the bullpen's first save in 15 games since July 2.  </P> <P> "I saw that, and that makes it great to get my first save and the first in a  while for the bullpen," Fetters said. "The offense was outstanding, and I felt  good. My arm strength was there."  </P> <P> Stevens' strength in lining Black's pitch 390 feet was impressive, but Rader  was equally impressed by the rookie's ability to hit a changeup. "There's no  way in the world he's looking for that," Rader said of Stevens, who was  promoted from triple-A Edmonton Monday. "When you're in that kind of position  physically to hit that pitch, able to handle it, you're pretty well locked in."  </P> <P> Despite the early lead provided by Stevens, the game wasn't a lock for the  Angels. Cleveland came back with a run in the second on three consecutive  singles, to which the Angels replied with a run in the bottom of the second on  Donnie Hill's RBI single. The Indians scored twice in the third to pull to 4-3,  but Brian Downing's chop-double down the right-field line scored Lance Parrish  to make the score 5-3.  </P> <P> Cleveland scored again in the fifth against Blyleven, who failed to go more  than five innings for the second game in a row. But the Angels got to Black and  Steve Olin for four in the sixth, an inning highlighted by Parrish's two-run  double and Stevens' RBI on a fielding error by Hernandez groundout that allowed  Dave Winfield to score from third.  </P> <P> "I expect a lot out of myself, more than five innings," Blyleven said, "but it  seemed like the guys picked me up and every time I made a mistake, the offense  was there to pick me up. . . . When you give up 10 hits in five innings, you  can't say every pitch was good. I was very fortunate to be on the winning side.  Mike Fetters really picked me up.  </P> <P> "I've played 20 years and I know there's not too many wins that come this way.  You have to appreciate them. Very nice. Wins are very hard to get in the big  leagues. Anybody could lose here but not everybody can win here."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Dave Winfield declined to comment on remarks by New York Yankee owner George  Steinbrenner during Steinbrenner's testimony before Commissioner Fay Vincent.  The transcripts of Steinbrenner's remarks were made public this week. Among the  reasons Steinbrenner said he paid gambler Howard Spira $40,000 was for Spira to  uncover damaging information about Winfield and the charitable foundation  Winfield oversaw when he played in New York.  </P> <P> Winfield, who acknowledged that he has read the transcripts, said he would  release a statement when Vincent issues a ruling. Vincent is expected to  announce his action, if any, within a week.  </P> <P> Game 93 brought lineup 92 for the Angels, with Johnny Ray hitting seventh and  Dante Bichette hitting eighth. "Just trying to spread out the offense a little  bit," Manager Doug Rader said. "I'm trying to figure out a way to play some  offense for more than just a few innings a game."  </P> <P> The Angels are batting .248, tied with Baltimore for the league's lowest. Their  332 RBIs rank 13th.  </P> <P> Bob McClure threw for 20 minutes and felt excellent, according to trainer Rick  Smith. The next step for McClure, who has been sidelined all season because of  a sore left elbow, would be pitching in simulated games or a rehabilitation  assignment. Smith said infielder Mark McLemore has nearly recovered from a  sprained right wrist.  </P></p>

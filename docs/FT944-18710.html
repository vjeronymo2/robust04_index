			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Vietnam exchange to open Vietnam's first securities exchange is expected to open early next year, the official Vietnam News Agency reported at the weekend. Quoting the central State Bank, it said the exchange would start 'on a very small scale', with trading in bonds issued by the government, local authorities, commercial banks and state companies. Trading in shares of privatised state companies, only a handful of which have so far issued stock to shareholders, will follow later. The report confirmed that the State Bank and Finance Ministry's joint committee on setting up the exchange intended to go ahead despite the slow pace of privatisation. Vietnam, which currently has no secondary markets, sees the stock exchange as a vital part of market-oriented reforms launched in the late 1980s.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / House starts in Japan slow down JAPANESE housing starts, which have been one of the few bright spots in an increasingly bleak economic landscape, may be slowing down, the country's construction ministry reported yesterday. The ministry said housing starts appeared to be entering a slowdown phase after their strong growth in the second half of last year, with a 0.9 per cent rise in January compared with the same month last year. The slowdown is likely to add to pressure for the government to include tax credits on housing in a special package to stimulate the economy. The package is expected to be announced soon after the original budget for 1993 passes through parliament later this month. For the past few months the strong growth of housing starts has been one of the few straws in the wind that economic policymakers have pointed to as evidence that the economy may not be heading for outright recession. The marginal rise in housing starts in January followed a 5.4 per cent rise in December. The construction ministry expects that housing starts for February will be below the level of last year, particularly because fewer houses for rent are being built. Generally, however, the construction industry is starting to feel the full force of the sharp increase in public works spending under the Y10,700bn (Pounds 63bn) emergency spending programme announced last year. Orders received by the country's top 50 contractors in January were 7.6 per cent up on the year before, the first annual increase for nine months. The rise was due to a 60 per cent jump in public sector demand. The financial authorities hope this public spending will gradually feed its way through into higher production in industries such as steel and chemicals, which will in turn stimulate investment. Consumer spending is likely to remain severely depressed however. Household spending fell by 0.9 per cent in real terms in December, while new vehicle registrations last month were 7.9 per cent down on last year, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association. Isuzu Motor, which is pulling out of passenger car production, reported a 27 per cent drop in registrations. Japanese companies' profits are likely to suffer a continuing squeeze, according to official figures published yesterday which show that unit labour costs rose by 8.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year and by 4.7 per cent in January. Productivity was 7.5 per cent down in January on the year before.</p>

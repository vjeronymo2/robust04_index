			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following 8 comments relate specifically to NEPA concerns raised by one or two commenters (but may also have been mentioned by others). One of these commenters submitted detailed comments to support its position that the proposed action will have a ``significant'' impact under NEPA and therefore requires a DEIS. However, NMFS does not concur with the commenter's interpretation that CEQ regulations state that certain factors (which follow and are evaluated below) are ``critical'' for making a determination relating to the ``intensity'' of the action. CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.27) require these factors ``to be considered'' in evaluating the intensity of the proposed action. As discussed below, these factors were given consideration by NMFS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Adverse impacts far outweigh any beneficial impacts (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(1)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> According to the Navy, ship shock testing, while possibly having a short-term impact on the marine environment, also has a beneficial impact in ensuring the health and safety of seamen onboard the Nation's naval vessels. In its EA, NMFS found that the proposed activity ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> issuance of regulations and a LOA) will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and thus made a ``finding of no significant impact.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EA fails to address the degree to which the proposed action affects the public health and welfare. The commenter was concerned that, because a variety of potentially harmful compounds from the explosive could persist in surface pools for 30&hyph;60 minutes after detonation, this could result in subtle and long-term effects on marine mammals and birds (40 CFR 1508.27(b)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS disagrees. First, as stated in the EA (page 47), and as provided for under CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.21), NMFS has incorporated by reference the Navy EA written in 1990 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . While identifying that document more clearly on that page may have improved the EA, the Navy EA was cited in the references. That document described in some detail the potential impacts on the human environment from explosives detonation. NMFS incorporated this information by reference but did not include discussion in its EA, that part of the Navy EA that discussed impacts on humans, because NMFS was of the opinion that the proposed small take authorization would not have an impact on public health or safety, and was therefore not relevant. However, because NMFS' proposed action may affect the environment that marine mammals inhabit, NMFS' EA does note that while 100 percent of the solid material and approximately 10 percent of the gases would be contained in the water pool created by the explosion (an area 10.8 X 107 ft3 (3.06 X 106 m3) for the 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge), the concentrations shown are below the levels considered harmful for fish and would not be expected to pose a threat to marine mammals after the stabilization times (53 minutes for 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) charge). The commenter's concern however, is apparently on the impact to marine mammals and other marine life entering the surface pool before stabilization ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> less than 53 minutes after detonation). Assuming these marine mammals were not within the 2-nm safety zone at the time of detonation, NMFS believes that the likelihood of this occurring is remote and if it happens there will be little or no effect, either singly or cumulatively, from the chemical components of the surface pool. As noted in the Navy EA, the chemical components (primarily composed of gases) would be thoroughly dispersed, with no possible buildup or cumulative effect, and become indistinguishable from other trace level constituents of the ocean shortly after detonation. The only solid particles are carbon and aluminum oxide. Carbon particles will tend to float on the surface and move with the pool while aluminum oxide particles, a naturally occurring component of seawater due to the weathering of rock, will probably settle to the bottom over a large area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Naval Air Station, Pt.

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Spring Budget: Green taxes lose their pre-Budget lustre - Why environmental levies have fallen off the government's agenda THE oil industry is bracing itself for rises in petrol and diesel taxes in the chancellor's Budget on March 16, but otherwise environmental policy is likely to be notable by its absence. That is in spite of the fondness of Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, for using financial instruments to achieve environmental targets. Tax rises for automotive fuel might be presented as environmental instruments as transport emissions are the fastest-rising cause of air pollution, but the more important motive is likely to be raising revenue. When the chancellor completed the abolition of the 10 per cent special car tax in the Autumn Statement he hinted that steps would be taken in the Budget to recoup the money. The thrust of recent transport policy - that move, combined with intense debate about road pricing - has been to tax use of vehicles rather than ownership. It would seem more likely that the government would raise the tax on petrol and diesel rather than the vehicle excise duty. Abolition of the special car tax will cost Pounds 1.5bn in a full year, according to the Treasury. To recoup that an increase of 3.3 pence per litre on automotive fuels would be needed, oil industry estimates show. The question fuel companies are asking is whether the chancellor would go further - several say privately they are braced for a rise of at least 5 pence per litre. It is difficult to portray this as an environmental measure - even though the Department of the Environment will doubtless try - because vehicle fuel price rises have little impact on how much people use their vehicles. That characteristic - increasing the attractiveness of a tax increase to the Treasury - was demonstrated during the 1973 oil price rises, according to Mr David Parker of the Petroleum Industry Association, although drivers gradually moved to more fuel-efficient vehicles. The much-discussed carbon or energy tax to help combat global warming is unlikely to make an appearance in the Budget, in spite of the Clinton administration's introduction of a US energy tax. Mr Robert Jones, chairman of the Commons environment committee, has argued that a carbon tax - intended to persuade the energy sector to move to less carbon-intensive fuels, such as gas and nuclear fuels - would be pointless if the government were to subsidise the coal industry. Carbon or energy taxes in the UK are likely only as part of an EC-wide move to reduce the impact on competitiveness, and Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner, has warned there is unlikely to be much progress this year. Labour may welcome caution in devising such taxes as it is concerned about the impact on poorer families. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said: 'We hope that they will carefully consider all the possible social effects before moving ahead.' The government is also likely to think that the introduction of a levy on landfills - licensed rubbish dumps - would be premature. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the consultancy, has just completed a preliminary study for the environment department on a levy designed to encourage incineration of waste and to a lesser extent recycling. Mr Smith says the UK government and Brussels are less serious about environmental policy than they were several years ago. The Budget is likely to strengthen the opinion that environmental policy is fighting for its place on the political agenda.</p>

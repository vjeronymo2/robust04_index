			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Restructuring hits Rhone-Poulenc: French group plans Dollars 1bn asset sales and promises an advance in full-year profits Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, should achieve a significant increase in net profits this year, despite a 69 per cent fall in results for the first six months, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman, said yesterday. Announcing a decline in net profits, from FFr1.08bn (Dollars 200m) in the first half of 1993 to FFr337m for the first six months of this year, Mr Fourtou said that a strong improvement in the group's operating result and capital gains from asset sales would push full-year results above the FFr962m recorded in 1993. Shares in the company, which have climbed over the past few weeks, rose by FFr2.7 to FFr141.5. This compares with a price of FFr135 per share for the public offer through which the privatisation of the company was completed last autumn. Mr Fourtou said that Rhone-Poulenc planned to sell more than Dollars 1bn of assets. Capital gains from these disposals should offset exceptional charges this year. He declined to give details of the possible sales. Industry observers believe the bulk of disposals will come from the company's basic chemicals operations. The main first-half hit came from restructuring charges. Rhone-Poulenc took about FFr900m of provisions for rationalisation, mainly at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its US pharmaceuticals subsidiary. Reduced gains from asset sales were another factor in the decline in first-half profits. Income from this source fell from FFr204m in the first half of 1993 to FFr57m this time. At the trading level, however, Mr Fourtou outlined an encouraging performance in the first six months. Sales rose across the company's principal divisions, prompting a 5.9 per cent rise in turnover to FFr42.38bn. At the operating level, profits before provisions and non-recurring items increased by 14.6 per cent to FFr4.04bn. The group's organic and inorganic chemicals division benefited from a rise in volume, although prices remained below the 1993 level, increasing turnover from FFr7.15bn to FFr7.43bn. The fibres and polymers division and the healthcare operations also saw a strong advance. A stronger than expected second-quarter performance lifted operating results in the agricultural division from FFr629m to FFr916m. Mr Fourtou said the group would continue its restructuring effort to concentrate on its core businesses and reduce debts, which rose from FFr24bn at the end of last year to FFr25.5bn at the end of June.

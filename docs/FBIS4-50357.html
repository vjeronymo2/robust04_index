The 27-member delegation including 11 Japanese congressmen  arrived here today at the invitation of the CPC.    Ding, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended a  warm  welcome to the delegation, saying that the SDPJ had made  long-term efforts for the normalization and sound development of  Sino-Japanese ties before it set up relations with the CPC 10  years ago.    After the establishment of relations between the CPC and  SDPJ  in 1984, he noted, the SDPJ has played a positive role in  promoting Sino-Japanese ties.    Ding stressed that in the current situation today, no matter  what changes on the Japanese political scene, the CPC will  positively develop its friendly exchanges and cooperation with  the SDPJ on the basis of the principles of independence, total  equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's  internal affairs.    He expressed the belief that the delegation's current China  visit will make new contributions to the two parties' ties and  the two peoples' friendly cooperation.    Wataru said that his party attaches great importance to the  ties with the CPC and China. The main purpose of their current  China visit is to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the  establishment of relations between the SPDJ and CPC, he added.    He pointed out that a sound relationship between Japan and  China is in the best interests of the peoples of the two  countries and beneficial to world peace and stability.

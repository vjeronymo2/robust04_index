			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: High cost of languages Sir, Your leader, 'Europe's parliament' (May 3) drew attention to some of the procedural reforms necessary within the European Parliament if it is going to earn greater credibility. Surprisingly, you made no mention of the huge cost of multilingualism within that institution. When Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway become full members of the European Union, three further working languages will be added, increasing even further the cost of translating and interpreting. Surely a case for Esperanto? Hilary Chapman, 8 Vardre View, Pentywyn Road, Deganwy, Conwy, Gwynedd LL31 9TE</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Technology: Triple therapy offers high-cost hope - International Aids conference / A look the struggle for resistance At nearly every presentation on the effectiveness of HIV drug therapies at the 10th International Conference on Aids this week, one of the biggest concerns to have emerged is resistance. The rapid speed at which the virus replicates, and the frequency with which it mutates, mean that HIV can alter itself extraordinarily fast and can, therefore, side-step the drugs administered to stop it. The result is that even the latest and most promising medicines, such as protease inhibitors, are likely to work for only a limited time. Joseph Vacca of Merck explained that his company's protease inhibitor L-735524 can almost eliminate the virus from the blood within two weeks. But after only four weeks, the levels start to rise again as the virus builds up resistance. One possible solution is to use a combination of drugs. Miklos Salgo, director of virological therapeutic research at Roche, showed that when saquinavir, the protease inhibitor also known as Invirase, was used on its own, resistance built up quite quickly. But when used in combination with other medicines, the deterioration in performance was much less rapid. The theory is that the chances of the virus finding the right mutation to overcome two drugs is less than those of overwhelming one. And the chances of the virus beating three treatments are even smaller. Pharmaceuticals groups are now busy preparing to test such triple therapies. The main problem with such treatment, however, even if it does turn out to be effective, will be one of cost. In those countries able to afford available therapies, many patients are only able to gain access to such medicines with the assistance of governments, or by means of compassionate programmes set up by the drugs groups themselves. The already large gap between cost and financial resources is likely to widen. Stefano Vella of the Istituto Superiore Di Saneta in Italy has suggested that the development of polymerase chain reaction technology, which permits doctors to estimate the level of virus in the blood, could allow physicians to monitor regularly the effectiveness of treatments. That would allow them to chop and change multiple therapies for maximum effect. While such therapy may improve the survival and quality of life of Aids and HIV-positive patients, the cost implications of such individual therapy are horrific and could undermine many governments' recent healthcare cost-containment efforts. The cost of available therapies is already beyond the means of the vast majority of HIV-positive and Aids patients - those who live in the developing world. Retrovir, the leading Aids therapy, costs more than Dollars 2,500 (Pounds 1,600) a year. That compares with annual healthcare expenditure of between Dollars 5 and Dollars 10 per capita. The most cost-effective form of healthcare is undoubtedly vaccination. But the international Aids vaccine programme has hit the buffers because the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases decided this summer not to go ahead with large-scale trials that would prove the effectiveness of an HIV vaccine. The reasons for the institute's decision were complicated. However, recent data suggested that although the vaccines could create immunity for HIV strains in the laboratory, it was unlikely to disable those in the real world. The institute decided the risks of the trial - possible HIV infection by administering the vaccine, and the danger that those vaccinated might assume they were immune and so undertake more risky behaviour - outweighed the benefits. Dani Bolognesi of Duke University Medical Centre in North Carolina said the consequences of the decision were far reaching. For the US, it meant that trials would be delayed for between one and three years. For the rest of the world, and particularly for the developing world, the US decision has created a desperate dilemma. The WHO had been planning to test the vaccine in Brazil, Thailand, Uganda and Rwanda (which is now impracticable). The Brazilian government initially refused to participate because it was worried its citizens were being used as guinea-pigs. Its concerns, and those of other countries, that vaccines not safe or effective enough for the first world could be dumped on third world volunteers, are likely to be heightened. However, African speakers were vehement in their support for the trials. Edward Mbidde from Mulago Hospital in Uganda said the risk-benefit equation was different in Africa from the US. In Africa there was no alternative to a vaccine: increased use of condoms, clinics for sexually transmitted diseases, education and counselling would never be affordable in Africa, he said. A vaccine was the continent's only hope. The only way to test whether it worked was to start trials. Natth Bhamarapravati of Mahidol University at Salaya, Thailand, said the only way to test whether a vaccine worked was to start trials. Testing on animals gave no indication of a human vaccine's effectiveness. The trials clearly had to be ethical, he said, or the companies and organisations involved would be accused of human experimentation. The cost of a three-year trial involving 9,000 people to test the effectiveness and safety of a vaccine would be only Dollars 45m - less than the cost of a single F16 fighter jet.</p>

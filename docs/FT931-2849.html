			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities rally The utilities areas of the market were given a thorough mauling by marketmakers at the outset of trading, with share prices commonly marked down by around 2 per cent after the Budget moves to introduce VAT on domestic fuel and power from April 1994. The reduction in advance corporation tax was seen as a small plus for the water stocks. But early losses in the utilities were quickly regained and replaced by large-scale rises as dealers reported a sudden burst of buying interest, apparently from institutions seeking high yields and top quality dividend potential. Southern Electric, the only regional electricity stock in the FT-SE 100, fell to 471p but rebounded to end a net 7 up at 487p. The power generators were virtually unchanged on balance but water shares finished a busy day with good rises. Of the Footsie stocks, Anglian gained a net 7 at 529p, after 518p, as did North West, at 517p, after 507p. The banks sector was one of the few areas of the market to attract any sustained buying interest. Barclays was the pick of the banks, closing a net 5 higher at 405p after heavy turnover of 8m shares, with US investors said to have been keen supporters of the stock, in spite of the recent halved dividend and the Pounds 2.5bn worth of provisions against bad debts. A round of visits to UK institutions by Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays' chairman, is also said to have gone down well. Details of the January retail sales, which accompanied the February headline figure, helped several stores stocks. The statistics showed footwear sales up 23 per cent and womenswear ahead 22 per cent. Among those benefiting, Stylo was steady at 126p and Storehouse up a penny at 198p, as was Sears, at 96p. Burton rose 1 1/2 to 78p in 9.4m turnover. Talk that Dixons had hit a patch of dull trading, together with a downgrade, knocked the shares, which tumbled 10 to 223p. Analysts who had recently met the high street electrical retailer said its US business was thought to be continuing flat and that the UK recovery had slowed. Morgan Stanley was said to have downgraded its current year forecast by around 15 per cent. Higher costs at Boots were said to be behind a downgrade from Nomura, but the house stressed that they were one-off and did not affect the fundamentals. The shares dropped 11 to 506p. Relief that VAT had not been levied on books and newspapers lifted the tightly held John Menzies 20 to 471p and WH Smith 3 to 450p. EMAP, up 16 at 348p, Telegraph, ahead 7 at 337p, Trinity International, 9 higher at 323p, and United Newspapers, 12 to the good at 547p, were also beneficiaries. VAT relief was shortlived among the food retail issues, where an initial rise was quickly wiped out as sellers moved into the market. Argyll Group tumbled 9 to 375p with 5.1m traded, J. Sainsbury eased a penny to 518p, and Tesco lost 8 to 252p in turnover of 10m. Asda, said to be giving out bullish sales talk in meetings with analysts, appreciated 1 1/4 to 73 3/4 p. Takeover talk was again heard around Nurdin &amp; Peacock as the shares surged 16 to 218p. Firm sugar prices and a determined buyer were said to be behind a rise of 3 to 432p for Tate &amp; Lyle, while United Biscuits was firm ahead of today's results, for which a confident statement is being predicted. The shares put on 2 at 388p. A gloomy leisure sector was enlivened by talk of possible advance corporation tax benefits to selected leisure stocks, although analysts remained both frustrated by lack of detailed information and divided over the exact amounts. The sentiment helped Rank Organisation, which improved from early weakness to close 6 off at 666p, Ladbroke, finally only 2 easier at 195p, and Forte, 4 off at 197p. Hi-Tec shares reacted badly to news of the departure on Tuesday of non-executive directors Sir Michael Edwardes and Mr Richard Fenhalls. The stock touched 35p before recovering to 40p for a fall of 9 on the day. They had been with the board less than two weeks. Investors continued to hunt for yield attractions in the property sector. Frogmore Estates jumped 20 to 391p, Greycoat added 1 1/2 at 15 1/2 p, Hammerson 'A', where bid speculation continues, climbed 9 to 375p, and Land Securities rose a penny to 506p on 5.2m traded. Bargain hunters in Gestetner, together with suggestions that the full year's dividend may be maintained, helped the stock brush aside a warning from the chairman at the annual meeting that profits will be hit in the short term by falling sales, redundancy and property-letting costs. Having retreated over the last two sessions following a sell recommendation from NatWest Securities, the shares closed 7 better at 123p. However, the securities house maintained that it still expected a 'hard landing' for the stock due to continued weakness in its European markets. News of the appointment of a new finance director at TI Group cheered the market, sending the shares forward 6 to 325p in trade of 3m. Yield buyers for APV ahead of figures expected next week helped the shares advance 5 1/2 to 120 1/2 p. Among transport stocks, the UK chancellor's commitment to a high speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel boosted tunnel operator Eurotunnel and the shares improved 4 to 489p.</p>

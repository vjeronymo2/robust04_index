			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Slower growth for Norway Norway's economy will expand more slowly next year, according to Mr Torstein Moland, central bank governor. He told a seminar in London yesterday that gross domestic product growth next year should fall to 2.5-3 per cent, as consumption became more subdued. The rise in consumer prices was down to 0.9 per cent in April but has since risen to 1.7 per cent, reflecting higher excise duties introduced in July. Mr Moland said that if wage inflation could be limited to 3 per cent this year and next, overall inflation would remain at 2 per cent in 1995. Traditional exports, excluding oil and shipping, had risen in value terms by 12 per cent this year, Mr Moland said. The improvement in the economy had reduced Norway's vulnerability to oil price fluctuations and the current account would remain in balance next year.</p>

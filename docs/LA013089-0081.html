			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The outlawed Irish Republican Army pledged to take greater care to avoid  causing civilian casualties after its political supporters criticized the  guerrilla group for a series of botched bomb attacks in Northern Ireland. The  pledge came in a message from the IRA's "army council" to the annual conference  in Dublin, Ireland, of the group's legal political arm, Sinn Fein. However, the  IRA said it will continue attacks against British military and security forces.  Twenty-three civilians have been killed since November, 1987, by the IRA in  guerrilla operations that went wrong.  </P></p>

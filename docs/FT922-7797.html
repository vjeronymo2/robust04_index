			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Venture group boosts investment THE venture capital group 3i has nearly doubled its level of new investment in the UK in the past six months, helped by increasing confidence in the economy. Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said the level of investment had been boosted partly by 'the encouraging number of management buy-outs'. The group made new investments of more than Pounds 275m in the six months from October last year to March, an increase of 90 per cent on the same period in the previous year.</p>

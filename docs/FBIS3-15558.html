			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Political Opponent? Put Him </F> Behind Bars!"]    [Text] A group of people's deputies has turned to  Ukraine's Procurator General V. Datsyuk with a protest in  connection with the recent search of the headquarters of the  Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly (UNA) and private apartments of  individual UNA members. The search was sanctioned by Hariy  Shevchenko, Procurator of Pechersk Rayon [in Kiev]. As already  reported in the press, at that time, about 30 UNA members were  detained, including four candidates for people's deputies. The  authors of the protest are trying to find out from the  Procurator General what social danger these people present so as  to enable the Procurator's Office to violate the status of  immunity of candidates for Ukraine's people's deputies. Perhaps  our legislators want, in this manner, to show their activity  instead of intensifying the struggle against corruption and  organized crime?    The group of people's deputies, including Kateryna Zavadska,  Iryna Kalynets, Mykhaylo Kosiv, Stepan Khmara, Ihor Yukhnovskyy,  Ivan Makar, and Mykhaylo Batih, all together 21 people, regards  this action as a trial of strength in unleashing a campaign of  political repression on the Ukrainian people and political  organizations that stand up for the right to a decent life in  the Ukrainian state. The people's deputies concluded their  protest against the attempt to use law enforcement agencies to  deal with political opponents with a demand that those arrested  be released without delay.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After the official operation of the North-South  500-kilovolt power line, the Minister of Energy has decided to  lift the restriction on the use of electricity by households and  production units in Southern Vietnam.    In the North, the restriction on electricity consumption has  been lifted since the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Power Plant began  operating.    In the past, due to a shortage of electricity, households  and  production establishments were supplied with limited electrical  power. Those who used electricity beyond the fixed limit had to  pay a higher fee or a progressive rate for the extra units used.  From now on, the restriction on the use of electricity and the  progressive fee system are totally rescinded throughout the  country.    The energy sector will strive to meet all the electricity  demands of production and business establishments and other  consumers.</p>

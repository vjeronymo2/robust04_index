			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Allied's Latin adventure It is odd that Allied-Lyons' shares should have fallen by 7 per cent if its deal with Domecq really is a strategic breakthrough. A significant part of the fall reflected disappointment with the 1993-94 profits estimate included in the rights issue document. It does not help that the issue was announced on a day when the market was fretting about the future course of interest rates. Nor was yesterday the best time to announce the purchase of a business which derives half its profits from Mexico. Still, the strategic benefit must also be qualified. On the plus side, Allied appears to be paying a reasonable price for a purchase which sharpens its focus on drinks. The multiple of 15.2 times is substantially below the that Guinness paid for Moet Hennessy, and while the latter's brands are stronger, Allied is buying a controlling stake. The operational advantages may be limited, since Allied already distributes its products through the Domecq network. But it may now be easier to use Domecq as a springboard to develop its regional presence. Allied will also be able to consolidate an earnings stream from the fast-growing Latin American drinks market. Less certain is the benefit in terms of cash. Allied has hitherto received only small dividends from its investment in Domecq. Now it will have control over Domecq's entire cash flow, but that will not necessarily help reduce group debt. Domecq's small dividends evidently reflected the reinvestment of cash in its business. After the deal Allied will still face the constraint of a 72 per cent gearing ratio. And it will have to wait before playing the rights issue card again.</p>

Katyal: "Kashmiris Fed Up With Militancy, </F> Feel Envoys"]    [Text] New Delhi, May 2.    The third group of Ambassadors, which visited Jammu and  Kashmir last week, returned with the dominant impression that  the people there were fed up with the prolonged dislocation of  their daily lives and craved for an early return of normality.    Though the Huriyat leaders in Srinagar did not see the  Ambassadors -- ten of them, mostly from the Muslim and Latin  American countries -- they were able to get a complete picture  of the situation there. They were briefed by the State Governor,  Gen. (Retd.) K.V. Krishna Rao, and various others like the  former Chief Minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, the representative  of human rights organisation and spokesmen of the migrants.  During their stay in Jammu, they saw two Huriyat leaders, Mr.  Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ahmed Shah Gilani, in jail.    Contrary to the account given by official sources here, the  group's assessment was a mixed affair, but New Delhi has no  reason to be unhappy about it. The Ambassadors found the Kashmir  problem highly complex which needed to be resolved politically,  not through force. The situation did not admit of any  "unsettling" solution, according to them. They did not find any  indication of the political process which, as claimed by the  Government, had been initiated, of late. At the same time, they  found evidence of external backing to militancy (the source of  this support, obviously, is the Pakistan-occupied areas of  Kashmir, but the group preferred not to identify it).    Ordinary citizens of the State, both in the valley and in  Jammu, according to the group's assessment, would like the  violence to end and the situation brought back to normal. They  complained of having been squeezed by the two-sided violence, by  the militants, on the one hand, and the security forces, on the  other -- and would like the situation to settle soon.    The visiting Envoys were impressed by the representatives of  the migrants, belonging to both the communities, who narrated  their tales of woe. At another level, Mr. Lone and Mr. Gilani  took an extreme line, of the type followed by the militants.  Also, they complained of the treatment meted out to them in the  jail, especially objecting that they had been clubbed with  ordinary convicts.  <H5>  No Cause for Complaint </H5>   Confirming the accounts earlier emanating from Srinagar, the  Ambassadors found no cause for complaint about the arrangements  for their trip. They did not blame the authorities for the  episode at Srinagar where the leaders of Huriyat insisted on the  Ambassadors coming to its office in the downtown area, rejecting  the suggestions for a meeting either at the tourist complex or  at the residence of the Mir Wahiz, one of the leading lights of  the organisation, near Nagin Lake.    The two groups of the Delhi-based Ambassadors who had gone  to  the State earlier, had found the Huriyat leaders speaking with  several voices. This umbrella organisation of 33 groups, big and  small, conveyed differing views on the modalities for resolving  the present deadlock and putting an end to violence -- and  though extreme sentiments were articulated by most of them, some  others were either non-committal or chose to prevaricate, and  avoided taking extreme postures.    To claim, as official sources did today, that the  impressions  of the Envoys represented a change in the attitude of their  Governments towards India is a case of inverted logic. As a  matter of fact, the observations of the visiting Ambassadors  would help their Governments to see the situation in a proper  perspective instead of being influenced by Pakistan's propaganda.</p>

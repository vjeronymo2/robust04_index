The sources said that the  arrest campaign concentrated on the capital Baghdad and on the  Iraqi town of al-Mawsil in the north.    Earlier reports spoke of large-scale arrests, including  officers on active service as well as retired officers, in  Baghdad and other towns following the distribution of leaflets  attacking the Iraqi regime on the occasion of the Iraqi Army's  73d anniversary on 6 January.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained a copy of the first  communique  issued then by the "provisional national leadership," which,  according to Iraqi opposition sources, consists mostly of Iraqi  Army officers. According to the communique, this group operates  inside Iraq within the ranks of the Army with the aim of  overthrowing President Saddam Husayn's regime "and transferring  the constitutional powers to the Iraqi people and their  institutions" after a six-month transitional period.    The communique declares that "Iraq's giant -- the army --  has  now awakened...to end this tyranny," and that the birth of this  leadership "marks the beginning of the march for the destruction  of that germ."    An official of an Iraqi opposition group which operates  abroad and which has received a copy of the communique, says  that it was distributed in Baghdad, al-Mawsil, and other towns  and that one of the copies was smuggled out by travelers to  Jordan.    The communique appears to have been drafted in simpler and  more realistic language than the statements issued usually by  professional politicians of the Iraqi opposition abroad, and its  emphasis is on a decisive role by the Iraqi Army to change  Saddam Husayn's regime.    The group in whose name the communique was issued is  probably  trying to cause a split within the security and intelligence  organs and the Republican Guard, which are under the tight  control of Saddam Husayn and members of his family, after the  failure to secure their support in past coup attempts.    The communique appealed to "our brothers and sons in the  armed forces and internal security forces, including the Army,  the Republican Guard, the police, the public security forces,  the intelligence forces, and the special security forces, as  well as the brothers in the party organizations." It reassured  them that their lives and rights would be protected.    This is the first time that a military group has announced  itself inside Iraq with the stated aim of changing the regime.  In the past such statements were issued by small groups of  officers who managed to escape abroad during the years of the  Iraq-Iran war, the occupation of Kuwait, and the war which led  to the liberation of Kuwait.    The communique said that the next regime should "steer our  political and economic courses in a manner suited to our  capabilities as a Gulf oil state...to build a modern Iraq and  divert its economic resources to the service of its people not,  as Saddam did, squander billions and billions of hard currency  on the purchase and manufacture of arms of mass destruction and  an arsenal which destroyed Iraq and slaughtered its people and  which was used to invade Kuwait and threaten the states of the  region and undermine their security."    The communique also said that the aim of the group which  issued it was to overthrow Saddam Husayn's regime and "transfer  power to the people so that they would rule themselves through  their representatives elected by free ballot and in the  framework of a system of government approved by the people, with  emphasis on the impartiality of the judiciary and on the rule of  law...without discrimination between Iraq's nationalities,  communities, religions, sects, or political or ideological  trends, with emphasis on the neutrality of the armed forces and  the internal security forces." It stressed that the  transitional period during which the group itself would govern  would not exceed six months.    Directly addressing the neighboring states and the  international community, the "provisional national leadership"  said in its communique that it would abide by the "UN charter  and resolutions, the Arab League charter, and international  conventions." It affirmed that it would "open a new and bright  era of relations based on mutual respect and interests. We also  emphasize that we would resolve all border problems permanently  so as not be preoccupied with them ever again in the future."</p>

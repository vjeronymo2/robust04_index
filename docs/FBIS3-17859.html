			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zurab Gagnidze, leader of the National </F> Ideology Party, by Nana Pitskhelauri; place and date not given:  "I Have Been Called the Georgian Zhirinovskiy...." -- all  questions published in boldface]    [Excerpts] Zurab Gagnidze is the leader of the National  Ideology Party [NIP] and a philosopher and political scientist.  He was born and brought up in Tbilisi. He graduated from the  philosophy faculty of Tbilisi State University. He continued  his studies as a postgraduate. He is a candidate of  philosophical sciences. He has worked as a teacher in higher  educational establishments in Tbilisi. At the request of our  readers, as we promised, we propose to you an interview with  this person. We leave you to supply any commentary.    [Pitskhelauri]Your, as they say, alliance with  Zhirinovskiy [leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia  (LDPR]) has alarmed the Georgian public. What we mean are the  letters you sent to him.    [Gagnidze] I did indeed send these letters to Zhirinovskiy.  We stated that our party is the true opposition in Georgia today  (as opposed to those "pseudo-oppositionists" who are motivated  by personal interests and ambitions) and I addressed the LDPR  leader as one opposition [leader] to another. Moreover, the  welfare of Georgia and Russia forms the basis for all this.    [Pitskhelauri]Until now, you have been known by a large  part of society as an active comrade-in-arms of Zviad  Gamsakhurdia....    [Gagnidze] I got involved in the national movement in  1989-90. I became an ally of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. At that time,  I was getting my own articles published. Zviad told me in  public: "You know how to write and you should use this to serve  the national movement." The first articles that I had published  were on political science; they concerned national will and  national freedom.    Later on, there was disagreement between myself and the  president about cadres selection. The National Ideology  Association was formed on 12 September 1991 and was transformed  into a party exactly one year later.    We are struggling for the restoration of national ideology.  Our variant of state organization is national  self-administration. This is quite separate from a presidential  or parliamentary form of government and constitutional monarchy.  National ideology is the only path toward the salvation of  Georgia, and not only Georgia. After all, the idea of humanity  forms the basis of our ideology.    Following the overthrow of Zviad's government, national  ideas  were being cursed along with the president, which was a moral  blow for us. I said then, and repeat now, that the government  should have been replaced without recourse to bloodshed and  barbaric methods.    Second, we are, philosophically speaking, idealists. We have  also developed the question of a national religion. Religion  should express the natural qualities and potentialities of each  nation and its soul. It will get rid of confrontation and unite  all Georgians.    [Pitskhelauri]If it is not a secret, what were your  letters to Zhirinovskiy about?    [Gagnidze] The first one expressed our attitude to the  elections. We believe that Zhirinovskiy expressed the will of  the Russian people and hence was victorious. Therefore, we  decided to welcome this fact. I sent the first letter to Volf  dze [son of Volf -- Zhirinovskiy] on 12 December. It turned out  that, after the Russian elections, opposition parties in Georgia  condemned the results. Some were forgetting that Zhirinovskiy  had been elected by his own people and that we have no right to  interfere in their choice.    This led to my sending a personal letter of congratulations.  The reason for the second letter concerned Zviad Gamsakhurdia.  Our party believed that the ex-president could, under no  circumstances, be buried in Groznyy. We decided to appeal to  Zhirinovskiy, Butrus-Ghali, and Ilia II [Georgian patriarch], to  intervene in some way, in accordance with the principles  underlying the protection of human rights, so that the president  could be buried in Mtatsminda [burial place in Tbilisi for  eminent Georgians] or in the courtyard of the Kolkhuri tower.    The next letter concerned the treaty signed between Georgia  and Russia. The Russian Duma refused to ratify it. We appealed  to Russia's national forces not to oppose the signing of this  treaty.    I don't know who should take the credit for this but this  process was stopped.    Another point of contact with Zhirinovskiy was the political  amnesty. We welcomed the fact that the political prisoners  Khasbulatov and Rutskoy had been released from Lefortovo prison.    That was all. So, there is nothing to fear and condemn  regarding what we did. [passage omitted]    [Pitskhelauri]Zbigniew Brzezhinski also pointed out  that chauvinism could grow into fascism and this was easier to  envisage following Zhirinovskiy's appearance on the political  arena.    [Gagnidze] I believe that it is only Zhirinovskiy who  expresses the will of the Russian nation today. He is a fairly  complex phenomenon. It has become a common event to curse and  hurl all kinds of slander at a new leader as soon as he appears  on the political scene. We also have experienced such facts.    Zhirinovskiy stated in his first speech during the election  campaign that, if he alone was criticizing the current  authorities, it was because they were interfering in the  administration of other republics, specifically Georgia.    Well, isn't Yeltsin aiming to create a powerful state? Like  Volf dze and unlike Yeltsin, we also support democracy that is  not limited, but on a large scale and believe that Yeltsin's  heyday is over and Zhirinovskiy's is imminent.    I forgot to mention that we stated in the concluding part of  the letter to Zhirinovskiy: "Your victory in the elections will  have a beneficial influence on strengthening Georgia's national  independence and protecting its territorial integrity."    We should make use of this person.    [Pitskhelauri] You were recently christened on television  as the Georgian Zhirinovskiy.    [Gagnidze] That's right. If I'm not mistaken, it was on  "Ibervizia" that I was called the Georgian Zhirinovskiy. They  probably saw that the similarity between us lay in what he wants  for Russia and what I want for Georgia, that is to say,  territorial integrity.    The difference between us lies in the fact that Zhirinovskiy  is a Jew by nationality whereas "there is not a drop of my blood  that is not Georgian."    I would also like to point out that we Georgians have the  habit of comparing anyone dynamic who appears on the scene with  foreigners. It would be my wish not to be known as the Georgian  Zhirinovskiy, but for Zhirinovskiy to be called the Georgian [as  published] Gagnidze. [passage omitted]    [Pitskhelauri] In conclusion, let us turn to the current  problems facing Georgia. How do you assess parliament's  ratification of the document on Georgia joining the CIS?    [Gagnidze] Frankly speaking, I have a strong antipathy  toward the Georgian parliament. There is no doubt that it has  to be dissolved. During one year, this parliament has not been  able to issue a single law. To put it crudely, it reminds me of  a cow that is well looked after, but cannot produce any milk.  It is no better than the former parliament; if anything, it is  worse.    I agree with Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi  Shevardnadze when he said that there should first be order not  among the people but in parliament. As regards the CIS, this is  an ephemeral association that contains aspects of security. I  believe that the association should be based on free will. The  question of ratification should be put to a referendum and the  Georgian people should decide whether Georgia joins the CIS or  not; it should not be decided by parliament, which does not have  the moral right or the power to decide the country's fate.    The question of dissolving parliament and holding new  elections in which we would like to take part should be put on  the agenda in the near future.    [Pitskhelauri]What would be the most desirable outcome  of the elections for you?    [Gagnidze] I have already told you -- national  self-administration.</p>

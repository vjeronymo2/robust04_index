freight vessels. Purpose of launch was to deliver consumables  and various freight to Mir orbital station.    Kosmos--name of series of artificial Earth  satellites that have been launched regularly from the country's  cosmodromes (starting on 16 March 1962).    Their tasks include:    --study of the concentration of charged particles in the  ionosphere for the purpose of researching the propagation of  radio waves, corpuscular streams and particles of small  energies, the energy composition of the radiation belts of the  Earth to assess the radiation hazard in prolonged space flights,  processes of adaptation and weightlessness, the primary  composition of cosmic rays and variations in their intensity,  the magnetic field of the Earth, the shortwave emissions of the  sun and other heavenly bodies, the upper layers of the  atmosphere and the effects of meteoric matter on structural  elements of space objects;    --research on space materials science, determining the  influence of factors of space flight on living organisms, the  receipt of efficient information on the Earth's natural  resources in the interests of various sectors of the national  economy and international collaboration;    --trying out elements and apparatus of space navigational  systems (being created for the purpose of determining the  locations of aircraft and maritime vessels), experimental  apparatus intended for the system for determining the location  of ships and aircraft that are lost, experimental apparatus for  the relay of telegraph and telephone information, equipment,  units and elements of the structural elements of satellites in  various flight modes, including joint;    --receipt of efficient information and continuation of  run-through of new types of information-measurement apparatus  and methods of remote research of the Earth's surface,  atmosphere and oceans in the interests of various sectors of the  national economy, science and international collaboration.    Molniya-1--a communications satellite intended to  support the operations of long-range telephone and telegraph  radio communications systems, as well as the transmission of  programs from Central Television to points on the Orbita network.    Soyuz TM-14, -15--improved spacecraft intended for  the delivery of crews to multipurpose manned systems of a  modular type. New systems for approach and docking, radio  communications and emergency rescue, as well as a new combined  engine and parachute system, have been installed on the craft.    Gorizont--communications satellite to support  around-the- clock long-range telephone and telegraph radio  communications and the transmission of television programs to  stations of the Orbita and Moskva networks, as well as for use  in the Intersputnik international satellite communications  system.    Resurs-F--a satellite intended for the performance  of multiple-zone and spectral-zone photographing in various  scales for the purpose of researching the Earth's natural  resources in the interests of various sectors of the national  economy and accomplishing tasks of ecology and international  collaboration.    Foton--a satellite intended for researching space  materials science. The flight program envisaged the conduct of  experiments to obtain crystals of proteins and semiconductor  materials with improved properties under the conditions of  microgravitation, as well as to try out technologies for their  experimental industrial production. Scientific-research  apparatus was also installed on the satellite for the National  Center for Space Research of France.    Molniya-3--a communications satellite to support  the operations of long-range telegraph and telephone radio  communications, the transmission of the programs of Central  Television to points on the Orbita network and international  collaboration.    Ekran--a satellite for television broadcasting  with on-board relay gear supporting the transmission of the  programs of Central Television to shared receiving devices in  the decimeter waveband.    There were 75 spacecraft in all launched into orbit in  1992, including the Kosmos 2177--Kosmos 2179, Kosmos  2187--Kosmos 2194, Kosmos 2197--Kosmos 2202, Kosmos 2204--Kosmos  2206 and Kosmos 2211--Kosmos 2216 using the same launch  vehicle.

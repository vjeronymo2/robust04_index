			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The American Heart Assn. said it plans to give its own seal of approval -- to  be used on labels and in advertisements -- to promote foods low in fat,  cholesterol and sodium. Known as HeartGuide, the program would go into effect  in February, 1990, but food manufacturers can submit products for testing now  to see if they meet AHA standards, the association said in a statement. The  group recommends a diet with less than 30% of total calories from fat or less  than 10% of calories from saturated fat. It also would limit cholesterol intake  to 300 milligrams a day and sodium to 3,000 milligrams a day. Initial food  categories to be tested are margarines and other spreads, shortenings and oils,  frozen dinners and entrees, canned and frozen vegetables, and crackers.  </P></p>

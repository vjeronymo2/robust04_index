			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> REVITALIZATION GRANT OKD  </P> <P> The City Council approved $105,000 in community development grant money for its  Main Street revitalization program.  </P> <P> Mayor Don McMillen and other council members praised the program, part of a  plan started five years ago to upgrade the older downtown area of El Monte.  </P> <P> The Main Street project, begun last year, concentrates on the Valley Mall along  Valley Boulevard between Ramona and Santa Anita avenues. The money pays for an  office and staff to attract major retailers to the mall.  </P> <P> "We all feel progress has been substantial the last two years," Planning  Director Harold Johanson said. "We want to keep the ball rolling, so to speak,  in the business district."  </P></p>

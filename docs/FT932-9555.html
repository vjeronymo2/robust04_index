			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Observer: Comfort letter The Serious Fraud Office, still wincing over the escape of Asil Nadir, may take solace from knowing that its Swiss colleagues have let not one, but two big fish slip through their fingers recently. Werner K. Rey, head of the Omni conglomerate that collapsed two years ago with debts of SFr2bn, fled to the Bahamas early last year and has been island hopping ever since to keep one step ahead of the rather inappropriately named Beat Schnell, Bern's public prosecutor. Then there is Jurg Heer, the colourful former credit director at Rothschild Bank in Zurich who last summer admitted defrauding the bank of some SFr30m. He disappeared in November and was last reported to have changed his name to Giorgio Bonomi and taken out an Italian passport. He even managed to shift all his goods and chattels, including a couple of highly valuable vintage cars, out of his homes in Zurich and Klosters. Unlike Britain, a suspicion lingers in Switzerland that, in Heer's case at least, the Swiss authorities would be just as happy if he did not return. His wild accounts last year of dodgy doings at Rothschild have damaged the image of the entire Swiss private banking community, and the gnomes do not like to be reminded of it.</p>

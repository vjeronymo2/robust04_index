			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir by Kamal </F> Hamid in Nairobi, date not given]    [Excerpt] [Hamid] Do you expect to attain peace after  Nairobi's current negotiations?    [Al-Bashir] Yes, we have come for this purpose. Our  delegation is under Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the  Transitional National Council, who chaired all the previous  rounds of negotiations. We are convinced of the need to depend  on what was discussed in the past. We love peace and hate war.  We are aware that the other side is the same. However, this  does not prevent the existence of a group whose interests are  linked with this war. We know of the existence of regional,  international, and, regrettably, local forces that believe that  the continuation of the war will realize their desire to remove  the current government by putting pressure on us and spreading  rumors.    [Hamid] You are speaking of international pressures. Certain  circles indicate the possibility that you will offer concessions.    [Al-Bashir] They are harboring an illusion. We believe in  God and in fate, whether for good or for worse. We are aware  that nothing will afflict us unless it is ordained for us. They  themselves are aware of the false allegations that we attack  civilians and prevent aid from reaching the affected people, who  are Sudanese citizens. We gather aid for them from all the  people and we provide transportation through the Nile as well as  by railway and by air. All organizations working in this field  can testify to the truth of this.    I reiterate that we have principles. We will not relinquish  them. These principles have been accepted by our people, who  realize the size of the external plotting. They have announced  their readiness to meet every eventuality. In alluding to  certain local forces, I meant some Sudanese citizens from the  opposition who reside in hotels abroad. They are pushing  colonialism in their own country in order to regain the power  they think belongs to them forever.    [Hamid] Did it not occur to you to negotiate with opposition  figures from the north, who are both inside the country and  abroad?    [Al-Bashir] We negotiate over whatever advances Sudan's  interests. If you are asking about leaders of the banned  parties, we have asked them to take an active part in  shouldering responsibilities. But they have their eyes set on  power. For evidence, watch their meetings and coordination with  Western forces that do not wish the country well. Such people  think that power in the country is a cake to be carved up and  that being in office should bring with it wealth and control of  the country's resources. The Ministry of Trade used to be  coveted, given the privileges it brings with it. This ministry  had to be divided into two sections. One was for internal trade.  It was entrusted to the Democratic Unionist Party so party  members who were in business would exploit it for their own  benefit. The Ministry of Foreign Trade usually went to the  Ummah Party and was handled by Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi. All  the Sudanese will testify to his practices at the ministry. We  now view government as an exercise in power-sharing and a burden  rather than a cake. The Ministry of Trade is not important any  more. We have scrapped the import system licenses altogether  and the licenses are now handled by commercial banks. We now  consider the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and  Irrigation Ministry to be the most important. This is to  promote the exploitation of the country's resources and  self-reliance. We have achieved a good measure of success on  that front, which has earned us the West's hostility.    [Hamid] What is your assessment of the Arab community's  reaction to the challenges facing Sudan?    [Al-Bashir] Regrettably, a unified Arab stand is completely  absent. However, we still hope that Arab reconciliation will be  restored and the Arab atmosphere cleared. [passage omitted]</p>

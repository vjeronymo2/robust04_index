			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Kurdish leaders meet Saddam: Meeting angers other opposition groups PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein of Iraq held talks yesterday with Kurdish guerrilla leaders who want internationally-guaranteed autonomy from Baghdad and the safe return of Kurdish refugees to their homes. Iraqi government officials have been negotiating with the Kurds since last Friday, but the state-run Iraqi media mentioned the discussions for the first time yesterday. Kurdish organisations have expressed optimism that President Saddam will make concessions to the Kurds, although many Kurds hate and distrust him and some non-Kurdish opposition groups are angry about the negotiations. President Saddam met Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and representatives of other Kurdish parties, the Iraqi news agency said. 'The meeting means there was agreement on the basic points and that a breakthrough was achieved in the talks,' a Kurdish official in Damascus was quoted as saying. Both sides need a deal. President Saddam's army is weakened by the Gulf war and he could not use chemical weapons against the Kurds without incurring the wrath of the international community. The Kurdish guerrillas are still a force to be reckoned with in the mountains, but they are fighting for an empty political cause if nearly 2m Kurdish refugees - half the Kurds of Iraq - do not return home from the borders of Iran and Turkey. It remains to be seen if Mr Saddam will accept Kurdish demands for a genuinely autonomous region within a democratic Iraq, for control over oil revenue from Kurdish areas, and for international guarantees to bolster any agreement. A loose ceasefire is in force in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, but Shia Moslem rebels in the south continue to announce guerrilla attacks on government targets. The Voice of the Iraqi Opposition radio station recently described Mr Talabani's discussions with the government as 'a stab in the back for all the Iraqis'.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS $15,000 TO FIX UP BALL FIELD  </P> <P> The City Council has approved spending $15,000 to improve the Duane Winters  Field at Amerige Park in time for the 1991 men's baseball season at Cal State  Fullerton.  </P> <P> The men's baseball and soccer teams will use the park as their home field  during the 1990 through 1992 athletic seasons while the campus Sports Complex  is constructed, a project that is expected to take 18 to 24 months.  </P> <P> The university will pay only $5,000 of the $20,000 needed to refurbish the  field. But the city justified bearing the majority of the costs because the  improvements will benefit the youth groups who will continue to use the field  after the university teams return to their campus complex.  </P> <P> The upgrades, which are necessary to comply with NCAA regulations, include  bullpens, a home run fence, batting cages, a public address system and a  storage unit.  </P></p>

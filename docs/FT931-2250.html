			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Property: For space and grace, go for a rectory - With congregations falling, Gerald Cadogan discovers that not only are there plenty of cast-off Church houses for sale but some of them come with an unexpected bonus ONCE, when the Church of England still had substantial congregations, rectors ran parishes and lived in rectories: substantial family houses, larger than most in the village and at its heart, next to the church itself. Position in the social pecking order - and attendant responsibilities - were made manifest in brick and stone. Now, though, the Church has sold nearly all the rectories it can. Parsons cannot afford to live in them unless they have private means to supplement a typical salary of Pounds 12,000 - and few do. Then again, many rectories became surplus when parishes were re-organised into groups of three, four or five churches under one priest. Rectories, new and old, have one common bonus. Downstairs is an extra room for the study where the priest wrote his sermons and held confirmation classes. In old rectories, it is often the same size as the dining or drawing room. Expect also plenty of bedrooms; a pantry, scullery and larder as well as the kitchen; several out-buildings; and a garden of between half an acre and six acres. The house probably will come with covenants forbidding you to turn it into a pub or make a disturbance during services. But these are not onerous restrictions. And if you are buying it from the Church, there is an unexpected plus. Thanks to the Ecclesiastical Residences Act 1776 and the Parsonages Measure 1938, the deal is free of stamp duty. That will be the case on Wednesday when the 16th-19th century rectory in the large village of Porlock, on the north Somerset coast and the edge of Exmoor. is sold at auction by Cluttons, the diocesan agent, with a guide price of Pounds 160-200,000. In a similar sale on April 21, Cluttons will auction Berrow rectory near Burnham-on-Sea. This is an attractive Georgian brick building which retains its coach house and comes with a guide price of Pounds 150,000. For another Pounds 30,000 or so, there is a second lot with planning permission for a house. Cluttons also has three old rectories in Somerset for sale by private treaty. One - at Croscombe, near Wells - has Georgian sash windows, a granny flat, three acres and a tennis court needing repair and netting. Price: around Pounds 270,000. In the south-east, old rectories cost more. At Washington, in West Sussex, King &amp; Chasemore and Jackson-Stops offer one dating from the 1820s - a time when many rectories were built. Its standard Georgian looks (for around Pounds 360,000) would be more at home in a town than a village. The Georgian house at Ampfield, near Romsey in Hampshire (Lane Fox, around Pounds 320,000) is more eclectic. By 1854 - the date of the Old Parsonage at Cranbourne in Windsor Forest - the style had changed to Gothic although rectories still had plenty of room. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert subscribed to building both it and the church, and Benjamin Ferrey was the architect. With six loose boxes and three paddocks (making 7.5 acres in all), and near Ascot, it is being offered by Jackson-Stops in London for around Pounds 565,000. In Kent, Mountfield House at Staplestreet, near Canterbury, is not actually an old rectory, although it might easily be. Gothic, and also from 1854, it has the right dimensions and was the home of a Methodist hymn-writer, Benjamin Gough. Strutt &amp; Parker in Canterbury is selling it with a guide price of Pounds 350,000. The same firm's office at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, has (with Seccombes) the double bow-fronted old rectory at Shipston-on-Stour in Warwickshire; offers over Pounds 240,000 are sought for this handsome Regency building. Savills in Banbury is selling two Georgian examples near the M40 in Northamptonshire. Offers of around Pounds 385,000 are sought for a stone-built rectory at Aynho, next to a wonderful 18th century box-pewed church, while another constructed of brick at Aston le Walls is on sale for around Pounds 10,000 less (with Jackson-Stops in Northampton). More unusual is the Dower House in Gayton, near the M1, which the same duo is selling for around Pounds 300,000. It is a Victorian Gothic extravaganza built for a headmaster of Harrow school and featuring a steeply-pitched, tiled turret. It would not have been out of place among the school's own outstanding Victorian buildings. Sir John Betjeman would have loved it. In the north, Jackson-Stops has three distinctive examples to sell. One, in pink stucco at Ulverston, Cumbria, has Morecambe Bay lapping below the front lawn (from the Chester office for around Pounds 550,000). From the York office, there is a Tudor-Stuart house in brick at Thorpe Bassett (around Pounds 230,000), while the other, also in brick and dating from 1885, is at Thorpe Thewles, near Darlington (around Pounds 285,000). East Anglia takes the honours for the greatest range of old rectories. One at Snetterton, Norfolk, is said to have a ghost - a kindly old woman (Jackson-Stops in Newmarket, around Pounds 235,000). Mullucks Wells offers an unusually imposing Victorian house at Abbess Roding, near Harlow (Essex) and the M11, for around Pounds 485,000; while Bedford has another fine example at Docking, north Norfolk, for around Pounds 325,000. John D. Wood is selling a rectory in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, for around Pounds 340,000 - ideal for yachtsmen. Bidwells has several, including two splendid 18th century houses near Holt, Norfolk, from the Norwich office: Foulsham in mellow brick for around Pounds 345,000, and Baconsthorpe for around Lxxx. The firm's Ipswich office offers the old rectory at Thornham Parva, Suffolk (around Pounds 170,000). Although built as late as 1952, it does not lack for spaciousness.

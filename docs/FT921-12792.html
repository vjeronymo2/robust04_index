			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / US plans airlifts to aid republics: Emergency relief effort to former Soviet states underlines end of Cold War THE US will begin emergency airlifts of food and medicine to the former Soviet republics on February 10 in a gesture of solidarity underlining the end of the Cold War, writes Lionel Barber in Washington. Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State, announced the military relief effort, codenamed Operation Provide Hope, yesterday at the end of a two-day conference of 47 nations in Washington called by the US to co-ordinate aid to the ex-Soviet states. The US proposal, involving 54 US Air Force flights, runs counter to German arguments that land and sea transport is more effective and less costly, but Mr Baker said at the State Department yesterday that the use of US forces was symbolically important. '(It) can vividly show the peoples of the former Soviet Union that those that once prepared for war with them now have the courage and conviction to use their militaries to say 'we will wage a new peace',' he said. The US has dispatched airlifts to select republics in recent months, but the latest relief effort - reminiscent of the Berlin air-lift in the late 1940s  -seemed more ambitious. The flights of C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft from Frankfurt will last between one and two weeks. The aim is to target orphanages, hospitals and other needy groups in all 12 independent states. Advance teams from the Pentagon and other Federal agencies will oversee the on-site distribution. The hope is to prevent the chronic corruption which has to date plagued the western relief effort. European diplomats suggested yesterday that the use of C-5 aircraft from Rhein-Main air-base could herald a fresh campaign to use Nato forces to oversee the relief effort. Mr Baker pointedly noted Nato's earlier offer of logistical support. Using Nato forces could run into opposition from France which this week expressed reservations about the Washington conference which also involved five international financial organisations including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. France dispatched its deputy foreign minister, criticised the decision to bar the ex-Soviet republics from attending and called for practical on-site mechanisms to ensure distribution of the food and humanitarian aid already available. In Washington, EC trade commissioner Frans Andriessen said nations outside the EC would have to do more to help out the former Soviet Union, as the current 'burden sharing doesn't reflect the global nature' of the issue. In spite of these reservations, the participants described the conference as a useful exchange of views which had produced detailed plans of action to help the republics in dismantling their centrally planned economies. The US defused rivalry with Europeans by agreeing to a follow-up conference in Lisbon this spring, to be sponsored by the European Commission and attended by the republics. Japan, which has been accused of dragging its feet over aid because of its claim to the Kurile islands, has offered to host a third conference.

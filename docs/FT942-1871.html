			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different concept of income Sir, Michael Prowse ('Clinton v Friedman on welfare', June 20) is wrong. The proponents of a guaranteed 'basic income' in Britain do not advocate negative income tax. The concept of basic income - now usually called citizen's income - is based on a different approach. Citizen's income is a universal benefit, not means-tested or work-tested as negative come tax. It is based on the individual not the family unit. Negative income tax brings with it all the limitations of the existing welfare systems - administratively complex, a disincentive in that it extends poverty and unemployment traps, and a bureaucratic nightmare.

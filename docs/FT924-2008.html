			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Borrowings to be cut at Time Warner TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, is hoping to reduce its Dollars 9bn borrowings by a third over the next two or three years by either selling assets or issuing asset-backed bonds. Mr Geoffrey Holmes, the Time Warner vice-president who last week told a New York seminar that the company wanted to 'monitise' about Dollars 3bn of assets, said at the weekend that the aim was 'to improve our balance sheet' by converting certain shareholdings into cash generating assets. Mr Holmes specified a series of equity investments 'that are not presently put through our profit and loss account' as being possible candidates for disposal. While stressing that no decisions had been taken, Mr Holmes said that these investments included: A 15 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 125m - in Black Entertainment Television, a cable network. An 11 per cent stake - worth around Dollars 150m - in QVC, the home-shopping cable television network whose most recent investor is Mr Barry Diller, the former chairman of the Fox film and television studio. A 50 per cent stake - worth 'a few hundred million dollars' - in the Six Flags theme park group. A 21 per cent stake - worth about Dollars 1.2bn - in Turner Broadcasting, the Atlanta-based group controlled by Mr Ted Turner. A 37.5 per cent stake - with a book value in Time Warner's accounts of Dollars 175m - in Whittle Communications. Mr Holmes said that Time Warner may not sell all of these assets. In some cases, the company may issue bonds which are backed by the assets, as with its current offer of Dollars 500m of zero-coupon convertible bonds backed by Time Warner's 14 per cent stake in Hasbro, the toymaker.</p>

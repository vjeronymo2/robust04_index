			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Healthy results could consign row to history - Body Shop International Body Shop International, the UK-based natural cosmetics retailer, will try on Thursday to put a summer of criticism over its ethical credentials behind it and focus attention on its trading prospects, as it announces interim results. Analysts are looking for a healthy increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10m to about Pounds 11.5m for the half year to August 30. Total sales are forecast to have increased 15 per cent, with UK sales up about 5 per cent. Sales in the US, where Body Shop has added 60 new stores, are expected to be about 30 per cent ahead. The results could boost Body Shop's share price, which has shown some recovery recently after falling more than 15 per cent in August amid criticisms of the company's 'green' standards. Franklin Research, the US ethical investment fund, sparked the debate in mid-August by advising clients to sell shares in Body Shop. Its decision was based partly on fears that an article in US magazine Business Ethics might prove damaging to the company. The article, published two weeks later, questioned Body Shop's treatment of franchisees, the seriousness of its commitment to ethical trade and against animal testing, and its product ingredients. The criticisms, vigorously countered by Body Shop, do not appear to have damaged sales, and the company has since been backed by other ethical investment funds. The affair rumbles on, however. Franklin two weeks ago published its own report concluding some of the criticisms of Body Shop were justified and there was a gap between its 'image and reality'. Most analysts feel Body Shop has weathered the storm and can look forward to strong growth as its international business expands. House broker NatWest Markets predicts annual profit growth of between 15 and 20 per cent over the next five years.</p>

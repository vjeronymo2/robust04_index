			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: The real role of the trade association Sir, Andrew Taylor draws attention to the large number of trade associations and the intention of the president of the board of trade to limit the number with which his department has contact. Some reduction might be appropriate, but we should bear in mind that it is the member companies of these associations which pay the bills and decide what they need in their dealings with UK government departments. Most up-coming legislation emanates from Brussels in any case and, in today's complex environment, expert knowledge from specialist groups is critically important if the wealth-makers in our society are not to be disadvantaged. Larger, more generalist, associations such as the Confederation of British Industry have an important role in influencing the general business climate. Similarly, the Chemical Industries Association represents its manufacturers in respect of their processes and practices. This leaves the sectoral associations to promote the interests of the particular product groups. It would be a pity if the DTI's work for British industry was to be inhibited by a doctrinal handicap. Barry Higgs, director-general, The Fertiliser Manufacturers Association, Greenhill House, Thorpe Wood, Peterborough PE3 6GF</p>

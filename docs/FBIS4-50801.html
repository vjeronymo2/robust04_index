			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 22 (AFP) -- Public order in China has  gravely deteriorated this year and urgent steps are required to  prevent serious unrest, a senior communist party official was  quoted as saying Sunday. In a markedly frank assessment of  current trends threatening social stability across the country,  the director of the party's Central Committee for Comprehensive  Management of Public Security, Ren Jianxin, said particular  attention needed to be paid to signs of unrest in the  countryside.    "Since the beginning of the year, the public order situation  throughout China has become extremely grim," Ren said in a  speech carried on the front page of the official People's Daily  [RENMIN RIBAO]. He especially warned of mass discontent in many  rural areas where incomes have failed to keep pace with  inflation and where resentment is growing over regional  disparities in living standards. "We must never underestimate  the effect that problems of public disorder in the countryside  will have on the country as a whole," Ren said, calling on  governments and judicial departments at all levels to take  immediate steps to ensure social stability. "Common law  criminals must be punished swiftly and more heavily," he said,  while education regarding state laws and regulations should be  strenghened for minor offenders. In a clear indication that the  party has effectively lost control of the situation in some  rural areas, Ren said major efforts must be made to resurrect  and strengthen "paralysed or semi-paralysed local party  orgainsations and rural commitees."    The remarks followed a series of warnings by top government  and party leaders that the traditional pillars of social  stability in China are cracking as the country makes the  transition to a market economy. Senior party leaders warned  last week that corruption and apathy among officials were  exacerbating the destabilising effects of unemployment, poverty  and inflation, while President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng  have both made speeches stressing the paramount importance of  ensuring social stability by all means necessary. The stability  theme has been hammered home at every opportunity in the run up  to the fifth anniversary on June 4 of the crushing of the 1989  pro-democracy movement, reflecting official fears of social  unrest among groups disenfranchised by economic reform.</p>

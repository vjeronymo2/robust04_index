			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Algerian </F> Socialist Forces Front, by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish "somewhere in  Switzerland"; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Darwish] Hocine Ait-Ahmed, a few days ago  you called for a serious and comprehensive dialogue. It was not  your first appeal. Do you believe developing conditions can  still make a solution based on dialogue a success?    [Ait-Ahmed] I believe in Algeria. I do not believe in the  inevitability of a national collapse. We have over the past two  years been calling for holding a sovereign national conference.    [Al-Darwish] Is that what you call a constituent assembly?    [Ait-Ahmed] No...a sovereign national conference with the  powers to set up institutions and structures for the  transitional phase. This conference should comprise the regime,  that is the Army, and the political formations representing  Algerian society.    [Al-Darwish] Including the [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS]?    [Ait-Ahmed] Of course including the FIS. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] Am I to understand that you believe the  security option has failed completely?    [Ait-Ahmed] Completely. I have from the outset said that  this option is doomed to failure. I spoke openly about this  with Major General Khaled Nezzar following the assassination of  President Boudiaf. We stressed the need to open a direct  dialogue with all parties. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] But are you calling for dialogue with the FIS  or with the armed organizations?    [Ait-Ahmed] Of course with the FIS. However, we believe  that the FIS' commitment to and entry into the dialogue process  is bound to influence these organizations. But nothing prevents  us from addressing these organizations and their members as  Algerians who have adopted a means of expression of which we do  not approve and which we reject in the political action domain  for the sake of sparing the blood of Algerian men and women.    [Al-Darwish] Did you follow the reports of contacts between  the regime and FIS leaders? Did these contacts include you?    [Ait-Ahmed] Of course, we followed these reports with  interest, through the press, rumors, and private channels as  well. But we were not consulted, nor did anyone contact us.  Nevertheless, we bless these initiatives and hope they are  serious. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] What about the message you sent to President  Zeroual on 9 April?    [Ait-Ahmed] Proceeding from my personal and partisan  responsibility, I wanted to renew our call for dialogue and to  express to the new president our fear of moving toward a worse  security situation, especially after the emergence of serious  maneuvers and calls in recent weeks.    [Al-Darwish] I believe that you are referring to the calls  for distributing arms and forming militias. Do you believe that  the regime has something to do with these calls?    [Ait-Ahmed] The call by some ministers from Redha Malek's  government for calling up the reserve and civil defense elements  is nothing but a framework for what is called in other cases  "militias." In the Algerian political reality it means moving a  step closer to all-out civil war. [passage omitted]</p>

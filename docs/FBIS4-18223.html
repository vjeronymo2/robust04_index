			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C. G."-initialled report: "Ability of European Union to </F> Achieve Compromise Praised"]    [Text] Bonn, 30 Mar -- The Federal Government has  expressed satisfaction about the fact that, following the  compromise with Great Britain, the expansion of the European  Union [EU] by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway will become  possible at the beginning of 1995, if the ratification  procedures are concluded in time in the individual countries.  Chancellor Kohl, who is on vacation in Austria, expressed  relief. Foreign Minister Kinkel stressed that the only thing  that is required now is the approval by the European Parliament.  He hopes that the referendums in the would-be member countries  will be positive. The accession of the four countries will  enrich the European Union politically, economically, and  culturally. Great Britain and Spain have committed themselves  to the European Union at a "moment that is important for the  European Union's survival." The European Union has proved its  ability to achieve compromises and to make decisions. The larger  the European Union becomes, the more difficult the procedure  gets at voting. Nevertheless, Germany feels that it is the  advocate of the states in Central and East Europe. Regarding  the applications for membership by Poland and Hungary, Kinkel  said: "These countries need to see light at the end of the  tunnel." However, their inclusion will "proceed slowly." One  has to "bring" the states of Central and East Europe "close" to  the European Union "carefully."    In contrast to the government, Mr. Lamers, foreign policy  spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union Bundestag group, expressed disappointment at the result of  the negotiations on the blocking minority for decisions in the  extended Council of Ministers. The British behavior  demonstrates "a basic attitude toward European unification,  which is incompatible with the goals of at least the European  Union's founding members and lets bad things be expected also  for practical decisionmaking in Brussels." It is not okay that  London "on the one hand, rightly demanded the strengthening of  the European Union's ability to act and, on the other, did  precisely the opposite -- namely made the procedure more  difficult." This cannot go on. Predictability and credibility  of the British European policy must be doubted. The events show  the difficulties that will have to be faced at the negotiations  of the EU government conference in 1996 about a comprehensive  institutional reform. The states, which want to proceed further  in political cooperation, must not be hindered from doing so.    In order to prepare for the German EU Presidency, which  begins on 1 July, Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul, deputy chairwoman of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany, advocated giving priority to  combating unemployment and to the "implementation of a social  Europe." The Federal Government must give up its "blocking  attitude" toward the proposals of the EC Commission presented in  its white book "Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment." As  quickly as possible "Europol" is to be developed into an  effectively functioning European police force, which can be used  to combat border-crossing organized crime. Mrs. Wieczorek-Zeul  said: "We want to put particular emphasis on combating  right-wing extremist violent criminals and their border-crossing  terrorist activities in European cooperation." The European  Union must implement a foreign policy based on partnership:  "Above all, the point is help for reconstruction in the  destroyed former Yugoslavia." The Federal Government should  work for common EU advances in implementing a "stability pact"  with the countries in Central and East Europe. Bilateral  neighborhood treaties are to be concluded between the countries  involved, which guarantee protection for the respective  minorities and affirm the recognition of the borders. The  results should be included in the CSCE. The states in East and  Central Europe should be able to participate in discussion about  the common foreign and security policy: "They must be given an  all-European prospect." During the German presidency, the  public discussion of the EU reform planned for 1996 should begin.</p>

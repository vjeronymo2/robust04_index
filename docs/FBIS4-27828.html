			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Executive director of  the American Committee on Korea John M. Swomley gave his  impressions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at a  press conference held in Pyongyang.    During his visit, he said, he came to know that the Korean  people revere and follow the great President Kim Il-song and the  dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il and that Korea has made a very  rapid development after the war.    He said he witnessed the Korean People's Army helping the  farmers in rice transplanting and participating in [word  indistinct] construction, not preparations for a war. This was  totally different from the propaganda he has heard in the United  States, he noted.    Korea, he noted, is maintaining independence, attaining  self-sufficiency in food and the Korean people are firmly  determined, industrious and joyful people.    He said the Americans should know that the United States and  South Korea built the concrete wall in the area south of the  Military Demarcation Line which is not to be compared with the  Berlin Wall.    He noted that the United States' shipment of armaments into  South Korea well shows that it is seeking a war, not talks with  the DPRK.    Pointing out that the United States most wantonly violating  the implementation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is  spreading the rumour of "nuclear suspicion" and putting pressure  on Korea, while closing its eyes to the nuclear programs and  production of Israel, South Korea and other countries, he  described this as unreasonable.    Saying the aim sought by the United States is to isolate  Korea, he called for struggling against it.    He contended that the third world countries should make the  United States start nuclear disarmament and respond to  negotiations to dismantle its nuclear weapons together with  other nuclear states.    He stressed the DPRK-U.S. negotiation is the only solution  to  the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula.</p>

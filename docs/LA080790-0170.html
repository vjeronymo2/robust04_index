			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FRED ASTAIRE'S WIDOW SUES CBS RECORDS;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: SHE CONTENDS THE FIRM UNDERPAYS ROYALTIES ON HER HUSBAND'S RECORDINGS  AND THOSE OF OTHER ARTISTS.  </P> <P> Fred Astaire's widow sued CBS Records Inc., contending the firm provided false  and incomplete royalty statements on sales of her husband's work.  </P> <P> The breach-of-contract and commercial-appropriation lawsuit, filed Monday in  Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that the world's second-largest record  company underreports and underpays royalties to entertainers.  </P> <P> "Reports such as these are not acceptable in other industries, and won't be  tolerated here," said Thomas A. White, a Beverly Hills-based record industry  consultant who manages the Astaire music assets.  </P> <P> CBS Records executives could not be reached in a telephone call made after  business hours to seek comment.  </P> <P> White said CBS Records' license to distribute the records has been terminated.  </P> <P> The lawsuit demands return of an estimated 50 to 100 master recordings,  including the soundtracks to such Astaire films as "Easter Parade," White said.  </P> <P> Astaire albums sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year worldwide, he said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Astaire's widow, the former Robyn Smith, cites  17 allegedly unfair business practices by CBS. It seeks at least $50,000 in  damages and an injunction prohibiting CBS from selling Astaire's recordings.  </P></p>

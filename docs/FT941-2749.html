			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (31): Star-struck town fights back - Profile / Starachowice Starachowice, a socialist-style company town of 60,000 souls half way between Warsaw and Krakow, has been a classic loser from the wrenching changes which have swept across Poland over the past five years. But a new joint venture meat packing plant with 51 per cent US control, and a refinancing plan for the town's main employer, the Star truck factory, has brought the first glimmer of hope to a town where 37 per cent of the workforce is unemployed. Most have been out of work since the Star truck plant fell on hard times three years ago. In its heyday in the mid-1970s Star turned out 20,000 trucks a year. Virtually everything in the town - central heating for homes and public buildings, the hospital, the kindergarten, the high-rise housing estates, the foundry and a cluster of sub-assembly and component plants - depended upon it. For decades Star turned out the same old models. It had no marketing department, and did not need one. Every year a certain proportion of output was allocated to the Polish military, some were painted light khaki and shipped abroad to places such as Mozambique and Angola, and others were allocated to various Polish enterprises or exported by state-owned foreign trade corporations, mostly to other Comecon 'customers'. It was a quiet life and a steady one for the 11,000 employees of Star and their families, although that did not prevent Starachowice being one of the hotbeds of the ant-communist Solidarity movement. But its real troubles began only after Solidarity ousted the communists. First came the cut in military budgets. Then the Comecon market collapsed. Then privatisation of the former state-owned transport companies, the bankruptcy of many large state-owned companies and the preference of the emerging new private sector traders for cheap, second-hand imported vans, caused demand to collapse. Output last year declined to 1,600 vehicles, of which nearly 60 per cent were small seven-ton models hastily introduced in an attempt to satisfy the demand for smaller vehicles. An increasingly desperate search for a foreign partner ended without success after first Volvo then Renault failed to obtain tariff protection for their assembly operations. Potential foreign partners were also deterred by the social problems involved in taking over an old-fashioned, highly indebted state-owned plant with strong union traditions. Fortunately, inherited problems were not high on the agenda at the huge unfinished construction site on the edge of town which lay abandoned for nearly a decade after the government ran out of funds. With the help of financial and other incentives from Warsaw, and lobbying by the town council led by its dynamic young mayor, Mr Grzegorz Wakendzic, the Epstein group, a private, Chicago-based meat processing and engineering company with links to the Polish Diaspora, agreed to invest Dollars 36m in completing and equipping the plant. The result was Constar, a joint venture in which Epstein teamed up with Animex, a state-owned food processing and trading company. The new plant, which turns out 160 tonnes of processed meat a day, employs 1,400 workers and supplies most of southern Poland and export markets in the US and Europe, including Russia. Another 100 jobs were created by a new cigarette factory which makes cheap cigarettes selling for the equivalent of 10 US cents a packet using the poorest quality Polish tobacco and reconditioned Molins cigarette-making machines which were bought as scrap. Soon the machines will be shipped to Belorussia where they will be re-assembled and the Starachowice plant will be re-equipped with new machines fed with higher grade tobacco. But the main grounds for optimism surround the future of Star itself. A financial restructuring plan has been put together by Bank Rozvoju, the Polish Development Bank, on lines similar to its highly successful restructuring plan for the Szczecin shipyards. The Scczecin yards have become a textbook case of a restructured loss-making state company which was restructured, made profitable and then prepared for privatisation. The Star plan hopes to repeat the performance. The starting point was the purchase by Bank Rozvoju of Star's debt with Bank Slaski 'at a very high discount', according to Mr Wojciech Kostrzewa, Rozvoju's president. The bank then arranged a 94 per cent writedown of the 1,700bn zloty (Dollars 80m) debt and accumulated interest, linked to a debt/equity swap and an undertaking by Star to repay 6 per cent of its principal debt (without accumulated interest) to creditors in 12 monthly payment. The unions, meanwhile, agreed to a further 25 per cent cut in employment levels from 4,000 to 3,000 while the government agreed to finance severance pay. 'We now hope to attract foreign investors to introduce new models. The difficulties which put them off in the past have been largely eliminated. We can now offer a debt-free, slimmed down company with a workforce and management eager to make the plant viable,' says Wojciech Dworzaniki, the deputy manager. For Zbigniew Rafalski, the Solidarity union leader at the plant, the agreement is the culmination of three bitter years for workers who have struggled hard to preserve their dignity along with the plant but have come to terms with the realisation that it will not, and should not, return to its former size or importance. In recent weeks, management and unions have been talking to a team from KIA, the South Korean truck company, which is looking for a low cost assembly base to supply its planned expansion into European markets. But they, and the town itself, are still open to other offers both for Star, its hived off subsidiary companies, and future greenfield investments.</p>

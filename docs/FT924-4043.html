			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / 1,300 jobs to be shed at Royal Ordnance ROYAL ORDNANCE, the armaments subsidiary of British Aerospace, yesterday announced 1,300 job losses, the largest reduction since the company was privatised in 1987. The cuts, reflecting the general downturn in the defence business, affect 13 sites in England, Scotland and Wales and include management staff. Royal Ordnance said it had to reduce its cost base to compete in the UK and overseas. An interim arrangement that guaranteed the company 80 per cent of certain categories of ammunition purchases by the Ministry of Defence will end next April. The company said it would be unable to sustain its present Pounds 550m annual turnover unless it increased its exports, now about 40 per cent of its total business. The latest cuts will reduce Royal Ordnance's workforce to about 6,100 against more than 15,000 when BAe bought the company from the government 5 1/2 years ago for Pounds 190m. In the interim, the company has boosted its gun and ammunition businesses by buying Sterling Armament and BMARC in the UK and Heckler &amp; Koch in Germany, together employing more than 1,000. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, said the cuts were 'a bitter pill we will not swallow'. He claimed that union pressure had stopped the company from closing several sites. Royal Ordnance employees lobbied parliament on Wednesday amid union predictions that up to 2,500 jobs might go, with the closure of three or four plants. The company denied that it ever had such plans and hoped there would not be further cuts. It said it planned to spend Pounds 40m next year on capital investment and product development. The US is to close four more military sites in the UK with the loss of at least 81 civilian jobs. The bases are the US Marine Corps barracks in St John's Wood, London; an airbase headquarters in High Wycombe, Bucks; and contingency hospitals at Little Rissington, Glos, and Bicester, Oxon.</p>

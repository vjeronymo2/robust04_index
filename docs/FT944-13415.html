			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal profits down for fifth year The financial performance of the western world's non-ferrous minerals producers deteriorated for the fifth successive year in 1993, according to the annual analysis of nearly 200 companies by the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. An improvement in the fortunes of precious metals producers failed to compensate for further deterioration in those of the base metals businesses, it suggests. On two key ratios the industry recorded its worst result since MMRS started collecting these statistics 15 years ago; operating profit margins were only 5.8 per cent and the average return on capital employed was down to 4.8 per cent. On most other ratios last year's performance was the worst since 1982. According to MMRS, the industry's aggregate operating profit has fallen by 71 per cent since 1989. Nickel producers last year joined lead/zinc companies in recording an operating loss while the slide for aluminium producers has also been greater than the average. However, MMRS says a clear ranking emerged in the minerals industry last year, with gold and platinum producers leading profitability on all measures; copper and diversified producers doing best among base metals; aluminium ranking sixth-best (or fourth-worst) overall and nickel, lead/zinc and silver companies generally in loss. The analysis suggests that the industry's operating revenue fell last year from Dollars 166bn to Dollars 148bn but its net earnings, after all charges, rose from Dollars 425m to Dollars 673m. Nevertheless, this bottom line was the worst in real terms since a loss was registered in 1982. MMRS says the one bright spot in its analysis is gearing. 'Although high for a number of individual producers and sectors, this ended last year little different from historical norms,' it says. 'Unlike in the early 1980s, debt has been kept under control in the recent market downturn. New issues of equity have also helped.' 1994 World Minerals Industry Financial Review; Pounds 850 from MMRS, 2 Henry Street, Bath, Avon, BA1 1JT, UK.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               AGGREGATE PROFIT &amp; LOSS ACCOUNT OF SAMPLE                      (in millions of US dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          1991       1992       1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating revenue                     167,009    166,524    148,268 Operating costs                      (153,974)  (154,945)  (139,728)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Operating profit                       13,035     11,578      8,540  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Other income                              534        358        783 Net interest payments                  (4,660)    (4,203)    (3,589)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profit                          8,909      7,733      5,734  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mining and income taxes                (4,170)    (4,088)    (4,425)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Profit after tax                        4,739      3,645      1,308  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Attributable to minorities               (442)      (429)      (481) Share of net associate incomes            176         13        334 Preferred dividends                      (163)      (226)      (227)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Earned for ordinary shares              4,309      3,003        934  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Extraordinary post-tax losses            (978)    (2,578)      (261)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Earned for ordinary shares after extraordinary losses              3,331        425        673  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: MMRS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

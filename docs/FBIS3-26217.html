At present, some 230  million TV sets are owned by China's households, and China ranks  first in the world in the annual production of TV sets.  However, in 1978 there were only 7.5 million TV sets in China,  a country with the largest population in the world. During the  early eighties, TV sets were still in short supply in China's  big and medium cities, and were rationed. On the black market,  however, they were best-selling items. [Video begins with a  birds-eye view of modern buildings and then cuts to television  production lines, TV stores, TV stations, TV relay stations, and  satellite ground receiving stations]    China's TV industry has witnessed rapid development in the  past 15 years since the introduction of reform and opening up to  the outside world. By the end of 1993 there were 614 TV  stations in the country, and their programming has increased  from the original 9,000 hours per annum to more than 150,000  hours per annum at present. With the continuous progress in the  building of a material and spiritual civilization, television  sets have made their way into tens of thousands of households,  increasingly becoming an indispensable part of the people's  daily life in China. Television relay stations, big and small,  are everywhere from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau to the shores of  the East China Sea, and from the north to the Xisha Qundao  [Paracel Islands]. At present some 32,000 satellite ground  stations have been built in China, and TV programs now can be  viewed by more 81 percent of the population. Today, new TV  programs are being constantly introduced in China, and literary  and art programs are blossoming in radiant splendor. More than  5,000 sets of TV plays or dramas are televised, and their  quality has improved steadily.    China's television now reaches, via satellite, more than 61  countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Clear  Chinese TV programs can be viewed in countries in North America  and along the Caribbean Sea. China has established business  links with the TV agencies of more than 100 countries and  regions in the world. Television has served as a window for  China, which is engaged in reform and opening up to the outside  world. From this window China has learned something about the  world, and through this window the world has been able to  witness a China full of vigor and vitality.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vatican City, April 7 (AFP) -- The Vatican called  on the United Nations Thursday [7 April] to ease its sanctions  against the rump Yugoslavia enough to spare the civilian  population from increasing hardship.    The world body should consider "correctives to the effects  of  the sanctions," Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano said  in an interview with Vatican Radio.    The cardinal urged the setting up of a "system permitting  independent and effective control of the humanitarian  consequences of sanctions."    He said the Serbian Orthodox patriarchate had sought the aid  of Pope John Paul II in "drawing the attention of the  international community to the serious consequences of the  sanctions."    The UN Security Council imposed economic sanctions against  Serbia and its ally Montenegro in May 1992 for Belgrade's  support for Serb separatist forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The legitimacy of decisions by the international community  "never obviates the need for attention to the actual fate of  civilian populations," he said.    Sanctions "must never be a means of war or of punishment of  a  people." They must "remain a temporary means of pressure on  governments whose actions endanger international peace...(and)  always be accompanied by dialogue between those involved, not  just in Serbia but elsewhere, in Iraq or Haiti."    The Vatican has made regular contacts with Security Council  members to examine the possibility of easing the negative  effects of sanctions with regard to humanitarian welfare.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Iliescu urged to step down MORE than 5,000 Romanians shouted for the resignation of President Ion Iliescu yesterday during an opposition rally for next month's local elections, Reuter reports from Bucharest. 'Let's stay united and fight against the expiring neo-communists who pushed this country to the brink of collapse,' Mr Corneliu Coposu, leader of the opposition National Peasant party, told the indoor rally in Bucharest's Palace Hall. 'Let's fight against corruption and ensure a decent future for Romania,' Mr Coposu said, drawing loud cheers and chants of 'unity, unity,' 'down with Iliescu,' and 'down with communism'. The gathering was staged by the Democratic Convention (DC), an opposition bloc uniting 14 parties. It was the latest event in its campaign against the ruling National Salvation Front party for the February 9 local polls, Romania's first in half a century. The DC presented its candidates for the posts of Bucharest mayor-general and six mayors of the capital's sub-districts.</p>

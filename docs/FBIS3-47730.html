			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] PRIME Minister Chuan Likphai has endorsed a  National Security Council [NSC] request to transform 5.6 million  baht worth of budget allocated for this year's spending into a  secret fund.    Government sources said the Cabinet would be informed to  acknowledge the change.    The NSC had told the Premier it wanted to use the money for  secret operations because the projects to which the money had  been originally allocated were no longer necessary or had been  completed.    Of the money involved, 603,500 baht had been allocated for  public relations work.    The other five million baht had been earmarked for solving  southern banditry problems, the sources said.</p>

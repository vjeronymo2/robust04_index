			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Claims against Rey amount to SFr3.02bn Receivers of Mr Werner K. Rey, the fugitive Swiss financier, have received claims against him of SFr3.02bn (Dollars 2.1bn). But nearly three years after the collapse of Mr Rey's Omni Holdings, only a tiny fraction of this amount has been recovered. In its latest letter to creditors, Atag Ernst &amp; Young said it had accepted only SFr842m of the claims. Another SFr519m had been rejected while claims worth SFr1.66bn were being held pending further investigation. Omni, an aggressive conglomerate, collapsed in April, 1991 with more than SFr2bn in debts, making it Switzerland's largest corporate collapse. Mr Rey went to the Bahamas and has refused to return. He has been charged with fraud and theft and Swiss authorities are preparing a request for his extradition. Atag said it sold Mr Rey's Rolls-Royce Corniche car last year for SFr26,000 and a property for SFr14m, but the net proceeds available to creditors from these two transactions would amount to only between SFr2.8m and SFr5.7m.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: James Finlay shares dip after profits warning Shares in James Finlay, the overseas trading and financial services group, fell sharply to 65p in early trading yesterday following a warning that profits from tea production in Kenya would decline more than expected. However, the shares later recovered to close at 75p, still down 5p on the day. Mr Richard Muir, chairman, blamed the effect of drought in the first four months of the year, coupled with in- flation and other currency factors. The group is expecting a tea crop of about 20m kg, compared with an exceptional 22.3m kg last year.</p>

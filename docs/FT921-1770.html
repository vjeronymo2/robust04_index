			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Management: Going to work on ageism / A report on plans to end discrimination After sexism and racism, the next '-ism' to be tackled by anti-discrimination legislation could be ageism. One pledge to have gone largely unnoticed during the past few days of manifesto madness is Labour's plan to examine the feasibility of just such a law. Employers could be banned from specifying an age for a particular post in a newspaper advertisement, in the same way that it would be illegal now for them to say they wanted to employ only a white person or a man. According to Brook Street, the employment agency, age discrimination does not start at 55. Says Anita Higginson, marketing and training director: 'If you're a judge it's OK to be over 70 and go on until you drop dead; if you're looking for a first secretarial job you could be finished by 25'. Associating particular jobs with particular ages is commonly an unthinking reflex on the part of employers, says Higginson. For example, the popular perception is that the chairman of a company - or, at the opposite end of the scale, a cleaner - will be over 50. According to a survey of 1,000 personnel directors conducted by Gallup for Brook Street, more than 60 per cent thought receptionists should be under 35. The same survey revealed that nearly 80 per cent of workers over 50 believed they had been refused a job because they were too old, even though they had the relevant skills. Some organisations have made a virtue out of breaking the stereotypes as they have struggled, particularly before the recession, to plug labour and skill gaps. B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, for example, has stores staffed entirely by men and women over 50 and has proclaimed the policy an unqualified success. Research by the World Health Organisation into Tesco's employees has found that older workers employed by the company are better with customers, more reliable, more responsible and less likely to take time off sick than their younger colleagues. The Gallup survey for Brook Street was carried out two years ago and there are some signs that attitudes among employers are beginning to change. A recent survey, by Alan Walker and Philip Taylor from the University of Sheffield, suggests, surprisingly, that employers could now even favour outlawing age discrimination. The survey of 500 employers, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, found 55 per cent in favour of a law along the lines of the sex and race discrimination acts. Some deep-rooted reservations about taking on older workers remain: the survey also found that employers feared they would not get a reasonable return on the money they spent on training older workers. This finding is important for policy makers, given that three out of four respondents to the survey perceived a lack of appropriate skills as the top reason for not taking on older workers. Government policies on training have, to date, been strongly biased in favour of younger workers. In spite of the Sheffield findings, Labour is likely to face strong opposition from employers' bodies to any plans for legislation. The Confederation of British Industry favours a voluntary approach and argues that there could be circumstances where it might be sensible for employers to specify age when, for example a post requires a particular level of experience. Labour's argument is that employers have had plenty of time to reform. Guidelines from the Institute of Personnel Management, which have been in circulation for some time, strongly urge organisations not to specify ages in advertisements. The Sheffield survey found that nearly half of employers had not seen the IPM guidelines although, 'in some cases, the guidelines had been copied enthusiastically to all departments in an organisation'. If much age discrimination is based on an unthinking reflex, the Sheffield finding indicates that - considerable progress could be achieved simply by increased education of employers.</p>

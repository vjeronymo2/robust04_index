			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Management: Thin pickings may provide food for thought - The BES's record is likely to hang heavily over efforts to promote interest in the Enterprise Investment Scheme It should have been such a jolly event. After nearly six years as investors in a Business Expansion Scheme that funded the Deals restaurant chain, shareholders were attending the opening of a third outlet, a finely converted building in Hammersmith, west London. But despite the presence of Lord Lichfield, royal photographer, and the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley - both large investors in the BES - a cloud hung over proceedings. The free champagne at the launch party is about the only return Deals investors have seen so far. Several have begun to ask - some rather forcefully - when they might get their money back. And what about a dividend? With admirable stoicism, one shareholder summed up the extent to which expectations had slipped. 'At least Deals has survived.' While this hardly smacks of an ambitious investment target, survival is indeed an achievement. The fact is that of the 1,300 publicly-funded trading companies set up under the BES scheme, less than 20 per cent have so far returned any cash to investors, according to John Spiers, editor of BESt Investment, which monitors and evaluates the schemes. It is a record that will hang heavily over efforts to interest investors in the replacement for the BES, the Enterprise Investment Scheme, announced in the last budget by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke. But the record is not entirely bleak. Those who invested in schemes between 1983-85 on the whole got back their gross investment and the benefit of tax breaks, according to Spiers. But those who invested in the next three years fared much worse as the recession swept many companies away. Nevertheless, the successes are notable. The films Leon the Pig Farmer and Henry V were both critically acclaimed as box office successes and should give a handsome return to their investors. Takare and Associated Nursing, two healthcare companies now quoted, also started as BES schemes. Shares in Resort Hotels, by contrast, are now suspended having been successfully floated. And Graham Wood, a structural steel producer, went bust in 1992, although not before it had given its original investors ample opportunity to sell in the market. Of the 20 BES companies listed, only about half have survived, according to Tim Villiers, of the BES Association. Broadly speaking, the finance bill published last week suggests the new EIS scheme will be modelled on BES legislation but will remove the opportunity to invest in property ventures like the assured tenancy scheme. The legislation remains fiendishly complicated, accountants say, but there are some positive changes. Investors will be allowed to take an active and paid role on the boards of the companies in which they invest, bringing in valuable expertise. Second, the up-front tax break for the new EIS has been cut to 20 per cent, though capital gains and dividends are free of tax. While this is less generous than the 40 per cent tax break allowed under the old BES, it may mean investors in future take a far closer look at the underlying investment. Trading company BES schemes were too often supported for the tax incentives alone. But the EIS is generating less interest than the Venture Capital Investment Trusts, announced in the budget (see above). According to Charles Fry, of Johnson Fry, one of the largest sponsors of BES schemes, the EIS is unlikely to raise more than Pounds 50m in its first year.</p>

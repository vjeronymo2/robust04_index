			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIELD IN TROUBLE;  </P> <P> UNOCAL STILL PUMPS OIL THE OLD WAY IN VENTURA COUNTY. BUT A PROPOSED  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT COULD FORCE A SHUTDOWN.  </P> <P> A Bible-quoting Presbyterian from Pennsylvania, 200 Chinese immigrant laborers  and an equal number of hard-drinking wildcatters converged in the arid hills of  Ventura County a century ago with a single goal: Oil.  </P> <P> Their work created the wells that powered the company that was to become Unocal  Corp., the Los Angeles-based energy company that observes its centennial next  year.  </P> <P> Partly as a remembrance, Unocal still maintains and operates some of the era's  ancient equipment there, and the wells continue to produce oil -- the  old-fashioned way.  </P> <P> But as the company observes its 100th year, it faces the prospect of having to  shut down the Ventura County operations that have otherwise withstood the  effects of time and weather. There's a stronger force at work: Development.  </P> <P> Unocal won't discuss details. But C. R. (Dick) Marshall, Unocal's production  foreman for the Ventura area, said a group of investors is considering an  upscale residential development on about 1,200 acres near Unocal's oil fields  above Santa Paula.  </P> <P> The company is talking with developers about possible conflicts between the  project and the old oil wells -- and if push comes to shove, Unocal could just  shut the whole thing down as early as next year.  </P> <P> "It would just cost too much to upgrade them and maintain them," Marshall said.  Unocal also wants to preserve its rights to future oil production near the  site, he said.  </P> <P> The operations consist of a handful of wells sunk as long ago as 1884, still  operated by 19th-Century-style "jack line" pumps.  </P> <P> The operations also include an unusual group of tunnels dug by Chinese  immigrant laborers in 1890 to tap nearly vertical deposits of oil. About 28 of  60 tunnels remain productive, dribbling out water and about five barrels of oil  a day.  </P> <P> The operations are all that remain of the bustling oil field that gave birth to  Unocal in the late 1800s.  </P> <P> The Pennsylvanian was Lyman Stewart, co-founder of the company, who came to  California to prospect for oil. He found it in the hills above Santa Paula,  where the native Chumash Indians used sticky black goo from natural seeps to  waterproof their baskets.  </P> <P> "Lyman was a geologist, and he rode horseback through here, and he just . . .  mapped all these seeps," said Marshall, a 16-year Unocal veteran and unofficial  company historian. "Then he would go to the property owner and say, 'Listen,  I'd like to get the mineral rights to your property' " -- rights he'd buy for  $2 to $5 an acre.  </P> <P> With rights to about 38,000 acres in hand, Stewart then set about drilling for  oil, primarily in the Adams Canyon area.  </P> <P> Stewart and his hearty mustachioed banker partner Wallace L. Hardison formed  the Hardison &amp; Stewart Oil Co. It and two other oil companies merged in  October, 1890, to create Union Oil Co. of California, now called Unocal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sent Stream Down Canyon  </P> <P> The area was the site of Unocal's -- and California's -- first gushers. In  January, 1888, Adams Canyon Well No. 16 hit big and got credit for saving the  fledgling company from bankruptcy.  </P> <P> According to old company logs, "the oil shot up to a height of nearly 100 feet  and flowed at the rate of 800 to 900 barrels a day. Before it could be  controlled, it sent a stream down the canyon for a distance of seven miles."  </P> <P> Four years later, Adams No. 28 surpassed the first well. In February, 1892, it  came in, blowing oil over the derrick, flowing down the canyon into the Santa  Clara River and out to sea, according to a Unocal history. At its peak, the  well produced 1,500 barrels of oil per day.  </P> <P> On Sulphur Mountain, which formed one of the canyon's walls, the terrain was  too steep to build derricks. Following the example of an earlier prospector,  Stewart decided to tunnel for oil.  </P> <P> About 200 Chinese immigrants -- known for mining skill -- were shipped into  nearby Port Hueneme and installed in boarding houses near the oil field.  </P> <P> Working in crews of about a dozen, the laborers set about digging an ingenious  network of tunnels to tap the oil deposits. The tunnels angled uphill from the  entrance to allow oil to run out in redwood sluices. Fresh air blew in through  a water-powered ventilator. At the tunnel's entrance, a man with a mirror  reflected sunlight back into the tunnel's darkness to help diggers see and stay  aligned.  </P> <P> The work was long and arduous. Crews with picks and shovels took four or five  months to dig an average 300- to 400-foot tunnel. And some tunnels ran more  than 1,500 feet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Explosion Killed 4 Men  </P> <P> The work was also dangerous. Cave-ins were common, and crews took canaries with  them -- much as coal miners do -- to detect natural gas buildups. In 1890, an  explosion rocked Adams Canyon Tunnel No. 4, called the Boarding House tunnel  because of its proximity to the diggers' camp.  </P> <P> Hardison's brother, Harvey, and three other men entered the tunnel to  investigate -- and a second explosion killed all four.  </P> <P> Even outside the tunnels, life was rough. The white drilling crews lived in  separate camps from the Chinese mining crews, but fights nevertheless erupted  between the two, Marshall said.  </P> <P> In Santa Paula, hard-drinking roughnecks routinely shot up the local saloon,  despite the best efforts of the devout Stewart to keep them in check.  </P> <P> Now, little is left of the tunnels except the pipes that continue to collect  oil. Many of the tunnels collapsed during the torrential rains of 1969,  Marshall recalled, and only a handful are still open to the surface.  </P> <P> The vertical wells are in better shape: three of the old units that powered the  drilling pumps remain. Components of the wooden pumps themselves have been  replaced over the years with steel; only Slocum Well No. 15 is preserved as it  was, made entirely of redwood.  </P> <P> The operations produce enough oil to pay for their upkeep and make a few  dollars for Unocal, maybe 25 to 30 barrels a day. That's minuscule compared to  the average 400 to 500 barrels a day from a modern well on nearby Sulphur  Crest, Marshall said.  </P> <P> "It's really not an economical project," Marshall said. "They just keep them  going for the history and because it was part of the early company."  </P></p>

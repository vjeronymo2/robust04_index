			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Feb MENA)--The Cairo newspapers today  stated that the will of peace has imposed itself on the Middle  East and that intentions of armed conflict have receded after  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres signed the Cairo Agreement to implement the  Gaza-Jericho Accord.    AL-AKHBAR said the agreement will help toward signing a  final  accord between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  to implement the Declaration of Principles, which everyone hopes  will end the tension and bloody conflict prevailing in the  region for approximately 50 years.    The paper called on Israel to eliminate any potential  obstacles that might mar the tranquility of the negotiations'  final phase or that might impede the required measures to  implement the accord.    The paper warned against building new settlements that will  create disputes and a conflict of authority in these territories  at a time when understanding and cooperation are needed to  streamline the transfer of power in an atmosphere of tranquility  and coexistence.    AL-JUMHURIYAH praised President Husni Mubarak's efforts to  bring the Palestinian and Israeli views closer until the Cairo  Declaration was signed.    It said: Egypt hosted Palestinian and Israeli negotiating  delegations and was open to a difficult dialogue between the two  sides at a crucial moment and while the Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators faced a difficult situation. The Palestinian  negotiator relied on vast Egyptian experience of dialogue and  formulating negotiating positions.    AL-JUMHURIYAH expressed the hope that the peace process will  extend east to include Jordan and Israel and north to include  Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.    AL-AHRAM emphasized that Egyptian diplomacy did all it could  to push negotiations between the two sides to the shore of  safety in line with its historical and cultural role in the  region as the largest Arab country.</p>

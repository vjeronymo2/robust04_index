Hryhoryev, SILSKI VISTI correspondent, Rivne </F> Oblast: "An Urgent Signal: Stop the Seed Drills!"]    [Text] V. Matviyenko, head of the Sarny Administration of  Agriculture and Food returned to the rayon center in a bad mood:    "There is little good news. I visited Tynne, Hnymovychi, and  Stepan. You cannot approach the machine operators. They sowed a  few hectares of corn each and stopped their machines: there is  no more seed.    A shortage of seed is holding up sowing in most of the  oblast's collective agricultural enterprises. The seed, which  the farms obtained on their own by bartering it for sugar,  timber, meat, and other products, has all been sown, and the  promised new supplies have still not arrived. In accordance with  a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast was to have  received 2,012 metric tons of corn seed before the sowing season  began.    The farmers are trying to make arrangements with seed  suppliers in Vinnytsya, Kherson, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts.  These, however, are refusing to be persuaded and are demanding  payment in advance. But the grain procurement enterprises have  no money, and the loans have gotten lost at the banks.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BEAUTY QUEST TOUCHES OFF A GOLD MASSAGE IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Want your skin to have that golden glow? Get it massaged with the precious  metal.  </P> <P> "With its rich, bright shine, gold offers smoother skin than any massage  cream," said the manager of a beauty salon in Osaka, western Japan, which  offers gold massage.  </P> <P> Japan is now one of the world's largest importers of gold, largely due to a  growing demand among newly affluent Japanese for all things golden.  </P> <P> Some Japanese sushi bars offer the rice and raw fish delicacy with thin gold  belts wrapped around it. Others offer dried seasoning with gold in it to  sprinkle on noodles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Golden Sake  </P> <P> Some sell sake with small pieces of gold floating in it.  </P> <P> The Japanese have a long history of eating gold -- they think it's good for the  health.  </P> <P> The full "Goldfinger" body treatment at the Osaka clinic, which takes about an  hour, costs $230, while a facial massage is $60 -- more than double the prices  for normal massages.  </P> <P> "It stimulates blood circulation much more than any other massage cream and  eventually makes the skin shine more than regular cream massages can," a  beautician at the clinic says.  </P> <P> The clinic uses about a handful of ultra-thin gold foil sheets for each full  body massage. All of the gold is absorbed into the skin, the manager says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demand Is Growing  </P> <P> Despite the high price, demand for the service is growing.  </P> <P> "An average of one customer a day shows up for a gold massage. Business has  been going well," she said, adding that quite a few customers return at least  once a month.  </P> <P> The clinic said it has received several inquiries about the service from men  but has had to turn them down.  </P> <P> "Our clinic is not large enough to have separate rooms for men and women," the  spokeswoman said. "We have to refuse men because customers must be naked for a  session."  </P> <P> One woman who requested anonymity said she had tried the gold massage and felt  her skin was smoother after the treatment. But, she added, she could not afford  the treatment again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mental Benefits Stressed  </P> <P> A doctor specializing in dermatology who declined to be identified said the  positive effects of such treatment are likely to be more mental than physical.  </P> <P> "All one can get from this kind of massage is psychological satisfaction, no  physical benefits at all," he said.  </P> <P> "Gold is one of those materials that is nearly impossible to absorb. From that  point of view, I can see no medical merit in a gold massage."  </P> <P> He added that as long as the gold is pure, no skin problems should result from  the treatment. However, if it contains lead or zinc, some customers could  suffer allergic reactions.  </P></p>

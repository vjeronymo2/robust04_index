			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> COUNTY RESULTS;  </P> <P> IRVINE MAYOR AGRAN OUSTED BY SHERIDAN  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was ousted early today in one of several  down-to-the-wire Orange County elections that forced three other incumbents  into runoffs.  </P> <P> While Tuesday's primary election drew a lackluster turnout of 38.1%, it  produced some surprises for Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, Dist.  Atty Michael R. Capizzi and School Supt. Robert D. Peterson, who will face  runoffs with their challengers in November.  </P> <P> Voters countywide also soundly defeated Measure A, a controversial initiative  to locate all future jails in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> In addition, Supervisors Thomas F. Riley of Newport Beach and Don R. Roth of  Anaheim were returned comfortably to office as expected, with Roth capturing  70.6% of the vote and Riley 60.4%.  </P> <P> Voters also returned County Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates to a fifth term in  office.  </P> <P> In the county's most bitter race, Irvine council member Sally Anne Sheridan  edged out the progressive, 12-year council veteran Agran by 860 votes. Agran's  outspoken support of gay rights, environmental protection and controls on  growth won him national notoriety.  </P> <P> "There was an anti-Agran vote," Sheridan said today, noting that she was  outspent by her opponent. "I think people were tired of the global versus local  issues, Agran's use of the city to further his own ends and his undermining the  city manager form of government." She said her campaign attracted a cross  section of voters who disagreed on many issues.  </P> <P> "There is no mandate," she said. "Walking and talking to people convinced them  to vote for me."  </P> <P> Agran, who watched an early lead turn into defeat, said: "Personally, it's  difficult. But I do respect the Democratic process and the people have chosen a  new direction.  </P> <P> "Sally Anne Sheridan in her statements and her literature said I was the issue.  She relentlessly, and apparently effectively, sought to make me the issue."  </P> <P> In other races, Democrats chose former Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Umberg over  Jerry Yudelson to run against Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) in the  72nd Assembly District in November. Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays won 41.5%  of the vote in defeating 4 others for the Republican nomination for the 58th  state Assembly District.  </P> <P> In statewide races featuring local contestants, Republicans chose Sen. Marian  Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) over Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) for the  lieutenant governor's race. Angela (Bay) Buchanan of Irvine, the Republican  candidate for state treasurer, lost the Republican nomination for state  treasurer to Thomas W. Hayes, the incumbent.  </P> <P> Wieder, the first supervisor in 10 years to face a runoff, will be challenged  by Joy L. Neugebauer. Capizzi, the first district attorney in more than 40  years to face a runoff, will run against James G. Enright, chief deputy  district attorney. Peterson, school superintendent for 24 years, will face John  F. Dean who captured the slight majority vote.  </P></p>

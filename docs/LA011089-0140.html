			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GULF STATES TIGHTEN TAP ON OIL FLOW  </P> <P> Gulf states generally turned oil taps lower in early January to comply with an  OPEC pact aimed at boosting prices by trimming output nearly 20%, Gulf oil  industry sources said today.  </P> <P> They said Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries, slashed output to 3.6 million barrels a day in the week  ended Jan. 8 from 7.4 million the week before.  </P> <P> The lower production easily meets the kingdom's new daily quota of 4.524  million barrels which went into effect Jan. 1.  </P> <P> "It seems there has been a general downward trend in output in the Gulf in the  first week as all states intend to abide by the (OPEC output) agreement," an  oil industry analyst said.  </P> <P> It was not known if Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have lowered output to  their respective quotas of 1.037 million and 988,000 barrels a day, oil  industry sources in the Gulf said. But both states have reduced output from  December levels, the sources said.  </P> <P> The 13 members of OPEC agreed in November to cut output to 18.5 million barrels  a day in the first half of 1989. OPEC output in December was estimated at 22.76  million barrels a day, according to a Reuters survey.  </P></p>

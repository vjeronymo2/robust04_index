			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (EFE) -- Candidates  Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana proclaimed victory today in  Colombia's initial presidential elections and both expressed  their confidence that they will win in the runoff elections on  19 June.    The candidates made brief statements after 95.6 percent of  the votes were counted and the results announced, giving them a  wide margin over the remaining 16 candidates.    Liberal candidate Samper regretted that he did not win in  the  initial elections and thanked the residents of Santa Fe de  Bogota who gave him a relatively broad margin compared with the  rest of the country.    The liberals expected to garner more votes and the climate,  although festive, was one of concern at the Orquidea Real Hotel  where Samper kept abreast of the vote count.    The Pastrana supporters, on the other hand, were euphoric in  the Tequendama Hotel because the slight margin garnered by  Samper augurs well for them in the runoff elections.    Pastrana thanked his family, his supporters, and all of  those  who voted for any candidate and invited them to join his  bandwagon.    Candidate Antonio Navarro of the Commitment with Colombia  movement, who obtained a little over 3.5 percent of the votes,  said he "was calm because despite all the difficulties that  existed during the campaign, we obtained a decent and dignified  vote which leaves us in a position to do well in the future."</p>

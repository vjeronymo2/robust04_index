			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Steetley seeks shareholder support for Tarmac merger THE BATTLE for control of Steetley, the building materials group, is expected to intensify with the publication today of the group's latest appeal for support to shareholders. The group has written to its 7,000 shareholders - institutional investors own 80 per cent of the 156.3m shares - defending its proposal to merge its UK brick, clay roof tile and concrete products businesses with those of Tarmac, Britain's biggest construction and building materials group. The announcement of the joint venture plan at the beginning of December prompted a hostile bid from Redland, the building materials group which has long coveted Steetley's domestic brick and French aggregates operations. Redland's 85-for-100 share exchange offer was yesterday worth more than Pounds 630m, valuing each Steetley share at 405.45p. Steetley's shares closed last night at 377p. In the document, which will be posted to shareholders today, Steetley says the Tarmac merger would reduce unit production costs by up to 15 per cent and generate combined savings of at least Pounds 10m a year. Savings would include the closure of 14 out of 56 plants. Combined brick production would be cut by 20 per cent or 160m bricks a year. Tarmac's large UK construction, housebuilding and concrete operations and its international interests would be excluded from the joint venture, which would be named Allied Building Materials. Steetley would retain its European concrete and aggregates businesses. It is the largest aggregates producer in France. The document says: 'No other combination could bring together two companies with anything like the same benefits across the total range of their building products.' It forecast that by the mid 1990s Allied would be generating profit margins higher than those achieved during 1988 and 1989, the two best years for UK construction output. A letter from Sir Eric Pountain, Tarmac's chairman, included in the document, endorses the joint venture proposal which he says 'will represent a potent challenge to our competitors . . . founded on one of the lowest cost structures in the industry'. Steetley is due to publish by next Monday its official defence document against the Redland bid. This, however, may be postponed if the Office of Fair Trading has not pronounced by then on possible monopoly implications raised by the bid.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Overseas earnings by consultants fall The net overseas earnings of UK professional consultants fell slightly last year, figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show. Consultants, defined as including professions such as engineers, architects and accountants, earned a net Pounds 1.34bn last year, down from Pounds 1.41bn in 1992. The biggest contribution came from the legal profession, which earned a net Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 473m in 1992. Accountants and surveyors recorded the sharpest increases in net overseas earnings over the two years, but there were steep declines in the earnings recorded by architects and advertisers. Apart from lawyers, consulting engineers made the biggest contribution, with net earnings of Pounds 240m. The biggest market for UK consultants was the European Union, with 49 per cent of the net total. Asia was second, with 24 per cent. The UK had only a small surplus with the Americas, mainly because its imports from the region were higher than from any other area. The net overseas earnings of consultants have declined steadily in recent years, after peaking at Pounds 1.61bn in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO VOTE ON $100 PAY INCREASE  </P> <P> The City Council will vote this month on a proposal to increase council  members' salaries from $300 to $400 per month.  </P> <P> Council members James Flora, Douglas Bystry and William D. Mahoney argued that  out-of-pocket expenses related to service as council members exceeded the  current $300 pay.  </P> <P> But Councilman John C. Holmberg challenged his colleagues to produce evidence  of those expenses.  </P> <P> Holmberg urged the council to postpone consideration of the increase until the  1990-91 budget is drafted. When his suggestion received no support, Holmberg  said: "I think it's arrogant for the council to say, 'We're going to put this  pay increase ahead of everything else in the budget.' As a taxpayer, it really  irritates me."  </P> <P> The council voted to decide the issue on March 20.  </P> <P> Mayor Beth Graham, arguing for the raise, said, "No one should be precluded  from service on the council because of financial status." Graham said she has  been fortunate that her employer allows her to be absent from work on city  business without a loss in pay.  </P> <P> The council's salaries have not changed since 1982, City Manager Lee Risner  said.  </P> <P> Council salaries in Orange County's 29 cities range from nothing, in Seal Beach  and Villa Park, to $690 monthly in Costa Mesa and Orange, Risner said.  </P> <P> Council members also receive a stipend of $30 for each meeting of the La Habra  Redevelopment Agency, on which they all serve as directors. These meetings are  customarily held at the end of City Council meetings and average about one each  month, Risner said.  </P> <P> State law limits the pay increase to no more than $120, or 5% per year since  the last raise in 1982, he said.

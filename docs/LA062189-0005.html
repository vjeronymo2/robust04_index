			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCINERATOR  </P> <P> This letter is in response to "Judge Clears Way for Building of Toxic Waste  Incinerator," Metro, June 2.  </P> <P> I'm amazed that so soon after the environmental disaster in Alaska that a  Superior Court judge would order the issuance of construction permits to allow  for a toxic waste incinerator to be built without a full environmental impact  report being conducted.  </P> <P> Judge Kurt Lewin ordered the incinerators' developers to use state-of-the-art  anti-pollution equipment -- who's going to monitor the construction to insure  the equipment installation?  </P> <P> I'm all for building the incinerator because the waste needs to be disposed of,  but without a full environmental impact report being conducted, we may not find  out the ill effects of burning the estimated 22,500 tons of hazardous materials  for decades.  </P> <P> MIKE YURISH  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURORS WILL DECIDE CASE AGAINST BUCKEY AFTER 3-MONTH TRIAL  </P> <P> The fate of McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey was turned over to the  jury Tuesday after attorneys for both sides wound up emotional final arguments.  </P> <P> The five-man, seven-woman panel paid close attention as the lawyers sought  during the three-month trial's final hours to convince them of the nursery  school teacher's guilt or innocence on eight counts of molestation involving  three girls.  </P> <P> "Stick it to the people (the district attorney's office) if they didn't do  their job," urged defense lawyer Danny Davis, referring to what he called a  botched investigation and a parade of unreliable witnesses.  </P> <P> He asked jurors to separate "raw emotionality" from "real evidence."  </P> <P> But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Martinez implored them to look at all the evidence  against the 32-year-old Buckey.  </P> <P> "These children were molested," he said. "These children have felt injustice  for so long that they've come to you for help. Ray Buckey did this thing to  them. Don't reject them."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg excused the jury until  Monday, when he will instruct them on the law and send them into the jury room  to begin deliberations.  </P> <P> "Avoid the temptation you might feel to start discussing or deciding it now,"  he told them. "It would be premature to do that."  </P> <P> The final day of the trial was peppered with allusions to McCarthyism, Vietnam,  Charles Dickens and Walt Disney.  </P> <P> Quoting from Dickens' "Great Expectations," Martinez compared the plight of the  alleged child victims at McMartin to the 19th-Century characters: "In the  little world in which children have their existence, there is nothing so finely  perceived or finely felt as injustice." He said the children should be  believed, despite inconsistencies he said resulted from their attempts to  forget the traumatic incidents.  </P> <P> "If they fantasize, they fantasize within their experience," he said, asking  how they could have made up the graphic details of their alleged sexual abuse  without any frame of reference except Buckey.  </P> <P> Martinez dismissed Buckey's supposed interest in early childhood education,  saying he dropped out of school and exhibited behavior inappropriate for a  teacher:  </P> <P> "In no way was he serious about becoming a preschool teacher," the prosecutor  said. Rather, he said, "the predator is always close to the prey."  </P> <P> Prosecutors had the final word Tuesday because the burden of proving that  Buckey is guilty lies with them.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, however, Davis said the children who testified against his  client should not be believed, both because their accounts were contaminated by  years of interviews and discussions and because those accounts changed over  time.  </P> <P> He pointed to what he called one girl's disregard for the truth, quoting her  answer to questions about inconsistencies between her testimony at each trial:  "That was then; this is now."  </P> <P> It is possible, he said, that children today alleging that Buckey molested them  will deny it in the future, just as some who earlier accused all seven original  defendants later said they were molested by Buckey and his mother, and still  later, said that only Buckey abused them.  </P> <P> "Are we going to wait 20 years and look back and say, 'What we did to Ray  Buckey was wrong?' " Davis asked.  </P></p>

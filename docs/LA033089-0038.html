			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syrian troops and their Lebanese allies bombarded Christian areas of Beirut in  defiance of an Arab League appeal for a truce, while Christian Maj. Gen. Michel  Aoun stepped up his vitriolic rhetoric against Syria. At least seven people  were killed and 24 wounded in the day's violence in Lebanon. At a news  conference at the bombed-out presidential palace, Aoun criticized U.S.  Ambassador John McCarthy for being "somewhat wanting in courage" and not  speaking out to protest the shelling until the ambassador's residence was hit.  The current fighting was triggered by a naval and aerial blockade imposed by  Aoun against Muslim-run illegal ports.  </P></p>

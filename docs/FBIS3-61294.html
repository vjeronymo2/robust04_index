Last week the Decree of the Council of  Ministers On Measures To Resolve Commercial Disputes Arising in  Conjunction With the Export of Russian Goods was signed, which  gave the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations the right to  establish quotas and introduce licensing for the export of goods  in regard to which the threat of the introduction of antidumping  or other restrictive measures exists. Therefore, on the eve of  Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels, Russia demonstrated its  readiness to comply with the European Union rules of the game  and the GATT antidumping code.    However, in the opinion of the Russian side, this  readiness will not solve all problems of the world market  related to so-called "sensitive commodities" (a term of the  European Communities Commission), of which aluminum is one. The  way out of the existing situation is elsewhere--while continuing  negotiations with the European Union, to attempt to come to an  agreement on measures to regulate the market directly with the  producers and exporters of aluminum. Russia outlined its  position at a meeting of representatives of the Governments of  Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, the United States, and the  European Community held on 1-2 December of this year.  <H5>  Russia in Search of Leeway </H5>   In addition to official personalities, representatives of  the  industries of these countries, jointly with the International  Primary Aluminum Institute (IPAI), took part in the first stage  of proceedings of the multilateral meeting. Those attending the  meeting thought that the simultaneous participation of officials  and producers was caused by a unique concurrence of events on  the world aluminum market.    Against the background of an overall recession in the world  economy, a massive discharge of aluminum on the world market  occurred in the early 1990's, and prices for the metal declined  to the level of eight years ago. Now, overproduction (including  reserves) of primary aluminum in the world comes to 1.5 to 2  million tonnes annually. Although the conference was not crowned  with the signing of any agreement, the participants in it laid  down their common position and submitted this document to their  governments: Everybody is responsible for the overproduction,  and, accordingly, cutbacks in production should also be made by  quite a number of countries.    The representatives of Russia did not manage to obtain what  they were counting on--the lifting of sanctions. However, there  is still hope: The final document includes a thesis on the need  to facilitate the transformation of the aluminum industry of  Russia and CIS countries into a sector with full market  orientation, as well as continuation of access to Western  markets for considerable volumes of aluminum from CIS countries.  <H3>  The Alyuminiy Concern: European Communities Commission  Sanctions Are Bad Medicine </H3>   KOMMERSANT approached Igor Prokopov, president of the  Alyuminiy Joint-Stock Company, with a request to comment on  current events; he had participated in the conference in  Washington, representing the interests of Russian producers and  exporters.    In his words, the position of the Russian side is based on  real facts. They are as follows. In the last 10 years aluminum  production in the world has increased by 4.3 million tonnes.  During the same period, Russia increased its output by only  200,000 tonnes. The difficult situation on the world aluminum  market has been caused not only by the concentrated unloading of  aluminum by CIS countries but also by the virtually unhindered  penetration of inexpensive aluminum from Brazil, Venezuela,  Australia, and Canada which has become possible in view of the  active participation of a number of European and Japanese  companies in investing in aluminum plants in these countries.  This was precisely where the bulk of the increment in aluminum  production occurred (see tables 1-3).    Mr. Prokopov said: "We categorically disagree with  protectionist attempts to solve the problem of the world  aluminum market solely at the expense of Russia, as the European  Communities Commission is trying to do. First, responsibility  for the poor market should be shared by all who had something to  do with its condition, including West European companies.    Second, this decision in itself is erroneous, unpromising,  and harmful primarily for metal producers. The decision has not  brought about an increase in prices, nor will it: This decision,  like poor medicine, neglects the sickness of the aluminum market  even more. Prices are continuing to decline, export streams are  changing: All of us are wasting additional funds for  transportation and other services.    Third, it is impossible in principle to solve the common  problem solely at the expense of Russia because in this case the  operation of its aluminum industry should be shut down virtually  in its entirety. For our part, we are ready for constructive  work: Aluminum-producing capacity in the amount of 600,000  tonnes has already been shut down in the CIS this year, of which  a volume of 300,000 tonnes is in Russia. We are prepared to  consider opportunities for further restriction of production by  an acceptable margin on the condition that all the major  producers do the same.    As far as Russian exports are concerned, as a chart shows,  the volume of direct exports will come to 0.5-0.6 million tonnes  out of a total production volume of 1.6-1.7 million tonnes. The  rest will be delivered toward so-called tolling operations.  Tolling, which amounts to processing the raw materials of the  customer, makes it possible for Russian enterprises on one hand  to utilize the available capacity, while on the other, to obtain  the necessary working capital, because it is carried out on  prepaid terms. Under the existing rules for world trade,  sanctions for the growth of the volume of exports which has  brought about falling prices are instituted against the producer  country anyway, even if a foreign company acts as the customer.  However, Mr. Prokopov believes this to be debatable: Since it is  the property of the customer, the product of raw material  processing is subsequently returned to him, and for this reason  should not be considered part of Russian exports at all, as Mr.  Prokopov sees it.    In the words of the president of the Alyuminiy Concern,  Russia likewise cannot accept the accusations concerning the  existence of some preferential conditions created for the  aluminum industry in order to artificially make it competitive.  The Russian aluminum industry has been integrated with the world  to a considerable degree: More than 60 percent of alumina and a  large amount of carbon raw materials are purchased on the free  market (in 1993 about $1 billion will be spent for these  purposes); in the process, outlays on the transportation of raw  materials are quite high.    The second factor of price reductions--cheap  labor--virtually  does not influence the cost of the metal because its cost  accounts for only 5-8 percent of total production outlays.    Finally, the president of the concern considers the main  accusations (the artificial understatement of prices for metal  due to lower electricity rates) to be likewise groundless. In  his words, electricity rates for metal producers in the Urals  and Central Russia are equal to those in Europe. On average  Siberians pay more for electricity than Canadian producers (in  that country, special coefficients for rate reductions on  electricity for the aluminum industry exist), although less than  in Europe and the United States. The latter is due to the fact  that 80 percent of the aluminum in Russia is now manufactured  using electricity from large hydropower stations, which is  inexpensive in terms of self-cost.    In the words of Mr. Prokopov, the state does not provide any  financial support for aluminum enterprises and does not regulate  or control their operations in ways other than the  standard--taxes, quotas, and the issuance of licenses.  <H5>  Domestic Consumption as a Way To Solve External Problems </H5>   Specialists attribute the actual augmentation of the export  of aluminum of Russian provenance, which is indeed causing  stress on the world market, primarily to reductions in the  domestic consumption of metal in Russia. Even in better times  for the economy such consumption was not in line with the level  of development of the aluminum industry. On top of this,  recently it has been falling steadily: The main consumer of  aluminum, the military-industrial complex, is facing a crisis.    If the downward trend in domestic consumption were  successfully reversed, many export problems would take care of  themselves. Igor Prokopov directly ties the growth of domestic  aluminum consumption to the volume of foreign investment which  may be channeled to this industry. He notes that the aluminum  industry is virtually the only sector that is already prepared  to absorb such investment: "We are the only ones to not simply  avoid falling apart in these years of perestroykas and periods  of transitions but to maintain production at a stable level."    Speaking in Washington, the president of the concern noted  that if funds were available, some of the capacity in the  industry would be shut down for upgrading; thus, the volume of  output would unavoidably decline. Investment could be marshalled  to establish new metal-consuming production facilities, which  would also facilitate reductions in the volume of exports.  According to available calculations, the establishment of  container, packaging, and construction elements production could  boost domestic consumption by 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes a year.    This approach was received with understanding at the  conference in Washington, where it was ultimately agreed that  the overall strategy at this stage should also include  reconstruction of the Russian aluminum industry and incentives  for domestic demand for aluminum products in Russia, in addition  to regulation of production volumes (by all) and access to  market information.  <H5>  If Only We Could Endure a Year and Hang on for Two </H5>   In Mr. Prokopov's opinion, resolving to substantially  restrict the world output of aluminum for the year or two to  come is a mandatory condition for a real improvement in the  situation on the aluminum market. Such a decision may only be  made within the framework of a multilateral agreement with the  participation of all the main countries producing this metal. He  stated: "At any rate, we will vigorously defend our place in the  market as one of the largest producers of aluminum. At the same  time, with the consent of the government, we are prepared to  embark on developing measures aimed at the temporary  self-restriction of aluminum production."    In the process, the need for coordination will persist in  the  future, when the issue of recommissioning the laid-off capacity  arises after the accumulated commodity surplus has been  absorbed. However, the market itself will then be able to act as  the principal regulator of production; producers of metal whose  costs are the highest will still have to restrict their output.    For now, the main hopes are attached to the final round of  the multilateral conference on aluminum which will be held on  18-19 January 1994 in Brussels.

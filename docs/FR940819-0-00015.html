			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Cape Fear and Northeast Cape Fear Rivers carry commercial and public vessels laden with increasing of amounts hazardous materials. The area is also experiencing rapid growth in the recreational vessel, barge, and other maritime traffic. The hazards of the materials transported range from fire and explosion to public health hazards. These materials, essential to the military, and to the petrochemical and textile industries are routinely transported in a safe manner. However, maritime traffic which could interfere with the safe movement of a vessel carrying hazardous materials would create a condition of unacceptable risk to the maritime community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The shipping channel within the rivers is normally only 400 feet wide and maneuvering room for a deep draft vessel is limited. Additionally, most of the facilities which handle these materials are about 30 miles upstream from the mouth of the river. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The safety zone will be enacted by a Broadcast Notice to Mariners prior to the vessel's arrival into the river and will be terminated by another broadcast. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maritime traffic will not be significantly impacted because of the small percentage of vessels needing this safety zone, and the limited duration of the zone, typically less than three hours during transit and only for initial hookups and cargo operations. Other piloted commercial traffic would not normally be affected because meeting situations between two piloted vessels are not normally scheduled by the pilots. Other commercial traffic not under a pilot's control would be regulated and safe passage would be arranged by the vessel identified in the safety zone, Coast Guard enforcement personnel, and the non-piloted commercial vessel's master. Recreational vessels would be directed to the safe limits of the river out of the zone while the vessel passed and would be able to resume normal operation when the vessel identified in the safety zone has passed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual dates this safety zone would be in effect are not known at this time, but the public will be given notice through a Broadcast Notice to Mariners when the Captain of the Port Wilmington invokes the safety zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This safety zone is needed to protect the public from the hazards associated with the passage of these vessels as well as the movement of other maritime traffic around these vessels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because it expects the impact of this rule to be so minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B (National Environmental Protection Act), and actions to protect the public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Harbors, Marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, Part 165 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 165_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

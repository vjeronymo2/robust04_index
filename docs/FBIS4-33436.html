			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Lozano] </F>   [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (PL) -- Despite its current economic  difficulties, Cuba has managed to keep operational its free  education system, which includes a program for foreign students  which this year will graduate almost 30,000 graduates from 110  countries.    An Education Ministry report shows that in the summer of  1994, 3,460 youths from America, Asia, Africa, and the Near East  will complete courses in medical technology, primarily in the  fields of teaching, medicine, and stomatology. Since 1965, when  the first students in the program arrived, 26,027 foreigners  have graduated from the country's institutes and universities.    Lazara Aguirre, a Cuban Foreign Ministry employee in charge  of the program, explained that changes throughout the world and  economic problems on the island forced changes in certain  aspects of the program in order to maintain their profoundly  humanitarian projection. However, although economic support has  been reduced, the authorities have continued to provide support  and adopt measures to guarantee commitments, which means that  the foreign student plan will be maintained at least until the  year 2005, when the final group that is currently in Cuba will  complete their studies.    Aguirre also pointed out that graduates can practice  teaching  at centers akin to the careers they studied. Most of the  foreign scholarship holders in Cuba come from Sub-Saharan  African states (2,754), the American continent (400), North  Africa, the Near East (94), and Asia (36). Angola is the  country with the most students in Cuba (910), followed by  Mozambique (422) and Nicaragua (249). With regard to graduates  from 1965 through 1993, Angola also holds first place with  4,764. It is followed by Nicaragua (3,428), Ethiopia (3,070),  Mozambique (2,184), and Congo (1,236).    The fall of socialism in Europe intensified the U.S.  blockade  which, according to conservative estimates, has cost Cuba over  $40 billion over the past three decades, but, in spite of this,  free education has been maintained. Although with unavoidable  restrictions and a shortage of teaching equipment, all of Cuba's  schools and educational institutions have remained open, which  shows that the country's authorities consider education a  priority.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENTS RALLY IN U.S. TO DEMAND DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Despite threats from their government, more than 1,000 Chinese students  attending American universities came here from across the United States on  Sunday to call for a "free and democratic China" and march in protest in front  of their embassy.  </P> <P> "You are the hope that one day soon we will see democracy in China," Father  Robert Drinan, a Roman Catholic priest and former Massachusetts congressman,  told the rally at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial. The protest was designed as  a counterdemonstration to the 40th anniversary celebration of Communist rule in  Beijing.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, about 500 Chinese students and sympathizers protested  peacefully outside the Chinese Consulate with prayers for those killed last  June in Beijing's Tian An Men Square, freedom songs and a mock trial of Chinese  Communist leaders staged against the backdrop of a rented Hollywood tank.  </P> <P> A declaration adopted by the rally in Washington demanded revision of the  Chinese constitution, protection of human rights, free elections and a "free  market economy."  </P> <P> Then, citing the message of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. from the same steps  two decades ago, the declaration concluded, "We have a dream . . . of a free  and democratic China."  </P> <P> At the rally, organized by the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and  Scholars, addresses alternated with rock groups that played songs written to  commemorate the massacre of Chinese students in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> Most of the Chinese students wore T-shirts proclaiming their commitment to  democracy and held banners identifying their schools -- from UCLA and  Washington State to Michigan and Harvard.  </P> <P> The crowd was made up mostly of students from mainland China, with a smattering  of Chinese-Americans. Up to 40,000 mainland Chinese are enrolled in about 200  American universities.  </P> <P> Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), who has championed legislation in Congress to  allow the students to remain beyond their visa deadlines, said that Chinese  officials have warned students against "activities that could jeopardize their  future and that of their families" in China.  </P> <P> In particular, they were told that "attendance here could be regarded as a  counterrevolutionary activity," Gorton said. Such threats are impermissible in  the United States, he declared.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles rally, organized by the Joint Committee of Chinese Students  and Scholars in Southern California, young families with babies sat and stood  in Shatto Place outside the closed consulate, laughing and applauding skits  commemorating the Chinese army's firing on students last June. A rubber-tired  movie-prop tank, rented with its driver for $500, set the somber scene.  </P> <P> Protesters placed several dozen carnations on a mock casket and paused in  silent prayer in memory of the slain students. Waving placards urging "Leave  Students Alone" and "Abolish One-Party Rule," the crowd shouted "Down with  communism!" and sang a parody of a People's Republic of China patriotic song,  substituting words that translated to "There is no new China until there is no  communism."  </P> <P> Clearly enjoying a mock "court of history," the protesters refused to volunteer  any defense counsel for three men wearing masks representing China's paramount  leader, Deng Xiaoping, President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng. They  laughed as a "jury" sentenced the three to death by burning, hanging and burial  alive.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police closed Shatto Place between 4th and 6th Streets to vehicular  traffic during the two-hour program of speeches, songs and skits.  </P> <P> No one from the consulate appeared at the rally.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Myrna Oliver, in Los Angeles, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

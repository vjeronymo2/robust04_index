			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Palestinian officials Ilyas Frayj, Muhammad </F> al-Nazal, Ghassan al-Khatib, Muhammad Ghunaym, Dawud al-Tilhami,  Dr. 'Awwad M. 'Awwad, Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, Zuhayr al-Rayyis,  Wahid al-Hamdulillah, and 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi; place and date not  given; by 'Ali Salih: "Arms Phenomenon in Occupied Territories  Greatly Blown Out of Proportion"]    [Excerpts] Even if the spread of weapons in the occupied  territories, specifically in Gaza and Jericho, is not as great  as newspaper reports claim, it has become a phenomenon that  demands attention, study, and debate, as well as treatment.  [passage omitted]    In order to shed some light on this phenomenon, AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT asked Palestinian officials from six major Palestinian  factions and parties, plus some independent figures, a number of  questions about the extent of the spread of arms, the reasons,  motives, consequences, the sources of the arms, and the role of  the Palestinian police in containing them.    What follows are the replies AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received from  Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir), mobilization and organization  officer and Fatah Central Committee member in Tunis; Hamas's  Amman representative, Muhammad al-Nazal; Dawud al-Tilhami,  member of the politburo of the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine in Damascus; Ghassan al-Khatib, a senior  official in the People's Party in Jerusalem; 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi,  member of the politburo of the Democratic Palestinian Union  (DPU) in Jerusalem; Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of  the Islamic Jihad Movement in Damascus; Dr. 'Awwad Muhammad  'Awwad, a doctor by profession and well-known national figure,  from Tulkarm; Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj (Independent); Wahid  al-Hamdulillah, a well-known independent national figure, and a  member of the Board of Regents of al-Najah University in Nablus;  and Zuhayr al-Rayyis, a writer, journalist, nationally known  figure, and prominent personality in the Gaza Strip.    Salih: How widespread are weapons in the occupied  territories? Is it as great as the newspapers say?    Abu Mahir (Fatah): There are an estimated  10-15,000 weapons--and that could rise--mostly in the Gaza  Strip. [passage omitted]    Al-Khatib (People's Party): There is a widespread,  large-scale spread of arms, particularly in the Gaza Strip, and  in the occupied territories as a whole. It is not only a problem  of the extent of the spread, but of the lack of any control over  who is stockpiling these arms. Of course, some political  organizations obtain arms, but there are also other groups and  individuals that get them if they can afford them. [passage  omitted]    Al-Shu'aybi (DPU): The spread of arms is relative  to how it was in the past. What is remarkable is the  transformation in this phenomenon now, to a virtually public  one, especially in the Gaza Strip. One cannot speak of this type  of phenomenon existing in the West Bank. But there is a  noticeable increase in the buying and selling of arms, and a  boldness in carrying them.    Al-Shaqaqi (Islamic Jihad): The spread of arms is  aimed at the Gaza Strip and to a lesser extent the city of  Nablus in the West Bank. This is not new, nor is it on the scale  alleged by newspaper reports. What is new is the openness with  which people are bearing arms, especially Fatah members. This  comes after the Oslo accord, whereby the authorities no longer  hold Fatah people responsible specifically for bearing arms.  Some families historically known for owning arms, for trading in  them, or other purposes, are no longer afraid to display them.  Most of them are small, light arms; and, by our estimate, do not  exceed the volume of the arms in the hands of all the factions  and families, by more than a few hundred weapons.    Dr. 'Awwad (Independent): There are several  reasons why arms are more widespread in the Gaza Strip than in  the West Bank, but there are no precise estimates about this.  Regarding the spread of arms in Gaza in particular, it is now  said jokingly that arms are sold by the bushel, like fruits and  vegetables in Gaza. But the truth is that there is a noticeable  rise in armament, with hundreds of guns like Kalashnikovs, Uzis,  and pistols reaching Gaza. [passage omitted]    Salih: The causes and motives behind the spread of  arms--do the factions have a hand in this?    Abu Mahir: There are many and varied reasons for  this phenomenon, which I would summarize as follows:    First: the occupation, and its continued presence during the  transitional period, and our people's belief that there will be  no withdrawal unless the enemy is forced out, by force of arms.  Second: the sense of a need for protection from settler attacks  and their crimes, which now occur under the very noses of the  occupation soldiers. Third: the attacks of armed gangs on people  and property, and crimes committed by people claiming to belong  to Palestinian factions. Fourth: the spread of rumors about  interfactional fighting once the transitional period begins.  [passage omitted]    Al-Khatib: There are a number of reasons for the  spread of arms. First, their availibility from Israeli sources,  through the black market, and the underworld (gangs) in Israel.  Second, citizens' feelings of insecurity and unease. Third, the  uncertain future. Fourth, the existence of rivalry, at times,  among political factions. Fifth, Israel's reduction of  monitoring and punishment of people transporting arms or  possessing them, especially in Gaza. Al-Tilhami:  Naturally, a large number of intifadah fighters had arms,  especially in the last three years. This was a distinct  increase, to confront the occupation. In recent months,  especially after the Oslo accord, there have been more guns in  Gaza, both smuggled in from Sinai or bought from arms dealing  networks in the occupied territories. Of course, in light of the  mounting chaos in Gaza, it was natural for organized Palestinian  forces to provide the arms necessary for self-defense against  occupation attacks, settler operations, or occupation agents. We  do not rule out that the Israelis, using their access to  arms-dealing networks, might be trying to turn political  disputes among the factions into armed clashes. This is  something we seriously and firmly warn against.    Al-Shu'aybi: Historically, the national movement  has sought to obtain arms to use them in militant operations.  They used to smuggle the arms in. In recent years, faced with  the difficulty of smuggling, they have resorted to obtaining  arms from Israeli dealers in the underworld. They get arms  stolen from Israeli camps. [passage omitted]    Al-Hamdulillah: We in the occupied territories  accuse the occupation authorities and their intelligence service  of playing a secret and dangerous role in the spread of this  phenomenon. These authorities have recently begun to arm their  collaborators more openly, and on a wider scale, to defend  themselves, instead of moving them behind the so-called Green  Line [pre-1967 border]. [passage omitted]    Al-Rayyis: The diverse factions have their own  reasons and motives that [passage incomplete]    Salih: What are the sources of these arms?    Abu Mahir: Recently, most arms have come from  southern Lebanon via arms dealers, and through collusion with  occupation officers.    Al-Nazal: There are numerous sources for obtaining  arms. It varies from faction to faction. Hamas's principal  source of arms is the occupation soldiers killed by al-Qassam  heroes, who take their guns.    Al-Khatib: Israel is encouraging this phenomenon.    Al-Tilhami: As I mentioned previously, most of  these arms come from arms dealers and even the occupation  soldiers, some of whom sell arms for material gain. There is a  certain quantity of arms smuggled in from Sinai. [passage omitted    Al-Shaqaqi: We believe that the phenomenon is a  limited one. It is not as newspaper reports portray it. The  supply is meager, and the high prices are staggering. The cost  of a gun, since the signing of the Oslo Accord, has not gone  down one cent. The price of a revolver is the equivalent of  $3,000. A Kalashnikov is $7,000, and a U.S.-made M-16 is at  least $10,000. The sources of the guns are as follows:    1. The theft of Israeli-owned cars, especially in the  territories occupied since 1948; most of these cars have guns  inside.    2. Arms smuggling over the Egyptian border.    3. Drug dealers who trade drugs to Israeli soldiers in  exchange for their guns, which are then sold.    4. Some bedouin in Beersheba have family connections in Gaza  and bring arms to their relatives.    5. Arms stolen from Israeli army stockpiles or settlements.    6. Arms stored since 1967, which are reappearing now. These  are Egyptian guns whose owners want to sell them and profit from  high prices before it is too late and they lose their value.    Dr. 'Awwad: There are a number of sources. There  are Israeli arms dealers, well known to the Israeli authorities.  There are arms stockpiles collected over the long years for use  at the proper time, which for some has now arrived. And there  are arms smuggled over the Egyptian border.    Frayj: If the reports are true, the people fueling  this phenomenon are the enemies of the Palestinian people.    Al-Hamdulillah: In my view, the sources are  restricted to the following: the remainder of the arms left  behind by the Arab armies in the 1967 war; guns smuggled over  the borders of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan; and Israeli  sources, including the arming of collaborators. [passage omitted]    Abu Mahir: Apart from the motives of those who  promote guns, or facilitate their supply to citizens, these arms  are patriotic and Palestinian when possessed by our people. They  will eventually be used against the soldiers of the occupation  and the settlers. [passage omitted]    Al-Tilhami: We are afraid, after reading the  provisions of the Oslo and Cairo accords, that the so-called  Palestinian police will be entrusted with the mission of  repressing the intifadah and the people. [passage omitted] So we  will work with all opposition patriotic and Islamic forces,  groups, and persons, including members of Fatah and the  Palestine People's Party who oppose the Cairo accord, in order  to reject this mission entrusted to the so-called Palestinian  police. We reject the transformation of this body into an  instrument of oppression against the people, to serve a plan to  repress the intifadah and provide security for the occupation,  instad of eradicating it.

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Spending cuts urged on DSS housing benefit Treasury officials are continuing to put pressure on the Department of Social Security to introduce cuts in spending on housing benefit and mortgage interest relief in an effort to contain the department's Pounds 85bn budget. Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, plans a tough public spending round this autumn, DSS officials are being asked to consider plans under which the amount of money spent on support for low-income groups is further reduced. In recent weeks DSS officials have been keen to underline that they introduced a number of measures to reduce their overall budget last year, and that they hope to stay out of the Treasury spotlight in the forthcoming public expenditure survey. They have pointed out that the department introduced the abolition of statutory sick pay subsidy for large employers and a reform of invalidity benefit in this session of parliament. Next year the department will introduce a substantial amount of cost-cutting legislation in parliament, including a pensions bill and the replacement of unemployment benefit with a Jobseeker's Allowance. Several rightwing Tory MPs believe, however, that the chancellor will have to introduce new cuts in social security spending if he is to reduce the overall amount of public spending - mainly because the DSS continues to have by far the largest budget of any Whitehall department. Last year the department took steps to limit the amount of mortgage relief offered to people on Income Support, lowering the ceiling for mortgages on which such payments could be made from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 125,000. DSS officials are being asked to give 'active consideration' to the possibility of abolishing this benefit, a move that would save the exchequer Pounds 1.2bn a year. The department is also looking at ways to reduce the Pounds 8.8bn spent on housing benefit, which goes to 4.5m people living in rented or local authority accommodation. People on very low incomes can theoretically have all their rent paid for in housing benefit. Ministers are concerned that this pushes up the price of private rented accommodation and discourages recipients from looking for cheaper housing. A DSS official said yesterday that discussions were taking place on reductions in housing benefit and mortgage interest relief, but that it was too early to indicate the direction that policy was taking.</p>

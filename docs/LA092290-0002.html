			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER CENSORSHIP OF THE ARTS  </P> <P> "Who decides issues of censorship in the arts?" you ask (editorial, "Sister  Mary Ignatius Isn't Happy," Sept. 13). But is censorship the only issue here?  What of those who feel that their beliefs and values are being mocked and  demeaned in the guise of art? In your words, "Sister Mary Ignatius" will offend  some because of its harsh handling of Catholic beliefs.  </P> <P> Yet, when one thus offended takes action, you raise the charge of censorship in  order to divert discussion away from issues of virtue and sensibility. I doubt,  for example, that you would be so lenient if the play dealt with one of our  ethnic or racial minority groups in a similar manner. And rightly so.  </P> <P> Clearly, censorship is unpleasant, and Costa Mesa seems bent upon adopting  severe measures to address what it sees as an assault on shared values. That is  unfortunate. But when art exists as a means to hurt others, as more and more it  seems to do, such actions may not be so severe after all.  </P> <P> WILLIAM S. LaSOR JR.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that she did  not make a promise to President Clinton on Cyprus when she met  him in the White House some time ago. Stressing that she "is  more sensitive than anyone else" on the question of safeguarding  the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side, Ciller asserted: "We  will do nothing that will conflict with the interests of Turkey  and north Cyprus." On the Cyprus problem itself, Ciller said:  "Nothing has taken place to cause alarm."    Prime Minister Ciller replied to journalists' questions  during the reception Speaker of Parliament Husamettin Cindoruk  held in the Turkish Grand National Assembly yesterday for  Children's Day, which is celebrated on 23 April. Regarding a  question on President Clinton's statement on Cyprus, she said:  "Denktas has approved the package of confidence-building  measures [CBM's]. Is that not so? However, he approved the  first package. Certain changes were made in the second package.  What we have said is that they should reconsider the matter and  agree if they can do so. The Foreign Ministry is well informed  on the matter. Nothing else has been said outside that  framework. Therefore, there is nothing to cause alarm."    In a statement through the Prime Minister's Office Press  Center yesterday, Ciller said that the Cyprus problem was  "definitely" not discussed in the talks she had with President  Clinton in camera after the two delegations met in the White  House on 14 April. However, Ciller refrained from divulging  President Clinton's views. Nevertheless, she outlined her own  views, which were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry in a coded  message.    Ciller said that President Clinton recalled the deadlock in  the talks on the CBM's package. She explained that she  responded as follows: "The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus] agreed in principle to the original CBM's package.  Turkey supported the TRNC in that regard. Later, however, the  package was changed. An effort to reconcile the views of the  two sides and have the talks on the package resumed by the end  of April will be useful."    The press center's statement noted that the records of the  Clinton-Ciller meeting were conveyed to the Foreign Ministry on  the same day.</p>

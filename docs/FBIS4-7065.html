			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yi Ki-tong from Moscow] </F>   [Text] North Korean authorities have started full-scale  activities in Moscow to prevent North Korean loggers, who  escaped from logging camps in Siberia, to defect to the ROK. On  the afternoon of 18 April, North Korean authorities dispatched  two agents, who seemed to be secret service men, near the  Foreign Ministry resident's registration office for foreigners  in Moscow. It seems that they are preventing North Korean  escapees from approaching this area.    These North Korean agents, clad in civilian clothes, were  hanging around (Pocropka) Street, where the resident's  registration office for foreigners is located, in twos and  threes. They hastily disappeared when our reporter approached  them. It was confirmed that they were also sitting around the  North Korean Government-run restaurant--Pyongyang  Restaurant--located near the resident's registration office for  foreigners. It was learned that they took turns watching over  this whole area during office hours.    This was revealed when a certain Mr. Kim, a logger who  escaped from a logging camp, reported to the ROK Embassy in  Russia that the agents prevented him from approaching the  resident's registration office for foreigners so he could  officially apply for a resident permit with the Russian  authorities on 18 April.    It was learned that the Russian authorities are planning to  grant residency to the North Korean escapees who apply for a  resident permit through the resident's registration office for  foreigners. Once they have this permit, the North Korean  escapees will be able to enter the ROK after being issued a  traveler's certificate. An ROK Embassy official in Russia  revealed on 19 April: "If the North Korean authorities continue  to interfere with this matter, it will be in reality difficult  for the North Korean escapees to apply for a resident's permit."  He also revealed that another emergency measure should be taken  for the benefit of the North Korean escapees as soon as possible.</p>

Many  people think that the aggravation is attributable to U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor's excessively uncompromising attitude.    To tell the truth, Kantor does not have any experience at  all  in dealing with commercial problems. Since one year ago when he  assumed the present post, his capability has been considered  questionable in the United States as well as in Japan. And  people think that, to cover his inferior experience, he has  absurdly maintained the uncompromising attitude toward Japan.    In fact, Kantor's attitude was excessively uncompromising in  the process of the recent Japan-U.S. economic talks being broken  off. A sign of compromise was seen between the secretariats of  Japan and the United States with the Japan-U.S. summit close at  hand. A consensus was being formed to the effect that, taking  Japan's standpoint into consideration, the United States would  make a concession concerning the numerical targets and others  based on the agreement reached at the Japan-U.S. summit held in  July last year. It was literally a final stage as "the wording  of the agreement to be announced was being reviewed" (informed  sources). It was Kantor who spoiled the agreement with his  "voice of authority." Then, he tried to settle the issue by  presenting the numerical targets at a direct talk with Foreign  Minister Hata.    "At this point, the repulsion of the Japanese Government  officials reached its peak" (informed sources in Washington).  Presently, his understanding of the commercial problems lying  between Japan and the United States is beginning to be  questioned even in Washington. For example, in February this  year, at a dinner table with reporters, Kantor referred to the  fact that U.S.-made cars were not selling in Japan, and strongly  accused the exclusive nature of the Japanese market. However,  it is a well-known fact, even to American people who have some  knowledge of the situation, that the big three makers had been  neglecting their efforts to promote sales. Reportedly, Kantor  caused laughter among the reporters because of his total  ignorance of this fact.    While being such a person, he still maintains strong enough  power to speak within the government, and is even supposed to be  "the closest person to the president." At the back of this firm  Clinton-Kantor line, there lies the fact that President Clinton  himself maintains a revisionist idea toward Japan. In other  words, he thinks it natural to exert strong pressure on Japan,  and all the persons around him are making good impressions on  him by maintaining an uncompromising attitude against Japan. A  journalist in the United States points out:    "It is true that, in the past, there have been people among  the high-ranking government officials who appeared to have been  influenced by revisionists. However, right now, both Kantor and  Secretary of State Christopher are giving the impression that  they themselves are literally revisionists".    Kantor covers his ignorance about the commercial problems by  bashing Japan, and has now raised himself to the No. 2 post of  the U.S. Government as his attitude is completely in line with  the revisionist concept of President Clinton. No doubt, he is  going to be a person who would make future Japan-U.S. relations  more and more gloomy.</p>

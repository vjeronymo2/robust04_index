			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sales of Apple's MessagePad fall Apple Computer has sold only about 75,000 of its highly-publicised Newton MessagePad hand-held 'personal digital assistant' products since they were introduced last August. The group has been reluctant to reveal sales figures since it announced initial sales of 50,000 units last September. The new figure demonstrates that Newton sales have fallen off sharply over recent months. Apple insists it is not disappointed and that new product sales volumes typically decline after an initial rush of interest. However, analysts see the latest figure as confirmation that Newton is failing to live up to the company's expectations. The Newton has been dogged by reports that its handwriting recognition software is unreliable. Communications capabilities were also limited at the time of its launch, although these can now be improved with add-on products. Apple is expected to introduce new versions of Newton later this year. Several companies that have licensed Newton technology are also expected to launch products. Poor sales could raise doubts about the commercial value of Newton technology. However, initial sales are not always a good indicator of long-term performance - Apple's first Macintosh personal computer, launched 10 years ago, was not an overwhelming success, but Apple has since sold about 14m Macintosh PCs. Slow Newton sales are, however, making potential competitors more cautious. Compaq, which is developing a hand-held 'mobile-companion' that is expected to compete with Newton, has decided to delay its introduction.</p>

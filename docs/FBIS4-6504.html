			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Korean People's  Army [KPA] is never afraid of any formidable imperialist enemy,  confident that it will always emerge victorious as Supreme  Commander General Kim Chong-il is leading the revolutionary  Armed Forces with his outstanding intelligence and ever-  victorious commandership and the whole Army is filled with  loyalty to the party and the leader.    The People's Army does not waver at all although the  imperialists and reactionaries are trying their hardest to  stifle the DPRK and destroy the Korean-style socialist system.    NODONG SINMUN today says this in an article headlined "Our  People's Army is Invincible Revolutionary Armed Forces  Unfailingly Loyal to Comrade Supreme Commander".    The article goes on:    It is a great honour and pride of the Korean people that  they  have the invincible revolutionary Armed Forces the whole of  which is pervaded by intense loyalty to respected comrade  supreme commander and whose entire officers and men are fighting  vigorously, firmly rallied around comrade supreme commander.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said:    "It is a greatest honour and pride of our party to have the  People's Army that resolutely defends the party and the leader  and implements to the end the party's orders and instructions at  whatever cost".    The invincible might of the KPA lies in that the whole Army  has the unshakable faith and will to become a gun and bomb  decisively defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and  a revolutionary Army trait of implementing his orders and  instructions to the end even by going through thick and thin  without hesitation has been thoroughly established in the whole  Army.    All men of the KPA from generals to soldiers become a fort  and shield to defend respected comrade supreme commander.    The officers and men of the People's Army are now taking to  their hearts the motto of loyalty "We serve comrade supreme  commander!".    The KPA does not know the slightest deviation or vacillation  in upholding the leadership of Supreme Commander Comrade Kim  Chong-il with loyalty and is resolute and valiant like an angry  lion in defending the authority of its leader.    The pledge of faith made by Pak Yong-chol and his seven  brothers to become eight rifles and eight bombs decisively  defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and the  resolve of the seven brothers and sisters of Yi Chang-ung to be  genuine revolutionaries like Yi In-mo defending General Kim  Chong-il with rifles in the van eloquently show how warm and  resolute the faith of the officers and men of the KPA in  upholding the leader is.    The revolutionary Army moral of the KPA represents the  spirit  of soldiers to unconditionally carry out the orders and  instructions of Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il even by  dedicating their bodies as human bullets.    Proud looks of the KPA lie in the unity in one ideology and  will and the oneness of action whereby the entire Army moves as  one on orders from Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and  the well-regulated order of action in which it follows his  orders and instructions even if the sky sank to the ground and  the ground collapsed.    The KPA's revolutionary moral is being displayed to the full  not only in performing military duties but also in upholding the  grand plan of socialist construction and guidance of comrade  supreme commander.    The invincible might of the KPA also lies in the beautiful  tradition of Army-civilian unity highly displayed among the  entire officers and men who take a warm care of and love the  people and unhesitatingly lay down their lives for them.    All the officers and men of the KPA are devoting their all  to  crystallizing the idea of Army-civilian unity set forth by  Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and are becoming an  integrated whole with the people.    Holding in high esteem Supreme Commander General Kim  Chong-il  and upholding his leadership with loyalty is an inseparable  noble ideological and moral trait of the officers and men of the  People's Army, a revolutionary trait prevailing in the whole  Army.    As they have invincible ranks, the heroic Korean People's  Army capable of defeating any formidable enemy, the Korean  people are always confident and convinced that they can  accomplish the socialist cause of chuche.</p>

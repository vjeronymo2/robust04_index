Yesterday, the Ivorian authorities and an IMF delegation,  which arrived 10 days ago, "positively" completed a first series  of discussions on the letter of intention by which Cote d'Ivoire  has called on the IMF to benefit from its resources, he stated.    "This first and very important stage, which has been passed,  augurs well for the next ones," the IMF representative stated,  adding that the letter of intention would be conveyed to  Washington for "consideration and approval" by the fund  management.    The IMF delegation, composed of five members and led by  Christian Francois, senior adviser at the Africa Department, is  expected to continue "in the days ahead" the negotiations with  the Abidjan authorities on a "global document" taking stock of  the country's economic situation and prospects. This document  will be examined by the IMF management "in the weeks ahead," Mr.  Dessart continued.    Neither the commitments made by the Ivorian authorities nor  the amount of the resources requested were made public.</p>

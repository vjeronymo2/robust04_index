			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fung Wai-kong] </F>   [Text] Prominent territory businessmen and professionals  closely affiliated with Beijing announced their own political  party yesterday - the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. The new  party is expected to add weight to Hong Kong's pro-China camp  and complement the role of the Democratic Alliance for the  Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which has a stronger grass-roots  flavour.    The Progessive Alliance vowed to participate fully in  district board, municipal councils and Legislative Council  elections. Its founders stressed its political stance was  neutral.    Topping the list on the founding committee of 52 are  Beijing-  appointed Hong Kong affairs advisers, Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delegates, and prominent  businessmen who enjoy a good relationship with China. They  include Henry Cheng Kar-shun, managing director of New World  Development Company and a CPPCC delegate; Henry Wu King-cheong,  a Hong Kong affairs adviser and the vice chairman of the Hong  Kong Gold Exchange; Wong Seesum, managing director of Hong Tai  Travel; and Yu Kwok-chun, owner of the Yue Hwa Chinese Products  department store and a Hong Kong affairs adviser.    Other Beijing advisers among the organisers are: Ambrose Lau  Hon-chuen, chairman of the Central and Western District Board;  Carson Wen, a local delegate of the People's Congress of  Guangdong Province; and Jose Yu Sun-say and Sze Chi-ching, both  CPPCC delegates.    The list of organising members also includes delegates of  the  Chinese National People's Congress and two district affairs  advisers. However, party convenor Mr Lau rejected the pro-China  label for the party and said it would stand up for the interests  of Hong Kong. "It's better to judge from what we do to see  whether we are a pro-China or pro-Hong Kong group," he said.    He denied reports that the party had been groomed by  officials of Xinhua (the New China News Agency) but admitted  Xinhua had been told informally of the intention to form the  party.    Yesterday's announcement of the launch was attended by  mainland media including the Chinese Central Television, Xinhua,  and the semi-official China News Agency.    Mr Lau said that on controversial issues such as the Xi Yang  case, the new party would seek to convey the concerns of Hong  Kong people to China through private discussion. "We understand  why the Hong Kong people are so (concerned about) the case and  we will reflect this concern to the Chinese Government through  our contacts with them." he said.</p>

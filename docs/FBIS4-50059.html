			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video, from the "Xinjiang News" </F> program]    [Text]An autonomous regional work conference on state civil  service system and wage reform was held in Urumqi yesterday.  Speaking at the conference, Autonomous Regional Chairman  Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: We must fully recognize the  role and the importance of personnel system in economic  construction and do a good job in personnel affairs under the  new situation. The reform of personnel system must be guided by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and closely  centered around the main theme of economic construction. We  must establish a personnel system in compliance with the demands  of market economy. The implementation of the state civil  service system is aimed at establishing a socialist cadre  administration system with Chinese characteristics,  strengthening and invigorating government operations, improving  government personnel's quality and efficiency, and making the  government's personnel administration system scientific and  legal.    Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: While focusing on promoting the  civil service system, we must vigorously carry out personnel  system reform in institutions and enterprises.</p>

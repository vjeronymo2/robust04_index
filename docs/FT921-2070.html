			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Three cultures converge in concern for the citizen - The Issues, Consumer protection THE KEY phrase of the campaign might be 'we are all consumers now', as the parties compete to promise better-quality public services that are more responsive to their users. The Conservatives say their Citizen's Charter offers 'the most far-reaching programme ever devised to improve quality in public services'. Labour promises 'high-quality, value-for-money services' with three 'quality commissions' to keep schools, councils and the National Health Service on their toes. The Liberal Democrats would 'invest in a network of community services to improve quality, choice and opportunity'. This emphasis on quality in the public services is a new theme in general election campaigns. When the main elements of the welfare state - such as the NHS, secondary-education and slum-clearance programmes - were established by the 1945 Labour government, the drive was for quantity, not quality. 'People were grateful for mass-produced services devised to meet urgent and basic needs which everybody shared,' says Ms Anna Coote, research fellow at the Labour-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. 'But as people became better-educated, better-housed and better-off, they expected more diverse and flexible services to meet their individual needs.' Mrs Thatcher was a catalyst for bringing these expectations to the fore, says Mr John Beishon, chief executive of the Consumers' Association, publishers of Which? magazine. 'By her emphasis on competition and choice, she made people more aware of the power consumers could wield through their spending capacity,' he says. The Conservatives' problem is that opinion polls consistently show that voters think Labour is best able to provide high-quality public services. By launching his Citizen's Charter last July, Mr John Major hoped to demonstrate a Conservative concern for the public services - and a distinctively market-oriented approach to improving them. A fourth-term Tory government would introduce further privatisation to public services. There would be greater competition between providers, and more contracting-out to the private sector. Managers' pay would have a large performance-related element as an incentive to satisfy customers. Where market forces cannot be brought to bear, services would be required to publish charters setting out clearly defined standards of services. If services fall below standard, there would be simple means of redress, including well-signposted complaints procedures and, in some cases, compensation. In some respects, this programme is little different from those of the other parties. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, devoted considerable space in his 1988 political testament, Citizen's Britain, to the need for consumers of public services to have rights and entitlements. Labour reached a similar position in its policy review after the 1987 election, and can draw on the experience of Labour local authorities such as York City Council which have pioneered guaranteed standards. Labour's manifesto promises 'customer contracts' for services, with 'clear avenues for complaint'. This apparent convergence does not mean there is no difference between the parties, according to Ms Coote. 'While the parties are using the same language, they have very different agendas,' she says. Mr Major told a conference in January: 'Let us hear no more of the phoney argument that you can only make things better by spending more money. 'Politeness, keeping promises, giving the right information, answering letters promptly - these things don't cost money. They are the everyday currency of decent services and they must become universal.' Labour emphasises 'underfunding' as a cause of poor-quality public services, and rejects the Tories' belief in the role of competitive pressures in improving performance. Labour would halt privatisation and compulsory competitive tendering in local government and the NHS. For Mr Beishon of the Consumers' Association, neither approach is sufficient. He agrees there is scope for squeezing out inefficiency in some public services. He accepts that free competition is the best mechanism for consumers to exercise power but he believes some problems will require fresh money.</p>

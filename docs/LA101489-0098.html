			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA TAKES A HARD LOOK AT CAMPUS RACISM  </P> <P> In eloquent, often impassioned testimony, more than a dozen Loyola Marymount  University students and faculty members addressed a special committee on  minority relations this week, describing frustrations among minorities,  feelings of not being welcome and outrage over racial slurs, including a  classroom incident involving a visiting professor.  </P> <P> The problems, they said at the meeting Wednesday, extend from the classroom to  extracurricular activities to social life on campus.  </P> <P> "I'm here to tell you I'm tired of insensitivity to minority issues," sophomore  John Crocker said. "Not just to blacks -- to Asians, Latinos or anybody else.  We just want a fair shake for everyone."  </P> <P> About 150 students and faculty members crowded into the auditorium of St.  Robert's Hall for the open forum, sponsored by the Select Committee on  Minorities.  </P> <P> The 11-member committee of faculty, alumni and community leaders was appointed  by President James N. Loughran after five students walked into his office in  April and refused to leave until he discussed the issue of race at the private  university.  </P> <P> The administration pledged last year to investigate students' concerns, but  some students said the racial climate has yet to improve in the new school  year.  </P> <P> "The average student on campus doesn't realize how frustrating this is," said  Patricia Hudson, a freshman who said she has been stopped at least three times  since September by security guards and asked what she was doing on campus.  Hudson said she feels she was singled out because she is black.  </P> <P> Sophomore Martha Arevalo cited an incident on Sept. 29 involving a visiting  assistant professor of statistics who allegedly made ethnic and racial slurs in  the classroom, causing many students to walk out.  </P> <P> Arevalo, newly elected president of the Concerned Student Union -- the group  that took over the president's office in April -- said about half a dozen  students immediately complained to Seth Thompson, associate dean of liberal  arts.  </P> <P> The assistant professor -- who was employed as a temporary replacement -- was  later fired, said university spokeswoman Leah Chester-Davis.  </P> <P> "He was removed from the classroom and in fact dismissed from the university,"  Chester-Davis said. "As far as the university is concerned, they're considering  it a personal problem." Chester-Davis did not elaborate.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's forum, students pointed to other incidents, including racist  graffiti sprayed across the entrance sign to the university over the Labor Day  weekend, and said they believe that there are insufficient numbers of  minorities in the faculty and student body. The university said the  undergraduate student body is about 31% minority.  </P> <P> Loughran, however, said he believes he has kept his promises to improve  attitudes on campus.  </P> <P> "Everything I said I would do, I've done," Loughran said. "If anybody said I  reneged on anything, (it's) not true, absolutely not true.  </P> <P> "In general throughout last year, I was aware there were some difficulties and  we needed to address them," Loughran said. "I take this seriously. . . . We  have a commitment to students in general and to minority students in  particular, and we're always looking for ways to improve it."  </P></p>

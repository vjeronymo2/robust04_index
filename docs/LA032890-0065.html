			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: SOVIETS WOULD PAY FOR GUNFIRE IN LITHUANIA  </P> <P> What's the connection between Soviet soldiers in Lithuania and bankers in  Frankfurt, London, Tokyo and New York? Simply this: The bankers may be the most  effective restraint on the troops, because if the Soviet army takes to shooting  Lithuanians, the Soviet Union can kiss its credit rating and its economy  goodby.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has been borrowing heavily -- $6 billion last year and $6  billion in 1988 -- and it now owes $49 billion to Western banks. That's not  excessive for a big economy, and the amounts Moscow must pay annually in  principal and interest are still at affordable levels, says Keith Savard of the  Institute of International Finance -- a Washington-based credit research agency  for international banks.  </P> <P> But the fact that the Soviets have been borrowing to import consumer goods --  trying to put something in the shops to quell popular complaints -- is worrying  Western bankers. Consumer goods are not capital goods -- machines that produce  exports, enabling the Soviet Union to pay back the loans. The current Soviet  pattern reminds bankers uncomfortably of Latin America in the 1970s, when many  countries borrowed to subsidize the price of food for their people. Once the  meal was eaten there was nothing to pay back debt.  </P> <P> Adding to the bankers' concern is that the Soviets are beginning to be late  with interest payments. Explanations that administrative upsets of glasnost and  perestroika are to blame for late payment sound to creditors suspiciously like  "the check is in the mail."  </P> <P> Against that background, violence in Vilnius would chill Soviet chances for  further loans, just as the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 halted Soviet access  to Western capital markets. And that would spell the end of perestroika, the  program of economic and political change that is about to enter a critical  period.  </P> <P> This summer, according to word out of Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  and his economic lieutenants will launch a massive shift to a free market  economy. They will privatize state companies by selling shares to the Soviet  public, liberalize prices in an attempt to get supply and demand working and  move rapidly toward making the ruble convertible -- a necessary step if the  Soviet Union is to join the international economy.  </P> <P> But doing all that will need Western financing, since the ruble right now is a  virtually useless currency -- pegged officially at $1.61 but trading between a  special tourist rate of 16 cents and a black market rate of 6 cents.  </P> <P> Thus, the "Soviets can afford a crisis less today than they ever could," says  Alan Stoga, chief economist of Kissinger Associates, a New York consulting  firm.  </P> <P> The Soviet economy is in worse shape than studies over the years have pictured  it. A new book, "The Impoverished Superpower," edited by Charles Wolf Jr. of  RAND Corp. and Henry S. Rowen of Stanford Business School, reveals that the  Soviets have been devoting more than one-fourth of their economy to military  spending (compared to less than 6% for the United States). Furthermore, the  Soviet economy may be smaller than previously thought -- only a third or less  the size of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> The truth is, it's an economy that would be laughable if it weren't so tragic.  Soviet economists acknowledge that in agriculture, up to half of the total crop  is lost through waste -- from lack of storage to sloppy work. And so the  Soviets must pay scarce hard currency to buy U.S. grain -- although lately  they've been buying on credit where they used to buy for cash.  </P> <P> The signals all point the same way: The Soviets need money. So much so that  Thomas H. Naylor of Duke University, author of "The Gorbachev Strategy," says  that the Soviet leader's ultimate aim is to reap hard currency from the West in  exchange for granting Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia independence. "Gorbachev  asked Lithuania for $33 billion in compensation -- an opening bid for  bargaining," says Naylor. "But he knows Lithuania has no money; he's really  looking for some sort of payment from the West, whether delivered through banks  or governments."  </P> <P> Why should Gorbachev get any kind of compensation? Ostensibly for Soviet state  property in Lithuania and to relocate ethnic Russians. In Naylor's scenario,  Gorbachev doesn't oppose self-determination for Lithuanians and other ethnic  minorities. It is historical fact, after all, that such self-determination was  granted by Lenin himself. Gorbachev just wants to make a much needed buck out  of the situation.  </P> <P> And while most Soviet experts don't think, as Naylor does, that Gorbachev wants  to "sell" other Soviet republics such as Georgia and Armenia, they do see  possibilities in the Baltic states. "We should make clear we do not condone any  violence," says Wolf of RAND Corp., the Santa Monica research firm that often  works for the U.S. government. "But if a $10-billion investment would get  independence for Lithuania, that's not a bad price."  </P> <P> So for all the threats from Moscow and tanks in Vilnius, Lithuania comes down  to a simple equation: Either Gorbachev keeps a tight rein on his soldiers, or  he can watch the Soviet economy continue to die.  </P></p>

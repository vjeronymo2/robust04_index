			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>   [Text] A notion has been put forth that the Team Spirit  exercise, an annual ROK-U.S. military exercise, has been very  effective in checking a North Korean provocation. However, on  the other hand, it has brought about an adverse effect of  triggering North Korea to excessively adhere to its nuclear  development. In other words, this points out that the Team  Spirit exercise is not always advantageous for the long-term  security of the Korean peninsula.    Such a notion has been brought up not only by the Chinese  authorities but also by ROK and U.S. officials stationed in  Beijing. Even though the notion is a minority opinion, it points  out the need to map out a new view on security to countermeasure  the changing situation in Northeast Asia.    A U.S. official, who has closely watched the North Korean  situation, said: "Ever since the nuclear issue has come to the  fore, many discussions and analyses took place among U.S.  defense and intelligence authorities over the background behind  North Korea's adherence to the nuclear weapons and the actual  capability of the North Korean nuclear arms," and added that  "During the course of those discussions, some believed that the  Team Spirit exercise, a ROK-U.S. joint exercise simulating  actual warfare, is not always beneficial to the Korean  peninsula's security."    He then continued saying: "After seeing the United States, a  super power, staging a three dimensional exercise simulating  actual warfare staged annually with its main land forces and  materials, North Korea may have figured out that it must have  nuclear weapons even it means sacrifice," and pointed out "The  Kim Il-song group is afraid of the U.S. power since it  experienced a serious defeat from the United States in the  Korean war which it provoked."    A ROK official, who is well informed of the North Korean  situation, said: "After the ROK normalized ties with China, it  gave me a better chance to observe North Korea `more closely'  via China and, through my observations, I came to realize how  much North Korea is afraid of the Team Spirit exercise," and  added that "I think the newly established situation in Northeast  Asia propels us to think about a regional security group that  includes North Korea, or at least a type of security that does  not provoke the other party so as to prevent it from coming out  with a more fierce counteroffense."    The Chinese side has also expressed to the ROK through  various channels that "As regards to the nuclear issue, the  biggest stumbling block for China to persuade North Korea is a  joint military demonstration, such as Team Spirit exercise."</p>

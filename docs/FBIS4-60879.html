			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by A. Kondulukov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Today veterans of the Communist demonstrations  and battles at Ostankino and the White House are marking May  Day. Representatives of the Russian Communist Workers' Party and  the liberal patriotic party Rebirth, as well as the All-Union  Communist Bolshevik Party, Working Russia, the Komsomol, and  generally all shades of the communist spectrum have gathered by  the giant Lenin monument on Oktyabrskaya Square. [passage  omitted]    The untiring propagandist Viktor Anpilov called on those  assembled to prepare for a political strike and to join the  ranks of the Russian Communist Workers' Party, which is already  beginning to compile lists of people's presidential candidates.  Every opposition candidate will have to make three basic  promises: To abolish mayors, to legalize Soviet power, and to  return to the people what has been stolen from them -- land,  factories, and currency accounts.    [Begin Anpilov recording, addressing rally] We did not want  a  war in 1993. But we will fight on to eventual victory, and stop  the hated regime that is carrying out the forcible  capitalization of our country, comrades. [end recording]    Anpilov does not intend to adopt peaceful proposals. In his  words, the main condition for civic peace is the resignation of  Yeltsin and the capitalist government.    Yes, today the Communists are demanding a lot -- the  cancellation of the results of the December referendum, a change  of government, the elimination of the post of president, power  for the Soviets, and the restoration of the Soviet Union. In  order to achieve this, the Communists are determined to expand  their ranks, and that is their main task today. As one of the  Russian Communist Workers' Party leaders said, that means more  leaflets, more words, and more propaganda work in factory shops  and on the trolleybuses.</p>

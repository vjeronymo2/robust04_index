			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Nigeria's civilian leader ousted by military NIGERIA'S political crisis deepened last night as General Sani Abacha, the defence minister, deposed the country's civilian head of state. Chief Ernest Shonekan, leader of the interim administration appointed in August, was said by aides to have been forced to resign by senior army officers at a four-hour meeting in the capital, Abuja, yesterday. Gen Abacha, a key member of former military governments, has been the most powerful figure in the interim civilian-led administration since it was appointed by the former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida. The army remained in charge, however. Mr Shonekan, a lawyer and industrialist, said in a statement read by an announcer on state television he had resigned after consultations with military chiefs, including Gen Abacha. The statement said: 'They expressed serious concern about the general uneasiness in the country and apparent lack of stability over the past few months. 'They spoke about restiveness of the rank and file in the military.' Last night the British government condemned the move. A foreign office statement said: 'The foreign secretary (Mr Douglas Hurd) deplores the decision of the Nigerian military to reverse the democratic process in Nigeria and to dissolve all democratically elected institutions.' 'Military dictatorship cannot solve Nigeria's problems. This is a serious step backwards not merely for Nigeria but for Africa as a whole,' the statement added. Tension has been rising since last week's decision to increase domestic fuel prices six fold, which triggered demonstrations in Lagos and a general strike, which entered its third day yesterday. The development, which Mr Shonekan's supporters described as 'an effective coup' will be a major setback to hopes for the country's economic recovery, and raises fears of instability should Gen Abacha not have the full backing of the armed forces. But these fears were downplayed last night by sources close to the military establishment. Mr Shonekan, a respected businessman who was first appointed chairman of a civilian administration in December 1992, is a technocrat who made economic recovery his priority. Working closely with the private sector, he drew up a policy blueprint designed to win the backing of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and pave the way to rescheduling of the country Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.1bn) external debt. Removing the fuel subsidy, which made Nigerian petrol among the cheapest in the world, was a fundamental part of the programme. The country has been losing revenue with fuel intended for the domestic market being smuggled - often with the connivance of senior military officers - into neighbouring states, where fuel prices are several times higher. Successive efforts to raise the price met fierce resistance from Nigerian consumers, convinced that the additional revenue would go not into government services but disappear in the corruption endemic in Nigeria. The change of power means plans to hold a fresh election next February may also have to be suspended.</p>

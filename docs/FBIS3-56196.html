His Victory Was Finally  Ensured by Two Votes, But What Votes They Were!"]    [Text] In the latest round of voting held 13 January  Vladimir Shumeyko polled 98 votes and was thus finally elected  chairman of the Federation Council. Petr Romanov got 52 votes,  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov seven, and Eduard Rossel six.    Federation Council deputies were candid and forthright about  the reasons for Vladimir Shumeyko's surprise failure to win in  the second round of voting, in which he dropped four votes, when  they spoke about it the next day, 13 January. They recalled the  wire that North Ossetia leader Akhsarbek Galazov, absent from  the session, had sent in Shumeyko's support but which he  addressed not to the Federation Council but to President Yeltsin  and to the actual contender for this prestigious post. In the  opinion of Viktor Stepanov, chairman of the Karelia Supreme  Soviet, Shumeyko made a tactical mistake: "He should have  refused that vote, but he said nothing." Aman Tuleyev, former  chairman of the Kemerovo Oblast Soviet, was even more  forthright: "It was a shoddy affair. People in the president's  team do not balk at pressuring deputies whenever they get the  opportunity."    Meanwhile, the attempts to tilt the balance of voting in  favor of the president's protege continued on the morning of 13  January. According to confidential information, Eduard Rossel  received an offer from the prime minister's messengers of the  post of first deputy speaker if he persuaded his supporters to  vote for Vladimir Shumeyko. The offer was rejected. A little  earlier, at 0830, Viktor Chernomyrdin called the heads of  administration to see him and, probably in exchange for a pledge  of additional credits, investments, tax concessions, and so  forth, obtained their "understanding" and "surety" by clearly  indicating which of the candidates they should vote for.  Finally that morning, before the latest nominations began,  First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets went to the building on  Bolshaya Dmitrovskaya Ulitsa where he "consulted" with powerful  representatives of the industrial directors' lobby.    Such very close attention paid by the top men in the  government to the course of the campaign for the speakership of  the upper chamber was due not only to a desire to ensure that  their man got the job (although that was the prime reason) but  also to the sudden appearance on the political horizon of the  figure of Petr Romanov, general director of the "Yenisey"  Petrochemical Combine, who publicly confirmed his adherence to  Sterligov's Russian National Assembly.    Be that as it may, the president and head of the government  now have the man they wanted as chairman of the Federation  Council. And the senators dependent on the executive have gotten  the man that the president and the prime minister wanted.</p>

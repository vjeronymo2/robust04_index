			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LEADS U.S. SPURT IN ELECTED LATINOS  </P> <P> California leads the nation in the percentage increase of Latino elected  officials, the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials  reported.  </P> <P> This year, Latinos won 580 elective offices in California -- an increase of  20.8% over last year. A total of 3,783 Latinos hold elected offices nationwide.  </P> <P> Officials say that the increase -- primarily at the county, municipal and  school board level -- will translate into a rise in political influence over  the next decade for Latinos nationwide.  </P> <P> For the sixth year, women made substantial gains; Latinas now comprise 19.7% of  Latino officeholders.  </P> <P> But while the association's figures show increased political activity, Latinos  account for less than 1% of all elected officials.  </P></p>

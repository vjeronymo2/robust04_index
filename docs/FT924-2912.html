			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Observer: Prize example Even the best paid City slicker would not sniff at a Pounds 25,000 Christmas bonus. But Jackie Haq, a 36-year-old mother of five living on income support, is putting the better-heeled to shame. On being handed the Pounds 25,000 Jameson Urban Poverty Award yesterday, she announced she's giving the money away. Her home is on Newcastle upon Tyne's grim Scotswood estate where only 18 per cent of people are in work and over half the unemployed have been jobless for at least two years. She was picked for 'courage combined with charisma and vision' in combating problems of deprivation, despair and loan sharks. Her prize will be used to set up a trust fund to help Scotswood become a 'nice friendly place again'. As it is, she says, her decision to give away the cash is being treated with such incredulity that 'my fear is some people will try to break in because they won't believe it'. With all credit to her, however, it's a sobering thought that had she been better off, the incentive to keep the money would have been greater. Since she's on social security benefits, the winnings would cause problems.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Sport: Kick off kicks out summer At the end of last week I opened a newspaper for a lazy, crickety read about the possible recall of Mike Gatting for the Oval test. I found instead a frantic, footballian debate about the resignation of Billy Bonds from the manager's job at West Ham. I am not exaggerating when I say that this depressed me a good deal. Surely, I found myself thinking, August is summer and summer is cricket and, with all due respect, Billy Bonds is not somebody that I want inside my head for at least another month. Last weekend I had sat like a lotus-eater amid the desultory crowd at the Headingley test match, steeped in the syrup of sloth. A bare week later I find that the world has changed completely. It has become alert and brisk and energetic, as if already trying to stave off the chill of winter. Cricket, of course, is still with us. But its time has gone: really it is already dead, a mere flicker of white ghosts upon a mirage of green, trampled down into the memory by the great size 12 boots of football. It is impossible, somehow, to give cricket the slow attention it deserves when one is being harried and worried about whether or not Alan Shearer has hepatitis. I know that darkness has begun to encroach upon summer evenings and that the still air of July has been blown through with autumn. But do we have to succumb so early? Must we relinquish so suddenly those gorgeous images of sunlit grass to those of mud and grime? I feel this strongly because I have, to paraphrase T S Eliot, measured up my life in sporting events. At the merest mention of the boat race, for example, I sense a fresh spring wind upon my face; the sight of those hefty blazered boys tripping down to the river causes my year to flower. By the day of the FA Cup final I am primed for summer, which is heralded by Derby Day at Epsom and which seems to ripen, to burgeon with riches, as the sporting occasions accumulate within it: Ascot, Wimbledon, Henley, Goodwood, the Greyhound Derby, the test matches. An ineffable melancholy attends the end of each of these events. Unlike the football season, which seems to go on forever and then, having stopped at last, seems to start again almost immediately, the summer sporting occasions are essentially finite, fleeting things. Because of this, however bored I might be by them when they're actually happening, I can never bear to lose them. I find myself enjoying those twinkly resume films, in which tennis players hug line judges to the tune of 'Always look on the bright side of life.' I watch the final trophy presentations with pleading eyes, as if silently begging the protagonists not to leave me. After the World Cup Final I sat in front of the rolling list of credits, staring stupefied and almost tearful at the names of sound men and floor managers. Ten years ago I would not have behaved in this way. Then I was of an age to take delight in the reassuring recurrence of sporting events, without feeling the need to slow down the inexorable cycle that they rode. Now, however, I feel that, although the occasions are rolling around the same as ever, I am growing a year older as they do so. Because of this, a moment like Martina Navratilova's last exit from the Centre Court takes on great poignancy. When she first appeared at Wimbledon, I was a child; I have grown up in the years that she played there; now she has gone, and she has taken my past with her. Identifying thus strongly with the landmarks of the sporting year, it is hardly surprising that I feel a pang when the football season starts, as if a door has been closed upon the summer. With the World Cup barely over, this season seems especially premature. Get that manly cabal of commentators, who only last month were sweltering and pontificating their way across America, off my screen. Give me Tony Lewis and Richie Benaud and the sense that the year is eternally suspended at its still centre. The worst thing of all is that I know how easily I shall give way, despite having so far ignored every thing to do with football, even the signing of bete blond Jurgen Klinsmann. I know that, like those women who stuff their Christmas turkeys on the day they return from their summer holidays, I too shall soon start wishing my year away, setting my face against the fading sun and immersing myself in the twilight comfort of the Classified Football Results. The start of the football season implies an imminent relapse into a different, winter life. After the sun and glamour-drenched theatricals of summer, it feels like returning to Nescafe after a few brief weeks of Douwe Egberts. It also feels inevitable. Football is reliably disappointing and disappointingly reliable but, because of this, it has a substance, a proper place in everyday life. I believe in it far more strongly than in those precious summer events which, like many lovely things, live more in the memory than in the reality. Perhaps that is the true reason why I dread the start of the football season: not because it says that the year is coming to an end, but because it says that the year - by which I mean the real year, the tough cold repetitive ordinary year - is about to begin.</p>

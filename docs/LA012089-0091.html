			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  $60,000 AWARDED FOR CULTURAL CENTER  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Arts has awarded $60,000 to the Cultural  Foundation, a San Fernando Valley group that is trying to build a cultural  center in the Sepulveda Basin.  </P> <P> The grant will help pay for a design competition that will provide  architectural plans for the center by early summer, officials said.  </P> <P> The Cultural Foundation envisions an "Arts Park L.A." including a 2,500-seat  concert hall, an open-air performance glen, a natural history museum and a  cluster of workshops and classrooms.  </P> <P> Still unresolved is a legal challenge by environmentalists to use of the basin,  which is a flood-control area under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of  Engineers.  </P> <P> Another obstacle to the project is a potential $70-million price tag.  Foundation officials said they will begin a fund-raising campaign once the  architectural plans are completed.  </P></p>

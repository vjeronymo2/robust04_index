			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by Notis </F> Papadhopoulos; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Papadhopoulos] Let us now get  into the international issues. Do you believe that even if our  economy gets back on track, Greece will be able to play a  decisive role in the Balkans at a time when its "fronts" with  Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and  Albania are sensitive?    [Papandreou] You are right. We have problems at the present  time. Your question is very correct. Indeed, Greece is a lot  more advanced in the economic area than all other Balkan  countries--it is a member of the European Union, has a business  world with proven capabilities at the international level, and  its prospects are indeed bright. However, in the short term we  have problems that, to a certain degree, throw shadows on our  expectations and hopes. They include the climate of conflict  which has developed between Albania and Greece and of course the  problem with Skopje. It would have been very good if these did  not exist; we would have been absolutely free in our moves to  have us, the peoples of the Balkans, all proceed together in a  new direction of progress and economic cooperation.  Unfortunately, these two thorns indeed exist.    [Papadhopoulos] Can we take these issues one at a time in  order to see what we could do in each of the two cases?    [Papandreou] Regarding the issue of Albania, it is clear  that the provocations are intentional. The violations of the  human rights of the Greek minority of Albania are very obvious  and unacceptable. Our policy, even during the previous PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government, was one of "open  doors" toward Albania. We do not have anything to divide. We  ask and demand that the handling of the Greek minority be  consistent with human rights.    [Papadhopoulos] Do you feel that Berisha's regime is trying  to kick out the Greeks from their homeland in North Ipirus?    [Papandreou] Albania's policy does not seem to be totally  autonomous. However, I cannot say with certainty what forces  may be using Albania.    [Papadhopoulos] Do you mean that these forces may be from  outside the Balkans?    [Papandreou] Of course, clearly. What is obvious, is that  Albania's policy appears to be an effort to kick Albania's  Greeks out of their homes, either to Greece or elsewhere in  Albania so that there will no longer be any contact by the  Greeks of Albania with what we call North Ipirus.    [Papadhopoulos] Are there large settlements stretching from  northern Albania to the south?    [Papandreou] They are exactly settlements. As a result,  there is a policy of breaking their ties to a geographic area,  if you will, and destroying the identity of the Greeks of  Albania. This is unacceptable to us. Of course we are in a  position to take measures of our own, but we would prefer not  to. We would prefer to follow a policy in accordance with the  established world criteria of human rights and stop the attempt  at demographic and geographic adulteration of the Greeks. There  have been many representations; we have talked to Russia, and  the United States, and to Europe, and of course we are in a  position to respond both politically and diplomatically.    [Papadhopoulos] During your interview with Mega Channel  [television], you inferred that we are ready to make other moves  as well. Do you mean, for example, closing the border and  controlling the traffic flow? Do you mean to control who enters  and leaves? Do you intend to heighten control so that fewer  illegal immigrants come to Greece?    [Papandreou] This is also included. The only thing we did  not mention is military action. This is clear.    [Papadhopoulos] Let us go on to the issue of Skopje. A few  days ago, speaking to members of PASOK's Executive Bureau, you  expressed certain optimism over the Skopje issue.    [Papandreou] Of course there is the issue of Skopje, which  indeed is an obstacle in our acting as a significant factor in  the Balkans; and I hope--I believe everyone hopes--that this  wound will heal. Yes, I expressed optimism, but I do not want  to get into details because the dialogue with [UN Special Envoy  Cyrus] Vance and [U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Matthew]  Nimetz continues. I would say that there has been a U.S.  contribution to this dialogue, but I can not make predictions  and nor do I want to get into details. I should not. However  I have hopes, let us put it like that, that the problem will be  overcome in a short time.    [Papadhopoulos] Does this mean that you believe it can  happen even before [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's elections  in October? Before the end of this year?    [Papandreou] I do not rule it out. However, I do not want  to imply a climate of optimism, euphoria, that the problem has  been solved. There is a problem and it still remains; and of  course our positions are very well known; there is no need to  repeat them. At this point I should say that the issue of  Skopje had been buried when we took over. There were  international recognitions of it every day under the name FYROM  [as published in English] or "Republic of Macedonia." We simply  waited until the recognitions, the catalogue, ended. However,  we overturned this completely with our action and the  implementation of the embargo. I think it was a critical  decision. Of course, I knew the reaction it would cause. When  one fights for his national interests, it is strange to see that  the solidarity he believed he would find from his partners and  allies does not come automatically.    [Papadhopoulos] During the last couple of days we have seen  a new attempt by Turkey to trump up tension artificially with  Greece. They even claim that we train Kurds; and there are some  in the United States who take these things seriously.    [Papandreou] You know that what they say--that we train  Kurds--is very dangerous. When I visited Washington, I raised  this issue during our discussion at the negotiating table. I  raised the issue that Turkey continuously sends signals that  Kurds are being trained in Greece for terrorist actions against  Turkey. I want to say it now: Greece has a very clear position  on this. There are two sides to this coin: Human rights and  terrorism. We support the rights and the human rights of a  minority, of the Kurds. But we condemn and protest against  terrorism as a means of solving the problem they face. And in  any case, there is nothing in Greece that would even prompt the  suspicion that we have any such contact with the Kurds who live  as free citizens in Greece. I raised the issue myself. Because  it is one of Turkey's techniques to describe Greece as a country  that helps terrorists, gives cover to terrorists, to back us  into a corner with regard with our international public  relations. What is Turkey trying to justify by raising these  questions regarding our role? This is what we do not know yet.  Consequently, it is clear that we should be very careful, very  decisive, not only to deny but also protest this accusation by  Turkey, which is an intentional move in preparation for  something. What it is I do not know. [passage omitted]</p>

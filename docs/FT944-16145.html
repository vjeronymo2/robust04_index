			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft puts its defence for futures debacle When academics and businessmen lock horns, the clash can be deafening - even if the dispute is over the esoterica of futures and derivatives. Attention is virtually guaranteed when the subject is Metallgesellschaft, the one-time German stock market favourite which almost came to grief this year as a result of controversial oil dealings. To defend itself against charges that it mishandled the unwinding of its oil contracts and precipitated an even bigger loss than might otherwise have occurred, the industrial and trading company held a press conference on Wednesday night to put its case. It said losses on the complex oil contracts - in which derivatives (mostly futures) were used to hedge long-term fixed price contracts - could have jeopardised the future of the whole company. It claimed Mr Merton Miller, a Nobel prize-winning economics professor, and his co-writer, Mr Christopher Culp (a doctoral candidate at Chicago University), had not grasped how much of a crisis faced the company. Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of Metallgesellschaft Ltd in the UK and a member of the risk management team sent to sort out the US problems, said: 'We're happy with what we've done and will remain happy with what we've done.' The unwinding was done 'in a way that alleviated the existence-threatening condition that the massive position had created'. If the futures contracts entered into by the US oil trading subsidiary (MG Refining &amp; Marketing) had not been unwound, monthly losses on rolling them forward would have reached Dollars 50m last December. Contango losses (caused by futures prices being at a premium over spot prices) alone had risen to between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m a month in the last quarter. The company's oil futures position totalled 180m barrels, more than the 160m usually quoted, he added. This was equivalent to 85 days of Kuwait's oil output. Nor were the contango losses offset by any corresponding gains on MGR&amp;M's futures contracts with customers. There were further losses of 'hundreds of millions of dollars' through lower oil prices and consequent margin calls. In New York, Metallgesellschaft said it paid Dollars 900m in margin calls on oil hedges in 1993. The result of the debacle was that creditor banks led by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank mounted a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package to save the company. Quite how Metallgesellschaft fell into this mess is still unclear. Since it is the subject of pending legal action, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Hans-Werner Nolting, the director responsible for trading, said much of the detail had to stay confidential. They declined to state the size of the present oil trading position. The legal wrangle concerns a Dollars 1bn compensation claim by Mr Arthur Benson, former senior executive at MGR&amp;M, for damage to his reputation caused by his sacking after the oil losses. Hearings start today in a Baltimore court on whether this should go to arbitration or be decided in court. The nub of the argument by Mr Miller and Mr Culp is that the futures transactions would eventually have produced profits if they had been kept going until oil prices rose again. They say, in the draft of an unpublished article, that a bad situation was made worse by unwinding the contracts too quickly. Metallgesellschaft disputes this and says the authors have changed some of their opinions in a new article out shortly. 'Where Miller and Culp go wrong is in moving from theory to reality,' said Mr Hutchinson. 'The authors incorrectly assume that all of MGR&amp;M's long-term supply contracts obligated the customer to take and pay for at least rateable (in equal amounts) monthly deliveries.' In fact, a large number of the contracts did not oblige customers to take any oil products or make payments until almost 10 years ahead; such flexible contracts running for up to 10 years totalled 50m barrels. None of MGR&amp;M's competitors ran 10-year contracts, Mr Nolting said. So when the full story of how these came about emerges, it should be a fascinating and salutary saga of how a company supposedly experienced in commodities trading could come so unstuck. Until then, outsiders can only look on with bemusement and schadenfreude; investors are left to ponder the value of a company whose shares languished yesterday at DM163 against DM365 a year ago.</p>

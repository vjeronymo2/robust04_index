			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Two birds, one Japanese stone JAPAN'S LATEST bout of fiscal activism, a Y5,000bn (Pounds 30.7bn) package of public spending and tax credits, is expected to be announced in Tokyo today. It could not have been better timed. The combination of the recent batch of bleak indicators and Tuesday's news that gross domestic product contracted by 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, means that the economy may finally be about to slip into an American-style recession in which output falls in consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, US Treasury under-secretary Larry Summers, in Tokyo today to press the US case for import targets, will presumably have little option but to congratulate the Ministry of Finance for this prompt display of neo-Keynesian pump-priming. The doom and gloom pronouncements of Japanese financial and corporate commentators have often seemed overdone over the past two years. The aftermath of the collapse of the late 1980s financial house of cards has certainly created disturbances throughout the economy. But Japan, unlike Germany, has so far escaped an Anglo-Saxon-style recession. Equally, the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Agency have seemed dangerously complacent about the prospects for an imminent upturn. Earlier fiscal packages, grudgingly agreed, have been tardily implemented. And the Bank of Japan has eased monetary policy too slowly, despite evidence that much of the banking system remains burdened by bad debts. Now the evidence is moving in the pessimists' favour. Higher government spending in the second quarter did not outweigh the decline in private activity, particularly consumption and exports. Department store sales are still falling, credit creation is stagnant and the yen's recent appreciation is biting deep into profit margins. No wonder the Tankan survey of business confidence shows that manufacturers are now gloomier than they have been for 18 years. Domestically, the economy is clearly crying out for stimulus. The government's sound fiscal position means that there is little danger in responding, especially as the Ministry of Finance appears to have held out for more spending rather than an income tax cut. But fiscal activism will not, by itself, remove the main obstacle to recovery: the dreadful state of Japanese bank balance sheets. Only a large cut in short-term interest rates, or some other form of concessional refinancing of the banking system, can speed what looks set to be a slow and weak recovery. The fiscal package also serves a second, international function. With the trade surplus still rising, and the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington only a week away, the Ministry of Finance is under great pressure to drop its justified opposition to explicit targets for the current account surplus and import penetration. But if Japan wants to persuade the world that it is serious about reviving domestic demand for imports, it will need to persuade US and EC politicians to lift their eyes from the details of the short-term fiscal package. For it is the new government's deregulatory agenda that holds out most hope for a radical change in Japan's economic relations. The share of consumption in Japanese GDP is low, in part, because the Japanese like to save, but also because the vast panoply of controls, rules and taxes  - especially in the distribution and housing sectors - makes consumption so difficult. Japan's weak and divided coalition has yet to prove that it will be able to implement the kind of radical, liberalising agenda that Japan needs. But if it can, the effects on imports and the trade surplus would outweigh those of any plausible fiscal package.</p>

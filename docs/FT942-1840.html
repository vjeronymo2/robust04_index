			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lower expenses boost Eurotherm Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, reported a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of April, despite flat sales. Profits were Pounds 12.1m, against Pounds 9.2m on turnover little changed at Pounds 81.9m (Pounds 81m). However Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said the order book 'is a last beginning to move ahead'. The increase mainly reflected a reduction in administrative expenses to Pounds 28.6m, against Pounds 31.8m which included Pounds 500,000 of redundancy costs. The average number of employees fell by 5 per cent from 2,124 to 2,029. Earnings per share increased by 31 per cent to 8.9p (6.8p) and the interim dividend is raised by 14 per cent to 2p (1.75p). Despite this the shares closed 28p lower at 369p. The geographic revenue pattern was only moderately changed from last year. Sales in the US were flat at Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.7m), but there was some improvement in UK sales to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 17.2m). And the group said most parts of continental Europe, with the exception of Germany, showed signs of economic recovery. Adjusted for currency movements, shipments grew by 2.5 per cent. Mr Claes Hultman, chief executive, emphasised that order book growth had begun to accelerate helped by the steady introduction of new products. The new order rate was now running at about 5 per cent ahead of last year. Operating profits in the first half advanced to Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.3m) fuelled by the reduction in the wage bill. Pre-tax profits were also helped by a swing from net interest costs of Pounds 100,000 to net receipts of Pounds 200,000 as the group used its strong cash flow to reduce borrowings. The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 11.9m after repurchasing certain minority holdings in subsidiaries for Pounds 1.6m in cash. COMMENT Once again Eurotherm has proved it can keep profits moving ahead by improving efficiency and squeezing out more productivity. As a result most of its key ratios have been transformed over the past three years. Despite optimistic forecasts, the management has yet to prove it can engineer a long-awaited resumption of sales growth. That may now be in sight. If order book improvements are translated into higher sales, full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m look possible, producing earnings of about 19.2p. Although the shares took a tumble in a jumpy market yesterday, they still deserve their premium rating.</p>

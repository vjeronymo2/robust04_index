			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / US credit card lender to set up HQ for Europe in Chester A Pounds 43m European headquarters is to be established in Chester by MBNA America Bank, representing the largest US investment in the UK for three years and creating up to 800 jobs. The UK government is meeting 16 per cent of the bank's costs through a Pounds 7m grant of regional selective assistance, Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, announced yesterday. Such grants are available for projects that offer new jobs. MBNA, based in Newark, Delaware, is the second largest US lender on credit cards, after Citibank, with a loan portfolio of Dollars 10.6bn (Pounds 7.2bn). It specialises in the issue of credit cards bearing the Mastercard or Visa logo to groups with a common interest, such as teachers or opticians. The bank expects to employ 70 people by the end of this year and to create the 800 jobs within five years. Measured on the basis of long-term employment, this is the biggest US investment in the UK since 1990 when Conner Peripherals, a computer company, set up in Scotland with the aim of creating 1,500 jobs. Figures from the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau show that US companies accounted for 41 per cent of the 56,271 jobs linked to inward investment decisions announced in 1992-93. Between 1951 and 1991, when the pace of US investment abroad slackened, the UK absorbed more than 36 per cent of direct US investment in the European Community, according to the US Department of Commerce. The first priority of MBNA will be to issue credit cards on the UK market, but, the bank said, it would be seeking to expand sales in the EC. MBNA narrowed the choice of a site to Chester or Dublin. It started negotiations with Inward, the agency for investment in north- west England, the local authorities and the DTI last December.</p>

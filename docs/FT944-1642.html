			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Strategy Mr Michael Howell, of Baring Securities, has forecast that the current bear market will be in retreat by the middle of next year, but warns that equities worldwide could fall by an additional 10 to 15 per cent over the next few weeks. There could be two increases in US rates of 50 basis points a time early in the new year, but thereafter a slowdown in the growth of the US economy would underpin sentiment. He recommends taking an overweight position in southern and eastern Europe, the Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

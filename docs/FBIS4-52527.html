			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) announced Tuesday that it will send  inspectors "in the next few days" to North Korea to complete  monitoring activities begun in March.    Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea  delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor,  according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix  addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam.    The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of  experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable.    Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate  the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel  rods.    The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods  must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly  selected, and various measurements of the rods should be  conducted late this year, officials said.    The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear  impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a  condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to  an inspection agreement.    The IAEA inspection team, with entry visas to North Korea  already in hand, would conduct basic checks such as replacing  batteries and film in monitoring cameras as well as additional  inspections of facilities that were barred to the inspectors  during their last visit in March.    Blix wrote to Kim that the team would go to Pyongyang "in  the  next few days."    North Korea and the IAEA have been deadlocked over the  inspections, with Pyongyang refusing random collection and  measurement of the fuel rods as demanded by the agency.    Blix's latest proposal cautiously sidesteps this stumbling  block by recommending that North Korea delay the refueling for  now so that his agency can get on with other inspection  activities first.    Officials here predicted that North Korea will accept this  proposal since it meets the requirements for a third round of  much- wanted high-level dialogue with the United States.    This glimmer of hope comes just days before Blix is to go  before the UN Security Council with a report on the status of  the North Korean nuclear row.</p>

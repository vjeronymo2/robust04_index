			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / International Company News: Foreign exchange activity lifts Banca del Gottardo NET PROFIT of Banca del Gottardo, the Lugano-based Swiss bank in which Japan's Sumitomo Bank has a majority stake, rose 9.5 per cent to SFr46m (Dollars 33m) in 1991, thanks to strong activity in foreign exchange business, a satisfactory trend in interest margins and exceptional contributions from recent acquisitions. The directors proposed maintaining the 20 per cent dividend, equal to SFr20 per share or participation certificate. Cash-flow was up 34 per cent to SFr110m. The bank was thus able to carry on with its policy of depreciating new investments and covering exposure towards risk countries. Provisions and depreciation allowances were up 60 per cent to SFr64m. The bank said that difficulties in the Swiss property market had only a 'minor' impact. Total assets rose 8 per cent to SFr7.4bn. Despite a decline in the number of its subsidiaries, the bank estimates that its consolidated net profit will exceed 1990's SFr51m.</p>

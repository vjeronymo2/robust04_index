			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Arts: The gospel according to The Five Blind Boys - Summer festival time has arrived in earnest London Jazz Festival Free jazz audiences seem to have an air of resigned purpose to them. In the bar beforehand, bearded men holding pints greet one another grimly as though preparing psychologically for that parachute drop behind enemy lines or shooting of whitewater rapids which will inevitably claim a few of them. 'Seen Bill?' 'Nope. Saw him at Spontaneous Music Ensemble last month and haven't seen him since.' They are survivors and they know they are all in it together at least until they go the way of all flesh  -to Radio 2. The body count from Saturday's free jazz ordeal at the Bloomsbury Theatre will reveal the diehard ranks to be thinned but no less resolute. An entire afternoon of London's most free spirits was capped by the appearance of the testing reeds of American Anthony Braxton - mathematician, chess demon and musical experimentalist. Pursued by the staccato, attacking piano chords of Marilyn Crispell, Braxton darted from alto, soprano and sopranino saxes, clarinet, contrabass clarinet and flute, music charts from both musicians spilling to the floor around them. It is said that Braxton often uses formulae and mathematical calculation to compose a framework for his challenging improvisation. That does not mean to say there are any obvious points of reference and this work, delivered without introduction or explanation (if there is any) tumbled out in a great snow storm of notes, up and down tempo. Musically, however, the performance was as evocative as a book of logarithms. Abstract jazz, like all 'modern' art, is not easy and perhaps all the more rewarding for that when it does actually move the emotions. The trouble with Braxton and Crispell's manic exchanges this night was that it was not involving, had no heart and did not swing. Which is precisely what the gospel of The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, closing the London Jazz Festival on Sunday, is all about. Formed 50 years ago at the Talageda Institute for the Blind by Clarence Fountain, who sings a sanctified bass, and on the road ever since, the Blind Boys' honeyed a cappella harmonies are a soothing secular balm. Joined by a rhythm section, elderly lead tenor Jimmy Carter, who at the climax of the show was lowered into the hollering crowd by his minder, shares a similar bag to James Brown. 'We didn't come to England to find God,' intoned Fountain, who like the other greying Boys was wearing a sharp double breasted suit and shades, 'We brought him with us]' Their combination of belief, unashamed sentimentality and showmanship is irresistible and the congregation on Sunday succumbed entirely. The salutary advice of a country and western tinged 'I'm not that way anymore', which concerned gambling and drinking, left bottom lips trembling while the blues shouting of 'Brother Moses Smote the Water', had them dancing in the aisles. If Braxton needs reminding of what music ought to do he should order a copy of the Boys live album Deep River (Elektra 7559 614-40).</p>

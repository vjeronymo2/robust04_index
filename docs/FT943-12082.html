			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Arts: Sanctimonious attitudes - Television It seems unfair on that admirably-run country that the state of Denmark should be associated in an English idiom with rottenness. There are other states where the rot is palpable and the individual David squares up to the Goliath of the establishment in vain. A sling is not much good (to mix metaphors) if the faceless men keep moving the goalposts. Last week's viewing provided an uneasy thread of Kafkaesque bureaucracy closing ranks against the seeker after truth. In Channel 4's Frontline Queenie Fletcher, mother of the WPC murdered outside the Libyan embassy in 1984, tried to act on her simple belief that someone somewhere must know who shot her daughter. Disturbing puzzles emerged: the trade embargo ignored, official indifference, and a final meeting with Colonel Gaddafi that took on the unreality of a nightmare. Unexpectedly sent for by the Libyan leader, Queenie found herself on the platform at a rally, urged to make a speech to a cheering crowd. She returned to her suburban home shaken by the layers of obfuscation attending the tragedy, not least on the part of British officialdom. The guarded smoothness of hatchet-faced Douglas Hogg summed it up. It showed up Michael Moore's TV Nation as the televisual equivalent of junk food. The cutesy idea of making a gnomic faux-naif in a baseball cap ask penetratingly simple questions about such agonising problems as the Bosnian war soon grated. You might as well send Norman Wisdom to interview Saddam Hussein. Moore himself is an unnecessary American import; the British are quite capable of providing pseudo-profound whimsy (especially on radio where Ray Gosling's lugubrious drone or John Walters' witless bellow trigger a Pavlovian lunge to the off-switch). The best item, from Moore's glamorous female sidekick, concerned brokers who buy life insurance policies from those with Aids and cash in: a rich Dickensian gallery with nervous giggles and hairstyles that resembled one of the late Queen Mary's toques, they were a jolly lot. As one cheerfully prognosticated, 'the next growth area of the market is cancer'. One wonders how far the tiresomely droll Moore would have got with the Kennedy clan. Inside Story Special: Chappaquiddick (BBC 1) revealed that pressure was exerted on her paper to sack reporter Liz Trotta for asking awkward questions of the senator for Massachusetts. It was 'raw power reaching out . . . just naked,' said the splendidly unscathed Trotta in John Edgington's 25th anniversary reminder of the drowning of Mary Jo Kopechne. Teddy behaved as remarkably as the dog in the Sherlock Holmes story. The dog, you remember, did nothing. Only the convolutions of American politics-cum-morality could sustain the latest theory: that Kennedy was not even in the car when it plunged into the water but claimed to have been the driver to avoid a possibly worse scandal - a degree of judgment that makes one thankful he never became president. But what of the individual opposing not corruption or vested interests, but the law itself? BBC 1's Heart of the Matter, tucked away on Sunday night, poses meaty problems week after week and should not be taken for granted. Last week's survey of gentle lawbreakers - anti-road activists, the man who assaulted youths who were terrorising his mother  - and the rather less gentle animal rights campaigners was memorable for the appearance of yet another Hogg: Quintin, Lord Hailsham, who chillingly detected the seeds of civil war in the honourable tradition of civil disobedience, equating it with world-wide strife - Catholic/ Protestant, Islamic/Jewish, and what he disdainfully dismissed as 'hootsi and tootsi'. This sensitively compassionate approach would doubtless have no truck with political correctness. One expected an equally rebarbative attitude in Richard Littlejohn - Live and Uncut (ITV). In fact the scourge of liberalism is more complex than given credit for, as anyone who knows his flailing castigation of the present government's brazen veniality will testify. Littlejohn is in the English tradition of fundamentalist puritan small-town morality. He would have joined Cromwell's New Model Army in that Thatcherite manifestation before its time, the Great Rebellion, with its City money, mercantile class support and grim dogmatism. In Friday's discussion on PC, Littlejohn managed to unite a lefty MP with the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation against him, not to mention the exquisitely enunciating Brian Sewell. Nobody behaved like a stereotype. Black Labour MP Diane Abbot was bubbly, funny, articulate and un-rancorous. Lord Archer was - would you believe bubbly, funny, articulate and un-rancorous? No statutory Hogg being present, it fell to the director of the Howard League for Penal Reform to ooze sanctimoniousness. Which brings us naturally to Sir David Frost. 'Money doesn't grow on trees but it may be growing on your family tree,' he burbled at the beginning of Good Fortune] on 'Christmas Day in July' - or Sunday, in the slot associated with That's Life. Esther Rantzen may have irritated but she was never as embarrassing to watch as this clammy, dowdy fumble at populist TV, pitched at a level as low as ITV at its most cynical and then some. Outside broadcast units ambushed punters with unexpected inheritances. A woman in the audience was presented with a competition prize she was unaware of having won, having moved to the Outer Hebrides as if in presentiment. A book on the Royal Family at Pounds 17.99 presented by a Queen lookalike made one wonder if it was worth it. Another audience member, due to go on holiday, was told by Frost that a forgotten premium bond had come up and she had two million - the studio screeched and whooped as he desperately added 'Turkish lira' - the equivalent of Pounds 50. Elements of Surprise] Surprise] and This Is Your Life reduced even reconciliations between families long separated (why? one ignobly asked) to a Roman spectacle with screaming crowds. 'You haven't done nothing,' laughed Sir D reassuringly to (or at) a nervous courier inveigled into a crowded studio to receive marvellous news for himself and 'your glorious family'. 'Not bad, is it?' Frost kept asking anxiously as the programme foundered on ineptitude after ineptitude. 'I've been adopted by a load of ducks here]' chortled reporter Adrian from location. The camera moved back to reveal a totally duck-free stretch of water. Adrian was also shut up in mid-interview, as were several of the punters who were obviously meant to stay lachrymose, grateful and silent. 'Who do I thank for this?' asked Phyllis, rather grim-faced at meeting her son again after 20 years. Frost replied in a supremely cynical moment of truth: 'John Birt.' And so say all of us. The BBC was once known as the greatest broadcasting organisation in the world. There is certainly a whiff of rot around, but from much closer to home than the Skagerrak. Christopher Dunkley is on holiday.</p>

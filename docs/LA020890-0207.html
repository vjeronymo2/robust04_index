			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PACKARD REJECTS SITES FOR REGIONAL AIRPORT  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard, a member of the powerful House aviation subcommittee, vowed  Wednesday to fight three sites soon to be recommended by an Orange County  citizens' panel as potential locations for a new regional airport.  </P> <P> In an apparent preemptive move, Packard (R-Carlsbad) hosted a meeting of  several local congressmen in Washington, during which they agreed to draft  broad guidelines for the location of any future airport. Packard said there was  general agreement among the congressmen that a regional airport should be  located in less populated and less mountainous areas of Southern California.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County's George Air Force Base, which is due to close, was  discussed as a strong candidate for a future airport, Packard said. The  congressmen also discussed moving all air cargo and overnight mail service to  Norton Air Force Base, also in San Bernardino County and slated for closure, he  said.  </P> <P> Packard represents a district that straddles San Diego and Orange counties and  includes all three sites expected to be named in a final report from a  citizens' task force. The sites, already named in a draft report, are Potrero  Los Ninos, a plateau east of San Juan Capistrano; Cristianitos Canyon, east of  San Clemente; and South Camp Pendleton in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Although the congressmen would play no direct role in selecting the sites, they  could assist in getting federal funding for the airport as well as steering it  through the federal regulatory process.  </P> <P> Packard, for example, serves on the aviation subcommittee of the House Public  Works and Transportation Committee, which oversees the Federal Aviation  Commission.  </P> <P> "We think we could lay the ground work for a regional airport plan that the  local people could then run with," Packard said.  </P> <P> "We do not want to take over in any sense the local responsibility of selecting  sites for an airport, but we certainly don't want to be in a position of  saying, 'No, don't put it here and don't put it there,' and then not be in a  position to help find a solution," he said.  </P> <P> Packard, who has previously expressed displeasure with the potential airport  sites named in the citizens' task force draft report, said he would oppose  federal funding for them.  </P> <P> "The simply are untenable," Packard said. "They simply could not serve as the  kind of airport we need. . . . They are fraught with problems."

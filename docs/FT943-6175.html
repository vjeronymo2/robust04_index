			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not convincing evidence on market testing savings Sir, Sir Peter Levene protests too much. He writes (Letters, August 26) that detailed evidence to back up the claims for savings made from market testing Civil Service activities is publicly documented in the Citizen's Charter Second Report. I assume he is referring to the table entitled 'Annual savings and department-wide costs of market testing' in that document. Unfortunately for Sir Peter, there is no detailed breakdown of the basis of the claimed 'savings', just rows of figures which we are presumably expected to take at face value. Taxpayers and civil servants are entitled to more than this. A series of assertions presented in tabulated form is no more convincing than if presented in any other form. The table makes very impressive-looking claims for millions of pounds of savings, until (like most quack remedies) you look at the small print. The notes accompanying the table state: 'The savings figures measure estimated savings in future years', and 'therefore the calculation of any net savings figure should be treated with caution, and regarded as illustrative only'. This is not what most people would call a convincing piece of evidence. John Sheldon, general secretary, The National Union of Civil and Public Servants, 124/130 Southwark Street, London SE1 0TU</p>

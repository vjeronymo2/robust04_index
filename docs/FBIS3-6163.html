			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] French Ambassador to Thailand Jacques Rummelhardt  yesterday expressed the hope that the difficulties caused by the  French government decision of February 9 to ban imports of Thai  fisheries products would soon be resolved. Mr Rummelhardt said  after meeting Commerce Deputy Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap his  government's decision did not set any new conditions on seafood  imports.    "The decision was based on the restrictions to which both  seafood imports and exports are subject. We must first secure  guarantees on these restrictions and the condition to get a  guarantee from Thailand must be observed," he said. Thai  fishery imports to the French market were banned as of February  9 due to uncertainties over a competent inspection authority.    Mr Chaiyot said the confusion resulted from the fact that  Thailand has several agencies involved in the inspection  process. He said the foremost inspection authority for Thailand  was the Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative Ministry's  Fisheries Department.    The Deputy Minister expressed reservations concerning  Paris's  decision, citing the perception of a selective practice toward  Thailand because Bangkok had submitted the required documents  indicating the Fisheries Department was the foremost authority  concerned with export inspection. It appears Thai exports have  been singled out by French authorities, he said.    Foreign Trade Department Director General Oranut Osathanan  said the French had allowed seven countries to import fishery  products after the February 9 decision. They are the United  States, Morocco, El Salvador, Brazil, Colombia, Senegal and the  Ivory Coast. Ms Oranut said Thailand had submitted a memorandum  similar to the Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry letter with trade  information for the French ambassador on Wednesday for  forwarding to his government informing them of the Thai position.    The French ambassador assured Mr Chaiyot he would inform his  government as soon as possible of the problems facing Thailand  to salvage the relationship between the two countries. The Thai  Government will await the decision of the French before taking  any measures.    "Future action may take place in a very short period," said  Mr Chaiyot when asked for a deadline on future measures,  declining to elaborate.    Mr Rummelhardt acknowledged that French fishermen and the  fishing industry was experiencing economic hardship and had  pressed the government for help, yet he denied the request was a  factor in his government's decision to ban Thai imports.</p>

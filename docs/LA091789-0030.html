			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE JIM BAKKER SAGA  </P> <P> May I suggest that Garry Abrams was stretching it a little when he reported on  the Jim Bakker saga? He reported that the water slide at Bakker's amusement  park, Heritage USA, is still open. But come on now: The children carrying blue  inner tubes to the top of the slide looked "like penitents cimbing to a  shrine."  </P> <P> Gimme a break.  </P> <P> MICHELLE LENTZ, Northridge  </P></p>

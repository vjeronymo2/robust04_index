			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Delhi allows private TV on state network INDIA is for the first time to allow private broadcasters to use the state-owned television network. The government announced yesterday that it would allow private companies broadcasting time on a second channel beamed to main cities. The partial privatisation, to start next month, is a belated response to the competition being faced by Doordarshan, the state-owned television service, from CNN, the BBC, Star TV and other networks using satellite links. The second channel, focusing on audiences in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, will show independently made programmes and will be governed by a Broadcasting Council intended to be free of government control. Independent television producers have welcomed the government's decision. The council will be made up of nine people drawn from the media and performing arts, all of whom will have experience of electronic media. Producers hope that the quality of programmes on Indian television will improve substantially once private producers 'with proven track records' are issued licences by the Council for an initial five-hour time slot rising to nine hours. The Information Ministry, which has faced widespread criticism of its mediocre programmes and arbitrary censoring, hopes to increase its commercial revenue substantially from advertising on the new private channel and from the licence fees of cable operators.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has said that Cairo radio  quoted a so-called responsible source in Aden as saying that a  military vehicle affiliated with the forces of unity and  legitimacy carrying katyusha rockets apparently infiltrated the  ranks of the rebellious and illegitimate forces and fired  rockets on the Port of Aden. The radio said some shells fell on  residential districts in the al-Tawwadi area in Aden.    At a time when we stress our categorical denial of the  infiltration of any vehicle affiliated with our Armed Forces,  and the impossibility of such an infiltration from the military  point of view, we would like to say that this news report proves  with categorical evidence that residential districts in Aden are  being shelled from the military positions controlled by the  forces of rebellion and secession inside Aden. This is with the  aim of fastening the charge on the forces of unity and  legitimacy and showing pictures of the victims of this criminal  aggression, which is being carried out by the criminal  secessionist gang against innocent civilians in valiant Aden.  This is part of a failed attempt to draw world public sympathy.    The source stressed that the criminal, secessionist gang has  not hesitated to commit the ugliest crimes against the homeland  and the people. Through its repressive agencies and its  militiamen, that gang is now exercising all types of pressure  and torture against citizens in Aden. They take children,  women, and elderly out of their homes by force, compel them to  carry weapons, and push them into the combat lines and the  crematorium of death.</p>

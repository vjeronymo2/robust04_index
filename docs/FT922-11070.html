			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Socomex to challenge appointment of receivers SOCOMEX, A long-established London trade house in cocoa and coffee, is to challenge in the High Court the appointment of administrative receivers by Banque Bruxelles Lambert. The company, which is also seeking damages, said it would meanwhile co-operate with the administrators in order to protect its assets. Banque Bruxelles Lambert has confirmed that it appointed administrative receivers on April 16, but has given no reason. Last week the Securities and Futures Association said that it had prevented Socomex Futures, a subsidiary of Socomex, from taking any new client business for three months 'because we are aware that the parent had some financial difficulties'. The SFA added that Socomex Futures was complying with its rules and was financially solvent. No customers were at risk, it said. Socomex has been a major trader in robusta coffee, and to some extent cocoa, with the Ivory Coast. Robusta coffee prices last week touched the lowest levels for 17 years.</p>

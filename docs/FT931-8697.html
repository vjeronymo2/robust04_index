			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / 'Cracks' are identified in accounting standards rules INCONSISTENCIES are creeping into the Accounting Standards Board's new requirements and their implementation, an academic warned yesterday. Speaking at the launch of the latest annual survey of company accounts from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Len Skerratt of the University of Manchester said 'cracks' were appearing in the new regime. 'The Accounting Standards Board has done a really good job,' he said. 'But it's a bit like a game of Scrabble. The first words are easy to fit in. The real problem is getting the last ones to be compatible.' From a sample of 300 companies, the survey shows wide variations in those choosing to allocate items such as foreign currency differences, goodwill and revaluations between extraordinary items, exceptional items and reserve movements. Mr Skerratt highlighted an inconsistency in the way the ASB requires companies to pass goodwill through the profit and loss account, while passing the effect of revaluations through reserves. He said its decision to require companies to classify all convertible capital instruments as debt rather than shareholders' funds until they were converted was inconsistent with its statement of principles, which says the substance of a transaction should take precedence over its legal form. He also pointed to variations in the way companies and their auditors had interpreted the ASB's urgent issues task force ruling on the treatment of goodwill on disposal of acquisitions. The survey highlighted the growing use of 'pro-forma accounts', which do not need to be audited but are included in the accounts because of significant events after the balance sheet was approved. It also showed that just 4 per cent of the companies had qualified reports from their auditors, down from 6 per cent last year. The proportion of companies showing intangible assets, such as brands and patents, on their balance sheets jumped considerably from 59 per cent to 67 per cent. That comes in advance of an ASB discussion document on intangibles. Financial Reporting 1992-93. Accountancy Books, PO Box 620, Central Milton Keynes, MK9 2JX. Pounds 49</p>

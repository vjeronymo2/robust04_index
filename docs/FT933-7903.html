			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / OECD warns on German growth: Economists cast doubt on Bonn's forecasts for end to recession GERMAN economic recovery is likely to be slow and hesitant, with growth of 1.4 per cent in all-German gross domestic product next year, compared with a decline of 1.9 per cent in the current year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For the west German economy alone, the organisation expects a year-on-year real GDP decline of 2.5 per cent this year, followed by an increase of just 1.0 per cent in 1994. That is clearly more pessimistic than the latest forecast from the German Economics Ministry, which is looking for a 1.5 per cent growth of GDP next year, after a decline of the same amount in 1993. The caution of the OECD annual report, prepared in June and published today, is based on the probability of continuing sluggish consumer demand, with unemployment continuing to rise; an effective freeze on public sector spending, with a 3 per cent nominal ceiling on growth; and relatively weak export growth because of the hesitant world economic recovery and the strong D-Mark. The report was released in Bonn yesterday, after its conclusions had been leaked in German newspapers. It assumes a continued easing in interest rates, as the Bundesbank responds to slower inflation, continuing wage moderation, and 'growing economic slack'. Inflation is assumed to fall from almost 4.5 per cent in the first half of the current year, to below 3 per cent by the end of 1994. 'In the face of such an improving inflation outlook,' the OECD says, 'short-term interest rates are assumed to come down in the course of 1993 to around 5 per cent by end-year, and then fall by perhaps another percentage point in 1994, to 4 per cent by end year.' The Bundesbank discount rate currently stands at 6.75 per cent. Long-term interest rates are projected to fall only marginally, to around 6.25 per cent. The other key element in German recovery, export earnings, are projected to grow by only 2.5 per cent in 1993, and by some 5 per cent in 1994, with competitiveness deteriorating further in the current year, because of the strong D-Mark. Relative manufacturing unit costs in a common currency are seen as increasing by some 5 per cent this year, before levelling off to an increase of less than 1 per cent in 1994. On the basis of a comparison with previous recovery periods from recession, the OECD expects an upturn in investment to begin in the first quarter of next year. But it warns that such an upturn may be delayed, because the last investment boom was exceptionally strong. 'Capacity is likely to keep growing faster than projected demand, even with slow or no growth of investment,' it says. 'Thus potential growth is likely to exceed actual growth for the foreseeable future, precluding a turnaround in capacity utilisation.'</p>

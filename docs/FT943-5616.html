			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wide-ranging setback follows US price data - Market Report Discomforting economic developments in Europe and the US upset the London stock market yesterday afternoon, prompting a sharp fall cross the range of equities. A large sell programme was reported and the market closed in a negative mood ahead of publication today of the latest US unemployment and payroll statistics. The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 34.8 points off at 3,216.5. Although this was a shade above the day's low, traders believed that the 3,200 mark could be challenged today, especially if Wall Street, which was 15 Dow points off as London went home last night, reacts badly to today's US payroll data. Markets were upset by the announcement that the pricing index of the US National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) had risen sharply in August to its highest level for six years. This latest hint of inflationary pressures from the US unsettled European markets already troubled by the Bundesbank's decision to leave key rates unchanged after a sharp rise in German industrial production raised concern that the downward trend in European interest rates might now be over. Analysts are now nervous of a return of 'stagflation,' when prices continue to rise while the economic pace slows down. However, traders were not convinced that yesterday's shakeout in London represented significant selling pressure from the institutions. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, taking in a range of non-Footsie stocks, also fell, closing 22.3 down at 3,794.3. The big selling programme, not finally disclosed until the market close, appeared to involve a wide range of front line stocks. But non-Footsie business made up around 62 per cent of the day's total of 677.2m shares traded through the Seaq net and several second-line stocks featured in the lists of active market stocks. Wednesday's session recorded retail business worth Pounds 1.53bn, well up to the best averages of the past twelve months. Equity strategists said that confidence remains relatively high in the UK stock market, and that this week's downward drift represents little more than a pause in a market now thoroughly underpinned by economic recovery and by strongly improving corporate profits and dividends. They believe that these trends will enable UK equities to resist the growing concern that interest rates may be forced higher sooner rather than later; some believe that the UK authorities may elect for a pre-emptive strike on base rates, following the lead shown by the US Federal Reserve. For the near term, however, company results have provided a less positive guide. The interim statement from Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group, failed to please the market yesterday, as did the statement from Ladbroke, the leisure and casinos group. The market was hard hit by the weakness in Wall Street influenced stocks which followed the opening setback in the Dow. Once again, traders were happy to take profits in the big name stocks which led the market in the strong upturn seen towards the end of last week. With the latest bout of bid excitement, prompted by SmithKline's purchase of Sterling Health, receding somewhat, there were sharp falls in the drug leaders. Defence stocks, also alerted this week by the Dollars 10bn merger of Lockheed Group and Martin Marietta, had a quieter session yesterday. Oil stocks, also, began to slide away towards the close and BAT Industries finally provided almost a lone firm spot among the blue chip internationals. Losses among the consumer and retail issues were fairly modest, although Kingfisher again gave ground as investors pondered the implications of the rise in French bank rates for Darty, the group's French subsidiary.</p>

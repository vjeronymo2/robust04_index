			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 23 May (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today received Enrico  Agiliar, head of the civilian affairs section for UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] in Sector South, and proposed to him that  UNPROFOR should take over the handling of the resumption of  talks between Krajina and Croatia. Martic expressed  dissatisfaction over the way this has been handled by Gehrt  Ahrens and Kai Eide, deputy cochairmen of the conference on the  former Yugoslavia, and proposed that Yasushi Akashi, the UN  secretary-general's special envoy in Yugoslavia, take over as  the coordinator to bring about the resumption of talks.    According to a statement by the RSK president's office, the  two deputy cochairmen have acted as mediators in a tendentious  and one-sided [as received] way and and have, in fact, only been  passing on Croatian demands to the republic of Serb Krajina.  President Martic said that mediation by a neutral and objective  diplomat such as Yasushi Akashi would certainly produce certain  results and would speed up the negotiating process between Knin  and Zagreb.</p>

What Will It Bring to Ukraine?"]    [Excerpt] [Myasnikova] What has been achieved since  bilateral relations were established two years ago?    [Plyushko] China was one of the first countries to recognize  Ukrainian independence, so we are now celebrating this modest  anniversary. Although two years is a but a brief moment from  the historical viewpoint, this has been a time of strenuous work  in terms of bilateral relations. A great many things have been  accomplished. During nine months of 1993, since the time I  presented my credentials, 10 official Ukrainian delegations have  visited China. Of course, bilateral relations are not defined  by the number of delegations, but this still indicates their  intensity. Every visit dealt with specific issues. About 20  documents have been signed during those two years, which have  established a legal treaty basis for our bilateral relations in  various fields.    [Myasnikova] Anatoliy Dmytrovych, how would you  describe relations between Ukraine, which is moving toward  nonnuclear status, and China, a nuclear state?    [Plyushko] I have held numerous meetings and conversations  with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  other leading Chinese officials, during which we discussed  China's attitude toward the Ukrainian Supreme Council's  ratification of the START I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol. I  will briefly outline China's stance on these issues. As early  as 1964, when China started to acquire nuclear weapons, it  pledged that it would use them neither first nor against any  nonnuclear state or region. When we requested that the Chinese  side grant us security guarantees if Ukraine assumed nonnuclear  status, the PRC Government reaffirmed its position. At the same  time, the Chinese side expressed understanding for Ukraine's  standpoint on nuclear disarmament, for which we are very  grateful. We would welcome China's participation, along with  other nuclear states, in a multilateral treaty granting national  security guarantees for Ukraine.    [Myasnikova] Nevertheless, China continues to test  nuclear weapons...    [Plyushko] China points out that other nuclear states have  conducted more nuclear tests, which are essential for improving  nuclear weapons and maintaining them at a proper level.  Fundamentally, China wants such weapons to be completely  prohibited, which will eliminate the problem of nuclear tests.  This has been stated by Chinese officials.    [Myasnikova] What is Ukraine's attitude toward Taiwan?    [Plyushko] For China, this is a very delicate issue when it  comes to relations with any country. The position of the PRC is  clear, adamant, and consistent: There is only one China, and  Taiwan is an integral part of it. While building relations with  other countries, China consistently tries to get its partners to  recognize this standpoint. Ukraine also recognizes it. We  pledged not to establish any form of official relations with  Taiwan.    [Myasnikova] What about unofficial relations?    [Plyushko] Such relations are possible in the sphere of  economic cooperation. It is no secret that Taiwan has a robust  economic and financial potential, as well as huge foreign  currency reserves. Many countries are therefore interested in  developing trade with it. The Chinese Government understands  this and allows certain forms of cooperation, however only on a  nongovernmental level -- at the level of companies and  businesses.    [Myasnikova] Ukraine's independence has led to  profound economic problems. Even though our government needs  other countries' help, it has been refusing Chinese aid for more  than a year. Why is the Joint Intergovernment Commission for  Trade and Economic Cooperation not operating?    [Plyushko] It is always hard to establish a new state even  under the most ideal conditions, both foreign and domestic. Our  situation is even further complicated by inconsistency in  implementing the economic reform program. A certain role was  played by the breaking off of old economic ties, which  undermined our economy. There are also objective reasons -- the  lack of know-how in trading with other countries and offering  the world what we have. Today, at the current stage, we cannot  manage without foreign help. We need equal and mutually  beneficial cooperation with other countries. We have many  products we could offer to the world, and even developed  countries are interested in those products, not to mention  developing ones. In this regard, the prospects for our economic  cooperation with China are very, very great.    Positive changes have already taken place over the last  year.  Whereas trade between Ukraine and China totaled $220 million in  1992, this figure doubled in 1993. Although I do not have the  final figure for trade between our countries in 1993, according  to specialists, it should have reached $500 million. This is  encouraging, but taking into account the capabilities of our  countries, this is not a great deal.    During President Kravchuk's visit to China in October and  November 1992, a number of documents were signed, including some  on trade and economic relations, in particular an agreement  establishing the Joint Intergovernment Commission for Trade and  Economic Cooperation. This commission should become a  coordinating and controlling body that will elevate our trade  and economic relations to a new level.    The commission was difficult to establish, given that this  was a time of constant changes in the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers and the Ministry of External Economic Relations.  Finally, the members of the Ukrainian section of the  commission, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov,  were approved. Then a problem appeared on the Chinese side,  which had a different attitude toward the establishment of the  commission, considering it to be a working body that should be  headed by people not below the level of minister of external  economic relations. Negotiations on this issue are currently  continuing, and there is hope that the first meeting of the  commission will be held in January or February.    [Myasnikova] What will change when it begins to  operate?    [Plyushko] The commission is to concentrate on trade and  economic activities. Thus far, we do not have a mechanism for  resolving such issues at the state level. Cooperation with  China may become very beneficial for Ukraine. This basically  concerns the PRC's experience in conducting economic reforms,  which were introduced in 1978 and shook the whole world.  China's GDP grows on average at a stable rate of 8-9 percent  per year. In 1992 it increased 12.8 percent, and in 1993 -- 13  percent, according to preliminary assessments.    China's latest economic successes cannot but draw the  attention of the international community, and we can see today  that Western countries are modifying their trade and economic  policies, relations, and priorities. For its part, Ukraine  possesses a sound industrial potential. We have certain  world-standard technologies that China and other countries need.  Few countries have experience in such fields as overall oil and  gas pipeline planning, superhard materials, monocrystals, or  welding equipment. However, we do not know much about the  Chinese market, and we have conducted virtually no research  whatsoever on Chinese needs or import requirements. One of the  tasks of our embassy is to fill this gap. Moreover, we should  help businessmen find beneficial partners. For the time being,  it is hard to do this. Our numbers are limited (seven diplomats  including the ambassador), and the important area of trade and  economic relations is handled by only two officials who are  physically unable to cope with the volume of work. By  comparison, I can say that the trade mission attached to the  Russian Embassy in Beijing employs about 100 professionals who  help Russian enterprises establish cooperation with China.    [Myasnikova] Will Ukraine establish a trade mission?    [Plyushko] So far, it has been decided to open Ukrainian  trade missions only in certain countries, first of all, in  Europe. However, such a decision should also be adopted  regarding China. We already have a trade surplus in relations  with this country: In 1992, exports amounted to 60.5 percent,  and imports to 39.5 percent.    [Myasnikova] What is the situation with the  50-million-yuan interest-free commodity credit that has not been  used by Ukraine for a year?    [Plyushko] Indeed, it has been a year since President  Kravchuk signed the agreement for China to grant credit to  Ukraine. Of course, it is bewildering why we do not take what  they are offering. However, there are certain problems. China  offers us goods in which we are not particularly interested.  The point is to choose goods that Ukraine really needs. The  conditions are tough. This does not mean that they give us 50  million yuans and we can buy everything we want from other  countries. The conditions are that the commodities must be  bought in China. Realizing this obstacle, the Chinese side  proposed slightly changing the form of the credit. During the  September 1993 visit to Kiev by Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the  Chinese side proposed allocating this sum for the construction  or reconstruction of one or several Ukrainian enterprises,  evaluating the equipment requirements, and purchasing it in  China with the loan. This option is currently being evaluated.  [passage omitted]</p>

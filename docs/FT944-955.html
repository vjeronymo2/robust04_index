			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mexico leads Latam plunge as Dow climbs Wall Street The US market showed potential for a year-end rally yesterday as equity prices climbed above 3,800 on the Dow indicator for the first time since November 18, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 50 points during the day before falling back to close 34.65 up at 3,801.80. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.51 to 459.61, the American Stock Exchange composite increased by 2.63 to 427.93 and the Nasdaq composite gained 8.61 at 737.12. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 380.5m shares. With yesterday's gains, the Dow has now made up most of the ground lost by a sharp sell-off in late-November. On November 22 the Dow plunged 91 points amid investor fears that the Federal Reserve, which had raised interest rates on November 15, would boost rates again in December. Many on Wall Street had come to believe that there would be no traditional year-end uptick because of all the insecurity about interest rates. With chances of another rate increase this year low, investors yesterday were watching to see if the day's advance could turn into a full-blown rally. Cyclical stocks jumped with the market, the Morgan Stanley cyclical index adding 1.4 per cent. Mead rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 and Tenneco Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/8 . ADRs of Mexican companies dropped in the wake of Tuesday's devaluation of the peso, which caused a sharp fall in Mexico's bolsa. Bellwether stock Telefonos de Mexico lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 and Grupo Tribasa fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/8 . Elsewhere, Biogen forged ahead Dollars 6 5/8 or 18.6 per cent to Dollars 42 1/4 on rumours that the biotech company may be the subject of a takeover bid. Cigna tumbled Dollars 4 7/8 or 7.3 per cent to Dollars 61 7/8 after AM Best lowered the insurance company's credit rating. Aluminum Company of America put on Dollars 2 at Dollars 82 3/4 after the company said it expected a gain of about Dollars 295m for the fourth quarter of this year after a loss of nearly Dollars 87m for the last quarter of 1993. Intel, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 , continued to gain from its announcement that it would replace flawed Pentium chips on demand. The shares had been under pressure because of negative publicity surrounding the chip's flaw. Shares in computer makers that use the Pentium chip were mixed. Canada Toronto enjoyed a third day of solid gains, but the upward trend stirred fears that the market was reaching its short term high. The TSE 300 composite index added 21.49 at 4,175.62, while turnover was the fourth heaviest on record, reaching 97m shares valued at CDollars 921m. Rises led falls by 460 to 369. Mexico Mexican stocks went into freefall as investors were taken by surprise by the 255 basis-point rise in local interest rates to 16 per cent. However, the market ended well above the day's worst on bargain hunting with a decline of 3.1 per cent on the IPC index, having initially plunged 11.7 per cent. The IPC lost a net 70.50 at 2,203.67. Volume totalled a fairly heavy 119.4m shares. The rate move followed a 15 per cent devaluation of the peso on Tuesday, which had been triggered by the outflow of capital, particularly from US and European investors, as a result of violence in the southern state of Chiapas. Investors were now worried that the government might be forced to make a second devaluation, commented analysts in London. However, Mr Nigel Rendell, emerging markets strategist at James Capel, remained positive on the market, assuming there was no further devaluation. He argued that while the initial consequences of devaluation for some companies would be negative, over a longer time period the negatives should be outweighed by positives, namely export growth and, hopefully, lower interest rates; while companies with substantial dollar earnings should outperform. Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson, took a similar line, and suspected that the market was going through a storm which would gradually subside. He now saw company earnings growth between 30 to 40 per cent in 1995. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo plummeted 6.4 per cent in reaction to the news from Mexico. The Bovespa index closed 3,038 off at 44,952. Volume was RDollars 364m. A broker said the mood on Brazil's markets suffered further yesterday from rumours that two large and reputable brokerage houses could be close to collapse. Argentina In Buenos Aires the Merval index finished 29.65 or 5.7 per cent down at 486.70 on worries about the fallout from Tuesday's devaluation of the peso. Volumes increased amid the sell-off. Turnover on the open outcry market totalled a strong 41.3m pesos.</p>

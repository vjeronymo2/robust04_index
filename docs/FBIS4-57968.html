			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergio Ramirez Mercado, FSLN faction leader, </F> by unidentified reporter; place and date not given; from the  "Events" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Ramirez] I want Nicaraguans to know we are aware  that we still have work to do and that we have a political  position to pursue. I want to reiterate that I have listened to  fellow Sandinists and believe that their views are logical. The  party's common interest is above my own. We have always worked  for the common interest. The FSLN represents social rather than  political interests. The FSLN seeks to benefit the majority of  Nicaraguans; stability [words indistinct] is not enough. We  have always strived for social laws that help alleviate the  current poverty and misery facing Nicaragua. In light of these  goals, which are above my personal interests, I have  reconsidered my decision.    [Reporter] The decisions of the FSLN bloc will always be  subject to the Sandinist Assembly. I am referring specifically  to the constitutional reform regarding reelections.    [Ramirez] Constitutional reforms were discussed by the  Sandinist Assembly, which is the FSLN's highest consultative  body. The Assembly approved guidelines for negotiations, and  the Sandinist bloc has fully complied with these guidelines. We  have worked with the other factions on the draft constitutional  bill, thus abiding by the said guidelines. I believe this  matter will not be reviewed again by the new Sandinist Assembly.    [Reporter] Then, will the FSLN be subject to the Sandinist  Assembly?    [Ramirez] There is no reason for the FSLN not to be subject  to the Assembly since it is a political party. As William [name  as heard] said, the Sandinist Assembly is a part of the  political whole embodied by the FSLN.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Breaches of rules emerge as Lautro imposes fines Serious breaches of regulatory rules emerged yesterday with the announcement of fines imposed by Lautro, the life insurance watchdog, on two friendly societies - Homeowners and Ideal Benefit. Homeowners, which has about 250,000 members, was fined Pounds 125,000 and must pay the regulator's costs of Pounds 30,000 after admitting nine charges relating primarily to misleading advertisements over a period of more than two years. Ideal Benefit, which has only 23,000 members, was fined Pounds 25,000 and told to pay costs of Pounds 6,000 after admitting that for almost four years from April 1990 it had not had effective procedures in place to ensure it met regulatory standards. The charges against Homeowners were mainly about advertisements in newspapers and through direct mail for single premium investments - particularly growth bonds. Lautro, which has been superseded by the Personal Investment Authority, also criticised the society for 'frequent and inordinate delay in making any satisfactory response'. Mr Roger Hocking, Homeowners' commercial director, said that following Lautro's visits earlier this year and the subsequent inquiry, the society's compliance manager had left by mutual agreement. Homeowners has appointed an assistant compliance officer and is in the process of recruiting a senior compliance manager. Lautro did not find any sign that investors had suffered but the society is writing to all the 17,000 members affected and has set up a helpline for them. The charges against Ideal Benefit related to faults uncovered in the second round of routine inspection visits by the regulator, which was carried out in March this year. They include not taking up references for people appointed as sales agents, poor record-keeping, and not sending full information to people who complained.</p>

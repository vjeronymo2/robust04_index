			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rank quashes film sale rumours RANK ORGANISATION, the leisure and enter-tainments group, yesterday moved to quash speculation over the fate of its film interests. 'Recently these rumours have increased in numbers and decibels,' a statement from the board read. 'We believe . . . it is in the shareholders' interests to say clearly and unequivocally that our film and television interests are not for sale.' Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, reinforced the statement: 'The businesses are not for sale - end of story.' Rank knew of no creditable offers, he added. However, the consortium which has sparked the recent speculation issued a statement of its own which threw some doubt on Mr Gifford's exact meaning. Premier Media, which is being advised by Chemical Bank, said it was aware the businesses had not been put up for sale, but 'if a realistic offer is made, the board of Rank would have to consider the proposal seriously'. Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, has agreed to become a non-executive director of the new company if a sale is agreed. Analysts tended to agree with Premier's interpretation, in light of Rank's efforts to reduce its roughly Pounds 1bn debt through a series of asset disposals. 'I bet if you came along and said there's Pounds 450m . . . Michael Gifford would not say go away,' said one analyst. 'I just think he does not fancy the chances of this consortium getting the money together.' Rank announces its results tomorrow with analysts expecting profits of between Pounds 233m and Pounds 245m, against Pounds 254m last time. Smith New Court estimates that the film businesses will have contributed Pounds 29m, after some Pounds 12m losses in the video distribution operation.</p>

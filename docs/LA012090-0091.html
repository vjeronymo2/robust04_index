			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> REPORTER'S EARLY EXCLUSIVES TRIGGERED A MEDIA FRENZY  </P> <P> He was an aggressive, award-winning investigative reporter -- and, at times, an  ombudsman paid to criticize his own television station, publicly, on his own  television station. But Wayne Satz will always be best known in local  journalistic and law enforcement circles for breaking the McMartin Pre-School  molestation story.  </P> <P> Satz had been working on a general story about child sexual abuse for a couple  of months in late 1983 when he first heard about McMartin. He vigorously  pursued the story, then delayed his first broadcast three weeks, he says, when  then-Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian told him that premature disclosure of the  investigation could jeopardize the case.  </P> <P> Satz's first McMartin broadcast aired on KABC Channel 7 on Feb. 2, 1984 -- the  beginning of "sweeps" month, when local television stations traditionally  broadcast their most attention-getting programming in hopes of attracting the  high ratings on which local advertising rates are based.  </P> <P> Satz denies that the sweeps were a factor in the timing of his early stories,  and he is equally insistent that other, even harsher criticisms of his McMartin  coverage are also unjustified. But Satz was unquestionably the most important  and most controversial media figure in the early stages of the case and now,  six years later, with the verdicts finally in, his role is worth examining in  some detail.  </P> <P> Satz, who left KABC in mid-1987, is not just the reporter who broke the story;  he is also the only reporter to be sued by former McMartin defendants and he is  the reporter who, while covering the story, became romantically linked to the  social worker at Children's Institute International whose interviews with  McMartin children became the controversial early crux of the prosecution's  case.  </P> <P> More important, it was Satz's early coverage that triggered a feeding frenzy in  the media, both locally and nationally.  </P> <P> Los Angeles television reporters in particular were immediately under pressure  from their superiors to match -- or surpass -- the exclusive McMartin stories  Satz was broadcasting night after night.  </P> <P> "There was hysteria in the newsroom," says Ross Becker of KCBS. "I remember the  news director . . . sitting there watching . . . Satz and coming to me and  saying, 'Ross, we got killed again.'  </P> <P> "The story took on a life of its own," Becker says. "We didn't even think at  the time . . . about what we were doing. . . . It was 'We gotta get something  new on McMartin; look how big this thing is getting. . . .' "  </P> <P> Unlike many other local reporters interviewed for this story, Satz makes no  apologies for his coverage. Most of the others say they are embarrassed by,  even ashamed of, their lack of early skepticism and their initial eagerness to  believe even the most unlikely prosecution allegations in the case.  </P> <P> Not Satz. His coverage, he says, was "fair-minded," not "unquestioning or  uncritical at any point."  </P> <P> "There's almost nothing (in my coverage) I would change," he says.  </P> <P> But a review of that coverage over two years' time (reports dotted with words  like "grotesque," "nightmarish," "chilling," "horrific," "bizarre," "amazing,"  "depravity," and "mind-blowing") and interviews with others involved in the  case (participants and other journalists alike) leaves little doubt that Satz's  early stories were largely instrumental in establishing the hysterical tone in  both the media and the general public that is now loudly decried on all sides.  </P> <P> Even prosecutors and some parents and children in the case agree that Satz's  coverage was both sensationalized and, at least implicitly, pro-prosecution.  </P> <P> "Channel 7 coverage was outrageous. . . . Wayne was so pro-prosecution," says  Christine Johnston, a prosecutor who withdrew from the case when she developed  doubts about the guilt of the defendants.  </P> <P> Johnston says she was especially offended when Satz telephoned her at home on  the day The Times published a story quoting another, unnamed prosecutor as  expressing similar doubts. She says Satz wrongly accused her of having been the  prosecutor in question; as subsequent events made clear, it was actually Deputy  Dist. Atty. Glenn Stevens. The implication of Satz's alleged call, she says,  was that she had damaged the prosecution's case and he was angry about it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nasty Tone of Voice'  </P> <P> "The tone of voice he used . . . was a really nasty tone of voice," Johnston  says.  </P> <P> Satz will neither confirm nor deny having called Johnston at home, but he  insists that he never said anything to her that could be construed as his being  angry that she had damaged the prosecution's case.  </P> <P> Some McMartin parents say Satz did make clear to them, though, that he  genuinely believed their children and supported their cause.  </P> <P> One parent, Diane Carter, described Satz's coverage as "very inflammatory" at a  time when parents, having been accused by the defense of being hysterical, were  trying to "project an aura of being credible, reasonable." Other parents even  began giving information to another television reporter because they thought  Satz's overheated approach might ultimately undermine their cause.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Awards  </P> <P> In fairness, Satz must be credited with some very good work on McMartin; just  as he won a Peabody Award, broadcasting's equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize, for  his 1977 stories on police shootings of civilians, so his McMartin work earned  him two Golden Mikes, awards similar to Emmys for local TV news. Although he  broke the first story on charges that the McMartin children had been forced to  indulge in satanic rituals, for example, he ultimately paid far less attention  to the Satanism charges than did many others in the media.  </P> <P> Indeed, Satz was more responsible and evenhanded than most in his handling of  several aspects of the case -- consistently interviewing defense attorneys and  spokesmen; asking tough questions of the prosecutors and of the most outspoken  McMartin parent; saying that some allegations "could have been planted" in the  children's minds by "well-intentioned questions" from parents; acknowledging on  the air that, if a child witness fantasized about some charges, it was  legitimate to ask if he might have fantasized about others.  </P> <P> Early on, Satz was ahead of all the other media, day after day, on each new  development in the case. He also broadcast the first interview with Virginia  McMartin, the founder of the school, and the first interviews with McMartin  parents. He and his camera crew even managed to be on the scene to shoot  exclusive footage of the arrest of prime suspect Ray Buckey.  </P> <P> There was widespread speculation among those who competed with Satz on the  story that he and Dist. Atty. Philibosian had cut a secret deal -- that in  exchange for delaying his first story, Satz persuaded Philibosian to give him  primary or exclusive access to later developments in the case. Philibosian and  his top aides at the time deny that.  </P> <P> Satz says he can't even discuss the accusation without violating both the  confidentiality of his relationships with news sources and the integrity of the  news-gathering process. He also says any such discussion might be deemed in  court to constitute a waiver of the privilege that California law grants  reporters to "shield" their sources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Competitors' Views  </P> <P> Criticisms of Satz, on this and other aspects of his coverage, may well be just  the resentful grumblings of beaten competitors. But rival reporters --  including Becker of KCBS -- say they had never before chased a story on which  another reporter had every important source locked up so tightly. In fact,  Becker says, he still has "a sinking, ugly feeling in my stomach" that the D.A.  might never have filed charges in the McMartin case had it not been for Channel  7's stories and the public attention they generated.  </P> <P> Several McMartin parents, all of whom were angrily determined to have those  charges brought, agree with Becker.  </P> <P> Philibosian denies that, too, but prosecutor Stevens, who left the district  attorney's office under fire after telling reporters of his doubts about the  guilt of the defendants,says Philibosian was clearly pressured to act by Satz's  persistent, challenging questions.  </P> <P> Philibosian was facing a difficult reelection campaign against the better-known  Ira Reiner, then the Los Angeles city attorney, and a public opinion poll  conducted for Philibosian identified child abuse as a potential "cutting edge"  issue in the campaign.  </P> <P> Although Philibosian denies that there was any pressure from Satz, Satz did  break the story; and the story did say the district attorney had subpoenaed  witnesses to appear before the grand jury; and Philibosian did play an  unusually visible, public role in the early stages of the case. Satz continued  to beat every reporter in town on the story for months to come.  </P> <P> Maybe Satz was just a better reporter. Certainly, he had better sources, a big  head start and a team of reporters out in the field, questioning everyone they  could find.  </P> <P> A lawyer himself, Satz also had "far and away . . . a better grasp of McMartin  than any other journalist," Stevens says.  </P> <P> Others also say Satz's understanding of the legal system made his coverage of  what happened in the courtroom better than any other reporter's, but these same  people almost invariably found his coverage of the early stages of the case in  particular both sensationalized and pro-prosecution.  </P> <P> To be sure, Satz's behavior may have been no different from that of any other  hard-driving reporter who gets a big jump on the competition on what seems to  be a remarkable story. Nor can he ultimately be held responsible for what other  reporters did in their effort to keep pace with him.  </P> <P> Moreover, others at his station contributed to the general perception that KABC  was on a crusade. A news anchor several times made inflammatory comments on the  air while chatting with Satz, and KABC management ran two full-page newspaper  advertisements trumpeting its coverage, featuring photos of a battered teddy  bear and leaving little doubt that the station seemed to believe the charges  against the defendants.  </P> <P> But Satz, who is critical of the KABC ads and of the anchor's comments, said  more than enough on the air himself to prompt the criticism directed at him.  </P> <P> In his very first story, he reported that more than 60 children -- maybe many  more -- "some of them as young as 2 years of age," had been telling authorities  a "grotesque secret"; they said that they had been molested by their preschool  teachers, that they had been "made to appear in pornographic films" and that  they had been "forced to witness the mutilation and killing of animals" to  scare them into staying silent.  </P> <P> Satz's subsequent stories told of children's tales about druggings, airplane  rides, the brandishing of guns, satanic rituals, the "mutilation of corpses,"  the drinking of blood and the sacrifice of a live baby in a church.  </P> <P> Satz says he was merely reporting what his sources were telling him, and he  insists -- correctly -- that his stories included "more defendant/suspect  denials . . . than any other media working the story." He repeatedly said in  his stories that the defendants "vigorously" or "categorically" or  "steadfastly" denied all charges. Once he even told viewers the defendants  sounded "extremely convincing" in their denials, and on several occasions he  said, "They may be entirely innocent."  </P> <P> Unlike some other local television reporters, Satz did not broadcast interviews  with McMartin children, an act he considered "exceedingly exploitative."  Although other stations showed the children with their faces in shadow and  their voices disguised, Satz thinks they were still recognizable to people who  already knew them.  </P> <P> Dan Leighton, an independent reporter, worked with Satz on the McMartin story,  as he has worked over the years on investigative stories for "60 Minutes,"  "20/20" and public television; he says Satz "agonized over every single little  piece of information (he broadcast). He was overly conscious of getting every  little piece of information right and trying to be fair."  </P> <P> All this notwithstanding, the overwhelming implication of Satz's early, daily  drumbeat of charges and disclosures, his inflection and tone of voice on  certain words ("lit-tle children"), his frequent promises that the case would  get bigger and bigger and his juxtaposition of various elements in his stories  was that monstrous crimes had indeed taken place at McMartin.  </P> <P> Sometimes Satz's broadcast message was more than implicit:  </P> <P> He showed defendant Babette Spitler -- against whom all charges were later  dropped -- saying she loved children and "always enjoyed being around  children"; then Satz himself chimed in to say, "Yes, and if you believe the  grand jury, she didn't mind assaulting children sexually either."  </P> <P> He accused Virginia McMartin, founder of the McMartin school, of speaking  "disingenuously" on one occasion and asked her, on another, "So, you think  you're just being framed, huh?"  </P> <P> He said society should "move ever so slightly toward being ready to believe  that kids do not talk explicitly about sexual matters unless they really  occurred, which is what experts say" -- a statement that Satz himself now  concedes came "dangerously close to commentary."  </P> <P> He identified by name several suspects who were never charged and showed  videotape of a man he said had "reportedly been described by children as  molesting them and taking pornographic pictures of them." The man was never  formally accused of anything, but Satz says it was appropriate to identify the  man on the air because "a significant number of children" had alleged that he  had taken pornographic photos of them, because he was "named in court" as a  suspect in the case and because other media, including The Times, also  identified him.  </P> <P> And what of information Satz didn't broadcast?  </P> <P> When the prosecution charged in March, 1984, that the McMartin Pre-School was,  in effect, a front for a massive child pornography ring, the story was  blockbuster news in most media.  </P> <P> Did Satz and his team of reporters investigate that charge?  </P> <P> He says they did, thoroughly, and -- like the district attorney, the FBI, the  U.S. Customs Service and various local law enforcement agencies and task forces  -- they did not find a single one of the "millions" of photographs and films  that Deputy Dist. Atty. Eleanor Barrett had said were taken.  </P> <P> Did Satz report that on KABC?  </P> <P> "No. No. No," he says. "It's really a silly question."  </P> <P> The news media doesn't have the same powers as law enforcement authorities,  Satz says, so KABC's failure to find any pornography didn't really mean  anything.  </P> <P> But if he had found some McMartin pornography, he would have broadcast that  story, wouldn't he?  </P> <P> "You bet. You bet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Romantic Link  </P> <P> Such comments, on and off the air, help explain why many other journalists say,  in the words of Barbara Palermo, who covered portions of the case for the Daily  News in the San Fernando Valley: "I don't think there's any doubt that Wayne  Satz was an advocate for the prosecution. I don't care how many attributions he  hid behind or how many disclaimers he issued."  </P> <P> Satz's romantic link with Kee MacFarlane, the social worker at Children's  Institute International who conducted many of the original interviews with  McMartin children, contributed significantly to this perception.  </P> <P> Satz now refuses even to acknowledge that there was a romance, invoking his  concerns about source confidentiality, about the integrity of the  news-gathering process and about the risk of appearing to have waived his  reporter's privilege under the California shield law.  </P> <P> He does say, however, that he "never had any conflict of interest" on the  McMartin story, no relationship that unfairly influenced his coverage in any  way.  </P> <P> Tom Van Amburg, general manager of KABC at the time, declined to be interviewed  for this story, but he told the Daily News in the San Fernando Valley in 1985  that Satz had informed station management of his relationship with MacFarlane  and that management had concluded there had been no breach of journalistic  ethics.  </P> <P> But Satz's single most skeptical piece of reporting on the case -- a lengthy,  tough-minded analysis that left no one, not even MacFarlane, unscathed -- was  not broadcast until January, 1986, after his relationship with MacFarlane had  apparently ended. Moreover, MacFarlane -- clearly a key source for Satz on the  McMartin story -- testified in court that she and Satz had a  "boyfriend-girlfriend" relationship beginning about two months after his first  story was broadcast. Yet he continued to cover the story for almost two years  after that.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge William Pounders ultimately ruled that there was no  evidence the romance began before Satz's first story and that testimony on the  romance would not, therefore, be presented to the jury. But many journalists  would ask for a different assignment if they became involved with so important  a figure on a story they were covering, if only to avoid the appearance of a  conflict of interest.  </P> <P> "If you continue the relationship, you get off the story," says Furnell  Chatman, who has covered the McMartin case for KNBC. "You just can't have both.  They don't mix. . . . That's a big question of reportorial ethics."  </P> <P> KNBC's Jess Marlow, who was anchor at KCBS during the early stages of McMartin,  says he has long admired "much of what Wayne Satz has done" and he realizes how  wrenching it would be for a reporter to remove himself from a big story,  especially if he had special access to a key figure. But Marlow thinks Satz  should have done so anyway.  </P> <P> Doug Conner of the Times editorial library assisted with the research for this  story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> McMARTIN TRIAL: HOW COSTLY?  </P> <P> The cost of the McMartin molestation trail to county taxpayers dwarfed those of  all other high-publicity criminal trials in Los Angeles County history:  $13,091,585  </P> <P> Besides McMartin, only two prosecutions cost more than $1 million.  </P> <P> The Night Stalker case, which cost $1.8 million at last estimate.  </P> <P> The Hillside Strangler case, which cost $1,643,469.  </P> <P> Other high-profile cases:  </P> <P> Bob's Big Boy murder case: $812,145  </P> <P> The Manson Family case: $768,838  </P> <P> The Sirhan Sirhan case: $592,806  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE THE DOLLARS WENT  </P> <P> Here is the breakdown of the costs of the McMartin molestation trial. Figures  are the latest available. From July, 1983, through October, 1989, the McMartin  case cost the county $13,091,585. Estimates of the cost of the trial have run  as high as $15,000,000. Additional costs will be tabulated in coming months for  the remainder of the case.  </P> <P> Court-appointed defense attorneys and related costs: $6,228,914  </P> <P> District Attorney: $3,748,013  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Court (for the preliminary hearing, including judge and  courtroom): $594,321  </P> <P> County Marshal's office (for Municipal Court bailiffs and other security):  $121,837  </P> <P> Public Defender's office: $174,188  </P> <P> Sheriff's office (including investigative costs and Superior Court bailiffs):  $1,827,141  </P> <P> Superior Court: $397,171  </P> <P> SOURCE: Tyler McCauley, chief of the audit division of the County Dept. of  Auditor-Controller.  </P></p>

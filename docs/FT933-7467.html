			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / TUC split over electricians' return THE UNITY of next month's Trades Union Congress is under threat from the continuing conflict over the return of the maverick electricians to the TUC six years after they were expelled. Intensive negotiations are going on behind the scenes, involving Mr John Monks, the new TUC general secretary, to resolve the outstanding differences over the electricians, whose breakaway EETPU union merged with the AEU engineering union to form the AEEU last year. Other unions have complained that they lost members to the electricians through alleged poaching. The situation will be discussed at Monday's meeting of the TUC finance and general purposes committee. The TUC general council will have to decide what to do when it meets on Wednesday. During their years outside the TUC - when they were not bound by the rules governing inter-union relations - the electricians launched an aggressive recruitment drive among members of TUC-affiliated unions. In the past 12 months the TUC has been trying to smooth the return of the electricians. Three unions remain dissatisfied - Ucatt, the construction union; the TGWU general union and the Prison Officers' Association. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt general secretary, has complained to the TUC that poaching is continuing, and he insists that the union must disband its construction and building trades section. Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, has told the TUC that his union is not seeking to undermine Ucatt but remains unwilling to disband its construction section. Eleven other unions which are involved in disputes with the electricians appear to have reached an accommodation. One union official said: 'Union leaders could face two unpalatable options. They could produce an interim report pointing out further conciliation is necessary, which would mean the electricians' section could not return to the TUC until next autumn. 'Alternatively they could call for the suspension of the whole of the AEEU from the TUC until the differences have been settled.' Neither option is likely to be acceptable to the TUC, which wants to use the congress as a new start under a new general secretary looking forward to the next century. A public spat over the electricians is a return to a bitter past that many union leaders would prefer to avoid. The Scottish TUC is to hold a protest rally in Dundee, Tayside, today over the bitter dispute at the city's Timex plant which is to close. A further 100 workers were paid off yesterday at the plant leaving just 100 employees, although Timex said the closure was still 'several weeks away'. When the closure was announced in mid-June the plant employed 375 people, of whom 280 had been hired to replace sacked workers.</p>

			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / De Benedetti says Olivetti paid bribes to win contracts MR CARLO De Benedetti, the head of Olivetti, the Italian electronics group, last night voluntarily presented himself to Milan magistrates and is understood to have provided a detailed account of how the group had been obliged to pay bribes to politicians in Italy over the past decade. The disclosure came after a new chief, Professor Romano Prodi, was named at the weekend for IRI, the big state holding company, which has been caught in the country's widening political and business scandals. He replaces Mr Franco Nobili, who was arrested on Wednesday on charges of corruption. The quick replacement of Mr Nobili bore the stamp of decisiveness of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, who last month was called in under crisis conditions to head the government. Over the past week there has been increasing speculation that Olivetti would be obliged to make a deal with Milan magistrates investigating instances of business paying kickbacks to politicians - as Fiat had done last month. However, Olivetti constantly denied any such deal was in the making. Mr De Benedetti is understood to have said that his group had paid some L10bn (Pounds 4m) to a politician 'collecting' on behalf of the ruling parties. This was in connection with contracts with the ministry of posts and telecommunications. Olivetti is one of the most prestigious names in Italian business and Mr De Benedetti's move - preceded by that of Fiat's chief executive Mr Cesari Romiti - underlines the extent to which Italian companies are now being caught up in the corruption scandal. Milan magistrates had begun to focus on Olivetti in recent days following the arrest of Mr Giuseppe Parrella, former chief executive of the state telephone service company Asft. This has led to a major new line of inquiry into kickbacks paid to obtain telecommunications contracts believed to be in the order of L40bn in total. Last week the chief executives of the Italian telecommunications subsidiaries of Ericsson and GEC were arrested in connection with this investigation and other foreign companies are expected to become involved this week.

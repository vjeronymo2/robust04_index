			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UN calls for earlier ban on CFCs THE UN's top environment official said yesterday that damage to the ozone layer was worse than previously thought and proposed advancing a ban on ozone-eating chemicals by four years to the start of 1996, Reuter reports from Geneva. 'The full consequences of our past folly will be painful,' said Dr Mostafa Tolba, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), at the start of 10 days of UN negotiations to tighten the 1987 Montreal Protocol on the ozone layer. Most industrialised regions are so alarmed by new reports demonstrating the rapid destruction of the protective ozone layer that they will almost certainly approve a target of 1996 for banning the chemicals, which include chlorofluorocarbons.</p>

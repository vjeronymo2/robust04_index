			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOFTBALL SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> El Toro 1, Don Lugo 0 -- Jamie Smith drove in the game's only run in the bottom  of the eighth inning, giving El Toro the Southern Section 3-A softball  championship.  </P> <P> With two outs, Smith beat the throw from Chino Don Lugo shortstop Michelle  Macias, allowing Corrie Yauney to score a run that was set up by several  umpiring calls questioned by Don Lugo Coach Ray Sheffield.  </P> <P> Sheffield argued that Kymm Maniscalco, who began the decisive eighth inning  with an infield single, was out at first base by a full step. Yauney then  forced Maniscalco at second base. Sheffield again argued when Karie Yoshioka  was called safe on an infield single on which Yauney went to third during the  argument.  </P> <P> Paige Lauby was the winning pitcher, giving up four hits, striking out 12 and  walking one. Agoura 4, Paraclete 0 -- Michelle Ray and Kim Bunch singled and  scored in a three-run third inning that powered the Chargers (23-5) to the  Southern Section Division 1-A championship.  </P></p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: The Cleveland Orchestra - Promenade concerts The Cleveland Orchestra must have been a bit surprised when the Prommers on Saturday night gave it politely moderate applause for Dvorak's New World Symphony and saved their thunder for Harrison Birtwistle's Earth Dances. Forty minutes of continuous attention calls either for protest or release, so release it was. Originally commissioned for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the music expressed - at least in this performance - not so much the corybantic celebrations relentless march of some lumbering behemoth with a gaggle of percussion (six players) persistently snapping at its heels and eventually bringing it, after much minatory stuttering, to a halt. Only a few people fled before Birtwistle's heavy hand had a chance to tighten its grip. The Cleveland Orchestra established its international reputation under the formidable George Szell, its music director for 24 years until his death in 1970. Szell was renowned for his austere discipline in the Austro-German classics, and the orchestra's current conductor, Christoph von Dohnanyi, is a respectful heir to that tradition, less remarkable for the warmth of his interpretations than for their clean efficiency. There was not much to make you sit up suddenly in the way he conducted the New World Symphony, though in the first movement he got the strings to bend the rhythmic shape of the 'Swing Low' theme in exactly the same way each time it occurred, which seemed merely a token gesture of artistic licence. In the Scherzo and Finale, counter melodies on the trumpet usurped the limelight - a sign that the conductor's ear may have tired of the main business, for in music as hackneyed as this, it is tempting to look for the inessential. However many times the orchestra may have already played Dvorak on its current tour, this certainly did not sound like the freshest performance, nor the most deeply felt. The only bit of genuine American music in the Cleveland's two weekend concerts was Charles Ives's eerily descriptive Central Park in the Dark, which came before the Dvorak - not the best concert opener for an audience still coughing tea or supper out of its system. Sunday evening's programme began with Webern's arrangement of the six-part Ricercar from Bach's Musical Offering - less of an orchestration than an analysis by instrumentation. Bach was then recalled in the playful Cubist mannerisms of Stravinsky's violin concerto, performed by the young German violinist Christian Tetzlaff with a fine blend of crisp wit and immaculate silky tones. But we were in another world altogether with Mahler's First Symphony after the interval. The Cleveland players gave it their well-honed best; yet still, to a work which is so personal and richly evocative, from the magically retrospective opening in which Mahler harks back to the sound of the countryside in which he was born, through the grotesque, fearful surrealism of the slow movement, to the flailing, tragic heroics of its finale, Dohnanyi's approach was more than a touch clinical. There was certainly no mud on his boots in Mahler's uncouth, rustic Scherzo, even if the eloquent expressiveness of Dohnanyi's gestures in the central Trio section did not seem to translate into orchestral effect. Which suggests, perhaps, that well trained as the Cleveland is, it is neither to be shaken nor stirred.</p>

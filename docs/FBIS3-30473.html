			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tirana, February 1 (ATA) -- Well-informed sources  in Tetove report that Mithat Emini, former secretary of the  Democratic Prosperity Party of Macedonia [PDP], was arrested on  January 28. The same sources relate this act of police with the  arrest some time ago of nine Albanians, one of whom was in the  post of the deputy defence minister. Despite statement by its  number one, Lubomir Ferckovski, that the question is closed now,  Macedonian police continued with other arrests. Detention of  the former senior official of the main party of the Albanians in  Macedonia is a warning that other arrests will be made. Another  proof to this is also the fact that the date of the trial for  the above group of Albanians arrested by the end of 1993 is not  yet fixed.</p>

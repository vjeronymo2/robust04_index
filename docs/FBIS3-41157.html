			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] People sentenced for drug trafficking will be able  to get the penitentiary benefits of semi-freedom and early  release as well as the redemption of their penalty through work  and education "as long as it is the first sentence of a loss of  freedom."    This was established in a draft law submitted by the  executive branch to Congress for urgent discussion. The bill is  already in the Justice Committee, whose members must meet in the  next few days to decide on the proposal.    According to the bill, in the case of redemption of penalty  through work and education, it will be at the rate of one day of  penalty for two of effective work for those found in possession  of up to 200 grams of cocaine or its byproducts. For those  arrested in possession of larger quantities, it will be one day  of penalty for five days of education or effective work.    The bill also considers the possibility that a process ends  ahead of time at the initiative of the Attorney General's Office  or the individual being processed. If the initiative comes from  the one being processed, he will get the benefit of a one-sixth  reduction of penalty. The benefit is an addition and will be  added to the benefit received by confession.    The bill adds a clause to the Civil Code establishing that a  "small quantity of drug" will be considered up to 200 grams of  cocaine and its byproducts, 100 grams of cocaine hydrochloride,  500 grams of marijuana, and 50 grams of its byproducts.    The bill also changes Article 299 of the Penal Code,  allowing  that drug addicts not be considered traffickers after a legal  medical checkup and if they were arrested with less than five  grams of cocaine.    Another draft law that also was submitted by the executive  branch to Congress includes the cultivation of poppy as a crime  of illegal drug trafficking, establishing severe punishment for  those who grow it.    In the reasons for this bill the executive branch warns that  the introduction of poppy in Peru is a serious threat not only  to our institutional stability but also to the community due to  the harm caused by the psychoactive substances derived from it.    Taking into account the problem's seriousness, the bill  excludes those processed or sentenced for cultivating poppy from  the penitentiary benefits, either early release or executive  branch pardon.    The proposal only has four articles, establishing that "the  one who cultivates poppy, and promotes, facilitates, or finances  the cultivation of poppy will be punished with imprisonment of  not less than 12 years and not more than 20 years." If the  quantity of poppy plants does not exceed 100, the violator will  be punished with not less than eight years and not more than 15  years.    The bill also establishes that all poppy cultivations will  be  destroyed by any means in the presence of a provincial  prosecutor, the land will be transferred to the state, and the  equipment and other supplies used in the cultivation will be  confiscated.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Wound management helps Smith &amp; Nephew rise 9% SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the international healthcare and consumer products group, yesterday reported a 9 per cent increase in first quarter profits after sales continued to grow rapidly in its orthopaedic and wound management divisions. Pre-tax profits rose from a restated Pounds 28.6m to Pounds 31.1m on sales ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 201.1m. This represented a 0.1p rise in earnings per share to 2p. The UK consumer business, which held the group back in 1991, continued to be adversely affected by recession. The healthcare businesses had, however, maintained margins. The sales increase was equivalent to an underlying growth rate of 8 per cent after adjusting for acquisitions, disposals and exchange differences. S&amp;N's tax rate rose from 27 per cent to 29 per cent, reflecting the greater proportion of profits derived outside the UK. The results were in line with market expectations and 'confirmed progress in the core healthcare businesses', said Mr Eric Kinder, chairman. S&amp;N is best known in the UK for its branded consumer goods, such as Nivea and Elastoplast, but this division has been badly mauled by recession. The group also suffered last year from a one-off Pounds 7m fall in profits connected with its Ioptex intraocular lens business after the US government slashed the level of reimbursements that it would pay. Last year, the new management's focus on areas such as hip and knee implants and its wound dressings began to show through in higher margins. The group has also emerged from under the weight of some acquisitions made in the 1980's drive for international coverage, which were less than totally successful. As a result S&amp;N's share price over the last year has risen by more than 50 per cent to 160 1/2 p. See Lex</p>

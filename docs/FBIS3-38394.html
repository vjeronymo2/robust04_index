			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Augsburg (DDP/ADN) -- The German Defense  Ministry intends to accommodate the 1.25 billion mark [DM] cuts  to its budget, approved by the cabinet, by making savings in  Bundeswehr personnel and equipment expenditure. The AUGSBURGER  ALLGEMEINE reports (in its Wednesday [2 February] edition) that  among other things, DM220 million are to be saved in the  purchase and development of arms equipment. The Defense Ministry  wants to save DM60 million by provisionally leaving the army  officer training college in Hannover instead of moving it to  Dresden, as planned. [passage omitted]    The paper also said the ministry hopes to save around DM235  million by cutting personnel levels. For example, some 1,500  civilian vacancies will not be filled and the number of soldiers  serving for a fixed period will be reduced by 400 to 213,800.</p>

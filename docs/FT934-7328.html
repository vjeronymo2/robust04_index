			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Italy seeks way out of dispute over steel cuts THE Italian government is expected to set up a special commission in the next few days to try to resolve its acrimonious dispute with the European Commission over reducing overcapacity in the European steel industry. A meeting of EU industry ministers broke up in disarray on Thursday after Italy rejected demands by Brussels for a 2m cut in annual production capacity at Ilva, the Italian state steel group. The Rome government has been strongly resisting the scale of the Ilva cuts, arguing that they would compromise the viability of the Taranto steel works in southern Italy, the largest in Europe, and create a serious social problem with rising unemployment. Italy is now expected to draw up a new plan covering both the public and private sector and Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister, is expected to establish a commission with a brief to find a solution acceptable to the EU. Italy, it seems, is willing to play for high stakes. But it does not wish to be seen pitted against all its partners, nor be accused of sabotaging integration on the issue of steel which was central to the early stages of forming an common market. In the view of the unions, who are seeking an early meeting with the government, the best solution would be to spread the production cuts into the private sector. They argue that Taranto is a very modern plant with another 30 years of productive life. Better to eliminate capacity among the older private plants, in particular Falck's operation at Sesto San Giovanni on the outskirts of Milan. Taranto has an unemployment rate exceeding 25 per cent, and rationalisation of Ilva puts a quarter of the 13,000 steel jobs there at risk. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Italy's prime minister, last week took the unprecedented step of writing a personal letter to Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, warning of 'explosive social consequences' if Taranto were compromised. The government has its hands full trying to ensure the 1994 budget passes smoothly through parliament and is anxious to avoid social unrest as the country moves towards an early general election. The loss-making Ilva group, controlled by Iri, the state holding, is being split in two covering flat products (essentially Taranto) and special steels. The main privatisation issue is who will take over Taranto. Both France's Usinor and Nippon Steel are possibilities.</p>

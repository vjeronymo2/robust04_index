			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Nissan UK reaches pay and employment deal with Sunderland and Cranfield staff NISSAN UK, the Japanese car company, has reached a two-year pay and employment deal with the 5,000 staff at its north-east England plant at Sunderland and its engineering centre at Cranfield, Bedfordshire. The deal is the first significant private-sector pay rise agreed since the government announced a 1.5 per cent pay ceiling for the public sector. The award, effective from January, will raise salaries by 4 per cent in the first year and 3.5 per cent in the second. If UK inflation rises above 4.5 per cent in 1994 salaries will rise on a point-for-point basis thereafter. That means that if UK inflation rises to 5.5 per cent in 1994, then salaries will rise an extra 1 percentage point to 4.5 per cent. In the previous two years the award was 10.5 per cent falling to 7 per cent in the second year. The deal compares with a two-year deal at Jaguar that gave workers 4 per cent in both years with an inflation trigger in the second. Employees at Rover had an 18-month deal worth a minimum of 7.3 per cent. Ford is in the second year of a two-year deal. Peugeot Talbot has still to settle. The deal at Nissan UK will give manufacturing staff a basic wage of Pounds 15,382.</p>

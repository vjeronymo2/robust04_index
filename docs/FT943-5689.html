			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: United Carriers falls to Pounds 1.2m at midway Poor trading conditions pushed down interim pre-tax profits at United Carriers, the parcel and freight company which was floated in February. In the half year to July 2 pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.2m on turnover up from Pounds 52.7m to Pounds 59m. Operating profits, which included a Pounds 364,000 loss on discontinued operations last time, were down from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 1.63m. Earnings per share fell from 5.8p to 3p, adjusted to reflect the scrip issue in February. Mr Allan Binks, chairman, said that as foreshadowed in the profits warning in May, the company's UK parcels and freight network suffered a sharp drop in volumes. The division had secured new customers, he said, but any benefits from the additional business would not be felt until next year. Although volumes had improved in May, Mr Binks said there was 'no reason to change earlier expectations that volumes would remain flat during the second half of the year'. Operating profits in the specialist transport and distribution division were also lower, although there were signs of a steady improvement in the UK and Continental car markets. Margins in this division would be improved in the second half by the acquisition of 100 large trailers which would reduce spot hiring, Mr Binks said. The company has net assets assets of Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 24.7m) and gearing of 17 per cent. United Carriers shares closed unchanged at 103p yesterday. On the day of the profits warning in May, the shares fell by 33p to 115p. The flotation price was 153p, which produced a market capitalisation of Pounds 51.8m.</p>

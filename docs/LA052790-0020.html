			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEND IN THE MIMES  </P> <P> There used to be an added delight in going to the Music Center. It was the  impromptu, alfresco performances in the plaza -- before and after the shows --  by mimes, violinists, jazz trios, brass choirs, etc.  </P> <P> They were of varying quality, of course, but they were always enlivening.  Sometimes they were more interesting than the performances in the auditoriums.  </P> <P> They have been missing for the past year or so. Why? And who is responsible for  banishing them? Is it the result of some purists' devotion to the idea of a  "higher art"? If so, the purists are sadly mistaken. They are making a visit to  the Music Center as drab and obligatory as visits to any other Temple of the  Higher Arts.  </P> <P> While they are seeking to improve our lives, why don't these purists devote  their energies to getting rid of the beggars who now surround and sometimes  infest the Music Center block, and who have injected into the area a sense of  danger rather than one of exaltation?  </P> <P> RICHARD E. ESHLEMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> A Music Center spokesman said the policy on free-lance performers has not  changed. A person must get permission to perform in the plaza at any time, he  said. The policy is to ask unauthorized performers to leave, but the spokesman  noted that some have managed to get around the prohibition.  </P> <P> </P></p>

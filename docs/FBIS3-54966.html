According to sources at this  Ministry, the previous round was suspended because Moldovan  representatives insisted, among others, on compensating the 14th  Army presence in Moldova. Moldovan representatives also  insisted on 1 July as the final day of the Russian troops'  withdrawal. Previously, the Press Secretariat of the Ministry  of Defense made a protest declaration denying Stepan Kitsak's  affirmations. Stepan Kitsak declared that the Moldovan Ministry  of Defense took the property and equipment of the Battalion 2  Cable And Radio of the 14th Army.</p>

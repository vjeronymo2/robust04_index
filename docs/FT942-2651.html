			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Catalans come to Gonzalez' aid Pressure on Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, eased yesterday as Catalan nationalists in the Madrid parliament promised they would continue supporting the Socialists despite their poor performance in the European elections last week. The assurance was given by Mr Jordi Pujol, the head of Catalonia's autonomous government and leader of Convergencia i Unio (CiU), in talks at the prime minister's residence in Madrid on Thursday.</p>

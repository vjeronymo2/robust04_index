			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Special report on Arts Sponsorship: Hard-up groups join rush for rich benefactors - How companies are chasing sponsors THERE IS hardly an arts company, museum or art gallery in the UK that is not actively seeking support, largely financial, from sponsors. Some organisations - the Glyndebourne festival is the classic example - depend totally on business and private supporters, and their box office, to exist. Not that the absence of a government subsidy worries Glyndebourne. When it re-opens in May in its brand-new theatre, the first production, Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, will be sponsored by Rothschilds. Two more of the season's five productions already have sponsors in Lehman Brothers and Unilever. And this is on top of the Pounds 33m raised to finance the new auditorium, 90 per cent of which comes from business supporters. Glyndebourne has been going for 60 years. But many newer arts companies are equally successful at selling themselves to sponsors. The Docklands Sinfonietta is only in its fourth year but has attracted nearly Pounds 200,000 this season from sponsors like Morgan Stanley and Amerada Hess, and the London Docklands Development Corporation. It has two attractive selling points, on top of its music: it is based in an economically deprived part of the country and it has strong educational and community programmes. These have brought it support from Texaco and Tate &amp; Lyle. Arts organisations have discovered that it is much easier to raise money for educational, youth and community projects than for their mainstream activities. Sponsors find their boards are more likely to nod through what seem like charitable donations. The organisations know that to get funding from the Arts Council and local authorities these days, they must provide a comprehensive educational and community programme so that any sponsorship money devoted to these causes frees resources for other creative activities. The development manager in arts companies, charged with raising sponsorship money, has become a key executive. The personality and the co-operation of the artistic director is still crucial in keeping sponsors happy, but the development manager now takes on much of the burden, especially the socialising after events where the corporate guests mingle with musicians, dancers or actors - a popular element in many sponsorships. Successful development managers are flexible. The days of the mammoth Pounds 200,000-plus sponsorship for a single event are over. They are prepared to accept smaller sums in return for a sponsorship, and to put together packages of sponsors. So, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (still the most supported arts organisation, with an income of Pounds 6.1m from sponsors, corporate and private Friends, and galas in 1992-93), has persuaded Cable &amp; Wireless to sponsor its grand new production of the year, Die Meistersinger (which opened yesterday), for a modest Pounds 100,000. The rest of the production cost has been found by the Friends of Covent Garden. The Royal Academy is particularly successful at creating joint sponsorships. Its present exhibition, of 20th century American art, has Merrill Lynch as its one main sponsor, but American Airlines helped with transporting pictures and curators and the Daily Telegraph is the useful media backer to provide publicity (see picture opposite). The RA is successful in attracting sponsors because it offers an excellent environment for entertaining corporate guests, has a smart image, and offers sponsors the opportunity of a guaranteee against loss  - with the outside chance that an exhibition might produce a surplus to share out. The National Gallery and the Tate share the advantages of attractive rooms for corporate hospitality, plus an unrivalled reputation for the quality of their exhibitions. They can afford to be selective and prefer one sole sponsor. This month, British Land is backing the Tate's Ben Nicholson show and has arranged that all its 8,000 shareholders have access to special evening viewings. In the New Year, Ernst &amp; Young sponsors a major Picasso show. The National Gallery has fewer special exhibitions, but Esso remains its long-term supporter and is behind the present re-assessment of the Wilton Diptych. The museum which has taken the hunt for sponsorship furthest is the Victoria &amp; Albert. In addition to finding Far Eastern corporate sponsors for its renovated Korean, Japanese and Chinese galleries, it typifies the new flexibility. Pearson, owner of the FT, is backing two important scholarly exhibitions in the near future: on the work of Pugin in 1994 and William Morris in 1996. Samsung, backer of the Korean gallery, and Mobil are funding scholars for three years to work in the field of Korean art and Victorian studies. Pilkington is providing help in kind: an impressive glass balustrade for the new Glasss gallery opening in January. Loaning the expertise of corporate executives to an arts organisation, on a daily or long-term contract, is another potentially important form of sponsorship which is formalised in ABSA's Business in the Arts scheme. Another new approach is favoured by Jeremy Isaacs, Covent Garden's supremo. He is looking for sponsors who will subsidise seat prices at particular performances, so enabling students and the less advantaged to enjoy a trip to the opera or ballet. This is an extension of the successful Midland Proms season at the ROH. Research by insurance company Clerical Medical on the way audiences see arts sponsorship suggested that many people regard reducing the cost of tickets as the most acceptable form of business involvement in the arts. One encouraging feature for development managers is that companies now are much more prepared to support the avant-garde and regional events. The lure of the tested and tried in the metropolis is less powerful. Some of the most successful sponsorship-getters are away from London. The Nottingham Playhouse boosted its revenue from Pounds 9,000 in 1980 to more than Pounds 120,000 this year, with Youngers recently adding another Pounds 175,000 in a four-year deal. The West Yorkshire Playhouse has moved ahead from Pounds 68,000 two years ago to a projected Pounds 200,000 this season. An interesting initiative here was to involve the staff of Marks &amp; Spencer in a community play, Magnetic North, which the company sponsored. The top development managers are already being poached. Lucy Stout, who helped to build the National Theatre's sponsorship success, is on her way to the Welsh National Opera. Some arts organisations feel, with justification, that they should not need to join this hunt, or become hucksters in the market place. They believe their artistic programmes are strong enough to draw sponsors to them. But sponsors respond to well-managed arts organisations, and respect professionals. Sponsorship, as a source of funding the arts, is not going to be replaced by enhanced government subsidies. Those few arts companies that still go through the motions in attracting sponsors will lose out. Perhaps they should apply quickly for one of the courses at leading business schools designed to introduce arts personnel to the mysteries of management. Naturally, these are sponsored - by English Estates.</p>

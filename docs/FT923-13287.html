			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Playing a variety of roles in natural resources / Investigation into the investment career of Clive Smith MR CLIVE SMITH, the Midlands entrepreneur known for his involvement in the flotations of several natural resource companies in London in the 1980s, is no stranger to litigation. Two legal actions have been taken out against him in the last six months. Mr Smith has been involved in companies such as Butte Mining, Geevor, Petranol, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Globe Petroleum, formerly called Far East Resources. The Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into two, Richmond and Butte, following a raid on the offices of Bryant &amp; Co, a Jersey accountant which once managed some of Mr Smith's offshore interests. A self-made millionaire, Mr Smith played various roles in the resource companies, from shareholder to board executive, and even chairman. The degree of his involvement in many of these companies is unclear, as virtually all of his interests are held in offshore trusts. 'My entire affairs are dealt with offshore by different administrators,' he said yesterday. The share prices of all but one of these resource companies have collapsed, hit by a variety of factors from failed ambitions to the sharp decline in fuel and mineral prices. The exception was Petranol which was taken over by Mr Hubert Perrodo, the French investor, and renamed Concorde Energy. The first piece of litigation to come to light in recent months concerned Butte Mining, which Mr Smith helped to float in 1987. The latest relates to the Big Sinking Field, a Kentucky oil property which was eventually sold to Globe Petroleum, a UK company in which Mr Smith was an investor. Globe has been suspended at 4 1/2 p since March. On March 13 1991, Sun Glow Joint Ventures of the US sold the Kentucky property to Proctor Investments, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.2m) in cash and Globe shares. Proctor's ultimate ownership is unclear, but Mr Smith actively negotiated the purchase. He also personally guaranteed Proctor's promise to buy back a Dollars 450,000 tranche of the Globe shares. Proctor failed to do so and Sun Glow is seeking payment from Mr Smith. He is contesting the legal action and last night said Proctor 'is certainly not connected to me'. However, he added that with so many interests overseas, it was difficult even for him to remember all the details. Immediately after the purchase, Proctor transferred the field to Kingsway, another British Virgin Islands company, which had been formed four months earlier and owned just one other, smaller asset in Texas. Globe agreed to buy Kingsway for Dollars 19.5m on March 27, just two weeks after Proctor had paid Dollars 2.3m for the Sinking Field. The next day, a prospectus for Globe's full stock market listing valued the Kentucky reserves at Dollars 26.7m and the Texas asset at Dollars 4.5m. The prospectus does not mention Mr Smith's role in the transaction, although he was a Globe shareholder through Supernal Services, his Jersey-based vehicle, and his two daughters were also investors, or the price which Proctor originally paid for the assets. Five months after the sale to Globe, the company's auditors, Moore Stevens, expressed concerns that Mr Smith 'may, in effect, exercise such influence as to be deemed a shadow director of the company within the definition of the Companies Act'. Their anxieties were communicated in a letter addressed to Mr Michael Plant, managing director. Mr Arthur Davy, who was in charge of the Globe account at Moore Stevens, said last week he had not been aware of Mr Smith's association with Proctor at the time of the transaction. Mr Smith's past has been the subject of some controversy in the City of London. He left Petranol, the resources group where he had been chairman, in April 1986 but kept his 25 per cent shareholding. In May, the Takeover Panel ruled that Mr Smith had been working in concert with a hostile predator, Inoco, which was bidding Pounds 21m in shares for Petranol. The Panel ordered Inoco to include a cash element in its offer, but instead it dropped the bid. Mr Roger Jeffries, an Inoco director and known to Mr Smith from the days of Petranol's flotation, subsequently resigned. Mr Smith said he had no idea at the time that Mr Jeffries was on the Inoco board. In 1987 Mr Jeffries helped to bring Far East Resources to the market, eventually becoming a director of the company. Mr Jeffries also held a wide range of natural resource interests, including stakes in Richmond and Butte. Mr Smith is also currently contesting US litigation by Butte, which claims damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds 184m) from about 70 individuals and companies. Butte is alleging fraud, and misrepresentation on the part of various defendants, involving, among other things, the purchase of US assets. Butte is also asking for damages to be trebled under US anti-racketeering legislation. When the allegations were first made in May, Mr Smith said: 'I have never been involved in any racketeering. Any claims are frivolous.' He said his family's shareholding in Butte remained at the same level as when the company was floated in 1987, some 19m shares. Butte shares were placed at 100p each in 1987, rose to 140p in 1988, but subsequently collapsed. Last night they languished at 2p each. Among the many allegations made by Deutsch and Frey of New York, Butte's contingent-fee lawyers, is that in 1988 Butte paid Pounds 51m, mainly in shares then priced at 125p each, for a company whose sole asset in Montana, had cost Dollars 90,566 only a short while before. No trial date has yet been fixed but Butte believes the case might reach court at the end of 1993. In 1987, Mr Smith's Supernal Services took a 26.5 per cent shareholding in Geevor, the Cornwall tin miner with an 85-year history and a London quote. Supernal paid 125p a share. Mr Smith sold a 9 per cent stake to Mr Eric Grayson, formerly of Burnett &amp; Hallamshire, who moved in as chairman with plans to turn Geevor into an international mining group. After Mr Grayson's arrival Geevor bought coal mining assets in the US and the UK, but they failed to live up to expectations. New management was installed in the middle of 1990. However, attempts to revive Geevor foundered early last year when its bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, withdrew the mining company's facilities. Geevor's shares were suspended at 4 3/4 p in January. Attempts have since been made to rescue the company via a reverse takeover. Mr Smith has also been linked to Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, where creditors recently foreclosed on the last of the main assets it had when it came to the market in June 1989. Floated at 105p, Richmond's public offer was a failure, when would-be investors questioned the valuations of Texas assets purchased for about Dollars 2m and valued in the offer documents a month later at Dollars 30m. Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken up. Immediately following the flotation, 30 per cent of Richmond was held by companies registered in Liberia. Richmond has suffered a series of mishaps since flotation, including the abandonment of a property in Louisiana, a dispute over the Texas assets, and a failed Pounds 31m rights issue in October 1990, when 25 per cent of the issue was left with underwriters, County NatWest, and brokers Girozentrale Gilbert Elliott. The shares, which were 173p in 1990, closed at 7p last night. Richmond's main remaining assets are two joint ventures, one in Siberia and another on Apache tribal lands in New Mexico. Richmond's broker at flotation, Corporate Broking Services, of which Mr Smith held 11 per cent, went into liquidation last year. It also acted as broker to Geevor and Globe. Other directors of CBS were Mr Jeffries, and Mr David Wilkinson, joint managing director of Richmond. Mr Wilkinson, a former director of Butte and Far East Resources, is also named in the Butte litigation.</p>

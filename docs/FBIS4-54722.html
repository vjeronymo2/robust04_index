			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 2 (CTK) -- The first session of the  Czech-Iranian commission at the level of ministers, at which  current issues concerning economic and trade relations are to be  discussed, started today in Prague. Heavy Industry Minister  Nezhad-Hoseynian is at the head of the Iranian delegation, and  Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is at the head of  the Czech delegation, Dlouhy's office told CTK. The mixed  commission should also discuss Iranian debts owing to Czech  businesses.    According to earlier information from the Foreign Ministry,  the debts are linked to long-term projects contracts for which  had been concluded in the past under terms not much advantageous  for the then Czechoslovakia. The debts now stand at about $20  million and the amount is further increasing. Dlouhy told CTK  today that he hoped that at least a basic agreement would be  reached on the problem.    The Czech delegation is made up of representatives of the  Trade and Industry, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Transport,  Economy, and Agriculture Ministries. The commission was  constituted on the basis of an intergovernmental trade agreement  signed on October 2, 1993, when Dlouhy was on an official visit  to Iran. The commission will receive Prime Minister Vaclav  Klaus tomorrow. The Iranian delegation will leave Prague on May  5.</p>

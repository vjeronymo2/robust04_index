			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEETHOVEN MASS SET AT CHURCH  </P> <P> Although many of the great classical music works were composed expressly for  religious rituals, they are rarely performed in that context today. This is  particularly true of full-scale renditions of the Roman Catholic Mass, which  are far more likely to be heard in the concert hall than in a church.  </P> <P> But on Sunday evening at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic Church in Encino,  Beethoven's Mass in C will be presented in the manner in which it was intended.  </P> <P> "This is a religious work, after all, so we wanted to do it as an actual Mass,"  said William Beck, music director of St. Cyril's. "But it is a large  undertaking for a church, to say the least."  </P> <P> The Mass, which is to be celebrated by the church's pastor, Rev. Monsignor  Cyril Navin, will be performed by a 40-piece orchestra, a 50-member choir and  four soloists, all to be conducted by Beck.  </P> <P> It was scheduled as part of the church's regular performing arts series, with  an important difference. Although the cost of performing the work will be  approximately $5,000 (most of which is for musicians' fees), the church will  not be charging admission or asking those attending for the traditional  "suggested donation."  </P> <P> "We can't," Beck said, "because this is being done as a religious service. It's  free to anyone who wants to come." As in any regular service, however, the  plate will be passed for free-will offerings.  </P> <P> Additional music will include the "Hallelujah" section of Beethoven's "Christ  on the Mount of Olives" oratorio.  </P> <P>  Beethoven's Mass in C will be celebrated at St. Cyril of Jerusalem Catholic  Church, 15520 Ventura Blvd., Encino, at 7:30 p.m. Sunday.

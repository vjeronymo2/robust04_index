			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / ICI increases offer to 5.1% IMPERIAL Chemical Industries has agreed to raise the pay of 19,000 hourly-paid employees by 5.1 per cent in the latest of a series of above-average settlements at chemicals companies this year. Union leaders and members had rejected a previous offer of 4.5 per cent  - about the average in UK manufacturing. The deal raises the possibility that employees will receive more than 11 per cent this year. In a framework deal last year the company and unions agreed that local deals on changes in working practices would trigger a 36-hour week and payments equivalent to 14 per cent of salary, starting with 6 per cent on implementation and a further 4 per cent in each of the following two years. The 14 per cent would be in addition to any annual pay rises. However, talks on working practice changes have taken longer than expected. The company had been hoping local deals would start to come through by the end of last year, but so far agreements covering fewer than 100 workers have been negotiated. Incomes Data Services, the pay research organisation, said ICI's pay deal is at the higher end of manufacturing settlements, but compares with 6 per cent at Yorkshire Chemicals and the Wellcome Foundation. The Chemical Industries Association, which negotiates on behalf of more than 200 companies, settled at 4.3 per cent from April 1.</p>

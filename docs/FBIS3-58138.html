			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Better News for Eastern Europe"] </F>   [Text] A reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to  Europe has been overdue for some time. Al Gore, the Vice  President, provided it last night in a speech setting the scene  for next week's NATO summit.    The speech is welcome not only because Europeans want  reassurance, but also because the United States seems to need  periodic reminders of the importance of Europe for its own  interests and its own security, no matter how vital the Pacific  rim is as well. It should not have taken Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  to provoke such a reminder.    But this time Mr Gore also reached out to include the  democracies of East Europe, not with a full commitment to their  security but to emphasise that "the security of these states  affects the security of America." This, too, was necessary. It  is simple enough to understand why Washington has been reluctant  to invite East Europe fully into NATO. Not only would an  invitation risk provoking the nationalists in Russia, but it  would also commit NATO to the defence of a much enlarged area  before the political and military groundwork has been done.    Yet the reluctance has been overdone to the extent of  seeming  to give Moscow a veto over Western security policy. As a  result, the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, in particular, have  felt themselves abandoned in a security vacuum by a Western  alliance that is supposed to share their values and interests.  They have rightly felt aggrieved and vulnerable and have been  pressing for more supportive policies, especially since the  nationalist clouds gathered in Moscow.    Washington's much-touted "Partnership for Peace" was  supposed  to reassure the East Europeans without provoking Moscow but has  satisfied neither. Mr Gore's speech, coupled with an  authoritative briefing from NATO sources, changes the emphasis  rather than the substance of policy. East Europe now gets more  attention and better hopes of entering NATO at some point, while  the Russian veto looks weaker. This is entirely right, provided  it is coupled, as it is likely to be, with efforts to persuade  the Russians that they are not being excluded from Europe.    What they need to be shown is that it is up to them whether  their relationship with Europe is to be co-operative or  confrontational. Western reassurance for East Europe does not  threaten them; rather, it lowers the risk of instability in the  area, which should be to Russia's advantage. If the NATO  summit is now freed of an exaggerated deference to the more  irrational fears of Moscow, its chances of success will be  enhanced.</p>

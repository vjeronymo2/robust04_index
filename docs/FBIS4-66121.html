			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mozambique/Italy: Government </F> Delegation in Rome"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- A Mozambique Government  delegation led by Transport Minister Guebuza is in Rome for  meetings with political and parliamentary figures within the  framework of the intense relations that Rome enjoys both with  the Maputo government and with Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance], the former rebel movement now in the process of  becoming a bona fide political party. It was Guebuza who  represented the Maputo government in the negotiations with  Renamo that led to the signing of a peace pact in Rome in  October of 1992.    The present Rome contacts are aimed at easing the  implementation of the peace accords and the elections set for  October 27-28 of this year in Mozambique.    During meetings held at the Foreign Ministry here the Maputo  government reiterated its gratitude to Italy for its  contribution to the pacification of the African country.    Italy, in fact, in addition to helping with the peace  process, is top contributor to the United Nations fund for  turning the former Mozambique rebel movement Renamo into a  political party.    The UN special envoy to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, only  recently pointed out that the Italian government had given three  donations totalling 6.28 million dollars, out of a total of 15  million dollars donated.    The fund was set up in May 1993 with the aim of persuading  Renamo to implement the peace plan signed in Rome in 1992.    It was initially to have 10 million dollars; this was later  raised to 15.    The next biggest contributor after Italy is Holland with one  million dollars, followed by Sweden, South Africa, Switzerland  and Luxembourg.    A second fund to fund campaigns of all Mozambique parties  for  October elections will receive donations to the tune of some  three million dollars, Ajello said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy: </F> "Professionalism, Discipline, and Order"]    [Excerpts] The training and upbringing of a corps of  national commanders is one of the primary elements in building  the Ukrainian Armed Forces.    Analyzing the two-year experience of this process, we must  point out that many notions had to be reviewed, transformed, and  created anew in the course of carrying out this task.    The structure of that part of the Soviet Army which was  inherited by Ukraine from the USSR did not correspond with  Ukraine's new tasks, its domestic and foreign political  situation. Thus, this structure had to be reformed.    The groups of forces acquired by Ukraine were not integral  military entities. The system of their command, control, and  communications was disrupted; the operational-strategic  structure of troops demanded radical changes and orientation  solely toward domestic resources.    Learning other countries' experiences and analyzing  suggestions and propositions, we came to the conclusion that the  new Ukraine needed a new Army that would neither be the  successor of the Soviet Army nor follow the pattern of any  Western army. This new army had to take into account national  and historic peculiarities and be based on domestic  infrastructure. Besides, the new Ukrainian Armed Forces  demanded the creation of a national officers' corps.    In light of this, we have to build anew the Ukrainian Armed  Forces, at the same time resolving several intertwined issues:  reforming existing groups and units and creating new ones;  dismissing a large number of servicemen and replacing them with  Ukrainian nationals serving in other CIS states; eliminating  acute social problems and resolving issues of spiritual and  national rebirth, and the like.    The cornerstone of these tasks is the formation of a system  of training and upbringing national officers. The critical  analysis of the elapsed two-year period has demonstrated that  certain things could have been done differently and better. One  of the reasons that we have not accomplished more were drawbacks  in personnel policy and the failure or impossibility to appoint  professional officers to the main sectors of our activities.    Any army that uses mixed methods of staffing, faces the  primary issue of a professional approach to the military trade.  This issue determines an army's morale and psychological  atmosphere and thus, success in combat.    In our opinion, three factors are crucial for military  professionals: competence, responsibility, and loyalty to the  motherland.    These are the features that distinguish a professional from  a  dilettante caring only how to get more and give less.    The complicated economic and sociopolitical situation in  Ukraine undoubtedly influences the situation in the Army which  makes us seek unconventional approaches to the training and  upbringing of officers. Besides, we must take into account that  any restrictions in the social, legal, or spiritual spheres of  officers' lives hamper the processes of professionalizing the  Army.    An officer who is constantly being distracted from his  duties  by his housing problems, his wife's employment, his children's  protection from hooligans, and the like, can hardly be expected  to be very efficient in his duties. The more so that both he  and his family see that shady deals guarantee better lives for  many people around them. [passage omitted]    We believe that an officer can achieve a high degree of  professionalism only by being assisted by a properly organized  uninterrupted system of professional training. This is even  more necessary given the fact that every five to 15 years,  knowledge becomes obsolete in different branches of science.    Such a flexible multifold system of continuous improvement  of  cadets' and officers' skills should be introduced in the  Ukrainian Armed Forces. We have drafted a concept of continuous  training which includes the following postulates:    First: The creation of an organized intertwined system of  continuous training of officers, not only by military institutes  and academies but also at different courses, officers classes in  military units, self-education, as well as closer integration of  military and civilian education.    Second: More fundamental schooling within the framework of  higher education, especially in initial years. In military  educational institutions during the first three to four years,  emphasis should be placed on learning basic subjects, as well as  elements of military and general educational programs that  entitle students to receive civilian diplomas.    Besides, we believe that the new conditions demand a change  in the essence of education. Military education used to be  oriented toward training personnel for commanding troops in  combat. The new type of schooling, not diminishing the role of  this kind of training, should provide knowledge necessary for  building the new Ukrainian Army and ensuring its readiness to  perform peaceful tasks (including participation in peacekeeping  forces). [passage omitted]    Assessing the situation that developed in the professional  training of officers, we cannot disregard the issue of the  Ukrainian language becoming the main working language of every  professional officer, the language which he can freely speak,  write, read, and use to give commands to his subordinates.    This is a natural precondition which is not in any way  insulting to the Russian language, which will remain the  official language of the CIS. However, this precondition is  hard to implement in the Ukrainian Armed Forces now. In our  opinion, we need an all-out state program to teach Ukrainian,  involving appropriate educational institutions.    For the Armed Forces, this is a very urgent problem,  because all the official documents are published in Ukrainian,  while a comparatively small number of officers can freely speak  Ukrainian, and there is a shortage of special military  literature in this language.    In my opinion, the problem can be resolved by better  financing of the process of training and by convincing officers  that learning Ukrainian is crucial. Officers should be led to  understand that Ukraine's glorious history, its customs and  traditions, important for both individual development and for  teaching one's subordinates, can only be done in the native  language. [passage omitted]    I think that we should once again point out the  depolitization of the Army. Ukraine's military doctrine and the  Law of Ukraine on Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and  Members of Their Families stipulate that "complete  depolitization" of the Army is one of the primary principles of  building the Ukrainian Armed Forces, which amounts to a ban on  servicemen's participation and membership in any political  parties, organizations, or movements. In a majority of  developed countries, political activity is a profession just as  diplomatic, legal, or military. Why should Ukrainian servicemen  be preoccupied with mastering politics rather than their  profession? He who wants to devote his life to professional  politics should give up his military career.    At the same time, this does not mean that there is negative  attitude toward any political party or its leadership within our  Armed Forces. We have nothing against cooperation with parties  and movements, the more so that some of these express opinions  regarding the situation in the state, that are similar to ours.  However, it should be precisely stated that the Ukrainian Armed  Forces are state structures and they should pursue governmental  policy which I would term "centrist," in terms of attitude  toward the standpoints of different parties and movements.  [passage omitted]    To provide the performance of tasks outlined by President  Kravchuk in his speech at the meeting devoted to Ukrainian Armed  Forces Day on 4 December 1994, the Ministry of Defense has  issued an order pointing out concrete measures for the Army.    The main task in the sphere of training the Ukrainian Armed  Forces in 1994, is implementing the military doctrine, and  maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of troops (forces)  at the stage of their forming, at the level safeguarding the  protection of national sovereignty and political independence of  Ukraine, its territorial integrity, inviolability of borders,  and fighting back armed aggression from any side.    In the situation when the Armed Forces are being built and  defense budget reduced, combat and mobilization readiness of  troops (forces) must not be lowered.    In operational training, efforts should be concentrated on  deep studying and practical implementation of issues of  organizing efficient defense of land and sea borders in all  directions, as well as antiaircraft and antimissile protection  of important state installations.    Combat training should be brought close to real conditions  in  which troops (forces) have to perform combat tasks, especially  fighting back aggression in the initial stages of war.    By the end of 1994, we are planning to adopt the contractual  system of manning our officers' corps, paying special attention  to officers having the experience of working in operational and  operational-strategic units, fighting in the Afghan war, and  eliminating the aftermath of the accident at Chernobyl nuclear  power station.    In the scientific aspect, we will continue researching the  problems of developing the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We will  direct our efforts at providing a theoretical basis for the  organizational structure of troops, and the combat structure of  units in light of the economic potential of the state and quotas  stipulated by the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.    We will continue working on developing the system of  military  education, supplying the Armed Forces with skilled specialists,  ready to perform their duty to protect Ukraine's independence  and sovereignty. Special attention should be paid to learning  the Ukrainian language and history.    Thus, complicated and responsible tasks posed by life to the  Ukrainian Armed Forces, require the strenuous work of every  general, officer, warrant officer, and all personnel. Only by  joint work and efforts will we be able to overcome the hardships  of the transitional period of building our state and the Army.</p>

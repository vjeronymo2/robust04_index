			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Norsk Hydro rights in line with expectations Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian energy, fertilisers and metals group which is 51 per cent owned by the state, has raised NKr4.7bn through its one-for-nine rights offering, in line with expectations. Merrill Lynch, global co-ordinator of the SEC-registered offering, said the 23.6m new shares were priced at NKr200 each - a slight discount to the old shares, which traded at NKr219 yesterday. Of the total amount, 30 per cent was taken up by US investors and the rest by European and domestic investors. The state subscribed in full to its entitlement. Svedala, the mineral processing and transport company, has raised SKr843.6m through the sale of 87 per cent of its shares in Kalmar, a subsidiary which manufacturers fork-lift trucks. Svedala plans to sell its remaining shares at a later date as part of its strategy of concentrating on its core businesses and paying down debt. The 11.1m shares were sold at SKr76 each, to give a historical price-earnings ratio of 29. Merrill Lynch, the global co-ordinator, said 7.2m shares were bought by European and Swedish investors and 3m by US investors. A further 900,000 shares were sold to Swedish retail investors. The shares will be listed in Stockholm on July 11.</p>

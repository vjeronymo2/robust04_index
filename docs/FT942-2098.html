			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Observer: Stone turned Argentina's President Carlos Menem rarely misses a chance to embellish his image of playboy, sportsman, racing car-driver and hob-nobber with glitterati. So when Oliver Stone sought his support for a film version of the musical Evita, he agreed to open the doors of the Casa Rosada presidential palace - the famous pink house in Buenos Aires that was the scene of Juan and Eva Peron's greatest triumphs 40 years ago. But he soon realised that the rank and file of his Peronist party - which still worships the Perons - abhorred the notion of a Yankee film-maker desecrating the image of Evita. The president is even more interested in getting re-elected next year, so he just as quickly pulled out again. Bitter tears from Oliver.</p>

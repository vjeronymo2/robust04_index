			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Observer: Diplomacy Gone are the days of shyness and embarrassed silences in diplomatic company whenever Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, takes the microphone. Honouring Michael Perry, Unilever's chairman, for his services to trade, Hosokawa pointed out that it was another Perry, Commodore Matthew Perry, who had arrived from the US with four black warships to 'force us' to open markets in 1853. But times and personalities have changed, Hosokawa implied; Unilever's Perry had come to Japan armed only with a 'mild shampoo'. Later on, Hosokawa played host at a press conference in the back garden of the prime ministerial residence; he smiled sympathetically as John Major, the British prime minister, was asked to comment on a famous Hosokawa saying that a party becomes easily corrupted if it is in government for more than 10 years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Must Act With Fairness"] </F>   [Text] A group of American companies late last week sent a  petition to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor indicating  that Thailand is among the 36 countries with a gross violation  of American copyrights. It says the private sectors in those  countries were responsible for piracy of books, software,  movies, and discs resulting in a loss of some 200,000 million  baht to them. It is a pity the complaint did not give a  specific figure about the damage caused by Thailand alone.    It is quite understandable why American companies complained  -- they wanted their government to apply Section 301 of the U.S.  Trade Act to penalize Thailand. Thailand is one of the  countries on the priority watch list facing U.S. trade  retaliation. It is possible the United States would take action  against them the way it is doing with Japan for rejecting  conditions offered by the United States to solve the problem of  trade surplus -- Japan agreed to solve the problem, but not the  way dictated by the United States. It also indicated it would  take action before the G-7 meeting, or the meeting of the seven  industrialized countries. That was Japan's condition. As for  Thailand, it has no choice but to wait and see what decision the  United States makes. This depends on how sincere and how  serious Thailand is concerning its efforts to suppress copyright  violations.    We think the Commerce Ministry has been trying hard to  suppress copyright violations. There have been raids and  seizures of pirated cassettes, and the products are destroyed.  Legal actions have been taken against imitators. However, the  rate of arrests might not be big enough for the American  companies; otherwise they would not have complained to the U.S.  Trade Representative.    So we think that to avoid U.S. trade retaliation Thailand,  through the Commerce Ministry, should take action more seriously  and consistently to stop copyright piracy. We must show to the  United States that we did not remain oblivious to the problem,  and thus the proposal by the American companies is not  justified. The government must protect the interest of the  nation against negative impacts caused by a handful of law  violators.    Anyway, we would like to appeal to the United States to be  fair. As Thailand is cracking down on the illegals, certain  countries are abusing the copyright law to a greater extent.  The United States did not show any concern. If this is allowed  to continue, it would be unfair for those with their names on  the U.S. priority watch list.    The United States realized what was going on, but it was  reluctant to react because this involves a big country with a  large population and a gross human rights violation. The United  States closes its eyes and pretends not knowing what is going  on. Can this be called a discrimination by the United States?    If the answer is no, that means the United States applies  different rules to different countries.</p>

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Observer: Bowed out Why has King's College, Cambridge, done a disappearing act with ballerina Lydia Lopokova, the one and only woman whose picture used to enliven its senior 'combination' room's walls? The official reason for the removal of the painting, by Duncan Grant, is 'restoration'. But dons suspect that the leaden hand of political correctness is to blame. Besides Lopokova, the picture showed a Peeping-Tom eyeing her gossamer-clad form from behind a screen - which female members of the college apparently deemed beyond the pale. Never mind that the watcher was her husband, John Maynard Keynes. Better to have no women at all gracing the walls, than one being ogled by a male.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Unfinished QE2 refit hits US passengers US passengers due to join the Queen Elizabeth 2's ill-fated Christmas cruise in New York became the latest victims of the liner's unfinished Pounds 30m refit programme as their holidays were cancelled yesterday. The New York office of Cunard, the ship's owner, said yesterday that 1,000 passengers would leave New York tonight on the next leg of the QE2's cruise. But it admitted it had been 'adjusting the inventory' - fewer cabins would be available - and an undisclosed number of passengers who could not be accommodated would be offered alternative cruises in compensation. It refused to reveal the number of passengers who had been due to sail from New York. The US passengers join 158 disappointed UK holders of tickets who were due to join the cruise in New York but had their holidays cancelled late on Tuesday, as well as 500 left behind when the liner sailed from Southampton last Saturday. Cunard in London insisted there would be no further cancellations. It said refitting work was continuing on the liner after bad weather had caused delays, and insisted that enough accommodation would be ready. Passengers on board reacted angrily to news that hundreds more would be joining in New York. They have complained of conditions resembling a 'building site', overflowing toilets, 'stinking' swimming pools and closed facilities. They have formed an action committee which plans to take legal action against Cunard. Passengers not disembarking in the US but continuing to the Caribbean and round-the-world cruise were told yesterday they would not have the planned day's stop in New York. The liner is expected to arrive in New York 16 hours behind schedule.</p>

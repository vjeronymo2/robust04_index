			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ari"-signed report: "BDI Considers Hopes of Growth in </F> Exports Fully Justified"]    [Text] In its latest report on the economic situation, the  Federation of Germany (BDI) states that the economic situation  in western Germany at the beginning of 1994 underwent a further  stabilization.    Industrial output, however, stagnated. Orders are continuing  to increase, with demand from abroad gaining in momentum. The  price situation has become more stable. In view of wage  agreements being in keeping with the economic situation, the  pressure on costs has been reduced and the downward trend in  interest rates is continuing.    All this indicates that business will pick up over the next  few months. Expectations that warehouse stocks will have to be  increased and an actual tendency to do so support a cautiously  optimistic view. However, this cannot conceal the basic problem  -- weak domestic demand.    The BDI does not assume that domestic demand will increase  over the rest of the year. However, expectations of a further  rapid increase in exports are completely justified. In addition  to a strong economic upturn in a whole series of countries  outside Europe, the first signs of an increase in demand in  Europe have become apparent. The first indications of economic  recovery as well as a reversal of the tendency for the German  mark to increase in value within the European Monetary System  play a role in this respect.    The prospects for the labor market are not good. Even if the  economy develops favorably, the BDI estimates the number of  persons in employment will fall further. The reduction in  employment in both western and eastern Germany will constitute  the most serious economic policy problem over the next few  years. It is inconceivable that this problem should be solved  unless investment grows at a significant rate. That is why the  federation has called for an easing of the taxation and public  dues burden on companies. This could help encourage investment  and thus contribute to the creation of new jobs.    Growth in the new laender has accelerated, writes the BDI.  However, despite considerable progress, east German industry  still cannot keep pace with international competition. The  unsatisfactory development of exports to Western industrial  countries reflects this very clearly.    In western Germany, the impact of gradual economic recovery  on the various branches of the economy has differed  considerably. The raw materials and industrial goods industry  had recovered the most in the meantime. Output rose in almost  all sectors. According to the BDI, the recession has bottomed  out for manufacturers of producer goods thanks to increased  demand from abroad. Until recently, output in the consumer  goods industry was falling. This is the strongest indication of  weak growth in private consumption.    The BDI economic reports also note a sustained upturn in the  west and an improvement in the situation in the east for certain  selected branches of industry.  <H5>  The Construction Industry </H5>   The situation in the construction industry has stopped  deteriorating over the past few months. Housing construction is  expanding rapidly, and there are indications of more stability  in industrial and public construction. Orders for industrial  construction are once again close to last year's high level, and  the recession in civil engineering is slowing. There has been  no improvement in the case of structural engineering orders  placed by the railroad, postal service, and in civil engineering  orders placed by local government. In contrast to orders, the  earnings situation is being increasingly negatively assessed.    In eastern Germany, housing construction, which registered a  nominal increase in sales of 40 percent in 1993, expanded the  most, with industrial construction increasing by 33 percent and  public construction increasing by 15 percent. East German  construction companies posted sales of 125,000 German marks [DM]  per employee. Thus, the difference in productivity compared to  west German companies fell by one-fifth. Employment rose by a  substantial 12 percent to over 370,000.  <H5>  Engineering </H5>   The continuing negative trend in west German engineering  shows that investment in western Germany is still in retreat.  However, orders from abroad indicate that there will be an  upturn. In addition, in January/February 1994, orders from EU  [European Union] countries picked up for the first time. The  first positive effects of improved business abroad can already  be felt in the ancillary field. The stimulus from abroad has  slowed the decline in output, but at the beginning of 1994,  output fell once again, by a further 2.1 percent compared to  last year's level. Since 1990, engineering output has easily  fallen by a fifth. The shedding of jobs that this has triggered  has still not come to an end.    In the course of 1993, east German engineering has  experienced a turn for the better. Output has grown rapidly,  and the rate at which jobs are being shed has slowed. However,  the productivity gap has still not been closed, and the number  of people employed in the industry will continue to decrease.  <H5>  The Automobile Industry </H5>   Demand from western companies has grown for the first time  compared to a year before. However, this does not mean that the  situation in the automobile industry will pick up, because the  level of domestic demand is still very low. The decline in  domestic demand for commercial vehicles reflects the continued  weak level of investment. On the other hand, there has been a  slight increase in demand from abroad. However, for a long  time, there has not been a sustained improvement that would  stimulate higher output.    Production of automobiles in the east is expanding rapidly.  The number of employees is no longer declining. In terms of  sales per employee, two-thirds of west German productivity  levels have been reached.  <H5>  Electrical Engineering </H5>   In the west, the rate of decline markedly slowed during the  second half of 1993. Nevertheless, the continued rise in orders  from abroad could not compensate for a further sharp fall in  domestic orders. The manufacture of electrical engineering  capital goods continued to fall, but the level of a year ago was  only marginally exceeded. Output of consumer goods grew and  production of entertainment electronics even rose rapidly. The  rationalization measures introduced in 1993 have led to a steep  increase in productivity and in the fourth quarter of 1991, unit  labor costs fell for the first time.    The situation in the east German electrical engineering  industry has stabilized. Employment stopped declining in 1993.  The productivity gap compared to the west has become smaller.  <H5>  Printing </H5>   In contrast to other branches of the economy, the west  German  printing industry did not come out of the recession in 1993.  The downward trend in output -- a good 4 percent lower over the  year as a whole -- gained in momentum in the second half of the  year. Nominal sales fell for the first time since the  establishment of the FRG. There was no indication of a reversal  of this trend at the end of the year. In line with the fall in  output, the number of employees also declined. Nevertheless,  the pressure exerted by costs intensified at the end of the  year. Whereas average labor unit costs in manufacturing were  below the previous year's level in the fourth quarter of 1993,  in the printing industry they grew by more than 4 percent. In  view of this, the prospects for 1994 remain unfavorable. There  were no indications of a recovery.    In eastern Germany, the situation in the printing industry  continued to improve. However, the upward trend in 1993 was  weaker than in 1992. The productivity gap was reduced once  again. In the fourth quarter, sales per employee reached  three-quarters of west German levels.</p>

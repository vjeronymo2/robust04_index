In reporting to the city people's congress, the Guangzhou  City Public Security Bureau said that it also seized 1,425 guns  of various kinds (of which 57 were designed for military use)  and 3,237 bullets last year.    Data has shown that, last year, more than 32,000 people in  Guangzhou were involved in gambling and were punished, and more  than 9,700 people were investigated for being involved in  prostitution, patronizing prostitutes, procuring prostitutes,  and harboring prostitution.    Statistics have indicated that the total value of goods and  money confiscated by the Guangzhou police in criminal cases  amounts to more than 310 million yuan.    A Guangzhou City Public Security Bureau report says that the  social order situation in Guangzhou remains quite grim. The  number of serious criminal cases is increasing steadily, the  damage resulting from organized crime is increasing day by day,  and some criminal gangs are becoming underworld societies.  Manifestations of the "vices in seven aspects" sometimes rise  and sometimes fall. Road and fire accidents occur frequently.    Wang Long, deputy director of the Guangzhou City Public  Security Bureau has revealed that the number of cases of missing  cars is increasing day by day, and such cases have become an  important part of criminal cases in Guangzhou. Last year, 965  cars and more than 6,600 motor cycles were stolen in Guangzhou.    Deputy Bureau Director Wang Long said that, this year, the  Guangzhou police will make great efforts to improve Guangzhou's  social order and will curb the momentum in the rising number of  major and serious cases, will send more policemen to patrol the  streets, will arm traffic policemen so that they can take care  of both traffic and social order, and will strengthen the  management of people from other localities and mobilize the  residents to set up "small security zones" to promote the  comprehensive improvement of social order.</p>

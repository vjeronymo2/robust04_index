			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We note that the term ``forgings'' covers a broad spectrum of products. The Summaries of Trade and Tariff Information (Schedule 6, Volume 4) identifies two basic types of forgings in its description of the product. Open-die forgings are large shapes produced by hammering or pressing heated ingots, blooms, billets, slabs, or bars on regulation press-and-hammer forging equipment with dies that are flat or slightly shaped. Closed-die or drop forgings are small- or medium-size shapes forged by using dies accurately formed to the size and shape of the desired finished product. Open-die forgings require machining to acquire the desired dimensions of the finished product. Closed-die forgings require little or no subsequent machining and are generally considered parts for import classification purposes. The forgings at issue have not been categorized as either open-die or closed-die forgings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Language of the Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The original petition describes the subject merchandise as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise covered by this petition is all tapered roller bearings, tapered rollers and other parts thereof (both finished and unfinished) including, but not limited to, single-row, multiple-row (e.g., two-, four-), and thrust bearings and self-contained bearing packages (generally pre-set, pre-sealed, and pre-greased), but only to the extent that such merchandise is not presently covered by an outstanding antidumping duty order or finding in the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the petition, Timken stressed that it had identified TSUS numbers to the best of its ability, but that it did not intend that products under other classification numbers be excluded from the scope if they fell within the description of the product in the petition. Timken argues that the language of the petition unambiguously includes Koyo's forgings, since the petition requested coverage for all unfinished TRB parts not included in the A&hyph;588&hyph;054 finding which covers TRBs four inches or less in outside diameter. Timken takes the position that the instant forgings fall under the category of unfinished parts and they should properly have been classified that way. The fact that they were not named specifically in the petition does not imply that Timken did not intend to include them. Timken states that it was impossible for it to name each item that might be considered a TRB part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Koyo, however, claims that since the petition never mentioned forgings, they were not included. In its ruling request Koyo argues that forgings are outside the scope of the order because they are ``precursor materials'' that have not yet begun the manufacturing process. Koyo claims that including forgings would be tantamount to including bearing grade steel in the scope of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's position is that the petition clearly includes unfinished TRB parts in its scope. However, the language in the petition is ambiguous with respect to whether forgings are considered unfinished parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Language of the Commerce Department's Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by the preliminary and final determinations and the order as it was published in 1987 are ``tapered roller bearings and parts thereof, currently classified under Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) item numbers 680.30 and 680.39; flange, take-up cartridge, and hanger units incorporating tapered roller bearings, currently classified under TSUS item number 661.10; and tapered roller housings (except pillow blocks) incorporating tapered rollers, with or without spindles, whether or not for automotive use, and currently classified under TSUS item number 692.32 or elsewhere in the TSUS. Products subject to the outstanding antidumping duty order covering certain tapered roller bearings from Japan (T.D. 76&hyph;227, 41 FR 34974) were not included within the scope of this investigation'' (see Antidumping Duty Order: Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan, 52 FR 37352, October 6, 1987). At issue is whether forgings should be considered unfinished parts within the scope of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timken claims that at the time of the order Koyo's imported forgings should have properly been classified as TRB parts, and that they are clearly included within the scope of the order. Koyo argues that the language of the order unambiguously excludes forgings, since at the time of the investigation Koyo was importing forgings under TSUS 606.7340 as ``non-machined steel forgings'', a provision not mentioned in the order. Koyo clearly stated in each of the first three administrative reviews that it considered its imported forgings to be outside the scope of the order, and neither the Department nor the petitioner objected. Therefore, Koyo argues that forgings have been considered outside the scope since the order was published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

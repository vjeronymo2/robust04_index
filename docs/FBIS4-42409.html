			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ettore Tamos: "The Prize Won by the Majority"] </F>   [Text] Who has the most power in Italy after the  election? One out of two Italians polled has no doubt: it is  Silvio Berlusconi, who came in ahead of Wojtyla and Agnelli, the  winners of previous competitions. Among the losers, Achille  Occhetto and Umberto Bossi received record negative ratings.    Who is the most powerful person in Italy? The responses  vary.  The opinions obtained in these polls change rapidly, just as the  mood of the voters does. "Gianni Agnelli," was the almost  monotonous response given by Italians in past years to the  Demoskopea and DOXA interviewers. There are no doubts expressed  this year either, but the name has changed. "Silvio Berlusconi"  is the response given by a chorus of voices to the SWG  [Integrated Research Services] of Trieste] interviewers in the  poll conducted for IL MONDO.    Was it because of the election results? Was it because of  Berlusconi's showmanship as a politician and because he holds  the office of prime minister? Surveys of public opinion have  always been useful primarily for understanding the basic  trends--the significant shifts--in public opinion, irrespective  of the quantitative data, which may have been influenced by  various factors. It was then discovered that the transition from  the First to the Second Republic has also made politics a  powerful factor. Moreover, the fact that for the first time in  our history the head of government is also one of the nation's  leading entrepreneurs and the owner of a large segment of the  media serves to explain why one out of every two Italians (49.6  percent) in the sample responded to the question, "Which public  figure has the most power in Italy today?" by assigning primacy  to the TV mogul.    Power, his adversaries say, to condition public opinion even  through the medium of public opinion research--of surveys that  bombard the public with Forza Italia's siren song and thereby  help to create a positive halo around Berlusconi. According to  this theory, even a public opinion poll is in effect a political  spot [preceding word in English].    The fact that the owner of Fininvest is the leader  [preceding  word in English] who possesses the greatest communications  skills is acknowledged even by his severest critics. These  critics, however, might be surprised to read a poll--similar to  IL MONDO's poll--that was published by OGGI in 1988, at a time  when Berlusconi was certainly less well-known and therefore  merely a big businessman. In the OGGI poll, 34 percent voted for  Agnelli; 20 percent for Berlusconi; 15 percent for Pope Wojtyla;  and 10 percent for Bettino Craxi (the highest-rated politician),  who came in ahead of Ciriaco De Mita, 7 percent; Francesco  Cossiga, 4 percent; Giovanni Spadolini, 2 percent; and Nilde  Iotti, 1 percent. These results were wiped out by the bribery  scandal and by the new politics, except that the top three  votegetters merely changed places.  <H5>  But the Seniors Remain Faithful to the Polish Pope </H5>   Here is the latest update: Berlusconi, way out in front with  49.6 percent; second, Pope Karol Wojtyla with 19.7 percent;  third, Agnelli with 7.4 percent. President of the Republic Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro came in fourth with 7 percent--a much higher  rating than that received by his predecessor in Palazzo  Quirinale, Francesco Cossiga. Fifth place (3.3 percent) went to  a distinct newcomer, someone who could defeat anyone in the city  [preceding word in English] of Milan and who is becoming  increasingly better known even outside his profession: Enrico  Cuccia, distinguished president of Mediobanca, the financial  institution that has brought into its orbit the two big IRI  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] banks that were  privatized--Comit [Italian Commercial Bank] and Credit [Italian  Credit Bank].    The power attributed to the judiciary, however, proved to be  illusory. Despite the fact that the Clean Hands pool [previous  word in English] played a significant role in diluting the  previous rankings of the powerful, the chief public prosecutor  for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borrelli--who figured prominently  in the TV reports of recent weeks--came in only sixth with a 3.2  percent approval rating, which was slightly lower than that of  Cuccia and slightly higher than that of Occhetto, the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] secretary who has come under fire  since the election defeat of the progressive alignment.  Occhetto, however, did come in far ahead of Northern League  leader Umberto Bossi (despite his theatrical performance at the  negotiating table, Bossi's rating failed to rise). And Deputy  Public Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, the judge most beloved by  the Italian people, did very poorly and was relegated--together  with Craxi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini--to the  small group of "others," which received a marginal rating of 0.8  percent.    In this connection it should be pointed out that the poll  was  conducted by telephone using a sample that consisted of 600  adults--a sample that although representative in terms of age,  geographic area, and vocation did reflect various tendencies.  For example, Berlusconi received a majority of the votes of  young people; residents of the northeast; students; and  white-collar workers of the private sector. On the other hand,  support for the Pope increased in proportion to the increase in  the age of the person interviewed, especially among pensioners  and the residents of the south and the islands.  <H5>  Diminished Role of the Federated Labor Unions and the PDS </H5>   It is futile to look for confirmation of this statistical  distribution in reality. Which public figure has undergone a  decline in influence in Italy? Game, set, and match went in this  case to Occhetto, who was far in front with 41.2 percent of the  responses, followed by Bossi with 16.7 percent and Head of State  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with 9.3 percent. Also losing influence,  albeit to a lesser extent, were Agnelli (6.9 percent of the  responses), followed by Wojtyla, Borrelli, Berlusconi, Cuccia,  and Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio.    The Clean Hands pool got its revenge when the most powerful  organizations were ranked rather than the most powerful public  figures. The Milan judges received 13.4 percent for third place,  behind Forza Italia in second place--formerly occupied by the DC  [Christian Democratic Party]--with 16 percent (the coalition of  Forza Italia, Lega Nord and the National Alliance took fourth  place with 11.4 percent) and most notably behind the Mafia,  which took first place with 23.9 percent. The Vatican came in  only fifth, with 7.1 percent. Mediobanca made its debut in sixth  place with 5.8 percent, well ahead of the Bank of Italy (3.8  percent) and Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian  Industry] (3.4 percent). The labor unions (CGIL-CISL-UIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor-Italian Confederation of  Trade Unions-Italian Federation of Trade Unions] (3.3 percent),  the League (1.6 percent), and the PDS (0.9 percent) came in last  but came in first in the follow-up questionnaire concerning the  organizations that have lost influence in Italy, Here, the  results of this questionnaire were predictable but not their  dimensions, for the responses indicated a dramatic loss of  influence by the CGIL-CISL-UIL (29.4 percent of the responses),  by the PDS (20.1 percent), and even by the Mafia (12.4  percent)--an indication that the action of the judiciary,  together with the phenomenon of the penitents, are cause for  hope that the phenomenon of the Mafia can be contained. Even  League lost influence, according to the poll.    Agnelli's revenge, however, derives from a homogeneous  sample  of 100 entrepreneurs and managers who are qualified to give  informed answers to a specific question, i.e., Which public  figure possesses the greatest economic power in Italy today?  Businessmen in particular felt sure they knew, and gave the  president of FIAT 36.1 percent of their votes. Enrico Cuccia's  reputation, however, has been rising sharply ever since the most  recent operations in which his Mediobanca was at the center of  the negotiations and was the only merchant banking [preceding  two words in English] group capable of managing companies that  were in crisis as well as managing the restructuration of  holding companies, acquisitions carried out in foreign  countries, and privatizations. This great director of Italian  finance obtained 33.7 percent of the votes, mostly from  managers. The current prime minister could do no better than  third (26.5 percent), for Berlusconi is considered to be less of  a "heavyweight" for the purposes of this target [preceding word  in English]. Not much was left for Confindustria President Luigi  Abete, who received only 1.2 percent of the votes.</p>

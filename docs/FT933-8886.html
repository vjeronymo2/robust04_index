			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Resignation threat rejected by PLO THE Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday rejected the resignations of three Palestinian peace negotiators from the Israeli-occupied territories. It also said, in a concession to the three who were upset about a lack of consultation by the PLO, that they would be included with four fellow negotiators in a PLO leadership committee directing peace talks with Israel. The move came after Palestinian officials in Tunis said the PLO had come under pressure from Arab governments, including Saudi Arabia, to resolve the issue quickly and not let the three negotiators, the more moderate members of the team, resign. The US and Russia, co-sponsors of Arab-Israeli peace talks, also said yesterday they had invited all sides to resume negotiations in Washington at the end of this month. Arriving in Amman in transit, Mr Husseini said: 'It was a serious matter, but in the end it was in the same house between the same people and we reached together a new conclusion which can really serve our interest.' The appointments of seven Palestinian negotiators to the PLO leadership committee marks the first time members of the Palestinian team from inside the territories have been given official PLO posts and will further test Israeli's ban on direct talks with the PLO. Palestinian participants in the talks said Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, had successfully exploited the resignation threat by postponing a final decision for several days. They said his almost single purpose was to force Israel to realise it must open a direct dialogue with the PLO to make progress in peace talks. By letting the resignation threat drag on, Mr Arafat faced Israeli politicians with the prospect of a Palestinian peace team stripped of its moderates and led by hardliners such as Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi.</p>

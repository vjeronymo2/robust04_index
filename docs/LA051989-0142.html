			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMEDY REVIEW;  </P> <P> OBSERVATIONS ON CHILDHOOD SET THE PACE FOR A NIGHT OF LAUGHTER  </P> <P> One of the most shocking discoveries for neophyte comedy fans -- right up there  with getting the crushing news about the Easter Bunny -- is learning that most  headliner-level comedians recite the exact same jokes, often in the exact same  order, every night.  </P> <P> Beyond that, even if they do change jokes, many comedians never really improve  that much. Some comedians even get worse over the years, done in by road  fatigue, diminished inspiration, their own excesses or the caprices of the  business.  </P> <P> So it's particularly refreshing to run into someone like Michael Pace, who's at  the Laff Stop in Newport Beach through Sunday. He's been performing for a  number of years and has worked locally on several occasions -- and each time,  he appears to have improved a bit more.  </P> <P> Not that his show Wednesday was without shortcomings: His 50-minute set  probably would have been better as a tight, focused 40. He was victimized  briefly by some overly chatty audience members and, perhaps not coincidentally,  he lost his rhythm a few times.  </P> <P> At the same time, he continued to demonstrate enormous potential Wednesday.  He's eminently engaging -- an expressive, natural performer. Even when his  material is less than stellar or sophisticated, he delivers it extremely well.  </P> <P> This puts him way ahead of the game, especially for the future: Material can be  improved, while natural ability, obviously, is either there or it's not.  </P> <P> And anyway, much of Pace's material is already fine. He tends to emphasize  observations about various phases of childhood, often summoning key details  with a Seinfeldesque flair.  </P> <P> A few of his bits addressed the typical adolescent's extreme self-absorption  and obsession with what other people think. "Puberty's a very, very tough time,  'cause you don't really know where you are sexually," he said. "You go to the  movie with your buddy (and) you sit like three seats apart so no one thinks  you're a 'homo.' "  </P> <P> He then pointed out that this kind of concern can kick in much younger, for  instance, when you're bringing your lunch to grade school: "You had to be real  careful about the kind of desserts you ate when you were a kid," he recalled,  adding that cupcakes or Twinkies were OK. But one day his Mom sent some of  those pink Sno-Balls. "I had to run to the bathroom to hide and eat them.  'They'll think I'm a (sissy) if they see me eating this thing.' "  </P> <P> Sometimes, the strength of Pace's pieces were as much visual as verbal. He  punctuated many jokes with some delightful facial expressions -- and he can do  some amazing things with his eyes.  </P> <P> In a segment about Easter, he first described the nonstop candy-eating. Then he  said, "And your little brother's working those malted milk-egg things in the  corner; he's got grass hanging out of his mouth," which he acted out,  portraying a heavy-lidded kid in the throes of a sugar overdose.  </P> <P> Similarly, he neatly evoked the struggle of a youngster on a diving board  trying desperately to get his mother to watch him dive, while the mother  happens to be paying no attention: "Mommy . . . Mommy . . . Mommy! Mommy! Mommy  look!"  </P> <P> While such childhood remembrances and observations are Pace's specialty and  strength, he laced his act with a hodgepodge of other kinds of material.  </P> <P> In the midst of some topical stuff, he asked, "Is it just me, or does (Barbara  Bush) look like the guy on the Quaker Oatmeal box?"  </P> <P> Later, he suggested the reason that discipline may be fleeting for someone who  decides to lay off booze and get in shape: ". . . work out really hard, wake up  the next morning, feel like somebody beat you with a meat tenderizer (and  think), 'Heck, I can drink and feel this (lousy)."  </P> <P> And when he moved into the inevitable section on flying (stand-up's de rigueur  topic), he at least put a different spin on it by zeroing in on pilots at both  ends of the age spectrum. The first premise: that pilots seem to be getting  younger and younger. On one flight, Pace recalled, they occasionally would say,  "Radical air pocket, dude."  </P> <P> On another flight, there was an announcement: "Ladies and gentlemen, Capt.  Johnson will be retiring at the end of this flight." A worried Pace imagined  the captain in the cockpit doing shots of Jack Daniels, executing aerial spins,  and gloating: "What are they going to do -- fire me?"  </P> <P> We don't know what kind of career Capt. Johnson had, but at this rate, we're  expecting big things from Michael Pace.  </P> <P>  Michael Pace and impressionist Rich Natole are at the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E.  Bristol St., Newport Beach, through Sunday. Show times: 8, 10 and 11:45 p.m.  Friday and Saturday; 8:30 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $6-9. Information: (714)  852-8762.  </P> <P> </P></p>

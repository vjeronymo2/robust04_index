			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Luis Ayllon report: "Government Makes New Credit for </F> Moscow Conditional on Gradual Repayment of Current Debt"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- The Spanish Government is prepared to  grant the Russian Government new credit lines provided that  Moscow begins to repay the debt of over 60 billion pesetas that  it owes Spain, according to government sources. The government  envisages converting into new credits 425 million hitherto  unpaid dollars, as they are paid, and adding another $200  million on certain terms.    Although the government was initially reluctant to grant  Russia new credit facilities during President Boris Yeltsin's  visit to Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has finally  acceded to the wishes of the Russian authorities, who do not  wish to return to their country empty-handed and without  something to show Spain's political support for the current  leaders.    Late on Friday [15 April], ABC has learned, the Spanish  negotiators reached an agreement with the Russian delegation to  mobilize over the next four years, through 1997, around $925  million (around 130 billion pesetas), aimed at boosting economic  relations between the two countries and Russia's development.    The accord will take shape today, when an agreement on  economic and trading cooperation between the two countries is  signed, but with a clause stating that all this will be done  "while safeguarding the two sides' economic interests."  Translated into everyday language, this means that Spain will  not begin to put a single peseta more into Russian hands unless  Russia has previously started to repay its debt, which now  exceeds 60 billion pesetas.    In fact, the government has agreed with Yeltsin to convert  into a new trade credit the unpaid $425 million, which belonged  to the line of finance granted by Gonzalez to Gorbachev in 1991  and inherited by the Russian Federation. So if the Russians  repay $50 million this year, for instance, Spain will grant a  credit to that amount.    But, in addition, as soon as repayments begin to be made,  the  government will start to supply another $100 million ($50  million short-term and $50 million medium- and long-term  credits), and if the Russians secure financing on international  markets for Spanish enterprises' projects in Russia, they could  obtain up to another $100 million from Spain.    It is expected that the remainder, up to the total of $925  million -- that is $300 million -- will be contributed by  private enterprises.    Gonzalez, who visited Yeltsin for an hour and a half at the  El Pardo Palace yesterday and who will sign the Treaty of  Friendship and Cooperation between Spain and Russia with him  today, wished in this way to give a token of confidence in and  support for the Russian president at a time when he is  experiencing a difficult internal situation because of the  economic crisis and the pressure which Communists and  ultranationalists are exerting on him.

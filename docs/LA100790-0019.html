			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> *** AC/DC "The Razor's Edge" Atco  </P> <P> This Australian band has been accused of making the same album over and over  since it began in the mid-'70s, thumping assemblages of pentatonic power chords  and leering innuendo -- a style so distinctive that you can always recognize an  AC/DC tune on the radio.  </P> <P> It's rock 'n' roll stripped to its absolute basics of noise, beat and schoolboy  aggression -- any high school dude with a guitar can reproduce any AC/DC riff.  </P> <P> The group's last few albums have sold well, but nowhere near the  umpteen-million copies they routinely sold between 1979 and 1982. AC/DC's  rotation on hard-rock stations is probably nearly as high as Led Zep's, but  what's played is mostly 10 years old.  </P> <P> This time out, the band hired hot Aerosmith/Bon Jovi producer Bruce Fairburn,  and the album still rocks like AC/DC, but a rather slick version thereof.  </P> <P> AC/DC's trademark gritty guitars are softened up; studio swooshing fills the  famous empty space between power chords; vocalist Brian Johnson actually tries  to sing instead of yelp like a wolverine. The tinge of mainstream rock may make  longtime fans scream, but "Razor's Edge" is probably AC/DC's best album since  1985's "Fly on the Wall." JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "PDS -- `Test Case' for the </F> Office for the Protection of the Constitution"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- According to the assessment of  the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, "extreme-left  positions" are being taken in the successor party of the  Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS], and "lively contacts" with  revolutionary-Marxist organizations are being maintained. This  particularly applies to the "Communist Platform" (KPF), which  was founded within the PDS with its explicit approval and whose  activists openly declare themselves in favor of the  "revolutionary idea of the socialist alternative." According to  the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the  Marxist-Leninist KPF regards itself as a bridge to other  communist groups and it maintains close and regular contacts,  particularly with the German Communist Party [DKP] and the  Communist Party of Germany [KPD]. Thus, this association has to  be assessed as a "test case" for the Office for the Protection  of the Constitution.    In an interview with the DKP newspaper UNSERE ZEIT, PDS  Chairman Lothar Bisky explains the PDS view on cooperation with  communists in the election campaigns as follows: "A decision  that communists are not to be put on PDS lists has not been  made. I would also regard it as a loss."    According to the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, the PDS is also not "afraid of coming into  contact" with violent extremists. As proof, the 1993 report of  the Office for the Protection of the Constitution quotes from  the 17th edition of the PDS member magazine DISPUT, which says,  among other things, the following: "The PDS has a good position  in the scientific analysis of the fascist development.  Consistently, however, it will have to bank far more on  extraparliamentary actions and self-help. It would be stupid to  leave autonomous groups alone in actions that would be worth  supporting, for example, if the `concrete prevention of Nazi  meetings' is at issue." PDS members also participated in a  congress of leftist groups in Hamburg to which members of the  terrorist scene had also come.    According to the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution, PDS members also participated in the  "Socialist-Communist Action Unit," which is operated by the KPD  and whose objective is the founding of a "uniform Communist  Party of Germany."</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore Estates ahead 36% after fall in property provisions FROGMORE ESTATES, the property company, yesterday announced a 36 per cent pre-tax profits increase, from Pounds 7.11m to Pounds 9.7m, in the year to June 30. With turnover down at Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 47.6m), the pre-tax rise was struck after a sharp fall to Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 2.26m) in provisions needed to reduce the cost of trading properties, litigation costs of Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 525,000) over the 1986 acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH, and interest charges lower at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 3.2m). Breaking out the pre-tax figure further, profits on ordinary activities, including rents and trading, more than doubled from Pounds 4m to Pounds 9.89m, while losses from the sale of investment properties amounted to Pounds 195,000 (profits Pounds 3.1m). Mr Dennis Cope, chairman, said that the advance in the contracted rent roll, from Pounds 12.9m to Pounds 18.2m, came mainly from acquisitions, rent reviews and new lettings. Year-end borrowings totalled Pounds 45.8m, giving gearing of 28 per cent: this contrasted with Pounds 7m at the end of December. However, Mr Cope said: 'The board will continue to proceed with extreme caution in this unprecedented financial turmoil'. The company continued to expand its joint venture housing activity north of London and within the M25 semi-circle with housing companies Fairview and Rialto as partners. Profits of Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 1.8m) were made and 395 (160) dwellings sold, mainly to first-time buyers. The final dividend is lifted by 1p to 11.6p, giving a total of 15p (13.8p), payable from earnings on ordinary activities of 16.4p (7.2p).</p>

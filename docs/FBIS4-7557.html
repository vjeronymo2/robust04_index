			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 31 Mar (MTI) -- Led by Prime Ministers  Peter Boross and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Hungarian-Russian plenary  talks were held in the parliament on Thursday.    Hungary was represented by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky,  International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar,  Transportation Minister Gyorgy Schamschula, and Minister of  Industry and Trade Janos Latorcai.    The Russian negotiating group included Telecommunications  Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Foreign Economics Minister Oleg  Davidov, Nuclear Energy Minister Vitaly Mikhaylov, Deputy  Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov, and Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergei Krilov.    Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman told the  press that the talks focussed mainly on bilateral economic  cooperation. The two prime ministers agreed that unresolved  issues outstanding from the past should be quickly settled,  including Russia's debt to Hungary, so that efforts can be  concentrated on strengthening business ties.    Herman said the $800-900 million which Russia owes Hungary  could be repayed through the participation of Hungarian  companies in Russian privatization, the use of non-commercial  services, or machine deliveries. The possibility of further  arms purchases was also raised, though Hungary would prefer  modern market methods of debt repayment which promote economic  relations.    Ministry leaders are to spend the next day-and-a-half  discussing debt settlement. It is hoped that an agreement on  this issue will be signed during Chernomyrdin's visit.    The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction that  bilateral trade has stopped declining and conditions have been  created for an increase in the near future.    Chernomyrdin said Moscow hopes Hungary will move ahead from  the 7th place it presently takes among Russia's trading  partners. Boross believes Hungary could mainly increase its  exports of farm and food products, medicines and buses.    Regarding the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, Chernomyrdin  said that while the former parliament was unable to approve it,  there is now a good chance for ratification.    Touching on the South Slav crisis, the Russian prime  minister  stressed that Moscow will do all it can for a peaceful  settlement as soon as possible, which he noted was also in  Hungary's best interest.    The two heads of government voiced agreement that political  relations are settled and progressing fairly well between the  two countries.</p>

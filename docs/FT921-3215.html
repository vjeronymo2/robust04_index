			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Observer: Stolen wheels Travel around west Germany and you will find plenty of people who wish the wall between the two Germanies had never come down. This not simply because they, like everyone else, object to paying higher taxes to finance reunification. The reason is that they have just had their car stolen. The wall's removal has apparently led to a massive increase in car theft in the west of Germany. According to Allianz, the Munich-based insurance company, organised gangs are behind a 50 per cent increase in stolen cars last year. Most of the cars go to eastern Europe and the recovery rate is extremely low. Allianz says that as many as 60,000 stolen vehicles were shipped out from Germany to Poland alone last year, of which only 1,700 were recovered by the police. The cars are stolen to order and can be delivered within 24 hours, the insurance company recounts. It seems that the clients are discerning: most of the stolen cars are large luxury BMWs and Mercedes and nobody is bothering to steal the Trabants which still clutter East Germany's roads.</p>

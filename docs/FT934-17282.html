			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Redland cuts brick stocks MR ROBERT NAPIER, chairman of Redland, one of Britain's largest producers of building materials, said that the group reduced its UK brick stocks by 60m in the first half. The group now had stocks equivalent to two months supply, compared with an industry average of four months. Overall, UK brick stocks stand at about the 1bn level, but Redland expects demand to increase by about 6 per cent or 7 per cent next year fuelled by the expected recovery in housebuilding. Brick prices have fallen by between 20 per cent and 25 per cent from their peak. However, Redland said engineering bricks were now showing slight price increase and prices for facing bricks were strong. Redland, like most other large brick producers, has cut its capacity dramatically during the recession. The Redland and Steetley brick businesses have been fully integrated and capacity has been cut by some 200m bricks.</p>

The opposition insisted that Gandhi quit after  the government auditor and comptroller general pointed out serious lapses in  selecting Swedish Bofors artillery in a 1986 contract worth $1.3 billion. The  opposition forced adjournments in both the lower and upper house by stalling  scheduled business. The Bofors scandal last year seriously dented Gandhi's  popularity following widespread allegations that commissions were paid to  middlemen despite an agreement with the Swedish company that no agents would be  used.  </P></p>

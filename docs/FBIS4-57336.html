			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Solidarity Party today agreed to support the  proposed national consensus promoted by President-elect Ernesto  Perez Balladares. Perez Balladares on Monday attended a news  conference held by Solidarity Party members and headed by party  president Samuel Lewis Galindo during which the party publicly  announced its decision to support the proposed national  consensus in view of the wise steps being taken by Dr. Perez  Balladares.    [Begin recording] [Lewis] We met with the party board of  directors and with our candidates -- pardon me -- with our  legislators and agreed to support Dr. Perez Balladares' endeavor  to form a government that represents the entire nation. We are  offering him this political support today, and we hope he can  complete his cabinet in a way that he will achieve what the  Panamanians want. Panamanians want unity. They want to leave  behind rancor, hate, and revenge and realize that this country  belongs to everyone. Only by working together can we meet the  challenges of the future. Therefore, Dr. Perez Balladares, I am  very pleased to offer you our support.    [Perez Balladares] Thank you very much. [end recording]    For his part, Dr. Perez Balladares said the Solidarity  Party's decision exemplifies the country's political forces  because they are joining a nonpartisan effort that is nationally  oriented, striving to achieve in the next five years all the  national objectives shared by Panamanians.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] For us it obviously  signifies extraordinary support to have this support -- pardon  the redundancy -- from the Solidarity Party because it also  means we will have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. With  that legislative majority, without denying the participation of  other forces that will also have their views, we can enact many  of the laws needed to spell out this new relationship for  progress, peace, cooperation, and unity among all Panamanians.  It is a significant step by the Solidarity Party. We applaud  it and hope it serves as an example for other political parties  so we can join forces for the sake of the fatherland, and for  the good of the humble and the poverty-stricken. From now until  1999, we are under the same tent, which is the fatherland. [end  recording]    The president-elect then met privately with Gabriel Lewis  Galindo, future foreign minister, and with Apostolic Nuncio  Osvaldo Padilla. Afterward, in the office of Magistrate  President Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, Dr. Ernesto Perez  Balladares, Tomas Altamirano Duque, and Felipe Virzi, the  president and first and second vice presidents, respectively,  received their credentials as members of the United People  alliance slate which won the elections.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (6): The fax of life in rural Oxfordshire - Small Company Application / Stonesfield Telecottage STONE walls along the road to Stonesfield mark the estate boundary of Blenheim Palace, but the route cuts straight through miles of uninhabited countryside before it arrives at a very different set of buildings. This is Stonesfield, an unpretentious village whose character comes not from postcard cosiness, but from steep tiled roofs and houses set at odd angles to one another and to the road which curls around them at impossible angles. Stonesfield's identity reflects its geological siting - on a rock which provided the slates for all the Oxford colleges and yielded the first discovery of a dinosaur bones in the 1880s. In the 1990s, Stonesfield has its fair share of re-vamped barns and baronial executive homes on the outskirts, but it remains a working village, not a dormitory, despite redundancies at Cowley which have devastated the local economy. Friends Close is in the centre, a new cluster of open, airy houses reminiscent of a Scandinavian style. Above, on a tree, a small sign 'Stonesfield Telecottage' leads visitors up some garden steps which, like the road, wind up and and around and finally down, into an airy room where sits Kathy Coonerty, at an Apple Macintosh, and Tony Crofts, at a desk loaded with papers. Kathy, manager of the office, is typesetting magazine copy on the Apple IICx. As well as being the manager, accountant and hub of the office, she earns much of the revenue by typing. She has one-off jobs, such as a recently-completed student thesis; regular clients including a local novelist, Jenny Hinton; and she does typesetting and pagemaking for a variety of newsletters. A new customer leaves with 10p worth of photocopying. Howard Bond walked from his home to the telecottage to copy a letter from the BBC. 'I read about this service in the local news sheet, the Slate,' he explains. 'Now I know it's here I'll use it again.' The next customer is on the telephone: an inquiry from a Bosnian who wants to enrol on a correspondence course for Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL). This is another business based at the telecottage, run by Jim Wingate, who develops courseware and writes books for Intered in Vienna. Tony Crofts deals with the inquiry and adds another letter to the pile which Kathy will take with her to the post office when she leaves for the day. The office also hosts a drama group and other local afternoon activities. Although Kathy only works 12 hours a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the door is always open. The telecottage itself is built on the back of Crofts' higgledy-piggledy house, all gables and steps. Built originally as a self-contained bachelor flat, with hand-made floor tiles and a loft-bed reached by a ladder, it was destined to evolve into a study, office and then telecottage, all part of Croft's campaign to bring affordable housing, owned and run at community level, to Stonesfield. Kathy joined Crofts initially as a secretary, having seen an advertisement in the Slate. She became the manager when the telecottage started in April 1989. She had relocated in Stonesfield for her husband's work, and her experience made her an ideal candidate for the job. She had evaluated various word processing packages from their earliest days, when employed at Thames Polytechnic and the Borough of Lewisham, and had also been involved in training. 'Once you got over the initial fear, people loved using the system' she says, recalling that those initially terrifed of computers often became the most effective users, irrespective of age. Now she works on the Macintosh and has added magazine layout to her skills, as well as doing occasional training. She is self-employed and paid by the hour. The Mac was chosen for ease of use and its power in design jobs such as typesetting and pagemaking. Its only disadvantage is that most women 'returners' wish to learn skills on DOS-based computers. Crofts is himself a TEFL trainer and agricultural journalist specialising in environmental and rural matters. He charges no rent to the telecottage business, but instead uses its facilities for his own work and deals with all incoming inquiries outside Kathy's hours. His wife, Randi Berild, an architect from Norway, has her own studio in a gabled room in the main part of the house. The couple take it in turns to work and share the childcare of their three-year-old son. As well as Jim Wingate, Tony Crofts and Randi Berild, there are nine other local businesses in the same street. There are three business consultants (including one who is only resident at weekends), a woman who manufactures custom-designed jogging suits, a couple who arrange fine-art holiday tours, a graphic designer and another freelance architect. All use the telecottage facilities on an occasional basis. Others, still struggling to find more conventional employment, keep their CVs on the Macintosh and Kathy updates them for each new job application. The local colour is a necessary accompaniment to understanding the function of the Stonesfield telecottage and the important part it plays both for local businesses and, as the hub of a campaign for housing provided by the community, for the community. No telecottage is 'typical' but Stonesfield is less remote than many. The village, a few miles from Oxford and within easy reach of the extended M40, has suffered similar problems to many other picturesque places, as wealthy middle-class incomers knock together small terraces to make spacious ranches. House prices, even in the slump, have risen well above what local people can afford, particularly the young couples and single people who would not even merit one point on the council housing list. Tony Croft's involvement with local housing has its roots in his job as a rural journalist. He moved to Stonesfield in 1976 and subsequently worked for British Farmer and Stockbreeder, an IPC (now Reed) publication based in Sutton, Surrey. Remarkably, he persuaded IPC to allow him to do 'distance working' because he had to be rurally-based, and it made economic sense to visit Sutton only once weekly. He now runs the newsletter for RURAL (Responsible Uses of Resources in Agriculture and on the Land), the countryside information policy group. He was further inspired by the 'father of the telecottage movement', the late Henning Albrechtsen. On his way to Leningrad in 1988 he visited the telecottage that Albrechtsen, a former UN interpreter and oil executive, had set up above a supermarket in a remote corner of north Sweden, Vemdalen. This centre provides the same quality of work as can be found in central Stockholm, but to remote business clients, and at comparable rates. There are now 80 such centres thriving all over Scandinavia. When the pub next door, the Boot, was closed and sold for a house conversion, Crofts wanted to see its adjoining land and car park put to good, community-based use. 'Planning should be done at parish level. I believe in devolution to community level. Houses should be built on the basis of need, not profitability.' The six dwellings in Friends Close are the result (see panel) and the telecottage is an important contributor to funds. He sees no point in letting prime land go to developers who build dwellings inappropriate to local needs, pocket the profit and put nothing back into the community. 'There's a tremendous potential for local democracy currently not being put to use by the system,' he says. 'Decisions made in higher tiers of government, usually urban-based, are often wide of the mark.' Crofts' idealism is matched by business sense and a long-term view. A second housing scheme of five houses is taking shape in the centre of the village, on a prime site which once housed the Rose and Crown pub and the old village school playground. It has been funded by Mercury Provident, the Ecology Building Society, county and district council grants, the Central Telethon Trust, the Marlborough Charitable Trust, and two other charities. There are also a number of private supporters who have invested their money as debenture loans, secured on some of the property over 12 years at a fixed 10 per cent interest. This guarantees a steady interest, and enables SCT to draw realistic cash flows. This method has been very successful, raising Pounds 60,000 in two months from an advertisement in the Friend, a Quaker publication. Crofts is now looking at a third project, funded the same way. This would provide workspace for small businesses and a new home for the telecottage, providing central services for everyone. In an ideal world, the post office would be on the same site and be part of the mutually supportive local network. 'A little nest of complementary activities,' Crofts calls it. The rural idyll is no mere dream and, he suggests, is achievable with local support and understanding: 'West Oxfordshire District Council has been wonderful - they have backed promising projects. Local supporters have created a climate where things can happen.'</p>

Amidst the new spate of Afghan fightings, the Geneva-based  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday  announced that the recent whirlwind of clashes could beset the  four neighbors of Afghanistan--especially Iran and  Pakistan--with an influx of refugees.    A point worthy of consideration meantime is that the present  war in Afghanistan is neither ethnic nor religious nor national:  It is merely a power struggle that pitifully has not only  tarnished the 13-year-long struggle of the Afghan people but has  also posed a serious peril to the prestige of the global Islamic  movement.    Developments in Afghanistan definitely bear close  relationship with Iran's national security. Kabul's devastating  and ruinous war will pose danger for Iran both in terms of its  ideological objectives and national interests.    Pitifully, however, the Iranian Foreign Ministry sluggishly  carried out just one not-so-successful move of establishing a  several-hour-long cease-fire in Kabul.    Aptly, the Foreign Ministry could have launched an extensive  diplomatic overture by contacting the involved sides, as well as  Pakistan, some regional countries, and especially the  Organization of the Islamic Conference (ICO) to preclude the  spread and perpetuation of the Afghan genocide. This diplomatic  sluggishness is in no way justifiable.    Meantime, the self-restraint so far exercised by the  Afghanistan Islamic Unity Party [Hezb-e Wahdat] in avoiding  involvement in the recent fightings is laudable.    Hopefully, this self-restraint will be kept up, and the said  party will assume the role of mediator as the best stance that  could be adopted. In principle, the former clashes that were  flared by some groups with this party actually did not augur  well for the future of Afghanistan, producing no positive  results.</p>

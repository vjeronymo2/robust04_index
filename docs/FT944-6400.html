			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Belgium hit by strikes Belgian flights and train services were paralysed yesterday by a 24-hour strike over privatisation which affected public service companies. The national airline, Sabena, said strike action by air traffic controllers early yesterday and firemen later in the day grounded flights at Zaventem national airport. Some European flights were diverted to regional airports, while some long-haul international flights left from Luxembourg with passengers travelling by bus to the Grand Duchy. The strike, which is also hitting telephone and postal services, was called by unions to protest about the reorganisation of the companies, which they fear will involve job losses and greater job insecurity. Among the four public companies involved in the strike, the telephone company Belgacom is the first due to be partly privatised, possibly in 1995, but plans to sell up to 50 per cent of the company have been held up by a reported dispute among top management and rows in parliament.</p>

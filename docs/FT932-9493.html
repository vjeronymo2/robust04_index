			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Murdoch's Fox in cable TV deal FOX, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, and Tele-Communications, the largest US cable television operator, are to create a cable television service. The agreement guaranteed Fox slots on cable systems serving TCI's 10m customers while providing the cable operator with good programming, analysts said yesterday. Mr Murdoch said he expected the channel to be profitable in about 2 1/2 years, 'depending on our success in rolling it out'. He said the service needed to reach 40m homes to break even. The service is expected to be launched between early October and the end of January. Mr Christopher Dixon, an analyst with securities house PaineWebber, said the arrangement was the first in what could be a variety of joint ventures in response to complex new regulations from the Federal Communications Commission. As part of the arrangement, which is for five years and subject to execution of final documents, Fox will allow TCI to retransmit Fox-owned and operated stations' broadcast signals. TCI will pay Fox Dollars 0.25 per subscriber and Fox will pay its affiliate stations Dollars 0.075 out of each Dollars 0.25. Mr Murdoch said affiliates could also choose to receive Dollars 0.05 per subscriber plus a small amount of the equity of the new channel. He said 25 per cent of the equity was being reserved for the affiliates. TCI is not taking an equity position. Fox was still negotiating with the affiliates over the arrangement and talks were going well, Mr Murdoch said. Mr John Malone, TCI president, said: 'The agreement redefines the relationship between broadcasters and cable operators.' Fox has agreed to provide some original programming for the new channel, which will show mainly entertainment.</p>

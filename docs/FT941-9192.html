			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Du Pont closure costs 112 jobs Du Pont, the US-owned chemicals and energy company, yesterday announced a plant closure with the loss of 112 jobs, and the sale of another smaller unit. The plant to be closed was bought from ICI in an international asset-swap deal last July. Du Pont said the compounding plant at Billingham, Cleveland, which makes nylon-based plastics, was being closed because of the tough economic environment. Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the TGWU general union which represents most of the workers who lost their jobs, attacked both Du Pont and ICI and said he felt a sense of betrayal over the closure. The 112 job losses are the second tranche announced by Du Pont in plants acquired when it took over ICI's European-based nylon business in return for its own US acrylics business, plus about Pounds 235m. Du Pont also said it had agreed to sell the Verton nylon long-fibre compound business, also at Billingham, to LNP Plastics Nederland BV</p>

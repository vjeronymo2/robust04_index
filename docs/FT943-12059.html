			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Life insurers to ease policy on HIV queries: Initial fears about commercial risk unfounded UK life insurers are to stop asking potential clients whether they have been tested for the HIV virus, which causes Aids, in an admission that the industry's initial fears about the commercial risk from the condition have proved unfounded. Insurers in future will ask only whether an applicant has received a positive test result or undergone treatment. Under current practice, an applicant who admits having been tested is often refused a policy or offered one only at a higher premium, even if the test result was negative. This reflects the industry's assumption that only people who considered themselves 'high-risk' sought such tests. But the Association of British Insurers said yesterday that testing for HIV had become much more common over the past few years, both for screening purposes and personal reassurance. Mr Tony Baker, ABI deputy director-general, said insurance companies had decided it was 'no longer appropriate or necessary' to ask applicants for new life insurance policies to say if they had had a negative test, although insurers would need to know if a test result was positive or treatment had been received. Since 1987, when the current question was introduced on to application forms, British insurers have paid out more than Pounds 50m for deaths where HIV or Aids is thought to have been a factor. This is considerably less than the industry had expected. Although the number of people annually diagnosed with Aids is still rising, the number of reported deaths caused by the condition has fallen for the past couple of years. This reflects improvements in the treatments available, increasing people's chances of surviving longer. The ABI said it had asked its members to bring in the change as quickly as possible, which would in most cases be when questionnaires were reprinted. Mr Peter Roth, chairman of the insurance working party of the Aids charity, the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the change was 'long overdue and removes concerns about mortgages and insurance that deterred many people from seeking an HIV test'. Mr Ivan Massow, an independent financial adviser who has written Britain's first finance guide aimed at gay people, said the change could mean that life insurers would gain more information about their customers. He said the current question had driven HIV/Aids testing 'underground', with people seeking tests anonymously from clinics instead of from their GPs. This gave insurers no way of cross-checking the answer. Under the new rule, if the stigma attached to testing disappeared, more people would seek tests from GPs, who would ask them about their sexuality and number of sexual partners. That information would then be available to life companies even if the applicant had tested negative.</p>

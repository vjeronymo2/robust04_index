			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ROW WITH BRITAIN MISSES BOAT;  </P> <P> HONG KONG: THE FOCUS ON VIETNAMESE AVOIDS THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF HONG KONG  RESIDENTS FLEEING THE CHINESE TAKEOVER.  </P> <P> The United States and Britain are arguing about refugees, but the row is over  the wrong refugees. Britain is determined to forcibly return about 40,000  Vietnamese who fled to Hong Kong, while the United States wants Hong Kong to  let the refugees stay if they will not agree to return home voluntarily. (On  Tuesday, Britain suspended the forced repatriation for a week.)  </P> <P> The British believe that the U.S. government, which treats Mexicans and  Haitians in a similarly rough way, has little ground for such criticism. And by  focusing on the Vietnamese, the United States avoids facing the far more  complex problem of the likely flood of Hong Kong residents fleeing the colony  as the 1997 Chinese takeover approaches.  </P> <P> Ever since the massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June, Britain has  quietly been trying to stir up support among allies for cooperative measures to  ensure the stability of Hong Kong, or failing that, to cope with the expected  surge of those seeking refuge.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has raised the matter at the European and  Commonwealth summit meetings and has sought American help on both a bilateral  basis and as a member of the Industrialized Democracies. The consistent  response, when stripped of its diplomatic drapery, is that "this is a problem  of British colonialism and you had better sort it out yourself."  </P> <P> Although London might expect such cynicism from many Europeans, not to mention  other Commonwealth members who had to wring independence from Britain, it is  the U.S. attitude that seems most shortsighted. If anything, because of its  major investment in Hong Kong, the United States has an even greater stake in  its stability and success and stands to gain the most from any plan to take in  Hong Kong refugees.  </P> <P> Despite the Bush Administration's overture to Beijing last weekend, many in  Washington seem willing to stand tough against the repressive Chinese regime.  For that reason, it is all the more surprising that Washington is not willing  to take a leading role in providing an "insurance policy" for the people of  Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Britain is looking for an international agreement whereby the developed world  will pledge to take in Hong Kong residents who want to leave when the next  crisis of confidence erupts. It is hoped that such a promise will not only help  ensure China's good behavior, but will give the people of Hong Kong the  confidence to stay at home and make the economy work. Even at current levels of  emigration (mostly to Canada and Australia), Hong Kong will lose so many of its  professionals that the economy will fail rapidly.  </P> <P> The success of an insurance policy for Hong Kong residents is not merely a  matter of immediately offering extra passports to the colony's 5.7 million  residents. To do so now would turn the stream of professionals seeking a more  secure life into a flood of people unwilling to wait for the next crisis.  Unless the insurance policy is framed so that it can only be activated after a  crisis has begun, it will only ensure the immediate collapse of Hong Kong.  </P> <P> However, there is no exact model for such a complex arrangement. Similarly  unique conditions faced the developed world in the late 1970s, when refugees  flooding out of Vietnam overwhelmed the Southeast Asians who were the first  port of call for the "boat people." As a result, the United States led an  international effort in 1979 to hold a conference in Paris to arrange an  orderly departure program that included a Vietnamese government agreement to  regulate the flood of refugees.  </P> <P> Of course, Vietnam was a special case for the United States. But refugees from  Hong Kong will also be special, for like the Jews escaping Nazi Germany in the  1930s, these will be the most highly skilled and talented refugees in the  world. As detailed studies in Canada and Australia show, they are only an  economic burden for a short period and quickly become a boost to the local  economy.  </P> <P> At a time when the attention of most of the developed world is focused on the  epochal events in Europe, it is not surprising that few are thinking about the  fate of Hong Kong. But at a time when so many millions are breaking free of  communist rule, it would be particularly deplorable if we let millions of  others slip back under the control of the much nastier Chinese version of  communism.  </P> <P> There is still some hope that if the United States could join with Britain in  arranging an international conference to make arrangements and pledge  immigration quotas for Hong Kong, then confidence in the colony might be  bolstered sufficiently to withstand the next crisis. It does not take a  particularly talented crystal-ball gazer to see that when China heaves in  political convulsions after the death of its leader Deng Xiaoping, Hong Kong  will be severely rattled.  </P> <P> Then, if the worst happens and the Hong Kong economy shudders and collapses,  the flood of boat people or jumbo-jet refugees would have someplace to go.  Under such dire circumstances, the United States and the developed world will  not have to deal with anything like 5.7 million refugees. But those they do  take in will be the best "exports" that China could ever send.  </P></p>

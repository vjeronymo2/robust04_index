			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Latin American outlook better Latin America's economic outlook appears slightly more favourable than in recent years, according to a report published today by the InterAmerican Development Bank. A promising world outlook, private investment inflows, likely higher prices for raw material exports and the expected ratification of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement all added to the optimism. Growth for the region this year was expected to be similar to 3.5 per cent in 1993, the third consecutive year of per capita growth. The report, Economic and Social Progress in Latin America, said regional economic integration was 'creating favourable opportunities for Latin American trade and investment'. Last year it noted capital inflows exceeded outflows by Dollars 69bn. About 76 per cent of inflows into the region's non-monetary sector - about Dollars 47bn - were in the form of direct investment and portfolio investment.</p>

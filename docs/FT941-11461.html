			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Gummer to press ahead with review of councils The local government review in England will continue in spite of objections from the High Court and backbench Conservative MPs, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday. He will not appeal against last week's High Court ruling that the government exceeded its powers in its guidance to the Local Government Commission that the two-tier status quo should continue only in 'exceptional' circumstances. But he reaffirmed his determination to establish all-purpose unitary authorities in most of rural England. He said: 'The aim continues to be to provide effective and convenient local government which takes account of community identities. The government believes that unitary authorities will often be the best way of achieving these objectives.' Mr Gummer gave some comfort to backbench Conservatives who have threatened to vote against proposals to abolish county councils. He added: 'There is no national blueprint and the government does not rule out consideration of two tiers in particular circumstances.' Local authority reaction was divided. The Labour-controlled Association of County Councils said the review, due by the end of this year, should be postponed by at least three months while the commission adapted to its changed guidance. The cross-party Association of District Councils said the announcement kept the review 'firmly on course for completion by the end of this year'. Local authorities in England should be able to provide services in the coming financial year at a cost their council-tax payers could afford, Mr Gummer told the Commons last night. He confirmed that the councils would receive Pounds 34.3bn in support from the national exchequer, an increase of 1.7 per cent over 1993-94.</p>

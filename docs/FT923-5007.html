			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hartwell increases offer for Trimoco HARTWELL, the motor group owned by the Jameel family of Saudi Arabia, has increased its cash offer for Trimoco by just over 14 per cent to Pounds 29.6m. It also bought 3.8m shares yesterday afternoon, taking its stake to about 42 per cent. At the first closing date on Tuesday for the original Pounds 25.9m offer, acceptances amounted to only 0.5 per cent. Hartwell has ceased to say that its bid is only a technical one, triggered when it converted loan stock and took its ordinary holding to 39.4 per cent. The original mandatory offer of 17 1/2 p a share matched the target's market price. The increased offer is 20p. Mr John Wei, chairman and chief executive of Hartwell, said yesterday: 'This is our reaction to the hostile defence document put out by Trimoco.' The document said that Mr Wei and another Hartwell executive had been invited on to Trimoco's board early this year on the basis that the Jameel Group would reduce its stake in the company, which then stood at 23.5 per cent. Mr Wei said 'because of the acrimony in the response, there is uncertainty among the staff, the customers must be worried and the manufacturers concerned'. Hartwell claimed that the new offer was 29.9 times Trimoco's earnings for the 12 months to September 30. It added 0.14p for the second half of Trimoco's last financial year to 0.53p for the first half of this year, derived from the target's recent Pounds 1.2m profit forecast. Trimoco has said that last year's performance was depressed by restructuring costs. Trimoco yesterday noted the increased offers. In its earlier defence document it pointed to its net asset value of 22p a share and a pension fund surplus worth 6p a share. Mr Wei questioned whether site valuations took account of the falling property market, and added that 'it is dangerous to mix company business with the pension fund'. If the bid succeeds, the combined group would have 12 Ford dealerships, four more than the maximum allowed by the manufacturer. Mr Wei said discussions would have to continue with Ford, some of whose rules have been called into question following a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on new car sales in the UK. Hartwell's offers, which are final unless another party steps in, include a raised bid for the outstanding loan stock of Pounds 200 per Pounds 100 nominal, up from Pounds 175. Trimoco's share price gained 1p to close at 20 1/2 p.</p>

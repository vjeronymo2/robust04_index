			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Setback to Black's bid for the NY Daily News MR CONRAD BLACK, the Canadian entrepreneur who owns London's Daily Telegraph, last night suffered a major setback in his quest to acquire The Daily News, the loss-making New York tabloid that used to be owned by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. A key aide to Mr Black said that after meeting the two largest and most powerful of the newspaper's unions it had been decided to 'adjourn temporarily our negotiations for The News'. Mr Martin Maleska, the New York investment banker representing Mr Black in the Daily News talks, said the decision came after leaders of the pressmen and drivers unions made clear they favoured a rival offer from Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of US News and World Report, the weekly news magazine. The two unions represent 600 of the 2,000 employees at the Daily News. Their co-operation is needed if a deal is to be consummated. 'We met with the pressmen and drivers unions and we decided we could not, realistically, match Mr Zuckerman's proposals. So we have ceased our negotiations with the drivers and pressmen this afternoon,' Mr Maleska said. Mr Maleska added: 'We have been the lead horse in this race and we are now realising that Mr Zuckerman has a commanding position vis-a-vis the major unions, a position we cannot match.' Mr Black had previously obtained a letter of intent from the management of The Daily News, which last year filed for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law. Any takeover still needs the approval of the unions and the creditors, as well as Judge Tina Brozman of New York's bankruptcy court.</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Leeds bus maker forges link with Mercedes-Benz Optare, the Leeds-based bus maker bought from receivers by its managers and employees last December, has entered a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz to make and market large single-decker buses for the UK market. Under the agreement being announced today Optare will produce 51-seat aluminium-bodied buses on chassis supplied by Mercedes-Benz, the world's largest commercial vehicle maker. The buses are to be sold by both Optare and Mercedes-Benz. The first deliveries are scheduled for later this year. Mr Russell Richardson, Optare's managing director who led the buy-out, indicated that the buses might later be considered for export and that other collaborative projects with Mercedes-Benz could follow. The project goes well beyond building a joint product. The two companies have developed what they describe as a 'complete package' for bus operators, covering the supply of the bus, hire or leasing arrangements and repair and maintenance contracts. Both sides remain free, however to seek other partnerships through which to exploit other UK bus market opportunities. Mr Richardson said: 'The contract provides Optare with access to the significant strength of the Mercedes-Benz financing operation, enabling us to promote competitive rates and pioneer contract hire and finance leases, neither of which have been properly exploited in the British bus market.' Optare, employing 310 people, says that it is profitable and on course for a Pounds 27m turnover in its first year of independent ownership. It expects to deliver about 75 of the Mercedes-based buses in the first year of production, representing about 20 per cent of its output of buses and coaches.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: Machinery of war / Review of exhibitions in London 'My subject is War, and the pit of War' wrote Wilfred Owen in 1918, just before he was killed. David Smith's 'Medals for Dishonor' are about anger, as well as pity, anger against warmongers and the exploiters of the defenceless. Smith is best known in this country as a welder of large abstract sculptures in stainless steel. The Tate Gallery owns a fine 'Cubi' of 1964, now augmented, thanks to a generous loan by his daughters of two earlier, more figurative sculptures. Again, thanks to the family, we can now see the extraordinary series of fifteen bronze reliefs which he made between 1937 and 1940 at the Imperial War Museum, brilliantly displayed in glass cabinets. Unlike his contemporary American abstract expressionists, Smith travelled widely in Europe in 1935-36, ending up in Britain. He was a violent opponent of rising Fascism in Germany and Italy, and his awareness of the Spanish Civil War was strengthened by seeing Picasso's 'Guernica' when it was exhibited in New York. The specific impetus for the Medals was a visit to the British Museum in May, 1936, where he saw a display of First World War medals by German and French artists. He was especially drawn to the savage propaganda of the German medals, which he related to the disintegrating political situation in America. Smith's targets were politicians, diplomats, the press (in particular, William Randolph Hearst), the clergy and what he called 'War Exempt Sons of the Rich,' whose medallion has a Greek inscription translating as 'soft cookies' across the centre. The imagery is strongly influenced by European Surrealism, especially Dali, and he borrows Picasso's symbolic use of the bull to represent the 'disemboweller of the lie of Franco.' Smith also quotes from Goya's 'Disasters of War' and draws on the apocalyptic language of paintings by Bosch and Breughel. The medallions were made with extreme difficulty, using dentists' and jewellers' tools on hard dental stone. Smith's anger seems quite literally to bubble through the surface. The first (and only, as it turned out) edition was cast in bronze and exhibited in 1940 to a distinct lack of acclaim. Since none was sold, they have remained in the family and are now exhibited with related drawings. Taken together, the ferocious anti-war and anti-corruption statements which they make are as relevant today as they were then. (Until June 23). ***** Denis Masi is also concerned with the machinery of conflict, with man's never-ending desire for territorial expansion at the expense of the weak, with paraphernalia of domination which includes imprisonment and surveillance. Masi's concepts are based on issues and polemics, which until recently have been more appropriately displayed as installations in public places. With the new wall work, Masi has come off the street and into two galleries, Edward Totah and Anderson O'Day. Although he has moved away from installations, the work has lost none of its impact. Elegant and beautifully crafted, Masi's wall pieces lie in wait, crouched by sleek feline creatures, waiting to pounce on the imagination. The smoothly finished weld mesh and copper cladding of 'Border No. 3' does not conceal that it is about territory, both physical and psychological, whether it be Northern Ireland, Kuwait or Kurdistan. The searchlight, described as a found object, in 'Make It Known,' speaks volumes to the collective memory of watchtowers at Buchenwald or Long Kesh. Many of the pieces include a mirror, which gives the viewer back his own image and, inserted into oxydised copper, as a narrow, horizontal strip behind a weld mesh cage, must also be understood as an observation device. Either way, the viewer is drawn into complicity with the artist. 'Territorial Imperative,' incorporates corrugated steel, a flue and louvers. Uneasily, we wonder whether we are in a mortuary or a hospital, the flue perhaps an escape route for smoke from a crematorium. (Until May 25.) Far removed from politics and the sturm und drang of warring nations are Lucy Jones's rapturous paintings of her native city at the Flowers East gallery. Born and bred in London, she celebrates its buildings and monuments in dazzling colours. Not since Derain, in imitation of Monet, was sent here by his dealer in 1905 has London been recorded with such panache. Like Monet and Derain, Jones is magnetised by the river. Drawn to it repeatedly, she paints it in a variety of moods and colours; the dolphins on the lamp-posts along the embankment take on a vigorous life of their own, here green and red, there purple and brown. Buses and cars lollop round Trafalgar Square like Dinky toys or hurtle towards Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Jones's rainbow-hued London is the city of her mind, bearing little relation to the archetypal grey, wet Saturday afternoon. Her self-portraits are a new avenue down which she has raced full tilt, revelling in the permutations of colour contrast: Van Gogh sunflower yellow is the background for the violet-clad artist in the full-length portrait, 'All of Lucy Jones.' (To May 26.) ***** Laura Ford's paintings and sculptures at Benjamin Rhodes Gallery have a superficial look of innocence, which proves to be entirely false. Little girls, dressed in neat embroidered pinafores, stand atop full mountains of foam cushions. Their childish appearance is subverted by a menacing pair of pistols, whilst in place of a head there is a tangled mass of Gorgon locks or a bursting flower. Surrealism is disturbingly mixed up with nursery rhyme illustration, more Struwelpeter than Kate Greenaway. Far from being a Teddy Bears' Picnic, the painting 'Shagpile' looks more like a gang-bang or ritual slaughter. Ford's declared liking for the sinister cautionary tales of Patricia Highsmith is made visible in her frightening and unpleasant subtext. (To June 8.)</p>

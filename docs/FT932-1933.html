			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Peace appeal at Hyundai SOUTH KOREAN officials yesterday appealed for an end to escalating labour disputes at Hyundai, the nation's largest business conglomerate, which threaten to derail the government's economic recovery programme. A partial walkout that began more than two weeks ago at Hyundai Precision, a container and jeep manufacturer, has since spread to six other Hyundai companies located at the group's huge industrial complex in Ulsan. Among the subsidiaries affected by the production slowdown is Hyundai Motor, Korea's largest car maker.</p>

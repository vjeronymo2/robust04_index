			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: SHOP NEW ENGLAND'S OUTLET STORES  </P> <P> Maria Anderson came all the way from Minneapolis to outfit her daughter's  wedding at one of Filene's Basement's legendary bridal gown sales. Every price  tag in a sea of white lace and pastels had been slashed to $199.  </P> <P> Although she and her daughter were weary, they posted trophies: a flowing  antique white extravaganza (original price: $2,000), a silver-gray gown (from  $850) and four square-necked, peach-colored bridesmaid's dresses (each reduced  from $700).  </P> <P> Filene's Basement's bridal sales occur two or three times a year. Sales of  women's designer-label suits ($150 to $285 reduced to $75) are held twice  yearly, and sales of men's designer suits ($185 to $235 reduced to $79) are  held once a year. Discounts of 50% to 70% on casual to formal clothing and some  home accessories occur every day.  </P> <P> Although some of its items are available in limited sizes or colors and labels  are often removed, Filene's Basement draws shoppers from around the nation.  </P> <P> The granddaddy of New England's off-price stores, Filene's Basement was founded  by Edward A. Filene, who sold marked-down goods in the basement of his pricey  department store.  </P> <P> Filene's Basement became a separate business in July, 1988, with its own chain  of stores. The flagship is still in the basement of Filene's at 426 Washington  St. Seven other stores are in the Boston environs: Framingham, Burlingon,  Danvers, Dedham, Saugus, Braintree and Kingston. Still others are elsewhere in  Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut.  </P> <P> Don't believe for a moment that the Andersons' pre-nuptial trek to Filene's  Basement was unusual, because discount shopping is one of New England's top  tourist attractions. In addition to Filene's Basement, hundreds of discount  outlets, selling everything from shoes to top-quality porcelain at 30% to 50%  off regular retail prices, abound.  </P> <P> Outlets at factories or in nearby stores offer shoppers an opportunity to see  how goods are made.  </P> <P> The Cheese Outlet, 398 Pine St., Burlington, Vt., is in a huge 120-year-old  brick building next to a factory that gives mouth-watering tours. Happily, the  firm sets out samples of Vermont cheddar, gouda, feta and all sorts of imported  cheeses. In all, the store carries about 100 varieties of cheese at low prices.  Creamy French brie is only $1.99 per pound.  </P> <P> General Manager Steve Lidle says that the Cheese Outlet also sells other  gourmet goodies. "Three times a year we offer pure Vermont maple syrup for $20  per gallon, and there's always a selection of about 30 close-out and  private-label wines for $3.99 each, or two for $7. We ship everything, except  wines, so shoppers don't have to carry their purchases, including our crustless  Vermont Velvet cheesecake."  </P> <P> About 50 miles to the north, Johnson Woolen Mills Factory Store, on Main Street  in Johnson, Vt., punctuates an otherwise rural experience with some high-tech  weaving and wonderful bargains on hundreds of woolen and natural-fiber  blankets, sweaters, outerwear, sportswear, mittens and fabrics. These are sold  at 20% to 40% off list. A seconds and samples section also reduces prices, by  50% to 70%.  </P> <P> Discounters, offering overruns or second-quality local and imported goods, put  otherwise obscure towns on the map. In Mount Washington Valley, N.H., the  stretch of Route 16 near North Conway Village boasts 39 discount outlets.  </P> <P> Looking for home accessories? You'll find Corning/Revere, Dansk, Gorham (china,  crystal and Norman Rockwell prints at 60% off list) and Alpine Sheets and  Towels (Fieldcrest and other labels). For clothing: Izod, J. Crew, Jonathan  Logan, Calvin Klein, Evan Picone, Guess?, Leslie Fay, Liz Claiborne, London  Fog, Levi Strauss, Timberland, Andrew Marc, Aileen, Anne Klein and others. For  shoes and accessories: Swank, Converse, LeSportsac, Johnston &amp; Murphy,  L'Eggs/Hanes, Dexter Shoes, Reebok/Rockport and others.  </P> <P> Some chain store discounters have identical stores in several popular discount  malls. Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Harve Bernard, Dansk, American Tourister and  Villeroy &amp; Boch are frequently featured.  </P> <P> For out-of-towners, discount malls are best bets for variety of merchandise.  Connecticut's two examples of the well-groomed New England mall are easily  accessible from New York City by car or public transportation:  </P> <P>  -- Milford Factory Outlet Center, 321 Post Road, Milford. Its super shops  include Harve Bernard (men's shirts for $30 and slacks for $39 to $79, silk  ties for $12 and women's gaberdine coat dresses for $200 and suits for $149 to  $220, silk scarves for $20, Van Heusen (men's shirts for $12 to $40 and silk  ties for $7 to $20, women's jeans for $19 to $25 and sweaters for $33, all with  the Van Heusen label), Micki's Designer Separates (washable silks for $40 to  $75 each), Leather Loft (briefcases by Carlo Anabaldi from $70 and Renwick for  $239 and London Fog garment bags for $140), Hathaway/Warner's/Olga (Christian  Dior all-cotton dress shirts for $18, blends for $14, plus discounted bras,  camisoles and lingerie) and Commuter Station (men's trenchcoats for $47,  ladies' raincoats for $30, Rayban Aviator sunglasses for $64, golf umbrellas  for $15 and suitcases for $30 to $45).  </P> <P>  -- Norwalk Factory Outlet, 11 Rowan St., Norwalk.

The area has more than 90 factory-direct and off-price outlets,  including Hickey Freeman, Alexander Julian, Oleg Cassini, Vakko Leather &amp;  Suede, Fenn Wright &amp; Manson, WilliWear, Gitano, Carlos Falchi and others,  at 50% to 75% off list.  </P> <P> In Freeport, Me., the L. L. Bean Factory Store on Main Street, offering  discounts on discontinued catalogue merchandise, has been surrounded by dozens  of other factory outlets, including those of Laura Ashley, Jones New York,  Patagonia, Bass Shoes, Cole-Haan, Coach Leather, Mikasa and others, offering  30% to 50% off list.  </P></p>

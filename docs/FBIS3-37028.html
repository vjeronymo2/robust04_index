			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 11 Feb -- Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the  Supreme Council Commission for Foreign Affairs, supported the  view upholding the necessity of air strikes against Serbian  positions in the outskirts of Sarajevo. He warned, however,  that the strike can cause deaths among UN servicemen,  specifically members of the Ukrainian battalion.    "Despite the opinion of the Ukrainian leader, I dare say  that  this problem needs to be discussed and thought out," Dmytro  Pavlychko said. "Russia is trying to scare the world saying that  NATO air forces' intervention in Bosnia's problems would mean a  war against Russia. But if the world community continues to  tolerate murderers, this can end up in the extermination of  Muslims. If we stand by this view, we are acting in an inhumane  way. I am in favor of returning to this problem at the level of  top responsible political leaders of the great powers," Dmytro  Pavlychko emphasized.    It is worth mentioning that Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk in a conversation with journalists in fact supported  Russia's stand refusing to interfere in the affairs of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SEEK HELP IN FINDING MISSING, ILL TEEN-AGE BOY  </P> <P> Police appealed to the public Friday to help find a 17-year-old schizophrenic  with the mental and emotional development of an 11-year-old who has been  missing since July 12.  </P> <P> Erick Scott Appel of San Bernardino becomes nervous and may experience auditory  or visual hallucinations without medication.  </P> <P> "Erick is extremely trusting, vulnerable and susceptible. He is like a 10- or  11-year-old kid in a lot of ways," said his father, Vince Appel. "I have a  feeling he might have gotten in a car.  </P> <P> "I've felt pain I didn't know a person could feel," he said of his son's  disappearance. "I feel like a big hypodermic needle is in my heart. . . . I  feel like someone is using him and he can't get away."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Press Conference  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters in Orange at a news conference sponsored by the Adam  Walsh Child Resource Center, investigators said they do not believe Erick ran  away.  </P> <P> "He always called somebody," San Bernardino Sheriff's Detective David Heard  said. In addition, Erick left his boom-box radio, which he carried everywhere,  at home because he was going on job interviews.  </P> <P> Heard said that while there is no specific evidence indicating foul play, the  circumstances surrounding Erick's disappearance are worrisome.  </P> <P> Martha Appel, his stepmother, said Erick appears normal and speaks normally,  but that he tells fanciful, farfetched stories. He blinks his eyes deeply when  nervous, she said.  </P> <P> Erick is 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighs about 130 pounds, has blue eyes and brown,  crew-cut hair. He was last seen riding his purple and white BMX bicycle on E  Street in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Anyone with information about Erick's whereabouts should contact Detective  Heard at (714) 387-3500 or Gary Whaley of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center  in Westminster at (714) 898-4802.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 23 (AFP) -- The bombardment of  Aden by northern forces resumed at dawn Thursday, with shells  and missiles wounding 11 civilians, the city's main hospital  said.    As artillery duels between north and south continued near  Aden, three southern soldiers were reported killed and 28  wounded. Nine residents of the northern district of Shaykh  'Uthman were wounded by shells falling on the city itself at the  rate of two or three a minute, mainly landing near the airport,  the al-Jumhuriyah hospital said.    A southern military spokesman said three missiles were fired  at Aden, two of which were brought down by anti-aircraft fire.  The third exploded on the hills overlooking the town, near the  al-Tawahi district. The hospital said two women were wounded in  the blast, which badly damaged a number of wooden homes in the  district.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Prescott warns of shipping collapse MR JOHN Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, pictured in Liverpool yesterday, warned the government that the UK's merchant shipping fleet could collapse without state help for ports and shipbuilding areas. Mr Prescott, launching a campaign to safeguard the industry, said: 'The British merchant fleet faces complete extinction. We have one last chance to prevent the total elimination of our fleet, a message which our campaign is designed to bring home to the government.' He called for regional maritime zones to be set up and for aid to be targeted at major ports and shipbuilding areas. The UK has slipped from fourth to 18th in the world's shipping league since 1979 and the merchant fleet has declined from 41m tonnes to 3m.</p>

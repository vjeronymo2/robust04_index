			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): UBS falls 4% on brokers' downgrades The major markets began the week generally stronger, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH was the exception, marked lower as the banking sector, which had held up better than the broad market early on during the recent market correction, succumbed to further domestic and foreign selling. The SMI index shed 13.4 to 2,915.9, under pressure from derivatives trading and with a stronger bond market unable to offer much assistance. Bearer shares in UBS, which reported a 69 per cent rise in 1993 group net profit on Friday, shed another SFr57 or 4 per cent to SFr1,356 as Credit Suisse reduced its recommendation from a buy to a hold. Credit Suisse said that UBS shares were fully valued and it suggested a short term switch into SBC. At the same time, Goldman Sachs was reported to have echoed the recommended switch to SBC. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on UBS from a hold to a sell in the immediate aftermath of the results. Credit Suisse bearers finished SFr36, or 5.3 per cent lower, at SFr638 after some late US selling added to earlier pressure from London investors. SBC lost SFr15 at SFr450. In the opposite direction, Alusuisse added 21 at SFr644 in continued response to its positive earnings forecast last week and amid indications that investors were beginning to switch from interest rate sensitive stocks into cyclicals. FRANKFURT was lifted by renewed strength in the bond and futures market, although activity was fairly muted throughout the session. There was also a signal from the Bundesbank, which said it would supply funds to the money market at variable rates, that it would make a further cut in interest rates later in the week. The market will be awaiting with interest the release of January M3 data, also due during the week. The Dax index rose 16.66 to 2,091.57, recovering all of the losses on Friday and the Dax March futures contract advanced 19.00 to 2,099.00. Daimler-Benz, which had fallen in post-bourse trading on Friday, pulled itself forward DM4.50 to DM812.00 in spite of news that the chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, was likely to move to Airbus Industrie, which in turn would spark a major reshuffle of senior posts at the industrial group. The banking sector went against the rising trend, affected by the prospect of lower interest rates: Commerzbank slipped DM3.50 to DM344.50 and Dresdner Bank weakened DM3.50 to DM406.00. AMSTERDAM regained the upward course helped by an improvement in a number of the highly capitalised issues. Both Royal Dutch and Unilever, which had suffered last week, found support, with respective rises of Fl 3.00 and Fl 2.20 to Fl 204.70 and Fl 215.90. The AEX index closed up 5.11 or 1.2 per cent at 420.75. The day's story was Polygram, up Fl 4.30 or nearly 6 per cent at Fl 77.80, which saw a strong rise in 1993 profits, and gave an upbeat forecast for the year ahead. Philips, the parent group, added Fl 1.30 to Fl 47.30. Another food group to benefit from the upturn in Unilever was BolsWessanen, rising Fl 2.10 or 5 per cent to Fl 44.10. PARIS recovered the 2,200 level as some support for the market returned after last week's declines. The CAC-40 rose 39.14 or 1.8 per cent to 2,238.06. Turnover was FFr3.7bn. Euro Disney returned to the news, and the shares advanced FFr1.60 or 5 per cent to FFr34.80, following news that creditor banks had outlined an agreement to provide a rescue package to the theme park operator. Moulinex gained FFr9.60 or 7.4 per cent to FFr138.60 on a broker's upgrade, while Assurances Generales de France slipped FFr17 to FFr628 after the insurance group said that 1993 profits would be below those of the year before. MILAN edged forward, the Comit index adding 3.10 to 658.20 in thin trading. BCI was an exception, adding L131 or 2.2 per cent to L6,060 as the public offer for the shares was launched yesterday. The buying was attributed to investors who fear that heavy demand for the privatisation shares, priced at L5,400, means that allocations will be cut. ISTANBUL lost 7.4 per cent as the Turkish lira lost more than 5 per cent against the dollar in spite of higher central bank interest rates. The composite index was down 1,195.92 at 15,003.58, although after a day's low of 14,860.4.

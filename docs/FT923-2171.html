			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (9): To new horizons - Transport master plan / The future of Pakistan's roads IT IS an inspiring goal. Raw materials from the Central Asian republics would be transported south through Pakistan's newly-modernised road system to industrial processing zones and onwards to efficient privately-owned container terminals in Karachi and Port Qasim. The political and geographical impediments to this strategy are enormous. Central Asia is separated from Pakistan by three of the world's highest mountain ranges, while Afghanistan's political maelstrom and Pakistan's own law and order problems spell difficulty in the fulfilment of this role. But it is a vision which is driving a vital overhaul of Pakistan's antiquated transportation system, after decades of neglect. 'There is a dire need of an effective communications system in Pakistan, especially now. We are anxiously looking forward to connecting the Central Asian republics with our roads. They are also in need of our seaports', said federal communications minister Mr Azam Khan Hoti. One of the major problems affecting transportation in Pakistan is the link between the southern port city of Karachi and the growing industrial centre of Lahore. Express trains have been held up by dacoits (local bandits) with rocket launchers, and vehicles now wait until they can form a convoy with military escort, before they undertake the treacherous journey. The impact was demonstrated in a 54 per cent fall in the number of railway passengers and a 52 per cent drop in freight, in the year to March 1992. The government has decided to focus its efforts on the road system, coming up with a five year programme which will cost Rs73bn. The main north-south highway is to double its existing two lanes. An alternative north-south route, the Indus Highway, is being improved, but, most significantly, work has started on a motorway connecting the Frontier capital of Peshawar with Karachi, via Islamabad and Lahore. Given its existing debt of Dollars 25bn, Pakistan has tried to entice foreign capital to build the roads on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. Under the new deregulative regime of prime minister Nawaz Sharif, foreigners had been encouraged to take over the entire project. Korean construction company Daewoo is to build a 340 kilometre six-lane highway, running from Islamabad to Lahore. Progress has been made, amidst an uproar over the Rs23bn cost, the government's debt burden (Daewoo will contribute only 40 per cent of financing), and accusations of corruption. It will be a toll road and the Government hopes this will cover the debt financing. If successful, it would help provide a framework for other infra-structural projects. Meanwhile, corporations remain concerned over political stability and the murky issue of Islamic banking regulations - it is clearly of concern for a company to lend money to a government which may prohibit interest payments. The motorway will create an infra-structural corridor through the economic heartland of Pakistan and should give a boost to industrial investment in the north. It is due for completion in December 1994. The rail system has caused more difficulty for the government. It is over-staffed, inefficient and draining Government funds, making its attractions for the private sector somewhat limited. The Government hopes to create rail links with Afghanistan, but is unlikely to foot the bill. At present, it is looking at selling land and privatising sections of the organisation to pay for its revival. But it will take a long time before this network becomes a key link for containers moving south to Karachi. Karachi is the largest port city in the Indian Ocean. It has been government-run and industrialists complain of the cost and inefficiency. The Government has reacted by privatising many of the operations. It is to set up a new container terminal on a BOT basis, while the two other ports, Port Qasim and the country's new deep water port project at Gwadur, will be primarily controlled by the private sector. Local newspapers suggest Karachi could become the Rotterdam of Asia. The presence of an unruly Afghanistan blocking easy access to Central Asia is a problem. But there is no doubt that the heavy expenditure on the transport system will finally make viable the government's hopes of introducing export industries into Pakistan. Under the present system, one industrialist complained that it cost more to process cargo through Karachi port and then freight it to Lahore than to ship it to Pakistan from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

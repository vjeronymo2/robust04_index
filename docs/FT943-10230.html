			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Mothers give backing to nurseries over playgroups Almost half of mothers placing their children in playgroups would have preferred them to attend a nursery school or a day nursery, according to a government survey published yesterday. The findings of the survey by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys will add weight to demands for greater provision of nursery education. There has been cross-party support for calls from educationalists to extend nursery provision - with Labour committed to providing education for all 3- and 4-year-olds. The survey on the use of child day-care services in England was conducted for the Department of Health in 1990. The aim was to find out what services were used and how satisfied parents were with them. The highest level of satisfaction was expressed by mothers of children attending nursery schools and classes. About four out of five of all pre-school children were looked after for some part of the day by somebody other than their mother or father. Of these about half mainly used services such as playgroups - which provide structured part-time play - nursery schools, day nurseries and childminders. The rest used informal care provided by relatives, friends or neighbours - with grandparents re-garded as the most satisfac-tory carers in this category. Of all pre-school children, 15 per cent attended nursery school or a day nursery and 21 per cent attended playgroups. A greater proportion of children of lone parents were looked after by relatives, friends, neighbours and childminders than children in two-parent families. The survey also covered schoolchildren aged under eight. Two-thirds of schoolchildren went straight home after school. The proportion decreased with age, from 73 per cent of four-year-olds to 58 per cent of 7-year-olds. Many of these children went to somebody else's home after school. Day Care Services for Children.

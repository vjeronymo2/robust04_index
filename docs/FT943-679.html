			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Yeltsin's panache With characteristic panache, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin has recaptured the initiative in international affairs with a bold set of proposals for disarmament and security. In his UN speech on Monday, he called for strategic disarmament to go beyond the Start-2 treaty, and threw his weight behind calls for an indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He proposed a new system of guarantees for the security of non-nuclear powers. Without giving many details, he called for a fresh approach to regional security, and a new regime of controls for the international arms market. He wants the five nuclear powers to conclude a treaty that would stop the production of fissile materials for military use, and ban the reuse of such materials for making bombs. Mr Yeltsin is, in effect, hinting to the US that the world might take a few steps back towards the bipolar system of cold-war times. During the US-Soviet stand-off, the superpowers - and to a much lesser extent the UK, France and China - set limits to the behaviour, and above all the arsenals, of countries within their own sphere of influence. Even at the height of the cold war, Washington and Moscow co-operated to keep nuclear arms out of rogue hands. That made for a more predictable world; the idea of returning to such simplicity is tempting. Sadly, the certainties of cold-war terror are impossible to recreate. Nothing will easily change the fact that a dozen rising powers are either on the brink of acquiring a nuclear capacity or have one already. But if Russia is ready to play a full part in ensuring that nuclear proliferation goes no further, that can only be welcome. Up to now, Russia has taken a softer line than the west with states such as North Korea and Iran. It would also be hard to disagree with the argument that even after Start-2, which leaves the US and Russia with 3,500 nuclear warheads each, there will be room for further negotiated cuts. But Russia's progress towards fulfilling its existing arms control obligations will need to be much faster before its proposals for new reductions can be embraced. So far, Russia has been much slower than the US in implementing the post-cold war arms accords. This reflects conservatism on the Russian side, and also some delays in the disbursement of US funds which were supposed to finance the decommissioning of Soviet arms  - including the money promised last January to Ukraine. Russia has been reluctant to let US experts near the heart of its nuclear programme, although it has accepted offers of US help to remove warheads from the other ex-Soviet republics. Many Russian arms experts view Start-2 as a bad treaty which locks in US strength. But if Russia's ambition to be co-sponsor of another world order is to be taken seriously, the least that other countries can expect is that Moscow should abide by existing promises.</p>

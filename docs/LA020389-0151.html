			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRAY-PAINT VANDALS MAKE A BIGGER MARK  </P> <P> Local mural production may be flourishing these days, but mural vandalism via  graffiti seems to be worse than ever.  </P> <P> "It's the biggest hurdle in terms of whether muralists have the incentive to  keep painting murals," said muralist Kent Twitchell. "If (graffiti vandals) hit  the one I'm working on now, it'll probably take that incentive right out of  me."  </P> <P> Twitchell said that his Olympic freeway murals of artists Lita Albuquerque and  Jim Morphesis at the 7th Street underpass of the Harbor Freeway, common targets  for vandals, have been more frequently marred with graffiti recently. What's  worse is that lately the vandals seem to have forsaken an attitude of "honor  among thieves" and now scribble directly on the murals' faces, no longer only  on the blank "negative spaces," he said.  </P> <P> Twitchell and other muralists believe that gang members defacing their works  with slogans and symbols are responsible for most of recent rise in graffiti.  </P> <P> "The other day five Crips came in here with spray paint and one said, 'I could  fix that up real nice,' " said Roberto Delgado, referring to the mural he is  painting at an East Los Angeles housing project. "We were taking bets that it  would be all covered up. It wasn't, but over the course of time people are  going to put stuff over it."  </P> <P> Most muralists cover their works with a protective acrylic coating that  prevents the graffiti from penetrating through, but the graffiti must still be  cleaned off.  </P> <P> Twitchell, with about 20 murals to his credit, is probably the city's most  prolific artist. He shares Delgado's pessimistic attitude.  </P> <P> "I've seen more graffiti in the last two years since the efforts began to clean  it up," said Twitchell, who has sued the man who painted over his popular  "Freeway Lady" mural formerly overlooking the Hollywood Freeway near downtown.  "Nothing that's being done now seems to be working."  </P> <P> Despite such gloomy observations, efforts to address the problem continue. Some  are community-based programs that put community members to work cleaning up  graffiti everywhere. Other programs are more specifically geared toward mural  preservation.  </P> <P> In May, the Los Angeles Unified School District will offer a mural workshop  co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Mural Conservancy and Art Educators of America  which will include mural inspection and conservation techniques.  </P> <P> And there is the Neighborhood Pride: Great Walls Unlimited project, which has a  $250,000 grant from the City of Los Angeles to wage graffiti clean-up efforts  as well as to get to the root of the problem. By providing youths with such  constructive outlets as mural painting, city officials hope the youths won't be  tempted to join gangs or engage in delinquent behavior.  </P> <P> James Anderson, a 22-year-old who is helping Roderick Sykes paint one of the  Neighborhood Pride murals, believes that the program will work by example.  </P> <P> "It's like telling the young kids that graffiti is not the thing. If you want  to put something on a wall, why not put a flower or a human being sharing  something with another human being? Unite together rather than painting gang  words or symbols."ZAN DUBIN  </P></p>

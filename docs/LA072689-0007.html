			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EASTERN COLLEGES  </P> <P> Prof. Mueller's sensible suggestion -- "Why Build New California Universities  When Eastern Classrooms Go Begging?" -- should also be encouraged because it  may well encourage some of the exported students to remain in the East. This  would reap other important savings as these hopefully permanent expatriates  reduce by that much the demand for more freeways, etc.  </P> <P> But surely the good professor knows that the educational establishment,  hellbent on empire building and jobs creation, would rather bankrupt the state  than adopt such an eminently rational alternative approach to more and more  campuses and hang the cost.  </P> <P> But perhaps Mueller, an Angeleno who studied and stayed back East, was too much  influenced by his own experience. Too much (influenced) for his own good,  should he abdicate the University of Rochester and try to get a university  appointment here after "coming out of the closet" with such heretical notions.  </P> <P> But nice try.  </P> <P> JOHN CARL BROGDON  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

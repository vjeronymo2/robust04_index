			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Air France pilots to strike Pilots at Air France are to strike tomorrow and Saturday after talks on productivity broke down. The strike is a setback for Mr Christian Blanc, Air France's chairman, who wants to raise productivity by 30 per cent by 1997 as part of a rescue package. Last year, the ailing state-owned carrier suffered losses of FFr8.48bn (Pounds 1.02bn). The SNPL pilots' union opposes plans to cut flight bonuses while Mr Blanc claims the pilots' counter-proposals on productivity would increase average pay by about 10 per cent. 'No company, even the most flourishing can allow that today, and Air France is not flourishing,' he said in a letter to the union. Air France said it could guarantee about a third of medium-range international flights tomorrow and Saturday and hopes to run more long-range flights.</p>

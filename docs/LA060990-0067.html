			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEBRASKA;  </P> <P> TAINTED DRUG INFECTS EIGHT HEART PATIENTS  </P> <P> Eight people developed infections from a contaminated drug used in open-heart  surgery, and two of them died, Bryan Memorial Hospital spokesmen in Lincoln,  Neb., said.  </P> <P> Susan Frye, a Bryan vice president, said the hospital traced the infection to a  solution of glutamate aspartate. The solution is used to paralyze the heart  during open-heart surgery. She said the hospital switched to a commercially  premixed solution and patients who undergo surgery now are not at risk of  infection. Frye said the source of the infection was traced to preparation of  the solution.  </P></p>

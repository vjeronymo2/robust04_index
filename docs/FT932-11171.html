			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (7): Why progress has been slow - Privatisation prospects BULGARIA is the laggard in east European privatisation. Not even one large or medium state enterprise has yet passed into private hands. But this does not mean that nothing has happened. Wide-scale restitution has returned thousands of shops and other forms of property to former owners in towns and villages accompanied by a partial and controversial restitution of land in the countryside. The most controversial aspect of the process is widespread hidden or nomenklatura privatisation, which really means illegal asset stripping and theft of state or municipal property, often in ingenious ways. The slow progress of formal privatisation is part of the price being paid for the difficult and confused political transition from an ossified communist regime in a country where neither parliamentary democracy nor capitalism ever had strong roots. The slow pace has led to disillusion with the reform process which reflects a widespread belief that the 'reform communists' who took over power from the Zhivkov clique in 1989 and transformed themselves into the Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP) spent their first year in power salting away state property in private accounts or making sure that former party members remained in key positions. A typical mechanism for 'privatising profit' while leaving the loss-making enterprises in formal state ownerships entails the formation of private companies linked to the family and friends of nomenklatura managers. The private companies are able to 'buy' products or assets at artificially low prices, ensuring losses for the enterprise but big profits for the new private owners or traders. Throughout the former Soviet empire, the mechanism is well-known but it is particularly well entrenched in Bulgaria, where much of the legislation needed to back up the transformation to a market economy has yet to obtain parliamentary approval. Mr Valentin Karabashev, the young deputy prime minister who has the difficult task of trying to co-ordinate government economic policy, says: 'Such so-called 'hidden privatisation' discredits the formal privatisation process and slows it down.' The only way to struggle against hidden privatisation, he adds, is to speed up open privatisation. But a succession of five governments in three years, slowness in approving enabling legislation and differing views on how to proceed between the various ministries and the Privatisation Agency, have combined to stultify progress. Mr Alexander Bozhkov, executive director of the Privatisation Agency, for example, opposes the sort of mass privatisation through vouchers pioneered by the Czech republic and under way in differing versions in Poland, Hungary, Russia and elsewhere. He argues that a mere redistribution of ownership is not enough. 'We have not yet succeeded in finding the best way for Bulgaria. We are experimenting with MBOs, ESOPs, virtually everything except complicated voucher programmes. But if they don't work, we'll probably opt for some form of voucher system too,' he concedes. Meanwhile legislation remains incomplete. The restitution law, returning physical property to those with valid claims, was passed by parliament in January last year followed by the privatisation law last April. But the law which provides compensation for those unable to reclaim physical assets, which might have been knocked down or transformed into blocks of flats or factories, has already gone through three drafts and has not yet been finalised. Neither has the bankruptcy law, without which it is virtually impossible to close down chronic loss makers. At present 12 companies are being privatised while 84 companies have been selected for the first round of the process. Up to 20 per cent of shares in privatised companies will be offered to employees at a 50 per cent discount, but only up to the equivalent of one year's salary. A further 20 per cent of shares have to be set aside for purchase by yet to be established mutual funds. In practice, however, foreign investors will be able to buy up to 95 per cent of target enterprises, Mr Bozhkov says. To facilitate privatisation, many of the large industrial combines employing tens of thousands of workers have been split up into several smaller units and 'commercialised' by being transformed into joint stock companies whose shares at present remain owned by the treasury. Up to now, however, there is little foreign interest in such plants while few Bulgarians have the resources or the desire to take them over. Some will survive, others face bankruptcy. In Bulgaria the shift to a private economy may take considerable time, and it may be largely through greenfield investments in new industries and technologies than through the more complex task of privatising and then converting Soviet-style factories into modern, competitive units.</p>

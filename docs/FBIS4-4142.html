			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Moscow and Bonn today  suggested a meeting of foreign ministers from the United States,  Britain, Russia, France and Germany to push for an end to the  war in Bosnia.    The meeting would also include representatives from the  three  warring sides, according to the proposal put forward here by  visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his German  counterpart Klaus Kinkel.    Such a meeting would help iron out differences in policy  among the consulting countries and, if successful, would pave  the way for a summit on the conflict between the five nations,  said Kozyrev.    Kinkel stressed Russia's participation in peaceful efforts  to  end the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. He also demanded  that Russia exert pressure on the Bosnian serbs.    Kozyrev's meeting with Kinkel followed talks earlier this  week with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as well as  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, aimed at finding ways to  promote an end to the war in Bosnia.</p>

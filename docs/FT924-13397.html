			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors warns of 'institutional paralysis' MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday warned of the risk of 'institutional paralysis' in the European Community if member states pushed the principle of subsidiarity too far. Tomorrow's emergency summit of EC leaders in Birmingham will consider the practical application of subsidiarity - the principle that the EC should take decisions only where national or local measures would not be more appropriate. But it now seems certain that any meaningful statement on the institutional balance of power in the EC will be postponed. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British Foreign Office minister, told a special session of the European Parliament yesterday that EC leaders would probably ask for further work to be done on the subject. 'Guidelines and criteria' for the application of subsidiarity would be agreed at December's Edinburgh summit, he said in his address on behalf of the British presidency of the EC. Outlining the Commission's expectations for Birmingham, Mr Delors said he hoped leaders would demonstrate their commitment to ratify the Maastricht treaty without renegotiation, their willingness to adopt the 'Delors II' EC budget proposals for 1993-97, and their desire to open the Community to other countries. 'If the 12 leave Birmingham with restored confidence, with renewed enthusiasm for the common European family, that will help change the atmosphere and improve the situation in Europe,' he told MEPs. But Mr Delors refused to yield ground to those states - notably Britain itself - which want to rein in the Commission's powers. He said Brussels was against giving members a veto over legislation they believed infringed the subsidiarity principle. A single vote on the substance of the legislation was essential to avoid paralysis, he added. Mr Delors also supported Strasbourg's call for increased transparency and democracy in the EC. He again criticised the Council of Ministers, which takes the final decisions on EC legislation. 'The Council sometimes seems like a closed shop where national egos clash.' The parliament last night backed a motion calling for the council to legislate in public, and for an 'assizes' of the European and national parliaments to discuss integration.</p>

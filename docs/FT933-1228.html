			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (5): Stock market rediscovers venture-backed companies - Listings have returned to favour VENTURE capitalists can hardly believe their good fortune. After a long period of famine, stock market investors have rediscovered an interest in venture-backed companies. Most of the companies that obtained a listing on the London stock exchange in the first six months of 1993 had been funded by the venture capital industry. Paradoxically, this upsurge of activity occurred when the stock exchange appeared to be signalling less interest in the smaller company. The stock exchange is thinking of closing the unlisted securities market, intended to cater for the younger company. European Community legislation had led to the main market becoming more accessible to smaller companies and the USM had fallen out of favour with market makers and companies alike. But its closure, many felt, might force some would-be entrants to delay a listing. Venture capitalists and other City interests are still trying to devise an alternative mechanism for helping smaller companies to market. The maturing of the venture capital industry which has also meant that many 10-year funds are approaching the end of their natural lives. There is now pressure on many venture capitalists to realise their investments and dispose of the rumps of their portfolios. Listings have returned to favour after a long period when trade sales dominated the 'exit' scene. Larger companies seeking to expand into a new market niche or add on a complementary product line could usually offer more than a company could raise by flotation. This situation has been reversed in recent months. At the end of a recession, trade buyers are thinner on the ground and the stock market has offered attractive prices. 'Smaller stock market companies are expected to show above-average growth over the next few years,' says Mr Ron Hollidge, managing director of Lloyds Development Capital. 'The picture for exits has dramatically improved. There has been a strong reversal of the exit pattern in favour of floats.' CINVen, which invests on behalf of the pension funds of British Coal, British Rail and Barclays Bank, completed six sizeable flotations in the first six months of the year compared with only two trade sales. Field Group, a packaging company, was capitalised at Pounds 148m when it floated in June, with CINVen's original Pounds 20m investment tripling in just two years. RPC Group, another packaging concern, delivered a five-fold increase in CINVen's original Pounds 8m investment, also in just two years. NatWest Ventures, for its part, managed to float five of its portfolio companies in the first half of 1993, including Holliday Chemical Holdings, a dyestuffs manufacturer valued at Pounds 161m, and Carpetright, a retail chain headed by Sir Phil Harris, valued at Pounds 113m. A feature of these flotations was the size of the companies involved. Investors are now prepared to wait before taking a company to market after a bad experience with some of the smaller flotations of the late 1980s. The listing boom also reflects the coming of age of buy-outs staged in the late 1980s/early 1990s. All but one of CINVen's listings were originally buy-outs, as was the case with NatWest Ventures. AN important attraction of a float is that these companies have been able to achieve very high price/earnings ratios, typically around 17 or 18. Expectations that smaller companies will outperform large ones have meant that investors have been keen to get such companies on to their books. The attraction to the managements of the companies themselves is that they can retain their independence, often lost in a trade sale, and share in the continued growth of their businesses. Despite its plans to close the USM, the stock exchange has at the same time made it easier for very small science-based companies to come to market. These companies must already have an outside investor and must use the listing to raise additional finance. They must also have a reasonable prospect of making money for investors. This has led to a raft of small bio-technology companies obtaining a listing. Founding shareholders are not allowed to sell their shares for the first two years but they do have the benefit of an independent valuation of their business. Welcome though this development is to both entrepreneurs and their venture capital backers, some observers have concerns about the experiment. 'The stock exchange made a good move by letting in these small companies but there is a lack of good quality technical commentary and analysis,' says Mr John Walker, senior partner of Trinity Capital Partners, which makes technology investments for Charterhouse, Alex Brown &amp; Sons and 3i. Mr Walker points to the problem of putting a valuation on some of the smaller technology companies where their main asset is the value of their research. Efforts to make the London stock exchange more accessible to the sort of company backed by venture capital cannot disguise the difficulties young companies encounter on a public stock market. Not only USM companies but many of the smaller companies on the main board in London experienced investor neglect once they were listed. Few analysts have been prepared to follow the smaller stocks and there has been little liquidity in their shares. The clutch of new arrivals who have gone to market in recent months will be hoping that they do not suffer the same fate.</p>

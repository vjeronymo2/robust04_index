			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Arts: Orton double bill - Theatre It is only 26 years since Joe Orton's death. Had he lived, he would today be only 61 years old. Almost nothing in his black comedies has dated. The connections between greed, lust, and criminality remain heartstoppingly funny; and some of his jokes about the Kafkaesque British police in Loot are astonishingly 'now'. So it is upsetting to discover how seldom his plays are revived in appropriate style. Orton's supreme joke is in his ironic - Wildean - mastery of language. Characters frequently speak with precise formality about matters carnal and/or criminal. Fay to Mr McLeavy (in Loot): 'You've been a widower for three days. Have you considered a second marriage yet?' The lines need maximum clarity and minimum special interpretation. The more suave their delivery, the more delicious their irony. In recent years, however, each Orton revival I have seen has been less stylish than the last. The Birmingham Rep is now presenting an Orton double bill - directed by Gwenda Hughes, designed by Kate Owen, with four actors performing in both plays - in which Loot is creakily entertaining and Entertaining Mr Sloane staggeringly short of innuendo. It does not help Orton's comedy if the hostess Kath, telling her new lodger Sloane that she has nothing on under her dress, reveals a firm petticoat; or if, where Orton specifies a 'transparent negligee', she wears a fluff-lined dressing-gown. Apart from these mere external factors, Stephanie Fayerman's interpretation - pigeon-toed, half-gauche and half-dainty, hysterical - is woefully over-emphatic, making a heavy meal out of the character's non-U nursery talk and utterly missing the classic English joke of her romantic social pretensions. Michael Cashman does better as her brother Ed, but he usually stresses the creepy side of Ed's homoerotic desires while not knowing how to make them disarmingly funny too. As Mr Sloane, who seduces them both, young Ian Pepperell (though physically too slight) has the right inscrutability, but not nearly enough skill in nuance. Sloane is a heartless thug who fools people he is an innocent - an innocent in need of firm . . . guidance; and his deadpan account of his sporting . . . activities should be irresistible. When Orton is not well enough acted, his originality dissolves. Watching the Birmingham Loot, however, you are aware of little but Orton's subversive novelty. Each character is consistent, but there is just enough absurdity in the air for us to be undermined by hilarity. Most of the cast - especially Cashman as Inspector Truscott - have such fun with Irish or Scouse accents that they stress words more for sound effect than for sense. Still, Cashman relishes his role; as does John Rogan as the bewildered widower Mr McLeavy. Pepperell's Hal and Ian Targett's energetic, nervous Dennis give fluent accounts of the two unscrupulous young coffin-despoiling bank-robbers. Fayerman, as the much-married killer nurse Fay McMahon, still overdoes the busy gestures, but here she adopts the right basic suavity. (Good Orton must hover on the brink of camp.) Wittily, Kate Owen has located the two plays next door to each other, in two halves of one semi-detached house on the same revolving stage. Two of the problems in Sloane are that she obliges us to see action (in the kitchen, or upstairs) that Orton meant to occur offstage, and that she shows us the flock of cuddly-toys that Kath keeps in her bedroom. (Doesn't much of Orton's essence always lie in what he does not show us?) In Loot, however, we see little save what Orton meant us to see, and the comedy of what is seen and unseen flourishes.

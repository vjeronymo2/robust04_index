			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Smith to paint Labour as a friend of small business Mr John Smith will today portray Labour as the friend of small business when he maps out a raft of ideas for improving the flow of investment to the sector. The Labour leader will use a speech to small business leaders in Edinburgh to argue that his party and the sector are 'natural allies' in the battle to create new jobs. He will emphasise that Labour shares the sector's worries about red tape and that it will 'happily get rid of any regulations that are pointless and out of date'. Mr Smith will underline Labour's support for the creation of a statutory right for companies to charge interest on overdue debts. Referring to a need to devise ways of channelling money towards small firms, Mr Smith will say that Labour would seriously consider setting up a private-sector managed investment fund focusing on small business. According to Mr Smith, Labour also believes there is a 'strong case' for expanding the small business loan guarantees scheme. A document covering Labour's proposed approach to industry, which it is planning for this year's conference, is to contain a chapter on small business, Mr Smith will announce.</p>

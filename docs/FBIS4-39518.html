This is expected to lay groundwork to bring the national  civil legislations of the CIS countries closer together on such  key economic integration-related matters as the legal status of  commercial organisations, freedom of goods traffic and  transactions, the proteciton of foreign investors' interests,  the development of legislation on contracts and guarantees of  the discharge of obligations, and the establishment of a similar  procedure to resolve economic disputes.    A model civil code is to be referred for adoption to the CIS  interparliamentary assembly session in October.</p>

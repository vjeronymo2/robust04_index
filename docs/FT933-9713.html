			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: An insecure minority BRITISH JEWRY AND THE HOLOCAUST by Richard Bolchover Cambridge Pounds 22.95, 208 pages A MEMBER of a young generation of British Jews, Richard Bolchover is harshly critical of the Anglo-Jewish community and its response to the Holocaust, arraigning in particular its leaders for what he perceives as their pusillanimity, self-indulgent preoccupation with petty communal and personal conflict, and their 'phobia about anti-semitism - a neurosis which at times verged on self-hatred'. Disregarding a substantial record of Jewish interventions, some quite public and many behind the scenes, he argues that the Jewish community, never more than one per cent of the total population of the UK, was throughout the Hitler era ineffectual and timid in its representations to the British government, paralysed between the 'politics of hope' and the 'politics of fear', unable to mobilise any rescue efforts of its own, or to exert effective pressure to help European Jewry. This was because of its failure to comprehend the disaster unfolding on the Continent, and above all because it was shackled by the values of an insecure minority concerned at all costs to avoid being perceived as different from the non-Jewish majority, except in matters of religious observance. For the author, only such non-conformists as Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld and the Zionist Revisionist fraction reacted appropriately to the emergency, campaigning loudly for concrete rescue work and the recruitment of a Jewish fighting force - efforts which were largely ignored or disavowed by the official Jewish leadership, and in the event also bore little fruit. Bolchover's argument, which he concedes is made from hindsight, is based almost entirely on Jewish community sources, especially the Jewish press, and as such is fatally flawed: the Jewish community's response to the Holocaust, its fear of anti-Semitism, cannot be appropriately assessed without some reflection on the surrounding reality. One would never know from this study that there was, in fact, significant anti-Semitism in wartime Britain, increasing in intensity as the war ground on and Jewish terrorism in Palestine began to take its toll of British military and civilian personnel; or that the German Jewish refugees, highly visible in a much more homogeneous and insular Britain than Bolchover would recognise, were likely to be targets for residual anti-German xenophobia from the first World War as well as anti-Semitic feeling. Consulting private papers, or indeed surviving individuals, might have enabled the author to produce a more useful work, that in addition to baring the unedifying record of communal strife and business-as-usual could have reported what the community managed to accomplish in helping to succour at least some of their fellow-Jews. The British Jewish community lived and worked, hoped and feared, in a context: but there is no discussion of that context. In a notably condescending conclusion, Bolchover alleges that British Jews 'had neither collective self-esteem nor a sense of being in control of their own lives', with the result that they were averse to taking risks and incapable of self-assertion in facing the Holocaust. Such a breathtaking charge, with its inapposite echoes of pop psychology, is simply unproven by the preceding argument, and does nothing to advance our understanding of those who had to live and act in a time of tragically limited options.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UN peace deal for Cambodia 'should be scrapped' THE Phnom Penh government called yesterday for a United Nations-brokered disarmament plan in Cambodia to be scrapped so that its soldiers can go back in the field to counter attacks by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh. 'We want the UN to declare an official end to Phase Two of the ceasefire,' government spokesman Khieu Khanarith said. 'We want troops that have been cantoned to go back to their positions.' The second phase of the accord signed last year requires fighters from the four Cambodian factions to enter UN-guarded camps and hand in their guns as a prelude to demobilisation. The process has stalled because of the Khmer Rouge's refusal to go along with the plan, which they signed with two allied guerrilla armies and the Phnom Penh government in October 1991. Accusing the Khmer Rouge of a series of recent ceasefire violations, Mr Khieu said: 'We cannot canton while the Khmer Rouge has the right to attack us - it creates an imbalance.' The radical faction should be excluded from the process and lose its seat on the Supreme National Council if it continued to spurn the peace treaty, he said. Mr Khieu said the mandate of the huge peacekeeping operation, the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), should be changed to let its soldiers train the three other Cambodian armies to fight the Khmer Rouge. He said his government wanted a presidential poll before general elections scheduled for next May. Such a poll would anoint Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former leader of the guerrilla alliance and now the neutral head of state, as president. If this was not done his government would reconsider its participation in the general election, he said. The Khmer Rouge, led by the same chiefs who subjected Cambodia to a reign of terror in the 1970s that cost over a million lives, have threatened to boycott the election. Mr Khieu said his government's army was not planning to launch an offensive but it needed to make counter-attacks against Khmer Rouge advances. The Khmer Rouge, among other conditions, refuses to join other factions in disarming until the UN verifies that all Vietnamese troops have left Cambodia.</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Malaysian power plan unveiled MALAYSIAN Resources Corporation (MRCB) disclosed late yesterday plans to take over a proposed MDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 899m) power-station project and acquire a listed vehicle for the power venture, AP-DJ reports from Kuala Lumpur. The announcement came a week after the company completed MDollars 800m in acquisitions that gave it control of two national media groups. The transactions will transform MRCB into the nation's largest independent electricity producer, fleshing out the company's speedy metamorphosis from a small property concern to a diverse group. It is controlled by parties allied with Mr Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, with equity interests in two planned electricity projects and controling stakes in Malaysia's largest print media group and only private television broadcaster. But MRCB's rapid ascension has left it saddled with a cumbersome debt burden. Analysts said they saw the latest power-related proposals adding to the burden while offering no immediate return.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 20 June, SPA -- The assistant secretary  general for political affairs at the Gulf Cooperation Council  [GCC], ambassador 'Abd-al-Aziz Bu'ali, has stressed the  anxiousness of their majesties and highnesses the leaders of the  GCC countries to back any joint Arab action and to sanction Arab  unity in any part of the Arab homeland, proceeding from their  belief that any cooperation gives strength to the Arab nation  and consequently the Muslim nation.    At a press conference held today at the GCC headquarters in  Riyadh, he said: "When Yemen's unity was established in May 1990  the GCC countries supported and sanctioned this unity which came  about with mutual consent".    He also talked about the great efforts made by the GCC to  stop the conflict between the brethren in Yemen and find a  suitable ground to solve the conflict through negotiations and  away from bloodshed, massacres and destruction.    He reviewed the efforts made by the servant of the two holy  places, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz Al Sa'ud, His Highness  Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United  Arab Emirates, and their brothers the GCC leaders to contain  this crisis. He then deplored the worsening of the conflict  between the two sides which led to the destructive war going on  in Yemen now. He stressed that the fundamental view of the GCC  states now was to insist on a cease-fire.    In reply to a question on the nature of measures which the  GCC states could take if the fighting continued between the two  sides, Ambassador Bu'ali said he hoped that fighting would end  between the two sides, otherwise other steps would have to be  taken either by the GCC states or the Security Council. He  added that the goal which the GCC states were pursuing was to  stop the bloodshed and the destruction. He further said: What  matters to us now is to stop the fighting and prevent the flames  of war from spreading here and there, and as for the rest --  everything will be examined accordingly and we will deal with  the developments in the future.    In reply to a question on the GCC center for commercial  arbitration, he indicated that the center was set up to  arbitrate disputes which might arise between a trader and  companies or between other traders involved in similar  commercial activities with the GCC states abroad [as received].  Finally, he reviewed the commercial projects which would be  executed in the framework of cooperation among the GCC states.</p>

The process of formulation will begin as soon as  possible and will be followed by signature and implementation.  I also believe that this will take place within a few weeks, or  rather in some days before the end of this month. What is  important, however, is that there is a real breakthrough,  seriousness, and a desire for quick accomplishment in order to  implement the Declaration of Principles as soon as possible. I  do not believe that there are significant problems on any topic  now.    ['Alima] Mr. Khalid al-Qidrah, member of the Palestinian  delegation and the Civilian Affairs Committee: Apparently there  is a breakthrough in some matters being discussed by this  committee. Could you give us an idea in this regard?    [Al-Qidrah] In fact, the Civilian Affairs Committee began  its work in this round of talks yesterday. Negotiations in all  fields, even in the Security Committee, are proceeding in an  intensive and serious manner and with a clear breakthrough and a  real desire to achieve a full agreement in order to implement  the Declaration of Principles as quickly as possible.    Yesterday and today, a review was made of all civil  departments and issues which were not finalized in the previous  rounds of negotiations. I believe that we have ended  discussions on the public works department and electricity, and  we are in the process of discussing the department of  antiquities, population, and other issues. I also believe that  these discussions will end because, as I said, work is taking  place positively and with a desire to make an achievement and a  breakthrough.</p>

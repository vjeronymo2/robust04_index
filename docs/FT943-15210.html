			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: The Dorchester: a bar that works - Eating Out A cosmopolitan friend, now living in Boston, Mass., always asks me whenever she passes through London if I have made any culinary 'discoveries'. Today, given the number of restaurant columns in newspapers and magazines, and the publicity top chefs receive, such 'finds' are much less common than they were. However, when she asked me the question recently, I did say that I had had a surprisingly good lunch in the Bar of the Dorchester Hotel. She was not impressed. She would rather not eat in hotel dining rooms, she said, finding them, and the hotel lobbies that lead to them, cold and off putting. The opposite was the case when I lunched at The Dorchester. The lobby was full, with deals seemingly being done at every table. By 15.00 the air was heavy with cigar smoke, testifying to the successful culmination of at least some of them. The Bar itself was busy, with quite loud entertainment being provided by two female diners and their portable phones. These they used every few minutes to phone the office to find out the phone numbers of Fenwicks and Harvey Nichols, where they were obviously going to spend the afternoon. The transformation of the Bar began a year ago, after The Dorchester ran a successful culinary promotion with the Hotel villa d'Este on Lake Como in Italy. The hotel's management then decided to convert what had not been the most popular bar in town into a bar serving good Italian food. Normally, when hotels decide on such metamorphosis they invest most heavily on the decor. This mistake has not been made here. Instead, The Dorchester has found in Paolo Sari, a 24-year-old from Treviso, a young, talented chef and handed him considerable culinary freedom. He repays this by offering a mouthwatering range of cold antipasti (Pounds 12.50 lunch only); a subtle fish broth with garlic bread, that contains large pieces of salmon and John Dory (Pounds 12); a thick piece of turbot wrapped in a thin skin of potatoes and then roasted (Pounds 16.50); a Venetian speciality of pasta with a duck sauce (Pounds 12) and a coffee cream pudding that was as strong as any espresso (Pounds 5.50). The Bar's wine list includes some of Italy's best names, Masi, Ceretto and Allegrini. The Bar at The Dorchester, Park Lane, London WlA 2HJ (629 8888). Open Mon-Sat 1100-2400, Sun 1200-22.30.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A strict code of conduct has been drawn up for  members of the National Peacekeeping Force to help solve  problems relating to their training at De Brug near Bloemfontein.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] said every member  of  the force would have to sign the code which requires him or her  to uphold the law, not to discriminate against an individual or  group, and to use the minimum force necessary. The disciplinary  code covers riotous behavior, disobedience and insubordination.  A subcommittee of the TEC's management committee is to visit  the base later this week.</p>

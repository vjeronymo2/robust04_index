			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A helping hand with charges HOW MUCH do you pay when you take out a personal pension? Up to a third of your final fund could be eaten up in charges, according to Pensionline, an independent financial adviser. Most of those who sell personal pensions receive a commission for doing so. This reduces the benefits provided by the policy and can influence the salesman's judgment. Pensionline is offering a new service which, in return for a fee of Pounds 245, will reinvest all commission income in the policy. The table shows the difference reinvesting commission can make. It covers regular premium unit-linked policies with a 25 year term. Companies covered are those which have five years experience of unit-linked managed funds and which will allow Pensionline to reinvest the commission. To take Scottish Life as an example, its standard charges would reduce the pension fund on retirement by 18.38 per cent. But if commission were reinvested, the reduction would be only 11.18 per cent. That would make Scottish Life the cheapest provider of those surveyed. Some companies have substantially higher charges than those shown. The charges of Liberty Life, NEL Britannia and Confederation Life would eat up 30 per cent of your pension fund, and at Gresham Life the charge is 35 per cent. But charges are not the only thing that matters; performance is important. There are 57 companies with unit-linked performance records lasting five years, and Scottish Life ranks 40th among them. Pensionline has accordingly sought out those companies which have relatively low charges and a good performance. These are highlighted in bold. Sun Life, for example, is seventh in performance terms and third on charges. Different companies come out best, depending on the type of policy surveyed. In the field of five year unit-linked single premiums (where charges are generally lower), Pensionline highlights Eagle Star, Scottish Widows and National Mutual. This combination of charges and performance can make an enormous difference. If Sun Life were to maintain a 13 per cent growth rate and 12 per cent charges for 25 years, then the fund value of a Pounds 100 per month policy would be Pounds 197,744. If Save &amp; Prosper were to maintain a 10 per cent growth rate and 17 per cent charges (after reinvestment), the same fund would be worth only Pounds 110,127. The commission reinvestment option is very likely to save you money, even allowing for Pensionline's fee, unless you are investing under Pounds 100 a month for a short period. This combination of intelligent analysis of charges and rebating commission would seem to meet the demand for 'best advice' imposed by the Financial Services Act. The Pensionline service is thus a very encouraging development. Pensionline, 7A, the Broadway, Cheam, Sutton, Surrey, SM3 8BR. Telephone: 081-643-9663.

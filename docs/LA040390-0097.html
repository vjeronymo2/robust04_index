			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Free Tickets in Paris: Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris is giving out two theater  tickets for the price of one this week in an attempt to lure Parisians back  into the city's 115 theaters. Although Paris boasts 100,000 seats in theaters,  attendance has plummeted in recent years, due in part to the increasing  popularity of television and movies, and theater ticket prices that can run  more than $50 each. The giveaway program starts today and will last three days.  BETH KLEID  </P></p>

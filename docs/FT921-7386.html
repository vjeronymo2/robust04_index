			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Perspectives: The secret university - A secret university for POWs in a Japanese camp IN MARCH 1942, Frank Bell, a newly-commissioned army officer with a First in languages from Cambridge, was captured by the Japanese. But this is not another tale of misery and deprivation; it is the remarkable story of how a determined man set up an unofficial university in Kuching prison camp, Borneo, right under the eyes of his captors. Regulations forbade prisoners to teach, learn, compile or possess notes on any subject. The penalty for disobedience was solitary confinement or death. Yet, Bell was able to set up secret classes in - among others - seven modern languages, history, navigation and pig-farming. Diplomas were awarded to successful students, ranking them from British university honours standard down to School Certificate pass level. Bell died three years ago, before he could complete his record of life in a secret university. His extraordinary tale is now published privately by his widow, Elisabeth.* From his notes and diaries, a clear picture emerges of conditions at Kuching. There was little food, no furniture, little paper and few books. There was cruelty, to which he alludes only briefly. There were terrible illnesses: Bell himself almost died from diphtheria, many others from beri-beri. Yet, Bell still managed to found his 'undercover university,' gave it the motto 'Artes in Arduis' and brought together those who wanted to study and those who could teach. 'It was entirely Frank's brainchild,' says Donald Yates, a fellow prisoner. 'No senior officer appointed him to organise study . . . and certainly no Japanese directive encouraged study. Frank supplied the idea, the administration and the motivation to keep it going.' In his early months at Kuching, Bell learned from copies of the English-language Nippon Times that Allied prisoners in Germany were allowed to hold classes and lectures. That knowledge fuelled his determination to establish a secret learning centre. 'Paper is a small and common word, but still a magic one to me,' Bell wrote later. 'What extremities of contrast lie between the luxurious abandon with which I write these very words, taking sheet after sheet of smooth, clean, white paper from the well-filled drawer of my desk . . . and the saving and prizing of every scrap in Kuching days.' The prisoner-students used every possible piece of paper: fly-leaves from books, cigarette papers, government forms, backs of letters, envelopes, soap wrappers, old newspapers. A letter from home was doubly exciting: good news and more writing space. Bell began to make language textbooks and grammars, writing them out laboriously by hand on tobaco paper, sewing them together, covering them in sarong or pyjama fabric and binding them with raw latex from the local rubber estate. Smokers often were reluctant to give up their tobacco paper. 'To smokers, paper was as precious as it was to me and my pupils. Paper fought for pride of place with bread and butter and beefsteaks in the visions of the night,' wrote Bell. 'In my dreams, I was forever buying notebooks and pens and inks; and even now, though I can walk past a cake-shop without my mouth watering, I cannot pass a stationer's without longing.' The Japanese compromised in one area - albeit slightly. They allowed a small number of books - foreign grammars and belle lettres  - into Kuching on the understanding that they would be read for pleasure and not used for teaching. Together with his handwritten grammars and exercises, Bell now had the tools for his university. He canvassed camp members with a double question: What did they wish to learn? What were they willling to teach? 'This personal approach proved very successful. I was encouraged that almost every member showed interest. I received a promise of active participation from all but four, who said they were too old to learn or too far gone in mental decay to pull themselves together. One senior officer was not interested in anything but Portuguese; and though I tried everything I could to get hold of a Portuguese grammar, I was not successful, so he did not join us.' Bell drew up dates of terms, tests and examinations and the university was launched with a flourish. Its story falls into two distinct periods of a year each. 'The greater part of the useful work was done in the first year,' writes Bell. 'Although we complained then of hunger, happily for us we had no conception of the degree of hunger, ill-health and frustration we should experience in the second year. 'As far as the university went, the second year was a sad story of decline, though not of fall. Most of the courses other than modern languages had come to an end through exhaustion of material. Many of the linguists had also succumbed but a few, about half a dozen in each language, persevered to the very end, in spite of everything.' Bell's French classes were among the most animated. 'Sometimes we would tell a story, each taking it in turn to add a sentence or two. Highly exciting and improbable adventures were told around our circles in the dark.' Always, though, there was the risk of intervention by a Japanese guard. 'When our classes were interupted by the Japs, or when they were being held in the part of the hut visible to the sentries as they patrolled outside the wire, our main method of subterfuge was to produce a pack of cards always left handy. I, who had never played a game of bridge in my life, could then be heard making nonsensical bids of 12 no-trumps . . . ' The Japanese ban on classes was particularly tiresome for Bell and other officers who helped with teaching. 'If the Japanese had not totally disregarded the Geneva Convention, we could at least have had some quiet and comfort. The professional teachers among us longed in vain for the orderliness of the classroom,' wrote Bell.' To be at a desk with a blackboard beside me, pupils in their places, each with his own book, pen, paper - that was the stuff of dreams]' Spanish was the most successful language class. Bell taught an advanced group of three pupils ('two of whom knew nearly as much Spanish as I did by the time we finished'). There was also an intermediate group and one for beginners. All groups amalgamated for conversation in the evenings. After the war, Bell had lunch with two members of the advanced class at a Spanish restaurant in Soho, London. It gave him great pleasure to hear them order in Spanish - and get what they asked for. Essay-writing in the top group was of a high standard, too. Topics included an imaginary dialogue between King George VI and the ghost of Henry VIII, and an appreciation of Cervantes. Pupils were expected to write 1,000 words. But amid the learning and the fun were the constants of debilitation and death. The officer conducting the chess class died of dysentery; a leading member of the Russian group became desperately ill. Malnutrition affected virtually all members of the university. At the end of the war, Bell awarded three 'degrees' in French and three in Spanish. Many others attained School Certificate level in Dutch, Italian and German. In all, Bell handed out 22 diplomas in what he called a 'silent testimony' to the efforts of his colleagues. All bore handwritten assessments of the officer's work and were signed FE Bell, MA (Cantab). Later, the diplomas were printed. All were again signed by Bell. Writing of his own award (for Dutch), he observed: 'My own diploma, though it can only speak of my Dutch studies at the good hands of an Australian colleague, has earned a place in my affections as high as my Cambridge MA.' Ten years after the war, Bell realised the dreams of Kuching and founded in Cambridge a school for teaching English to foreign students. Donald Yates, his fellow prisoner-student, helped him to build up the business. Further schools were opened in other English towns and cities and Bell's zest for teaching remained undimmed at his death in 1989. He re-visited Kuching in 1984 and was delighted to find the Batu Lintang Teachers' College flourishing on the site of the former POW camp where he had established his own secret university. *Undercover University, by Frank Bell, published by Elisabeth Bell.

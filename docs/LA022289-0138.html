			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR SEEKS 50% STAKE IN CASABLANCA FAN FIRM  </P> <P> An investor has offered to purchase 50% of the stock in CasaBlanca Industries  in City of Industry, company executives said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The offer was received by Diana Corp., a Milwaukee firm that owns about 50% of  CasaBlanca, according to Jerry Holland, CasaBlanca's chief financial officer.  CasaBlanca's stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, closed  Tuesday at $8.875, down 62.5 cents.  </P> <P> CasaBlanca's subsidiaries produce ceiling fans, lamps, chandeliers and other  lighting fixtures. Diana, a diversified company, owns retail sales operations  in Wisconsin, Ohio and New York.  </P> <P> The value of the offer and the identity of the bidder were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Diana Corp. Chairman Richard Fisher said he did not know the value of the bid  or the identity of the bidder. He said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the New York  investment house handling negotiations for Diana, would present the proposal  later this week.  </P> <P> "Unless we found that the offer is terribly attractive, we probably wouldn't  sell," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Michael McDonald, legal counsel at Diana, said the offer may have been prompted  by a statement that Diana issued in November saying it was willing to consider  offers for its stake in CasaBlanca.  </P> <P> The prices of the zinc and nickel used in ceiling fans and some lamps have  risen 50% during the past 12 months, hurting the company's bottom line,  according to John Pearson, CasaBlanca's controller.  </P> <P> For the six months ended Dec. 31, CasaBlanca lost about $387,000 on sales of  about $30.2 million, Pearson said. For the 12 months ended June 30, CasaBlanca  earned about $3.3 million, compared to $4.1 million during the previous year.  </P></p>

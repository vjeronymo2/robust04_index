			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINY ASH WHITEFLY LAYING SIEGE TO TREES AND TEMPERS  </P> <P> Carol Mueller, a gardening enthusiast, has abandoned her hobby because a  swirling white cloud of pinhead-sized flies has invaded every corner of her  yard.  </P> <P> When the Van Nuys woman must go outside, she wears two bandannas to protect her  hair and ears. She waves her hands to keep tiny flies off her body and  frequently coughs and puffs air out her nose.  </P> <P> "It's driving me crazy. They are all over. You wonder if you are breathing them  in," she said, exasperated. "It's horrifying. When I touch my plants, a cloud  rises up in my face."  </P> <P> In the final days of summer, the wrath of the ash whitefly, a pest without  enemies, reached an explosive crescendo throughout Southern California,  attacking millions of trees and prompting an unprecedented outcry from  fly-tormented homeowners, especially in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> From Van Nuys to Glendora in Los Angeles County and throughout most of Orange,  Riverside and San Bernardino counties, thousands upon thousands of residents  who have long found cool comfort beneath their shade trees are under siege by  what is perhaps the most menacing insect to have swept into residential  neighborhoods, agricultural officials said.  </P> <P> Barbecues have been canceled or ruined. Patio furniture has stayed in the  garage. Housework has doubled. Many residents have purchased car covers and  others keep a bucket of cleaning solution on hand to wipe flies and their  sticky droppings off windshields.  </P> <P> Windows stay closed. The insects stick to hair like dandruff. Simply chatting  outside with a neighbor is an arm-flailing exercise.  </P> <P> "We've never had anything that comes close to matching the citizen-based outcry  over this," said Bob Atkins, Los Angeles County deputy agricultural  commissioner for pest prevention.  </P> <P> "They are everywhere. Everywhere!" said Lynn Olson of Glendora, whose front and  back yard trees are teeming with flies. "Some days I feel like taking an ax to  every tree on the block. It's so frustrating."  </P> <P> In the last several weeks, Atkins said his office has received up to 200 calls  a day from fly-tormented homeowners, forcing officials to install a tape  recording. Throughout the county, local city officials say they too are  receiving scores of calls.  </P> <P> But there is no good news for callers.  </P> <P> Virtually nothing can stop the flies, entomologists said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Immune to Sprays  </P> <P> They multiply with lightning speed and have wax-coated wings that are almost  immune to pesticide sprays. Residents who do spray find only a few hours  respite from the swarms and inadvertently kill insects that can be beneficial  to gardens.  </P> <P> Others have turned to drilling holes in their trees and inserting intravenous  capsules that leach pesticides in the hope that lethal doses will eventually  flow far enough to kill the leaf-sucking flies. Agriculture officials  discourage the practice because it is only a temporary fly killer and repeated  boring kills trees.  </P> <P> As a last resort, some residents are screwing high-pressure nozzles on their  garden hoses and shooting water on their infested trees in an attempt to blast  away the pests.  </P> <P> The flies come right back.  </P> <P> "All we can do is tell people to deep water and fertilize their trees to keep  them as healthy as possible," Atkins said. "Unfortunately, that's not what  people want to hear. We are used to quick kills with pesticides."  </P> <P> The flies attack a wide variety of trees, attaching themselves like white  crusts and laying eggs on the undersides of leaves. The flies are slowly  sucking the life out of two of the region's most popular shade trees -- ash and  ornamental pear.  </P> <P> But they also have an appetite for others, including loquat, pomegranate,  Christmas berry, peach and plum. They will also latch onto citrus, but it is  not a primary "host tree," agriculture officials said.  </P> <P> Infested trees will "live under stress" for several years before dying.  </P> <P> The flies, which were first detected in July, 1988, by a Van Nuys  vegetable-stand owner, have no natural predators in Southern California, the  first North American region to host the fly. The insect is a native of Europe  and the Middle East.  </P> <P> By the time the ash whitefly was identified by state entomologists, it had  spread throughout Los Angeles County, free from European species of wasps and  ladybugs that control the flies in their native lands.  </P> <P> Agriculture officials say the main hope for ash whitefly control is to import  the enemy insects. This week, a state entomologist who is in Italy sent back  two boxes of the stingerless wasps and ladybugs to UC Riverside, where the  insects will be studied.  </P> <P> If the predators can survive and breed in Southern California, feed off the  whitefly and not become destructive pests themselves, they could be turned on  the ash whitefly as early as next spring, said Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside  associate professor of entomology and the whitefly expert supervising the  study.  </P> <P> Then, it would take anywhere from two to eight years before residents will  detect any kind of population reduction, agriculture officials said.  </P> <P> Early predictions of devasting effects on the state's $831-million-a-year  nursery industry have not come to pass, state agricultural officials and  several large growers said. The infestation has not struck the mammoth  $634-million citrus industry either.  </P> <P> So far, the flies have been mainly attracted to big, healthy trees growing  along residential streets and shading the back yards of homeowners.  </P> <P> Infested trees rain droplets of a molasses-like substance -- the ultimate  insult, fly excrement. When the flies swarm, the excretion floats through the  air and settles like sticky dew. Dead, sticky leaves turn moldy and drop onto  the sticky ground. The sweet substance attracts ants.  </P> <P> "The floor, the furniture, the mini-blinds, everything is coated with sticky  stuff," said June Amacher, 67, of Glendora. "Leaves stick to the cat, my feet  stick to the floor."  </P> <P> Two houses down from Amacher's, the Huntington family keeps a bucket of soapy  water and a squeegee on the porch to wash their car windows.  </P> <P> "It's a pain. Every time I drive, I have to clean the windows or else I can't  see," said Troy Huntington, 17. "And if I walk outside barefoot, it doesn't  feel so good."  </P> <P> In Whittier, Sylvia Ochoa, 34, said a recent back yard gathering was ruined  when flies began swirling around her guests. First, her friends thought the  nearby hills were on fire because so much ash was floating in the air.  </P> <P> No, Ochoa told them, it was the ash whitefly.  </P> <P> "Then for some reason the flies were attracted to the ladies with hair spray,"  Ochoa said. "It was kind of funny, they all left with white flies stuck to  their hair."  </P> <P> About 10 miles south, Lorean Wirt of Cerritos was dumbfounded several weeks ago  when she found that her gold car parked beneath the ornamental pear tree was  covered with a white veil. When she brushed the vehicle, flies swooshed up  toward her.  </P> <P> "It was disgusting," the 30-year-old woman said.  </P> <P> Now, she dreads seeing neighbors on her way out to her fly-swathed car.  </P> <P> "I don't even want to open my mouth and say hello. I just nod my head, wave and  get in the car as fast as I can. It's the safest thing to do," she said.  </P> <P> Back in Van Nuys, the flies were so thick on Enfield Avenue that resident Tom  Spicklemire is reluctant to fire up the barbecue and grill himself a steak.  </P> <P> "The second you take the meat off the grill, flies start landing on it," he  said. "It's miserable."  </P> <P> Carol Mueller across the street echoed the wishes of many who have found  themselves under ash whitefly siege.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping for a cold, wet winter," she said. "Maybe that will take care of  the little devils."  </P></p>

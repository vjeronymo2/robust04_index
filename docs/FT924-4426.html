			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney near to deal on refinancing SALE TILNEY, the loss- making mini-conglomerate, is close to agreement with its banks on a financial restructuring. The group's borrowings total about Pounds 24.5m. The deal is believed to involve a debt-for-equity swap which would dilute existing shareholders. Any proposals will have to be put to shareholders but the group's problems may give them little option but to approve the plan. The group has interests in food, industrial products, insurance and financial services. Its net liabilities at the end of its half year, May 27, were Pounds 11.6m and it incurred a pre-tax loss in the period of Pounds 2.5m, after losing Pounds 4.45m in the year to November 29 1991. A facility was agreed with its banks, led by National Westminster, in January 1991 shortly after Mr Andrew Coppel joined the group as chief executive. This facility expired on Monday, hence yesterday's announcement.</p>

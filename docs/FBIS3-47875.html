			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Jan 94 Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] The coalition government plans to map out an  additional package of stimulus measures next week. Commenting  on the question of whether the stimulus package includes the  income tax reduction, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a  news conference on the evening of 19 January: "The Economic  Consultative Council (chaired by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime  minister and foreign minister) of the ruling parties will be  asked to discuss the question. In my view, it is desirable that  the additional package of stimulus measures include the income  tax reduction." As for the question of how to make up for a  fiscal shortfall incurring from cuts in the income tax, Mr.  Fujii said: "I think the council also will be asked to discuss  the question." Asked to comment on reports that Japan-U.S.  finance ministerial talks would be held on 23 January, the  finance minister said: "Although there has been no formal  request for the talks from the United States, I will have to  positively consider holding the talks if the United States makes  such a request."    Asked about the future of political reform at the news  conference, the finance minister declined to specifically  mention a schedule for carrying out the political reform,  saying: "I am not in a position to predict how the political  reform will be carried out in the future." Referring again to  the additional package of stimulus measures, Mr. Fujii said:  "Now, government ministries, especially the Economic Planning  Agency, are working on the package and substantial progress has  been made. I think that they will map out the package before  long." At the news conference, he repeated his view that the  Economic Consultative Council will discuss ways in detail for  the income tax reduction.    On the Japan-U.S. finance ministerial talks, Mr. Fujii said  the United States had not formally sounded out Japan about  holding the talks, but added: "I understand that Treasury  Secretary Bentsen will stop in a Tokyo suburb for his plane's  refueling on 23 January on his way back to Washington from his  visit to China."</p>

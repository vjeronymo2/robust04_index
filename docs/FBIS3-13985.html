A Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today that if  Pakistan  continues to pressure for the introduction of this resolution,  then bilateral talks will be endangered. The spokesman said,  "The whole world knows that Pakistan has nothing to do with  human rights in the Kashmir issue; it just wants to take  political advantage of this issue."    The spokesman said that India was still intent on resolving  the problem between the two countries through talks. He said  that the prime minister has clearly indicated that India is  committed to talking to Pakistan about Kashmir and all other  issues.    The spokesman expressed the hope that Pakistan would not  introduce the Kashmir resolution in Geneva. He said that India  has already told all member nations about Pakistan's real reason  for introducing the resolution. "All countries are aware of  Pakistan's goal and also of Pakistan's involvement in Kashmir,"  he said.    Foreign Minister Salman Khursheed made it clear at the Human  Rights Commission meeting yesterday that Pakistan is not  qualified to talk about human rights, because its own record in  this area is very bad. He said that India has supported  bilateral talks on all issues in Pakistan; it also supports  talks according to the Shimla Agreement.    He said that India sent a six-point proposal to Pakistan to  increase mutual trust; however, Pakistan did not even consider  sending a formal reply.  *</p>

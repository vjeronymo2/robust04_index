			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THAT SMART LOOK  </P> <P> Re Gene Simmons' letter of April 23 about the cherished "old adage" that most  critics like Elvis Costello because most critics look like Elvis Costello:  </P> <P> E.C.'s intelligence, wit and integrity are as apparent on his face as his  trademark hornrims. We might wish that more critics -- and rock stars -- looked  so good.  </P> <P> Maybe Neanderthals like Simmons and David Lee Roth should take a harder look in  the mirror.  </P> <P> KAT JOHNSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

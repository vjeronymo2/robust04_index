			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> Eytan Almog; recorded on 19 March]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Almog] Mr. Peres, in last  night's vote in the UN Security Council we still enjoyed U.S.  support regarding Jerusalem's status as the united capital of  Israel which is under complete Israeli sovereignty. Is the word  still appropriately placed in the above sentence?    [Peres] I do not want to play down the UNSC resolution.  There is a change, however, in the U.S. position -- and I think  it is a change somewhat for the better. To date the United  States on two occasions voted in favor of including Jerusalem in  the definition of the occupied territories. This time it  abstained, and the reason for this is that had it voted against,  it would have in fact vetoed the entire resolution and the  Security Council would have been left without any resolution.  One of the reasons which caused the United States to abstain is  that the Declaration of Principles does not even mention  Jerusalem. The present U.S. Administration has also taken upon  itself severe restrictions regarding Jerusalem. The solution  which the United States thought most appropriate in the present  case was not to vote in favor -- as in the past -- but rather to  abstain.</p>

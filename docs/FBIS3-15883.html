			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Amangeldy Akhmetalimov and </F> Gennadiy Kulagin]    [Excerpts] Almaty, 10 Mar -- The decisions of the  Kazakhstan Supreme Council on the setting up of free economic  zones in some oblasts have been made invalid. An edict to this  effect was signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was  granted additional powers by the former parliament until the  opening of a new parliament.    This move was officially explained by the fact that measures  are being introduced in the republic to streamline and balance  the budgetary system. Asked by ITAR-TASS if this was a  deviation from the course of reforms in the economy,  authoritative experts from the presidential apparatus said that  the existence of the free economic zones had resulted in  unbalanced budgets at various levels. [passage omitted]    The experts believe that given the grave financial situation  in the country, it is more expedient to have just limited and  localized free economic zones. The edict did not affect these.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / US holding fresh talks on beer imports THE US said yesterday it was consulting state governments on how to comply with a Gatt disputes panel ruling that federal and state laws and practices discriminate against imported beer, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The ruling, with far-reaching implications for many Gatt members with federal constitutions, was discussed for the first time by Gatt's governing council. The panel was set up last year to examine a complaint by Canada alleging 78 discriminatory practices against imported beer by the US federal government and 44 US states. The panel found preferential federal excise taxes for small US brewers and tax and distribution practices in 41 US states and Puerto Rico were inconsistent with international fair trade rules. The US had not shown it had taken 'reasonable measures' to bring states in line with Gatt rules, the panel said. Another Gatt panel has ruled in favour of a US complaint that certain Canadian liquor board practices for beer violated Gatt obligations. After US threats of retaliation, the two sides reached an agreement last Monday, giving US brewers easier access to Canada. This is set to make it easier for the US to end discriminatory practices at home. The US accounts for 90 per cent of Canadian beer imports, worth Dollars 200m a year, though these are equivalent to 1 per cent of total US beer output. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said he hoped to say soon that the US could accept adoption of the panel report.</p>

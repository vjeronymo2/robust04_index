			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: The taxation factor that may be inherent in a national lottery Sir, May I offer some points which should be considered in assessing the role of a UK national lottery: In North America, where state Lotteries were reintroduced in 1964, they are often regarded in official circles as a form of 'voluntary' taxation; There is also a view that lotteries are a regressive form of taxation (due to the socio-economic backgrounds of the majority of ticket purchasers); Unless reasonable value is offered, the lottery would not be successful  - this may well mean that prizes should be 50 per cent of gross revenues. In the current economic climate, however, perhaps a 'voluntary' tax is preferable to other types. Following the new Australian director of government statistics, perhaps an American (or Canadian) lottery director would be appropriate.

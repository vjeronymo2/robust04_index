			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Volodymyr Butkevych, head of the working  group of Ukraine's Supreme Council, which is in Crimea and head  of the Supreme Council Commission of Human Rights, National  Minorities, and Interethnic Relations, and a UN expert on human  rights, has said at a news conference that during the joint  Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary working group's trip to  Crimea, a base was created for the peaceful settlement of the  current problems. He refused to qualify the situation with  Crimea as a "conflict," a "dispute," or a "constitutional  crisis," but only as a situation that has arisen because of the  nonconformity of Ukraine's legislation with that of the  autonomous republic. Volodymyr Butkevych gave assurances that  there no particular claims and demands were made by either side  during the talks. Difficulties only arose because both sides  have a different interpretation of the same articles of the law.    In his words, the results of the working group's stay in  Crimea are set out in a document which contains a provision on  the nonconformity of some legislative acts of the Supreme  Council of Crimea with Ukrainian legislation. The working  commissions of both parliaments should, within two weeks (by 15  June), submit proposals with regard to this for consideration by  the two Supreme Councils.    The joint working group asked the parliaments of Ukraine and  Crimea to refrain from actions that could influence the  commission's work, and also asked president Meshkov of Crimea to  contribute to the commission's work.    In the words of Volodymyr Butkevych, the working group,  headed by Volodymyr Stretovych, chairman of the Supreme Council  Commission for Issues of Legal Policy and Judicial and Legal  Reform, left today for Crimea in order to continue coordinating  the work.    In reply to a question whether Volodymyr Butkevych could  foresee the possibility of a referendum in Crimea on its  secession from Ukraine, he said that, according to international  law, a change in the public power in Crimea is the prerogative  of the entire Ukrainian people. A plebiscite of the whole  Ukrainian population and not a referendum of just the Crimean  population should be held on this.    Speaking about the possibility of recognizing the Majles of  the Crimean Tatar people as a body of higher authority in  Crimea, Volodymyr Butkevych noted that even the UN [United  Nations] does not have a common viewpoint on whether an  indigenous population has a right to self-determination on its  historical homeland. Opponents of such a viewpoint argue that  almost all conflicts in the world have erupted on these grounds.  Volodymyr Butkevych noted that in Crimea this issue has not  been discussed at an official level.    Replying to a question from UNIAN on the expediency of  suspending Crimea's economic laws, which were passed by its  parliament after 19 May, and also on a request to forecast the  actions of Crimea's parliament after the end of the period of  elaborating proposals with regard to making the legislation  conform, Volodymyr Butkevych said that the Crimean MP's confess  that the laws which they have adopted have not yet been  implemented. He also stressed that the Supreme Council of  Ukraine and not the Supreme Council of Crimea would have the  last word after the end of the agreement period (15 June).  However, he is convinced that every ground exists for consent to  be reached between the parliaments. The only thing which could  be an obstacle is the short time available (two weeks), during  which proposals should be prepared. But he is convinced that in  that case, there could be discussion on extending the period.    Volodymyr Butkevych said that during the talks, the Crimean  side expressed the wish to form another commission, with the  participation of Ukrainian economists Volodymyr Lanovyy and  Viktor Pynzenyk, which would study economic relations between  Ukraine and Crimea.</p>

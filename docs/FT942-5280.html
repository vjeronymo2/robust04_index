			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Ruling on Gibraltar killings welcomed The European Commission of Human Rights' ruling that Special Air Service soldiers did not use unnecessary force in killing three IRA members in Gibraltar was welcomed by the government yesterday. The families of Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell and Sean Savage, who brought the case, were heartened by the decision to refer it to the European Court of Human Rights, which will make the final decision. The Foreign Office said: 'The government naturally welcomes the commission's findings. We will continue vigorously to defend our actions in the forthcoming court proceedings.' The Strasbourg-based commission advises the European Court - but the final ruling rests with the court. The case is not expected to be heard until next year. The relatives said the 1988 shootings were a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards 'the right to life', but the commission decided that the SAS was justified in opening fire because of the risk that the IRA members could have been armed or about to detonate a bomb.</p>

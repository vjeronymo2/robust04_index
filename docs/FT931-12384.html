			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Misys sharply up at Pounds 6.76m MISYS, the computer services group, yesterday reported sharply higher interim profits, partly reflecting the performance of recent acquisitions but underpinned by strong organic growth. The dividend is being raised by 15 per cent. Pre-tax profits improved 88 per cent from Pounds 3.59m to Pounds 6.76m in the six months to November 30. The increase included Pounds 1.53m of profits from new acquisitions together with Pounds 209,000 (Pounds 120,000) of net interest. Group turnover increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 32.3m), including Pounds 6.32m attributable to acquisitions. Earnings per share grew by 70 per cent to 11.9p (7p), out of which an increased dividend of 2.61p (2.27p) per share is being paid. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said that established businesses provided the larger part of the earnings growth. 'Their stronger sales performance, together with further reductions in working capital and overheads, underpinned this advance.' However, he also noted that the performance of the acquisitions made during the last calendar year had been 'most encouraging,' with all contributing to the earnings gain. The financial services division, which now includes the Countrywide businesses acquired in June, led the advance with record profits in all the divisional companies. Turnover increased to Pounds 9.24m (Pounds 6.17m) while profits on ordinary activities before taxation grew to Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 1.62m). Mr Lomax noted that Countrywide's contribution was 'significantly ahead of expectations.' Mr Lomax said the strong sales improvement in a number of the established businesses resulted largely from increased market share and the impact of new products. COMMENT Misys' results were slightly ahead of expectations, mainly because of the particularly strong performance of the Countrywide purchases, and the shares jumped 48p to 435p. But even if acquisitions are excluded, profits advanced by 36 per cent. Meanwhile despite the Pounds 3.5m spent on acquisitions cash balances improved again during the first half to Pounds 12.4m from Pounds 9.9m at the end of last year. Given that most of the gains so far have come from increasing market share and new products, any more general upturn in demand would boost profits considerably. But even without this Misys looks on target to generate Pounds 16m of pre-tax profits and earnings of 28.6p. On a prospective p/e of 15.2p this stock is still a buy.</p>

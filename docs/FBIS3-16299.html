On behalf of the Russian president he signed an agreement on  the enlistment and service of Armenian citizens in Russia's  border troops stationed on the territory of this republic.    Russia and Armenia also signed bilateral protocol on the  text  of the oath to be taken when joining the Russian border troops.    Both the agreement and the protocol are of extremely great  importance, General Nikolayev told ITAR-TASS. They practically  complete a series of documents relating to the presence of  Russian border troops on Armenian territory and on cooperation  between the two countries in protecting the state border.    We have completed all steps connected with the preparation  of  the necessary legal basis, from the status of presence to the  system of manning borderguard units and funding provisions for  them, the general said.    General Nikolayev stressed the importance of this  accomplishment for Russian border guards and Armenian citizens.</p>

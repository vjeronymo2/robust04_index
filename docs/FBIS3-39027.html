			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "From Gibraltar to Svalbard"] </F>   [Text] Relations in the European fishing sector are turning  sour and the serious crisis which has been racking France in a  context comparable to last winter's illustrates the failings of  a European Union structure which -- treaties, regulations, and  summits notwithstanding -- is more interested in lofty  principles than in the daily life of men. Fishing is one of the  sectors which are being shaken up by the globalization of trade.  But unlike cereals, fishing was virtually ignored by our GATT  negotiators.    For the last 10 years, especially since Spain -- whose  fishing fleet is Europe's largest -- joined the Common Market,  fishing has mostly been dealt with from Brussels rather than  Paris, Copenhagen, or Madrid. The European Commission proposes  and enforces orientation prices for major species; it organizes  market support; it ensures that structural adjustment aid  packages do not turn into operating subsidies; it sets the exact  size of fishing nets; it comes up with the idea of monitoring  fishing boats via satellites; and it sets the quantities of fish  each country is allowed to catch.    Above all, commissioners are in charge of negotiating trade  treaties with maritime countries such as Argentina or Russia  and, in exchange for an authorization for European trawlers to  operate in their waters, the products of such countries are  granted preferential access in Europe. Since customs duties  never exceed 18 percent (2 percent for salmon), they never  really amount to a deterrent likely to bring tangible meaning to  the principle of Community preference.    Even within Europe, there is a strong bone of contention  between countries with a substantial fishing industry (France,  Spain) and Northern countries (united around Denmark, Britain,  and the Netherlands). The latter have powerful fish processing  industries and purchase mostly low-priced fish outside the  European Union. Their commercial interests are opposed to those  of the Paris-Madrid axis.    This is why the requests which France regularly submits to  the EU in the hope of obtaining guaranteed prices or a  protective clause are greeted with caution by its partners,  which fear that any interventionism, even temporary, will work  counter to the free-trade philosophy.    Nevertheless, the "European fishing community" needs to  become stronger. Indeed, what is at stake in the negotiations  with Scandinavian countries -- and especially Norway, whose  well-managed waters remain well-stocked with fish -- is nothing  short of crucial in the field of fishing. What a gain should  Community waters extend as far as the Svalbard archipelago! But  what will Britanny's David do when he has to face Scandinavia's  Goliath?</p>

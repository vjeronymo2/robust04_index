Clearly an important precedent has been set, and henceforth  the majority of the most fundamental questions, including those  linked with legislative work, will be resolved in the State Duma  in a similar comprehensive manner. In this case the deciding  factor determining the content of decisions will be the "weight"  of the factions holding the preliminary consultations.    Now the main internal drama in the general development of  the  Duma will consist in the factions' battle to preserve and  increase their size, insofar as it is the number of votes which  a faction has at its disposal on each specific question which  will determine its capacity within a specific bloc to influence  its ultimate solution.    By definition, there can be no objection to political  methods  of struggle for votes on the part of factions: This is the  normal mode of operation for a parliament. At the same time,  apart from political means, apparatus means, which are  concentrated in the hands of elected leaders (as we have already  observed in the example of Khasbulatov's Supreme Soviet), may  also be drawn into this battle.    In principle it is possible to entice deputies both by  creating and distributing material privileges, and by creating  advantages in work, including information advantages. For  instance, Vladimir Isakov, who heads the key Legislation  Committee in the Duma, can organize its work in such a way as to  afford any deputy equal access to draft laws, or he can create  effective advantages for members of factions close to him while  impeding access to information for "outsiders."    In his election speech to deputies, and later in his  "inauguration speech" to journalists, State Duma Chairman Ivan  Rybkin stressed that he will try not to reveal his own political  partialities in the post of speaker. He will deserve a medal if  he manages to resist the temptations facing him and the pressure  which will certainly be put on him, but the strength of such  temptations goes without saying.    Meanwhile, Vladimir Shumeyko, his colleague from the "House  of Lords," has demonstrated quite frankly that he does not  intend to ignore apparatus methods of struggling for influence  over members of the Federation Council. This has already been  demonstrated in the story of his election, in which backstage  talks with regional leaders played a significant role. And one  of Shumeyko's first steps in his new post, according to  information from well informed sources, was an appeal to the  president to review his earlier guideline on creating a unified  Federal Assembly apparatus.    At present this apparatus serves both chambers. Since  according to the Constitution the main concern of the Federation  Council is to be to approve (or reject) laws adopted by the  State Duma, it can hardly be deemed useful or efficient to  establish for the two chambers two completely autonomous  bureaucratic apparatuses including duplicate expert departments,  information services, libraries and codification departments,  personnel departments, and, of course, economic administrations  in charge of official apartments and dachas, cars, and luncheon  vouchers.    On the other hand, the whole of Soviet history is in fact a  history of the transformation of control over the apparatus into  supreme state power and of the absorption by the apparatus  branch of power of all the other traditional "branches," and in  Soviet history purely distributive, bureaucratic functions  triumphantly dominate legislative, executive, and judicial  functions. Of course, it is difficult for Vladimir Shumeyko and  other leaders who passed through the Soviet apparatus school to  renounce this means of holding sway and these stereotypes.    In the light of such demands already stated by the  Federation  Council, the State Duma simply has no option but to put forward  similar demands and to set about the de facto division of the  unified Federal Assembly apparatus which has only just been  hastily set up, beginning with the unique body of experts and  ending with the auto mechanics. The first round of rivalry  between the chambers for possession of the apparatus will  probably lead to rivalry between the parallel apparatuses that  are set up, and a war between the apparatuses may serve as one  reason for a future war between the chambers.    Since the proposal on division is directed to the president,  let's look at the situation as if through his eyes, or rather,  the eyes this time of the presidential apparatus. On the one  hand, "divide and rule" is an old apparatus principle proven  throughout the centuries, and there is a not unfounded  assumption that the initiative for division emanates not so much  from Shumeyko as from the presidential administration. On the  other hand, the presidential administration, which still retains  the ability to monitor compliance with proprieties in a unified  Federal Assembly apparatus to some extent, will probably lose  this ability in the event of division.    This option for the organizational structure does, of  course,  have its advantages, which are that deputies will be more  independent of the whims of the presidential administration.  But as payment for this independence, they will immediately  become dependent on their chambers' divided apparatuses, and  this is clearly capable of inflicting significantly greater  damage on the normal legislative process. At the same time,  this will mean that Russians' longstanding dream of a civilized  parliamentary speaker who merely chairs sittings neutrally and  properly and is relieved of any kind of tiresome organizational  or economic hassle can be written off. However great the desire  of Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in particular to distance himself  from intrigues and politicking, he will inevitably be drawn into  this by the apparatus that clings to him -- it is beyond the  strength of any human being to resist this on one front while  simultaneously resisting political pressure from his own faction  on a second front.    It is unlikely that the deputies will want to heed the  advice  of journalists, but it seems to me that the most sensible thing  for both chambers would be to decline to have their own  individual apparatus and to leave the solution of the bulk of  organizational, information, economic, and purely everyday  problems to representatives of the presidential administration  monitored by them. There are also significant inconveniences  and obvious risks in this, but at the same time it is, in my  view, the only way to guard against the apparatus-distributive  virus.</p>

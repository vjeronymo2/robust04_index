			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, if an import specialist requests a sample to determine whether a shipment of merchandise bears a genuine or counterfeit trademark and the importer provides the sample and a violation is determined to exist, any resultant claim for liquidated damages would be cancelled using the guidelines for trademark violative goods (generally a 25&hyph;50 percent result). Under current guidelines, by failing to provide a sample, the importer would be granted relief in the one to five percent range. The guidelines are amended to provide that a claim for liquidated damages for failure to provide a sample will be cancelled consistent with guidelines in effect for any violation that is suspected with regard to the sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a new guideline is promulgated which will provide that in any case where redelivery or compliance with country of origin marking occurs, but not in a timely manner (i.e., outside the 30-day redelivery period or any other redelivery period which may be designated by the district director), the claim shall be cancelled upon payment of $100 or one percent of the value of the shipment, whichever is higher, but in no case shall the amount exceed $1,000. This guideline will only be appropriate for compliance that occurs prior to the issuance of the Notice of Claim for Liquidated Damages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Change to Section VI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section VI of the bond cancellation guidelines covers Guidelines for Cancellation of Claims Arising From Failure to Timely File Shipper's Export Declarations (SEDs). The guidelines provide for relief for the first and second violations incurred by a carrier, but after two violations, no relief is afforded from any claim. These guidelines do not take into account the fact that most carriers file large numbers of SEDs each year and that three violations may be a very small number when considering the total number of SEDs filed. Accordingly, Customs is amending the guidelines to remove the references to first or second violations. All claims will be cancelled upon payment of an amount between 25 and 50 percent of the claim but not less than $100, except that no relief shall be granted from any claims written for $50 or $100. If this mitigation does not have a deterrent effect upon a chronic violator, then cancellation upon payment of an amount exceeding 50 percent (or denial of relief) may be warranted. In order to promote administrative efficiency, the guidelines are also being amended to permit Option 1-type mitigation in failure to file SED cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Change to Section VII  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Treasury Decision 92&hyph;81 (57 FR 37692), Customs published a Final Rule amending the Customs Regulations to provide for regulations specific to duty-free stores. The bond cancellation standards for violations of warehouse bond regulations are amended to make clear that they are also applicable to duty-free stores.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under current policy, claims for liquidated damages for non-merchandise violations relating to the maintenance of a bonded warehouse are issued at $1,000 for each day that a violation continues. For example, under the provisions of &sect;19.12(a)(4) of the Regulations (19 CFR 19.12(a)(4)), a bonded warehouseman is required to update a permit file folder related to a bonded warehouse entry within two business days after any transaction related to that entry (generally a withdrawal for consumption) is accomplished. By failing to update within two business days, he is in breach of his bond. If the violation continues for 100 business days, he will be liable for liquidated damages of $100,000. This has provided some overly harsh claims for liquidated damages for relatively minor violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Through this document, Customs amends Section VII of the Customs Bond Cancellation Standards to provide for a limit of $10,000 on any continuing warehouse bond violation not involving merchandise. The promulgation of this cap on assessment of the claims will not affect guidelines for cancellation currently in effect, but will serve to eliminate overly harsh assessments and concomitantly harsh cancellation amounts. The guidelines are also amended to permit implementation of Option 1 procedures in all warehouse bond cases that involve claims for liquidated damages based upon defaults not involving merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current guidelines for claims arising from defaults involving merchandise do not accurately reflect commercial reality. The guidelines include a category of defaults arising from clerical error or mistake, that is a non-negligent, inadvertent error. Under Customs Directives issued concerning assessment of these claims, district directors are given broad discretion to issue claims for liquidated damages when breaches are detected. Issuance of claims for liquidated damages for violations arising from clerical error or mistake, as a matter of policy, is unnecessary in order to encourage compliance. Accordingly, if a claim for liquidated damages is established and the warehouse proprietor can show that the claim arose from clerical error or mistake and no loss of revenue occurred, then the claim will be cancelled without payment. If a loss of revenue occurred, it shall be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prima facie  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> evidence that something other than clerical error or mistake occurred and other sections of the guidelines should be followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

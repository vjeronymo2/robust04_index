			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "`Here Come the Experts...' </F> -- But They Are Already Being Challenged by the League and the  Democratic Party of the Left"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- Yesterday Silvio Berlusconi confirmed  the plan to entrust three "wise men" with the task of studying  the guarantees that have been insistently requested from him by  allies and opposition alike. "Our legal system," the newly  appointed prime minister explained, "already includes an  antitrust law, which instituted the role of a guarantor of  competition and the market, invested with the power to guarantee  and control, as well as the power to sanction in order to  protect the market and free competition. Also currently in  force is Law 223 of 1990, which instituted the role of a  guarantor for broadcasting and publishing, with specific powers  to guarantee, control, and sanction in the press, television,  and advertising sectors." [passage omitted]    Reactions from the parties were icy. For Achille Occhetto  [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS],  "Berlusconi's appointment is giving rise to deep concern.  Fininvest's owner is bringing together, in his own person,  political power, enormous economic power, and, above all, power  over the media -- something which is unprecedented in history  and has no parallel in other countries."    The PDS secretary added that his party would advocate "a  clear-cut, unequivocal, full separation between the prime  minister's role and the ownership of the media. With the  privatization of the major banks, three or four families will  have a hold on the economy, and given that Mediobanca and  Fininvest's interests are interlinked, with a view to  rationalizing Fininvest, it will be difficult for the government  to take any action against [Mediobanca Chairman] Cuccia.  However, we believe that this is necessary in order to  effectively deregulate the Italian market."    Senator Ferdinando Imposimato found the guarantors'  appointment "absurd: It is inconceivable that the controllers  should be appointed by the person controlled." League floor  leader Francesco Speroni said "PSI [Italian Socialist Party]  European deputy La Pergola's appointment is very strange," while  [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi remarked: "He has not given  any guarantees, he could not give them. We lack the appropriate  laws for this. If today we have someone like Berlusconi, the  reason is that we did not have a serious antitrust law.  However, he will have to do something about it before all  reservations are put aside. The best guarantees for us consist  of obtaining the right ministries for the League."</p>

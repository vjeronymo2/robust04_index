			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Not wanting fool's gold Sir, Here we go again. Not long ago, the west was backing one side in its desire to establish a system which it preferred. Then it was Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, now it is Boris Yeltsin in Russia. When is the west going to stop trying to impose its own system in other lands? The Russians must be fed up - continuous promises of assistance and nothing forthcoming. Nothing, that is, except meddling in their internal affairs. Capitalism and democracy will only ever become ingrained if the Russian people themselves are committed and become accustomed to these ways of life voluntarily. If they look at how capitalism and democracy are functioning in other parts of the world they may not consider worthwhile the hardship which they have to undergo to get theirs. The west should lead by example not by intervention. Until it does, when the time comes for people to look for bright torches to follow, they will by-pass the western fool's gold and prospect elsewhere. Onesimo Alvarez-Moro, Pontejos, 2, 2 puerta 6, 28012 Madrid, Spain</p>

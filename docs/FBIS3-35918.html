During the talk President Aliyev said that  Baku stands for the peaceful regulation of the conflict. But  for this Armenia must withdraw its forces from all the occupied  Azeri territories. "Since the aggressor continues occupying  Azeri territories there is no sense to talk about the  cease-fire," said President Aliyev. "Cease-fire talks can begin  only after a complete withdrawal of the Armenian forces from the  territory of Azerbaijan", he said.    President Aliyev called for the Armenian nation and the  Armenian leadership to stop the aggression against Azerbaijan.  "We will guarantee the safety and complete observance of the  rights of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians as the citizens of  Azerbaijan if they stop anti-governmental separatist actions",  Aliyev stated.    TURAN's Moscow correspondent reports quoting a source at the  Russian Foreign Ministry that Special Russian Envoy Vladimir  Kazimirov arrived to Baku with a Russian plan of regulation of  the Armenian-Azeri conflict. The key point of this plan is the  stationing of the Russian troops in the conflict zone, i.e. in  Nagorno-Karabakh and adjoining territories occupied by the  Armenian forces.    According to Moscow's plan Russian units will be stationed  at  the territories where the Armenian troops will withdraw from.  Russian troops will observe the adherence to a cease-fire by  the parties to the conflict.    Meanwhile, Vafa Gulizadeh, Azerbaijani State adviser for  foreign political matters told TURAN's reporter that "such  forces should be stationed first of all along the Azeri-Armenian  border, as Armenia is the exact aggressor".    Russian mass media report that Yerevan and Hankendi  (Stepanakert) have already agreed to the implementation of the  Moscow' plan. President Aliyev said in conclusion that  "Azerbaijan will never agree to humiliating accords. We have  enough forces for the defense of our country and its  sovereignty."</p>

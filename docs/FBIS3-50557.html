The rebels controlled Las Margaritas after occupying the  town  on 1 January and withdrew early on 3 January, journalists who  arrived there after they had left told EFE.    The journalists said when leaving the town they saw the  corpses of Police Commander Berlain Perez Perez and a guerrilla  at the Union de Uniones Building.    A rebel identified as "Major Moises" told the journalists  that General Castellanos, who was kidnapped on 2 January, will  be judged in a summary trial at their general garrison for  "repressing the people."    "He will not be freed. He already enjoyed freedom and will  be executed," the rebel told the journalists who managed to  enter Las Margaritas.    He reiterated that his organization "will remain armed and  will fight to the death. We are determined. We are not  demanding negotiations; we have declared war on the Army."    Meanwhile, the almost 120,000 inhabitants of Comitan are  living hours of terror tonight, fearing the town, located 15  minutes from Las Margaritas, could be attacked by the rebels  posted in the surrounding areas.    Helicopters and "Pilatus" type planes are constantly  overflying Comitan, and the Army has reinforced security in  public buildings and access roads to the city.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign  Ministry denied Wednesday that the United States has formally  raised the issue of Seoul abolishing its National Security Law,  but was looking into the exact nature of comments made by a U.S.  official last week.    "The issue was never officially raised," said one ministry  official, reacting to remarks attributed to Tom Hubbard, U.S.  deputy assistant secretary of State, who said Washington wants  to see democracy take firm root in South Korea and the National  Security Law repealed. The remarks drew a sensitive reaction  because Hubbard is the top U.S. working-level representative at  nuclear talks with North Korea. South Korea's National Security  Law prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Korea.    "We don't believe that Hubbard's statement reflects the  formal U.S. position, but we are looking into what the exact  quotes were," said the ministry official.</p>

Kelbadzhar is still being  controlled by Armenians in spite of their heavy losses in recent  combat operations.    The ministry experts associate the desperate attempts of the  Armenian troops to keep control over Kelbadzhar with the  existence of gold mines in the region.    According to the source, "in the past few days the enemy has  brought into action even badly trained recruits" in a bid to  hold the positions.    The Azeri military say that as a result of their latest  military success, the Armenian troops near the town of Agderi  were cut off from supplies from Armenia.    On Monday Azeri troops surrounded and completely destroyed a  group of 240 Armenian servicemen who tried to penetrate the  combat zone from Armenia, the source added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(dos)": "Weiss: The Party of the Democratic </F> Left Is Next, After the Slovak National Party,"]    [Text] Bratislava--I know that the Party of the Democratic  Left [SDL] is next, after the Slovak National Party [SNS], but  the methods that were used to break up the SNS will not be  successful with the SDL. This statement was made yesterday by  SDL Chairman Peter Weiss. He described the claim made by Deputy  Prime Minister S. Kozlik that P. Weiss and L. Pittner voted  intentionally for the draft state budget as a deliberate  political lie. "I know that the prime minister waited  impatiently for the outcome of the SDL Executive Committee  meeting and that he expected me to resign," said Weiss in this  context. According to him, differences are beginning to crop up  within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] between  those who want to continue democratically to fulfill the HZDS'  preelection program and those who, despite their deputy's  mandate, also have posts in the state administration and are  interested in privatization. Weiss considers the visit to  Slovakia by representatives from the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] to be part of the preelection campaign organized by the  party, which is trying to ward off the threat of electoral  defeat. Weiss announced that L. Fogas (SDL), the leader of the  group of National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies in the  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, has been elected one  of its deputy chairmen.</p>

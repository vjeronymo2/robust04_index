			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURN ON "CHANNEL ONE," TURN OFF VALUES  </P> <P> If I were to characterize the genial and creative head of Whittle  Communications I would describe him as one of those people who want to do well  by doing good. Like the pop business manuals say, he thinks of a crisis as an  opportunity.  </P> <P> The crisis at hand is the miserable state of education. He talks earnestly  about teen-agers who think the Holocaust is a Jewish holiday and Geraldine  Ferraro is a talk-show host.  </P> <P> The opportunity, as he sees it, is to produce and beam a national news program  right into the schools. He would provide color TV monitors, VCRs, satellite  dishes and ten minutes of fairly zippy daily news. In return, the schools would  provide a guaranteed teen-age audience for two minutes of commercials.  </P> <P> The test run of this trade-off is a program called Channel One that will begin  on Monday in schools in Kansas City, Detroit, Knoxville, Cerritos, Calif.,  Billerica, Mass., and Cincinnati. If all goes well, Whittle hopes that Channel  One will be broadcast in 8,000 high schools, which means that more teen-agers  would see this than any other program except the Super Bowl. Commercial heaven.  </P> <P> Whittle likes to talk about this -- indeed likes to think about this -- as "an  enlightened partnership between the business community and the educational  community."  </P> <P> All of which makes it harder for him to understand the opposition. Peggy  Charren, head of Action for Children's Television (ACT), calls this a "Great  Big Gorgeous Trojan Horse." If the schools go for this trade-off, she says,  "they might as well auction off the school day to the highest bidder."  </P> <P> Public-interest advocates point to this as a blatant example of the  "privatization of the public world. " The school day, like a national park, is  being leased, minute by minute, acre by acre, to private industry.  </P> <P> If the schools allow advertising on television, says Charren in high dudgeon,  what's to stop them from having advertising in a textbook? If those ads mean  that the schools could afford twice as many books, says Whittle, let's hear it  for the ads.  </P> <P> This argument about values is likely to be replayed throughout the 1990s as  strapped communities try to get more bang for their diminished tax bucks. The  schools want business involved in partnership. The business community has a  vested interest in an educated work force and citizenry.  </P> <P> But it is one thing when business is interested in young people as students.  Quite another when they are interested in students as consumers. It is one  thing when the marketplace supports the schools. Quite another when the schools  become a marketplace.  </P> <P> Schools are expected to teach students values rather than deals. How does a  principal explain this commercial exchange? That he sold his students,  literally? Must the teachers enforce required viewing of messages from Nike or  McDonald's?  </P> <P> At the very minimum, the schools become the sponsors of commercials. This is a  deal they can refuse. The schools are not commercial turf. They are the  marketplace for ideas.  </P></p>

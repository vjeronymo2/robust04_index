			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pro-U.S. Flunkeyist Traitor's Fascist Violence" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  group, in its fascist violence on April 20, walked away some 150  students affiliated with the South Korean Federation of General  Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) who broke into the puppet  Defense Ministry building and denounced William Perry's South  Korean trip and brutally suppressed the struggle of students in  Seoul and Kwangju against Perry's visit and deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea.    A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says:    The students' struggle this time can never be a target of  suppression. It displayed their patriotic will to defend the  wellbeing and dignity of the nation against the aggression and  war policy of outside forces.    The object of overthrow is the Kim Yong-sam group bent on  igniting a war and plunging the nation into a nuclear holocaust  in league with outside forces.    The Kim Yong-sam group invited Perry to South Korea, begged  for "sanctions" against the North and reinforcement of the U.S.  forces and an "early deployment" of latest-type military  equipment in South Korea.    The patriotic students courageously turned out in the  struggle against Perry's war trip because the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppet clique were scheming to impose the  disaster of a nuclear war on the nation. Nevertheless, the  Kim Yong-sam group, far from turning an ear to the just demand  of students and people, wielded the sword at the patriotic  students. What a disgusting and despicable act of a pro-U.S.,  flunkeyist traitor and warhawk it is.    The valiant struggle of the South Korean students who  ardently desire peace and reunification is supported and praised  by the whole nation now.    Their righteous struggle and patriotic spirit can by no  means  be blocked or broken with anything.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which is resorting to  treacheries, clinging to the coattails of outside forces,  estranged from the fellow countrymen, cannot evade judgement by  the nation.</p>

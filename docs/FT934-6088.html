			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television What is it about beach huts that is so profoundly English? The fact, perhaps, that you need a hut to shelter from the weather, brew the tea, and change your clothes. Mediterranean people simply abandon the beach in bad weather, don't drink tea, and never need to change: they put their clothes on over their swimsuits which dry in the sun. C4's documentary series Short Stories (8.00) looks at beach huts of Southwold, built in the 1930s by Herbert Ladd. The guests on Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10.00) are Jimmy Tarbuck and Vitali Vitaliev. But who cares about the guests? Volunteering for this show is a bit like sticking your nose between someone's teeth and refusing to let go. In the past few weeks Roy Hattersley, Edwina Curry and Frank Bough have all been reduced to bemusement by the near-libellous wisecracking of the regulars. This programme is more likely to make you laugh than any other now on television. Radio 3 continues with its huge 'Polska]' season. Kathryn Stott, who is playing all the Chopin Nocturnes, can be heard at 10.25, and at 10.45 Christopher Hope considers Conrad: A Polish Writer.</p>

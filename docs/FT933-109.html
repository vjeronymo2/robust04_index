			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Adwest seeks Pounds 22m as profits advance 35% - Several takeover targets under consideration ADWEST yesterday marked the end of three years of restructuring at the automotive components and power systems group by announcing a rights issue to fund acquisitions and a 35 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.4m. Mr Fred Grant, chairman, said Adwest had 'done all the rationalisation that we think needs to be done. We want to grow the business now'. Since 1990 Adwest has reduced its workforce by about 29 per cent and closed six factories. Adwest aims to raise Pounds 22.2m through a 1-for-4 rights issue at 140p. Although it was not able to announce an acquisition with the rights, Mr Grant said the group was in discussions with several possible targets in its power systems and automotive components divisions. Adwest stressed that it had no intention of adding to its property arm, although prospects there were brighter than for some time. The rights issue announcement was accompanied by an unexpected increase in the total dividend. Adwest had managed to maintain a covered dividend for four years, but shareholders had been patient long enough, Mr Grant said. 'I do think they are entitled to a little bit of the flavour of recovery,' he said, referring to optimistic prospects for the current year. The group's shares rose 11p to close at 183p. The dividend was 3 per cent higher at 7.2p, after a reduced final of 5.2p (5.75p). Earnings rose by 45 per cent to 11p. Results for the year to June 30 showed a 9 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 137m. The automotive division's operating profits rose 27 per cent to Pounds 3.5m on sales 8 per cent ahead at Pounds 83.1m. Power systems rose by 20 per cent at the operating level to Pounds 3.9m on sales 9 per cent up to Pounds 51.1m. Property, hit by a decline in margins on housebuilding, returned a slightly lower profit of Pounds 3.17m (Pounds 3.22m). This excludes the Pounds 634,000 (Pounds 1.12m) contribution from the joint venture with housebuilder, Bryant. COMMENT Adwest has somewhat cheekily launched a rights issue to fund acquisitions that have not yet materialised, and sweetened the move with an unexpectedly increased dividend. The 5 per cent yield, which rises to 6.4 per cent on the rights price, is one of the most attractive things about Adwest. The company will now have to use the rights cash to meet demands from customers for integrated products as opposed to a variety of small components. Yet this is a company which - since new management was introduced three years ago - has, so far, managed to deliver on its promises. On forecasts of between Pounds 11.5m and Pounds 12.8m, the prospective p/e comes in at roughly 15.5 times. Compared with others in its sector, this would seem good value.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Also Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 100(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months after receipt of the submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After providing more than 30 days of prior public notice, the State of Colorado held a public hearing on April 15, 1993 to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Lamar. The plan for Lamar was subsequently adopted by the State and submitted by the Governor by letter dated May 27, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. EPA received the submittal on June 3, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated June 14, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process. In this action, EPA proposes to approve the State of Colorado's PM&hyph;10 SIP submittal for Lamar relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 and invites public comment on the action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 2. Accurate Emissions Inventory <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR 13539).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Colorado submitted a winter/spring season emissions inventory for the base year of 1992. A winter/spring season emissions inventory was calculated because the highest PM&hyph; 10 concentrations generally occur in the winter/spring season in Lamar. The base year inventory identified area sources as the primary cause of high PM&hyph;10 concentrations, which contributed 99 percent of the total emissions, with wind erosion from agriculture lands contributing 49 percent, re-entrained road dust from paved and unpaved roads contributing 24 percent, cattle feedlots contributing 15 percent, residential wood burning contributing 8 percent, and point sources contributing 1 percent. The remaining 3 percent of PM&hyph;10 emissions was due to emissions from tailpipes, agricultural tilling, and storage piles. The emission inventory demonstrates that wind erosion from agricultural land is the principal contributor to PM&hyph;10 emissions in the Lamar nonattainment area. However, the State and EPA believe that during the conditions when the PM&hyph;10 exceedances have been known to occur (high wind days preceded by warm, dry weather), PM&hyph;10 from wind erosion may be coming into the area from land much farther away than the area modeled by the State in developing the Lamar PM&hyph;10 emissions inventory. Thus, on the high wind days, agricultural emissions not in the immediate area surrounding Lamar may represent a much greater contribution to total PM&hyph;10 emissions in the area. However, emissions from such sources not in the immediate area surrounding Lamar were difficult to estimate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  For further details see the Technical Support Document (TSD).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The EPA issued guidance on PM&hyph;10 emissions inventories prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments in the form of the 1987 PM&hyph;10 SIP Development Guideline. The guidance provided in this document appears to be consistent with the revised Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 3. RACM (Including RACT) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57 FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). In Lamar, wind erosion from agricultural farmland in the area was identified as the principal contributor to the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem, and these emissions will be controlled through reliance on the soil conservation measures of the Food Security Act (FSA). See e.g., 16 U.S.C. 3801, 3811&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3813.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

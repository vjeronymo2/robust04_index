			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / International Company News: Caparo chief in Indian steel stamping venture Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of Caparo, the UK-based steel group, yesterday signed an agreement with Maruti Udyog, the Indian car manufacturer and Machino Techno Sales, a Delhi-based plastic auto-parts maker, to set up a Rs400m (Dollars 12.7m) steel metal stamping shop near Delhi. Mr Paul will own 60 per cent of Caparo Maruti, while Maruti Udyog and Machino Techno Sales, a Maruti joint-venture company, will each hold 20 per cent. The new company, due to start production in April 1995, will be located at Maruti's joint venture complex at Gurgaon, 25km from Delhi. It will augment Maruti's steel metal pressing capacity with an 800-tonne press line, possibly rising to 1,200 tonnes. This is the first investment that Mr Paul, a London-based non-resident Indian industrialist, has made in India. Maruti, a joint venture between the Indian government and Suzuki Motor of Japan, plans to increase production to 230,000 cars by 1996. The company, until recently wholly government-owned, achieved a turnover of Rs22.22bn last year. Caparo has steel stamping plants in Spain and in the UK.</p>

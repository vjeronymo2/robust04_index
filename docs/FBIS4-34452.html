			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from Cartagena, Colombia] </F>   [Text] The Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) is  being revitalized by the integration accords in the continent,  LAIA Secretary General Antonio Antunes said. At its headquarters  in Montevideo, the organization is hosting meetings of tobacco  industry workers from Mercosur [Common Market of the South]  countries and Chile. They want a master agreement on labor  relations. The universities and media of these countries also  are approaching each other. There are possibilities for  concerted action by and consolidation of Mercosur and the Andean  Pact. Antunes said that negotiations also have their crises. He  did not rule out the possibility that subregional groups may in  the future have a preferential relation with the United States  and countries outside the region.    The LAIA Council of Ministers has decided to draw up a  program of action seeking to coordinate the Andean Group,  Mercosur, and the various bilateral and multilateral agreements.  The idea is to make those agreements lead to a Latin American  common market. In this regard, the proposal for the creation of  a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which was raised by  Brazil and has been endorsed by Mercosur countries, is a major  contribution, Antunes said.    In August, LAIA will have to make suggestions for this  higher  integration phase that its members are looking for. To this end,  it will need a set of commercial regulations with antidumping,  origin, and customs rules. "That is the initial step," Antunes  said.    The organization also is working to define rules for  transportation and for new subjects like the sale of services,  intellectual property, and capital movements. Mexico itself,  which usually has criticized LAIA, believes the organization is  modernizing, as Mexico's main NAFTA negotiator, Herminio Blanco,  admitted a few days ago in London during a seminar on relations  between the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and Latin  America, Brazilian diplomatic sources said.    The protocol that interprets Article 44 and the program of  action have meant a qualitative step forward for LAIA, Antunes  said.    LAIA, he said, is on its way to becoming a regional GATT.  The  organization will create a labor council, promote a second  meeting on consumer rights, and continue its business talks,  encouraging major entrepreneurs of signatory countries to invest  in smaller countries in order to export to their own countries.    Antunes' conclusion is that the expansion of commerce  produces the need for integration and instruments for regulating  commerce, like fair competition rules. Mexico itself, which  requested a solution for its problem within LAIA -- because it  is also a NAFTA member -- is negotiating bilateral and regional  free trade agreements with several countries, expecting its  profits to surpass the compensation it will have to offer.    Greece and South Africa have asked to be accepted as  observers to LAIA. China is in the final stage of the process of  being accepted as an observer, while Romania already has been  granted the status of observer. Antunes said LAIA is trying to  negotiate the status of observers in exchange for cooperation  agreements with the observer countries, thus guaranteeing the  future possibility of signing trade accords with LAIA members.</p>

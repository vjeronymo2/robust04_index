			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (XINHUA) -- China's central bank  is fully confident of maintaining a stable exchange rate  throughout this year, Zhou Zhengqing, vice-governor of the  People's Bank of China said.    Zhou expressed his confidence on behalf of the central bank  at a press conference held by the ongoing session of the  National People's Congress (NPC) here today.    He said that, since China adopted a unified exchange rate  between the Chinese yuan and major foreign currencies on January  1, the exchange rate has remained stable -- 8.7 yuan to the U.S.  dollar -- and the country's foreign exchange reserve has seen a  sharp increase.    Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli disclosed yesterday  that  the country's foreign exchange reserve now stands at 27.2  billion U.S. dollars.    On the possibility of foreign banks in China dealing in the  local currency, Zhou said: "Conditions are not ripe yet."    He gave three reasons for this. First, tax rates for Chinese  banks and their foreign counterparts in China are different at  present -- higher rates for the former would make competition  unfair; second, China has yet to convert banks into purely  commercial institutions, though their conversion is in the  pipeline; and third, the country has yet to formulate laws  governing banking activities.    However, Zhou said, China is creating required conditions.  He listed work being done in this direction. It includes the  formulation late this year of a central bank law, a commercial  bank law, a securities law, a bills law, an insurance law and a  series of banking regulations.    He said related experiments are being done in a few selected  joint Sino-foreign banks to gain experience.    On the central bank's role in the field of macro-controls,  Zhou said it is adopting a "steady" policy, explaining that it  "will neither squeeze nor loosen credit."    "For this year," he said, "the increase of total money  supply  over last year will be controlled at between 23-24 percent."    Last year, money supply went up 25 percent from the previous  year.    China's banking order has turned for the better since the  second half of last year, after the introduction of tightened  macro-controls. In the first two months, people's savings  deposits increased by a big margin, and recovery of all the  money released immediately before the Spring Festival is  expected before the end of March, he said.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Banesto moves to resolve Portuguese bank dispute Banco Santander and Banesto yesterday put forward proposals aimed resolving a dispute over the Spanish groups' shareholdings in Banco Totta e Acores, a Portuguese bank, according to Portuguese officials. Banesto, which was acquired by Santander last month, owns just under 25 per cent of BTA directly and a further 25 per cent through nominee shareholders. Portugal contends that this contravenes legislation limiting foreign ownership of the bank to 25 per cent. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander chairman, and Mr Alfredo Saenz, Banesto chairman, met Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portugal's finance minister, and Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor of the central bank, yesterday for talks requested by Santander. Both sides declined to comment on progress. But Lisbon bankers said Santander was seeking an agreement that would avoid court action by either side. Santander affirms that the limits imposed by Portugal are at odds with European Union regulations. Banesto and its associate shareholders in BTA are contesting a decision by the Portuguese central bank that restricts their joint voting rights in BTA to 25 per cent. Mr Botin said last week Santander would not dispose of its stake in BTA, which he considered a high-value asset and one of the main reasons for acquiring Banesto. But Lisbon bankers said a compromise might involve selling other Santander assets in Portugal. Santander's purchase of Banesto gave it control of an estimated 10 per cent of Portuguese banking. In addition to BTA, which owns Credito Predial Portugues, a mortgage bank, Santander controls Banco Comercio e Industria and Banco Santander de Negocios, two Portuguese merchant banks.</p>

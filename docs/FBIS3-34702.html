Rabin spoke  at Labor Party headquarters last night. Dani Gur-Arye reports:    [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin says the  attacks on Israelis are painful. He says they highlight the  need to begin implementation of the agreement with the  Palestinians. Speaking to the Labor Party Bureau in Tel Aviv,  Rabin said Israel must fight hard against those who seek to  derail the peace process. He said Israel is determined to see  the agreement through despite the violence. Police Minister  Moshe Shahal said following the Bureau meeting that the new  security arrangement with the Palestinians will make such  attacks more difficult for those who oppose the peace process.    [Shahal] We expect that the Palestinians will prevent any  kind of terror acts or violence of any kind against Israeli  civilians. For that matter, we are going to have all of the  responsibility on their shoulders and this is their obligation.  We are realistic enough to know that there are those who oppose  the peace process and probably they will try to sabotage the  peace process by terror acts against civilians: Israelis and  maybe even Palestinians. But the Palestinian authority in Gaza  and Jericho will be responsible to prevent those actions.    [Gur-Arye] Prime Minister Rabin said at the Bureau meeting  that the Islamic Jihad is the leading terror organization in the  territories. He said it would take at least a month to reach  agreement on outstanding issues with the Palestinians. He ruled  out meeting with Yasir 'Arafat before all the issues are  resolved. Rabin said Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had  coordinated all his moves with him on the phone from Cairo. He  criticized Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin for promising  that the government would resign if the public rejects an  agreement with Syria in a national referendum. Prime Minister  Rabin said Beilin had no authority to make such a promise. [end  recording]    [Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 11 February in a  page 1 report on the Labor Party Bureau meeting by Sarah Honig  adds that Prime Minister Rabin adds: "Arab terrorism will not be  controlled without help from the Palestinian police." THE  JERUSALEM POST writes that "Rabin noted that Israel could not  eradicate terror when it controlled the territories. 'Perhaps  what we need is a partner to help us towards that end. When the  Palestinians have self-rule and deploy their own police force,  they will have their own interest in putting an end to terrorist  acts perpetrated by their own people.    ["`They will have something to lose if they do not exert  control. They will have an enormous stake in securing the  peace. If they fail and the bloodletting continue, they know  they will not arrive at their destination and will not get what  they wish to achieve beyond Gaza and Jericho,' Rabin said."]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Queenie Wang] </F>   [Text] Pro-Beijing Airport Consultative Committee (ACC)  members have accused China of making concessions over airport  financial arrangements in exchange for a deal with the British  in the defence land talks. ACC members expressed disappointment  with the draft agreement on funding for Chek Lap Kok being drawn  up for signing within the next few days. They say it fails to  clarify grey areas in the new airport Memorandum Of  Understanding (MOU) and fear overspending on the project may  cause rows in the future.    Some ACC members have already taken their grievances to  Chinese members of the Airport Committee. The group is unhappy  that Beijing appears to have accepted the arrangement proposed  by the British without securing an agreement on setting up an  independent body to monitor progress on the project. "Hong Kong  people should welcome this agreement but the mechanism for  monitoring the expense progress and quality of the project needs  further discussion," ACC member Ho King-on said.    Other members were harsher in their criticism of the deal,  claiming it contained many loopholes. They said that, during  their private meeting, Chinese official Hu Houcheng failed to  give a satisfactory explanation for giving in to British  demands, admitting only that there were many "problems" in the  draft deal. "This is a disappointing result. They broke the  deadlock which had lasted for two years but did not clarify the  grey areas in the MOU. This is dangerous," one ACC member said.  "We all understand that they (the Chinese) did so because they  got advantages over defence land -- they mixed the two issues  up."    ACC members were disappointed China accepted a level of debt  far above the $5 billion ceiling stated in the MOU without  seeking more cash reserves to be left for the Special  Administrative Region (SAR) government. "The British have only  promised to leave at least $25 billion for the SAR government.  Now the British increase the debt level, why don't they  increase the reserve to make it more comfortable?" one member  said. But ACC chairman Wong Po-yan did not share the anger,  saying he hoped the agreement would be finalised soon.    Britain is already planning to rush any agreement through  the  Legislative Council before the summer recess. The last Finance  Committee of the session is scheduled for July 8, but a later  one may be arranged if necessary. Legislators would be asked to  approve a $60.3 billion equity injection, with $36.6 billion  destined for the Provisional Airport Authority, and $23.7  billion for the Mass Transit Railway Corporation [MTRC]. Much  of this has already been voted through, and a further $15  billion is up for approval at Friday's Finance Committee  meeting. However, none of the money for MTRC has been put to  the Legislative Council.</p>

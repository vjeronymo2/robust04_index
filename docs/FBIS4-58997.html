			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>   [Text] Amman--The United States has officially informed  Jordan of its acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal to replace  the sea-inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound shipping with land-based  verifications of cargo by the independent British company Lloyds  Register, informed sources said Monday.    The sources said the U.S. decision was communicated to the  Kingdom Sunday in a letter sent by U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. American Embassy sources declined comment  when asked about the letter. The sources said the U.S. decision  would remove the obstacle to Jordan's resumption of its active  role in the Arab-Israeli peace process and is a step towards  restoring Jordanian-U.S. "normal and friendly relations."    The sources, which requested anonymity, said the siege on  al-'Aqabah would be lifted after completing work on what they  described as minor technicalities. That would be soon, they  said.    They said the "fine-tuning" which Mr. Christopher referred  to  when he announced the acceptance of the Jordanian proposal in  London on April 25 was almost over. Mr. Christopher said at a  joint press conference with His Majesty King Husayn in London  that the U.S. had accepted the Jordanian proposal to have Lloyds  Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo once it is unloaded in  the port instead of the sea-inspections which the Kingdom says  had caused enormous losses to its economy.    The American decision came a few days after France announced  it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting  al-'Aqabah-bound shipping while enforcing the sanctions against  Iraq.    Informed sources said that Canada had rejected an American  offer to replace the French in light of Jordan's provision of an  alternative to the sea-inspection.    The Lower House of Parliament Monday praised what it called  the "belated" but "positive" French decision, expressing hope  that other countries would follow suit, end the siege on the Red  Sea port and compensate the Kingdom for the losses it has  incurred from it.    "The (French decision) reflect's France's awareness of the  correctness of Jordan's policies and the fairness of its  demands."    Al-'Aqabah Deputy Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said the U.S.  decision to end the siege on al-'Aqabah is "a victory for the  justness of the Jordanian demand over the logic of power which  was exercised over it."    Mr. al-Kabariti said the lifting of the siege should be  followed by more steps to improve the economic situation in the  country because "a stable, moderate and strong Jordan will  strengthen the cause of stability in the whole region."    Mr. al-Kabariti called on the United States to take concrete  steps towards realising President Bill Clinton's promise to help  write off some of Jordan's foreign debts, hoping the decision to  end the sanctions would constitute a first step towards  addressing the economic woes of the Kingdom, which, he said, has  been in the forefront of forces for moderation in the region.</p>

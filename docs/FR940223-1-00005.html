			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were three proposed modifications for determining the value of the components other than butterfat. One, advocated by a spokesman for Kraft General Foods, would use the average component values (tests) of the milk included in the survey of pay prices that make up the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M-W) estimated price for manufacturing grade milk. The M-W price is the basic formula price for the orders. According to the Kraft witness, use of the M-W milk component tests would provide uniformity of component prices among orders, whereas using market average tests could result in component prices that were not uniform among orders. Darigold's witness indicated that Darigold would accept this approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second modification was advanced by the witness for Northwest Independent Milk Producers (NWI). As proposed, the Class III milk price would be a formula price based on the prices for 40-pound blocks of cheddar cheese, plus a value for whey cream, minus the make allowance used by the Commodity Credit Corporation. The proponent claimed that the current Class III price (the M-W price) may be reflective of cheese production and manufacturing in Minnesota and Wisconsin, but is totally out of sync. with the real market situation in the Pacific Northwest region. The proposed Class III price is needed to improve the competitive relationship between cheesemakers in the Northwest and those in California, according to the proponent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NWI also proposed that the basic formula price provision should be amended by adding the words ``or $12.10 per hundredweight, whichever is higher for the month.'' In the view of NWI's witness, this proposal would decouple Class I prices from the radical price fluctuations that have occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for Swiss Village Cheese, a proprietary bulk tank handler under Order 135, supported MCP for that market. The witness stated that the failure to recognize varying protein tests for raw milk produces a great inequity in the Federal milk order pricing system and sends the wrong economic message to producers. He noted that the August 1992 M-W price of $12.54 per hundredweight yields a skim milk price of $10.09 with a seven cents butterfat differential. The $10.09 figure is the same, regardless of the protein content of the milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This being the case, he said, the value of a pound of protein thus varies as the test varies. If milk tests 4 percent protein, dividing the $10.09 by 4 yields a value per pound of $2.52. However, if the test is only 3 percent, the per-pound value is $3.36, or a difference of 84 cents. Thus, when a cheese plant wants the lowest-priced protein, it would want to attract the highest testing milk. In order to attract high-testing milk, cheese plant operators pay producers protein premiums or base their price on a cheese yield formula. He stressed that plants can pay a premium over the Federal order price, but cannot lower the price to a producer below the minimum Federal order price based on butterfat content. In his view, this causes handlers or cheese plants to play a price averaging game, which results in producers of low-testing milk getting paid more than their milk is worth, while producers of high-testing milk are paid less than their milk is worth. Adoption of multiple component pricing would correct this situation and provide a basis for making economically correct decisions at both the dairy farm and the plant, he concluded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Swiss Village Cheese representative presented what he believes are important factors regarding the future of the dairy industry in Idaho, and in the West in general. He indicated that: (1) Herd size will be large; (2) production per cow will be high; (3) total milk production increases will exceed population increases; (4) nearly all of the increased production will be used to make cheese; and (5) most of this ``new'' cheese will be sold to consumers in the East. In view of these factors, the witness proposed modifications to the MCP plan proposed for Order 135. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first proposed modification would use the protein test for milk that is included in estimating the M-W price. The second modification proposes adjusting the M-W price for a transportation differential (minus 10 cents) prior to determining the protein price. This proposal is based on the belief that the market for additional quantities of cheese produced in Idaho will be population centers in the eastern United States. Therefore, a price adjustment is warranted, in the view of this witness, because the cheese produced in Idaho will have to be moved long distances to find customers, and a lower price would help Idaho cheese plants be more competitive with California cheese plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third proposed modification by the Swiss Village Cheese witness called for giving milk buyers the right to reduce a producer's payment if the producer's milk had a high somatic cell count. He testified that cheese yields and cheese quality both suffer when raw milk has somatic cell counts above 300,000 per milliliter.The money deducted from payments for milk with a high somatic cell count would be returned to other producers in the pool whose milk had lower somatic cell counts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

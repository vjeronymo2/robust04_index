			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Capital spending in Wales up 8.5% CAPITAL spending in Wales is to total about Pounds 1.5bn in 1993-94, representing a year-on-year increase of 8.5 per cent, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, announced yesterday. Mr Hunt also used Welsh questions to unveil details of seven new industrial projects involving investment by companies of more than Pounds 13m. He said the projects, backed by regional selective assistance, would help create more than 600 jobs and safeguard 260 existing ones in Wales. The companies concerned include the manufacture of filtration and packaging products, precision plastic components and poultry processing. To opposition laughter, Mr Hunt said: 'The Welsh economy is already in the forefront of the economic upturn. 'We are doing very much better than the rest of the UK, the rest of Europe and many parts of the world.' Health authorities in Wales are to get an additional Pounds 750,000 to buy extra hospital treatment for their patients, Mr Gwilym Jones, the junior Welsh minister, announced in the Commons. Mr Jones said at question time that the cash would be spent on cutting waiting lists in the current financial year.</p>

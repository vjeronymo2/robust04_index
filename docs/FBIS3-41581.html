The law  provides for identifying the owners of waste and regulating  their obligations and responsibilities. It bans dumping waste  at places other than dumping grounds and lays down new rules for  transboundary waste shipment, including payment of damages  clauses.    The cabinet today gave consent to carry out negotiations in  Brussels next year on harmonizing regulations on trade in  textile articles, ferrous metals, small cattle and meat between  Bulgaria and the European Union. The members of the Bulgarian  delegation will be named later on.    The government named the Bulgarian members in the  Bulgarian-Romanian Government Commission on Environmental  Protection. The Bulgarian side will be headed by Deputy  Environment Minister Khristo Dalchev. (passage deleted)</p>

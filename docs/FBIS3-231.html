			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libreville, 2 Mar (AFP) -- The fifth conference of  African finance ministers today severely criticized the recent  "substantial and uncoordinated" devaluation of the CFA franc.  The criticisms are contained in the resolution the participants  adopted in Libreville on the last day of the meeting held under  the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Africa.    During the public examination of the draft resolution, only  Cote d'Ivoire's delegation intervened for the removal of the  portion saying that "sudden, substantial, and uncoordinated  devaluations are inefficient solutions in the African context."  Also, Cote d'Ivoire did not want the resolution to say that the  devaluation of the CFA franc was "caused by external and  internal pressures on African countries."    In the text that was adopted, the ministers and their  representatives called on the IMF and the World Bank to  henceforth take "a critical look at the issue of efficiency of  substantial devaluations in African countries. This is mainly  in view of the inflexible structures of the continent's  economies and, in particular, the steady fall in the prices of  basic cash crops."    The resolution also stressed the "negative effects of  substantial and non-coordinated devaluations on interregional  cooperation and integration" when describing the 50-percent  devaluation of the CFA franc decided on 11 January.</p>

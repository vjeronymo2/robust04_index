			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter from Khieu Samphan, head of the party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea, to the representatives of countries and  international organizations who will attend the Tokyo conference  from 10 to 12 March 1994; dated 4 March -- read by announcer]    [Text] Your excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen: as  representatives of your countries and various international  organizations or agencies, you will attend the international  conference to collect aid for Cambodia, which will be held in  Tokyo from 10 to 12 March 1994.    On behalf of the national resistance forces of Democratic  Kampuchea [DK] and the Cambodian nation and people in the  countryside, in the cities, and in Phnom Penh and abroad who  have taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese enemy  aggressors for the defense of Cambodia's land and race since  1979, I would like to submit to all of you, excellencies,  ladies, and gentlemen -- who are representatives of countries  and governments that cherish peace and justice in the world and  have all along provided firm support to the just cause of the  Cambodian nation and people -- this open letter for your  consideration.    I. In the past, the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK]  always welcomed and supported all initiatives and international  conferences aimed at mobilizing relief assistance to alleviating  the misery and suffering of the Cambodian nation and people,  victims of the Vietnamese war of aggression.    The PDK always urged that humanitarian aid provided by the  international community reach the needy Cambodian people.    The PDK's position on this matter, either before or after  the  signing of the Paris agreement, is already known to national and  international public opinion.    II. At the same time, the PDK has also done its utmost to  oppose any activities which, under the cover of assistance of  any kind, are aimed at consolidating and developing the  Vietnamese-installed regime, continuing the war in Cambodia, and  allowing communist Vietnam to swallow up the Cambodian nation  and race through military aggression, demographic invasion, and  through the power structure it has set up in Cambodia since 1979.    III. Your excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, you are not  unaware that ever since its formation, this government with two  prime ministers has been used by the Vietnamese communists and  the alliance as an instrument to launch small- and large-scale  military operations aimed at destroying the Cambodian national  resistance forces and the people in the DK's liberated zone so  that they will be able to vie for their own interests in  Cambodia.    At first, they launched the military operations against the  region of Phnom Chhat in Thmar Puok District of Battambang  Province and against Stoung in Kompong Thom Province. Then,  starting from September 1993, they have mobilized a large number  of troops with many top-ranking commanders and a huge amount of  weapons, ammunition, and other war materiel to destroy the  national resistance forces in the region of Anlung Veng in Oddar  Meanchey Province. The objective of their large-scale military  operations is to eliminate the DK forces, which support His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point idea for Cambodia to  achieve genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and  peace.    It can be said that the military operations launched by this  government with two prime ministers are against national  reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. On the surface, it is  fighting between the two-headed government's forces and the DK  forces. However, the formation of the government with two prime  ministers and the current Khmer Royal Armed Forces and the  strategic policy of the countries which they serve are known to  all.    Their true nature is that of all-round power structures set  up by the Vietnamese aggressors since 1979, with the only  difference being that the personalities of some political  parties have been put in here and there in order to mislead  national and international public opinion.    Diplomatic sources in Phnom Penh have also clearly indicated  that there have been a large number of Vietnamese forces in  Cambodia. They are to be found in various ministries, in the  puppet army, and even taking part in the fight against the  national resistance forces on various fronts, particularly on  the Anlung Veng battlefield.    Since August 1993, even though the Cambodian nation,  people, and national resistance forces have insisted on talks  among all Cambodian leaders with a view to achieving national  reconciliation and unity so as to restore peace in Cambodia, and  even though the king himself made a five-point proposal on 24  November 1993, the Vietnamese communists' puppets, such as Hun  Sen, Tie Banh, and others, have only cried out: Fight, fight,  fight!    In his proposed annual plan, Hun Sen has called for the  military strength to be expanded by forcibly enlisting students,  workers, and farmers in villages and communes so as to continue  the vietnamese war of aggression.    In its various trips abroad, the government with two prime  ministers has tried hard to buy arms and ammunition and to  request assistance regarding military equipment. It has gone so  far as to rubber-stamp communist Vietnam's sending of its troops  and war materiel into Cambodia under the cover of the so-called  cooperation on military issues between Cambodia and Vietnam  worked out during Chea Sim's trip to Hanoi at the beginning of  this month. Besides, communist Vietnam continues to send its  nationals to Cambodia under the framework of its strategy to  swallow up Cambodia through demographic invasion. The number of  those Vietnamese in Cambodia has increased to nearly four  million. This is indeed a very big threat to the survival of  the Cambodian nation and people.    IV. In brief, we can see that Vietnam's war of aggression  continues unabated either through military war or demographic  invasion or through the power structures it has set up since  1979.    In such a situation, will the assistance of all kinds  provided by the international community to the government with  two prime ministers be able to rebuild the country? Or will it  be helpful to the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the  alliance in continuing to kindle the flames of war that will  bring about ruin and destruction for Cambodia and its people and  death to the Cambodian nation and race?    During the past 14 to 15 years, especially after the signing  of the Paris agreement, have the Vietnamese communist puppets  built anything in the interests of the Cambodian nation and  people with the huge amount of assistance -- worth millions of  dollars -- given to Cambodia by the international community?  Rather, have they not used all that money to expand their war  machinery and their instruments for repressing the Cambodian  people?    Every dollar given by you to the victimized Cambodian people  as humanitarian aid has been diverted by the Vitnamese puppets  to buy ammunition and poisonous products to kill the Cambodian  nation and people.    Past experiences show that the assistance generously  provided  by the international community to Cambodia will certainly be  transformed into weapons used by the Vietnamese communists, the  Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance to carry on the war to kill  the Cambodian nation and race -- which is what they have been  doing ever since the formation of this government with two prime  ministers.    The flames of the war will flare up with no end in sight.    In such a situation, will the assistance to be provided by  the international community for the construction of Cambodia not  be in contrast to your purpose? If so, how will this affect  your consciences as the representatives of the peace- and  justice-loving countries and governments who want to help  relieve the Cambodian nation and people from misery and  suffering?    If the Vietnamese war of aggression continues in Cambodia,  will it be beneficial to Cambodia as well as to the strategic,  political, and economic interests of the countries in this  region or not? Will communist Vietnam, which annexed Laos and  Cambodia, not be a threat to regional security?    On the contrary, if the assistance is used to compel the  government with two prime ministers to accept and implement the  five-point guideline of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk so  that Cambodia achieves genuine national reconciliation, national  unity and peace, will this not be a benefit to Cambodia and the  region as well?    Once Cambodia has national reconciliation and peace and  investment from countries near and far, will this not help to  ensure the security, stability, and prosperity of the Southeast  Asian region?    V. On behalf of the PDK and the Cambodian people who have  taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese aggressors for  the defense of their nation and race as well as for peace and  security in this region, I would like to make a sincere appeal  to you, the representatives of peace- and justice-loving  countries and governments and of the international  organizations, to consider whether to provide the assistance in  a way that will help the Vietnamese communists, their puppets,  and the alliance continue their war to kill the Cambodian nation  and people and menace regional peace and security, or instead to  use this assistance to compel the government with two prime  ministers to accept and implement the five-point guideline of  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk that will pave the way for the  achievement of genuine national reconciliation, national unity,  and peace in Cambodia, thus strengthening peace and security in  the region -- a way which is the best for peace in Cambodia and  in the region.    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, head of the PDK    [Dated] 4 March 1994</p>

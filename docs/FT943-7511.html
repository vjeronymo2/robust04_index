			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Health check for your company - Questions entrepreneurs should be asking As you head back from the summer holiday, how healthy is your business? As every entrepreneur who has survived the past few years will know, growing after a recession is fraught with danger as cash flow is stretched while resources have yet to be replenished by profits. But there are many more pitfalls. With the help of a quiz put together by accountants Blick Rothenberg, you can decide whether your business is in as good shape as your suntan. Interest rates. While rates are at their lowest level for years, some pundits say they will edge up again in the near future. What effect might this have on your company's profitability? Work out your interest cover - the number of times interest payable is covered by pre-tax profits before interest. Is your number (a) more than 5 (b) between 2 and 5 (c) between 1 and 2 (d) less than 1? Dependence on one customer. Work out what percentage of your turnover your largest customer accounts for. Is it (a) less than 5 per cent of turnover (b) 5-10 per cent (c) 10-20 per cent (d) more than 20 per cent? Loss of several customers. How important are your five largest customer accounts? (a) less than 10 per cent of sales (b) 10-20 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent? Suppliers. Is there one supplier who accounts for a large percentage of your materials? Does your largest supplier supply (a) less than 10 per cent of your key materials (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50 per cent? Key suppliers. Who are the managers responsible for the key functions in your business - sales, marketing, production, personnel, distribution or finance? How long could you continue if one of them left before the need to replace them became urgent? (a) more than 12 months (b) six to 12 months (c) one to six months (d) less than one month? Workforce. Have you increased or cut your workforce recently? If so, by what percentage in the past 12 months? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50 per cent? Turnover. How quickly has your turnover risen or fallen in the past 12 months? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50 per cent? Plant and equipment. Have you made any large purchases in the past 12 months? If so, what percentage of the cashflow of your business have your committed in this area? (a) less than 25 per cent (b) 25-50 per cent (c) 50-100 per cent (d) more than 100 per cent? Profit margins. Have your profit margins dropped in the past 12 months? If so, by how much? (a) less than 10 per cent (b) 10-25 per cent (c) 25-50 per cent (d) more than 50 per cent? Quick asset ratio. Calculate your quick asset ratio - the ratio of your current assets, excluding stock, to your current liabilities. Is it (a) more than 1.2 (b) between 1 and 1.2 (c) between 0.7 and 1 (d) less than 0.7? Assessment. For each question you have answered, score as follows: (a) 4 (b) 3 (c) 2 and (d) 1. If you scored more than 30 points you are running a splendidly stable business, Blick Rothenberg says. You might as well have stayed on the beach because your business is so stable it would not miss you. If you scored between 22 and 30 points, you are more vulnerable but you also have more excitement in your life. A score of between 15 and 21 points indicates you are likely to return to some nervous creditors. If you scored under 15 points, go back to the beach and recruit someone who scored above 22 points because you could be in serious trouble.</p>

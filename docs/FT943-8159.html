			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US partners in Kamchatka gold venture Asarco, the US non-ferrous metals producer, is a member of a joint venture partnership that has made the winning bid to develop a gold mine on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Russian Far East. The partners, having bid less than USDollars 1m, expect to spend about Dollars 30m to develop a mine that, from about 1997 onwards, will produce 160,000 troy ounces of gold a year. Asarco and Grynberg Resources of Denver will each have 25 per cent of Kamgold, a company set up for the project. The other half of Kamgold will be held by Kamchatgeologia, a local Russian group. Kamgold expects to receive a licence from the Russian government in October to begin development of the Aginskoe deposit, located in the southern part of Kamchatka, about 50 miles by road west of Milkova, a town with a population of 12,000. Asarco says that the deposit contains proven reserves of 1m tonnes of ore containing an average of one ounce of gold per tonne and there is potential for additional reserves. About 52,000 metres of underground development and 160,000 metres of drilling has already been completed by the Russians. When completed, the mine will employ 300, most of them locals. It is expected to contribute Dollars 17m a year to the local economy. Kamgold will seek multilateral agency financing for the project. Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, says that his group has been looking for investment opportunities in the Commonwealth of Independent States and other parts of eastern Europe for some time.</p>

The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions; although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirement through cash contributions. Therefore, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% of total project cost).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The non-Federal share may be met by cash or through the provision of in-kind property or services, but only to the extent that cash or property is from any source (including any Federal agency where legislation or regulation authorizes using specific types of funds for a match) other than a program, contract or grant authorized under the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended. An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application. A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3) of the Native American Program Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

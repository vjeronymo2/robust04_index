			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (9): The motorway effect arrives late in the north - The home counties THE OPENING of the M40 extension, providing a fast link from London to Birmingham, was expected to have an impact on the surrounding areas. But its timing, coinciding with the Gulf war and the worst of the recession, meant that only recently have the anticipated effects begun to be seen, observes James Kennedy-Cooke, of DTZ Debenham Thorpe. The new Charwell Valley services at junction 10, to open next summer, should add impetus to the warehouse market. And at nearby junction 11, AMEC and Abbey Life have just completed the 103,000 sq ft MXL centre, at Banbury - the M40's only high-quality distribution centre. Oxford city centre has seen a gradual revival in demand over the past six months, says Scott Harkness, of surveyor Adkin Commercial. He estimates that, during this time, 45,000 sq ft of good modern space has been let. Adding smaller developments and second-hand space to that would take the total to between 80,000 and 109,000 sq ft. In common with many other locations, central Oxford has seen virtually no speculative developments completed in the past three years. And though there is still space available, it is slowly being taken up. In Cambridge, activity revolves around research-based and technology industries. Some companies are now looking at further expansion. There is, says John Tweddle, of surveyor Bidwells, a strong resurgence of interest in this sector, with a spate of lettings at the Cambridge Science Park and several proposals to add to or create new premises. In addition, developer Bride Hall, says Andrew Lawrence, of surveyor Connells Commercial, is busy with a new phase at the science park, where rents range from around Pounds 10 to Pounds 12 a sq ft - down from their peak of Pounds 14 to Pounds 15. It is a different picture in the city centre, where rents peaked at around Pounds 23 a sq ft but have now halved. Available space stands at between 600,000 sq ft and 700,000 sq ft, Mr Lawrence estimates. However, that compares with some 1m sq ft two years ago. At Ipswich, Kim Watson-Powell, of Bidwells, sees signs of a revival of interest, mainly from professional firms.  However, although there is a great deal of talk, it has yet to be translated into actual transactions. Ipswich suffers from a shortage of good-quality office space and an almost total absence of 'institutional' quality buildings. At Chelmsford, 1992 is reckoned to have been the low point in the office market. Only 30,000 sq ft was taken up. This year, that figure should at least double, particularly if Tarmac Brookglade's 36,000 sq ft County House, currently under offer, is duly signed up, says Nicholas Jones, of Nelson Bakewell, who adds that there will then be no new offices available in lot sizes of over 10,000 sq ft. Basildon is not an established office centre, and activity is centred on out-of-town space. Recent lettings include 43,000 sq ft by Ford Motor Company at Trafalgar House's Southfields Business Park, where there is now only around 3,500 sq ft still available, according to Stuart Mole, of surveyor Glenny. Demand has picked up, although it is still inconsistent, he adds. South Bedfordshire towns, including Luton and Bedford, are suffering from an over-supply of new space. The area has been affected by cuts at General Motors over the past 10 years, and unemployment is high. There has been little speculative development since Capability Green in the mid-1980s, says Roger Saper, of Jones Lang Wootton. The 90-acre business park, where 350,000 sq ft has been built, now houses tenants that include Whitbread, Barclays, Nabisco and Siemens. There is 33 acres for development at the park, which boasts as high a standard as any in the UK. Jones Lang Wootton are now marketing the entire development on behalf of the estate of NH Phillips, the original developer. There has been some interest in buildings at the 35-acre Houghton Hall Park, at Houghton Regis. The striking Herculean building offers a total of 60,000 sq ft in three wings, and has been developed by Danish consortium Laserglide. Glaxo, which is building a new research campus on a 75-acre site in Gunnels Wood, dominates the current market in Stevenage. The pharmaceutical giant already has a further 25-acre site for expansion. But it is also understood to be on the look-out for more sites in the Gunnels Wood area. The largest office letting in Stevenage in the past 18 months was in Gunnels Wood, where Penta Technologies took the 16,000 sq ft Chadwell House at Universities Superannuation Scheme's business and industrial park. On a 10-year lease, rent rises to Pounds 200,000 in the fifth year. In the town centre, one of the largest office buildings available is Cramond Lelliot's 68,250 sq ft Kings Court, close to the railway station. Asking rent is Pounds 17.50 a sq ft. Markheath's King's Court, a 22-acre site again close to the station, has infrastructure in place for 600,000 sq ft of offices. It is one of six sites identified by the Hertfordshire Development Organisation's marketing plan as of strategic significance in attracting inward investment from overseas. The Reading office market received a boost early this year with news of the sale of Kumagai Gumi/Ranelagh Developments' 121 Kings Road for some Pounds 45m, to OIL Property Investment, the property investment arm of the German Hypo Bank. This sale, at a yield of just over 9.3 per cent, was one of the first of a growing number of provincial office investments made by overseas investors. Tarmac's 29,000 sq ft Adelphi House, let to the DSS, is also said to be attracting interest at yields of 7-7.5 per cent. The only new building in central Reading due for completion within the next two years, says Mr Head, will be CIN's 51,000 sq ft Phoenix House adjoining the station. However, Tim Warboys, of Jones Lang Wootton, says that the firm has received a conditional offer for the post office site, again next to the station, subject to planning consent for 50,000 sq ft of offices and the refurbishment of the original post office. Competition from out of town comes from Arlington's 720,000 sq ft business park at Theale, where KPMG Peat Marwick has signed up a 30,000 sq ft pre-let. Arlington is quoting rents of Pounds 24.50 a sq ft - and this figure looks likely to be repeated for new space in the town centre.</p>

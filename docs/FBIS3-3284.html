			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Qian Qichen says that although  China's 1994 military budget looks bigger, the increase in the  budget is only being made to offset inflation.    Qian Qichen made the statement at a press conference in  Beijing on Wednesday [16 March]. Li Peichun has a highlight.    [Begin recording] China will spend about 52 billion yuan  this year on defense, about 20 percent higher than last year.  But Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this doesn't mean China  is trying to make itself into a regional power.    The foreign minister said in 1993 the inflation rate was 13  percent and is expected to be 10 percent this year. So actual  military spending remains the same. The foreign minister said  China's military budget accounts for 1.7 percent of the gross  domestic product. He said China's military budget is tiny  compared to other countries, such as the United States and  Japan. Qian Qichen said this is proof that China is concerned  about economic development and not about being a military power.    The Chinese foreign minister also said he was a bit  disappointed with his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher in Beijing last weekend. He said: Although the  talks produced some agreements on specific measures to eliminate  problems caused by the human rights issue, China was ready for  more substantive talks.    Qian Qichen said: Beijing invited Christopher in hopes the  two sides could improve bilateral ties, but the foreign minister  said there were events just before Christopher's arrival which  showed that the United States was not being completely sincere.  The foreign minister said both governments realized that the  worsening of relations will have adverse effect on their  economies. Dialogues will continue until June when the Clinton  administration decides whether or not to renew China's MFN [most  favored nation] status. Qian Qichen said any specific plan will  be made in accordance with the wishes of both governments. He  said neither country should interfere in the other's internal  affairs. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 4 -- Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy  criticized Solidarity's strivings to gain a dominant position in  workers' representation during a meeting with the Warsaw-based  FSO car plant on Wednesday. "I do not accept the union which  has the overthrowing of the government as its aim," Oleksy said.  "Solidarity's historical achievements are enormous but the  proclamation of a general strike is a last resort all over the  world. I do not think that the situation in the country  justifies such a need," added the Sejm speaker.    According to Oleksy, workers' incomes will be ever more  differentiated. "The thing is, though, not to forget about an  elementary sense of social justice. The notion of social  justice was rejected four years ago. This government is trying  to implement a different strategy," stated Oleksy.    The Sejm speaker also said that four years ago FSO was  condemned to destruction by some politicians. "Today it is a  prosperous plant which has prospects for development. This  proves that it is necessary to create own, Polish solutions  instead of plagiarizing western solutions, which often do not  correspond to the Polish reality," concluded the Sejm speaker.</p>

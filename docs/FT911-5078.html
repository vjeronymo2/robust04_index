			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Estate agents see thaw start in housing market FURTHER evidence of the start of a slow thaw in the housing market is provided by a survey of English and Welsh estate agents published today. In the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors survey, agents reported a modest but widespread increase in the number of buyers looking for homes last month. The study was conducted before last week's announcement of a further reduction in interest rates. Building societies and banks have also noticed an increase in mortgage inquiries from customers. John Laing construction group says it sold more homes in the week before last than in any week during the past two years. According to Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest society, house prices rose by 0.9 per cent last month, the first monthly rise in its house price index since September. Estate agents say that demand has grown for lower-priced properties in particular. Prices, however, remained generally static. The recovery remains fragile, according to the RICS. Optimism over falling interest rates has been offset in some areas by concern over rising local unemployment because of the recession. The collapse of Air Europe and other redundancies, for example, has led to a rise in repossessions in Crawley and Horsham in Sussex. More than three quarters of the 63 English and Welsh estate agents questioned last month said prices had failed to move during the three months to the end of March. Most of the previous surveys conducted by the RICS during the past two years have shown a high proportion of estate agents reporting price falls. Mr Edward Waterson of estate agents Carter Jonas in North Yorkshire said: 'Life is being breathed back into the market, aided by falling interest rates and a feeling that the bottom of the market has been reached.' Mr Andrew Spittle of James and Lister Lea in Solihull in the West Midlands said: 'Over the past month we have experienced a significant upturn in activity, with more prospective purchasers looking for properties and an increased volume of properties coming on to the market. No increase in house prices has been noted but properties are proving easier to sell.' London estate agents also reported a slight improvement in demand. Mr Conrad Mazen of Copping Joyce in Islington, north London, said: 'Although we are not being inundated with new buyers, those that are looking appear to be more serious and more sensible offers are being made.'</p>

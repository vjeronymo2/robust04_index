			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Factors combine to send Dow lower Wall Street THE COMBINATION of bankruptcy filings by the property developer, Olympia &amp; York, and expiration of stock index futures and options pushed US share prices lower yesterday morning, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 15.79 at 3,353.09, but lows were more than 20 below that. The more broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.06 at 410.08, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.03 to 574.43. NYSE turnover was 192m shares, and for the second consecutive day declines outnumbered rises by 1,037 to 620. A bigger-than-expected 0.9 per cent rise in April industrial production failed to lift sentiment, which has been depressed since the Dow reached a record high on Monday. Subsequently there has been concern that the market may have been overbought in recent weeks. The 'double witching' expiration of stock index futures and options added to the downward pressure on prices late in the session, while investors were also unsettled by the overnight news that O&amp;Y had filed for protection from its creditors under Canadian and US bankruptcy laws. There was some support, however, from the bond market, where news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve of a weakening in local business conditions lifted prices at the long end, in the process lowering the yield on the 30-year bond to just over 7.8 per cent. The troubles at O&amp;Y forced bank stocks lower, although they all recovered some of the early losses. O&amp;Y's prime lending banks were hardest hit, troubled by worries that they will have to make further bad debt provisions or loan write-offs in the wake of the bankruptcy. Citicorp fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 , Chemical by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 37 1/2 , and JPMorgan by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 55. Among others, Bankers Trust lost Dollars 1 at Dollars 58 1/8 and Chase Manhattan was down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 29 3/8 , although BankAmerica recovered to end up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 . ADRs in Unilever fell Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 102 1/8 in busy trading after the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate reported first quarter net income below analysts' estimates. Briggs &amp; Stratton fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 46 after Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the broking house, removed the engineering company's stock from its list of recommended issues. Canada TORONTO share prices spent the day inside a narrow range and closed steady, with the coming holiday weekend seeming to have more influence on trading than last night's bankruptcy filing by Olympia &amp; York Developments. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 3.12 points, or 0.09 per cent, closing at 3,391.43. On the week, the composite gained about 17 points, or about 0.5 per cent. In today's trading, declines outnumbered advances by 261 to 254, the total volume of 20.20m shares was below yesterday's 28.02m shares, and trading value was CDollars 230.2m compared with CDollars 315.3 m. There are fears that the lenders might become more reluctant to supply real estate concerns with funds. That helped push Trizec -B- shares 1/4 lower to 6.O&amp;Y holds roughly 35 per cent of Trizec. The banking group posted an index gain of 0.90 per cent with Canadian Imperial Bank up  7/8 to 28  1/4 , Royal Bank of Canada off  1/8 to 23 5/8 , Bank of Montreal up  3/8 to 43  1/4 , Bank of Nova Scotia up  1/8 to 19  7/8 , Toronto Dominion Bank up  1/8 to 16  7/8 and National Bank of Canada up 1/4 to 8 3/4.</p>

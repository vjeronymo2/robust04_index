			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Viktor Chemodurov "Commentary": "Rutskoy </F> Attacks the Provinces"]    [Text] Kursk -- Aleksandr Rutskoy has been spending a few  days in Kursk, combining the celebration of his mother's  birthday with a series of public speeches to the people of his  own region. The character of the speeches is not in doubt: The  former vice president has launched an energetic campaign to win  votes in the future presidential election. He is doing so,  moreover, in the provinces, which to a large extent will  determine the outcome.    The former vice president now states in plain terms only one  or, to be more precise, two interrelated goals: Repealing the  current Constitution and holding an early election. He has said  not a single word about any intention on his part to run when  the time comes, but that does not, of course, mean that there is  no such intention. That intention is clear in every word  uttered by the garrulous orator, who adroitly brought the  audience at the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture  complex around to the idea that no better "savior of Russia"  than he is to be found. And he did so by the method of  negation, so to speak.    It was a rare politician who did not get a mention in his  impassioned monologue, and it turns out that there is indeed no  one worthier than Aleksandr Vladimir in Russia. Scathing,  off-the-cuff descriptions were dished out right and left. There  was no need to say anything even about our currently thriving  president or the "Yeltsin gang" -- for them there is only "one  route, the route to the cells." Viktor Chernomyrdin, the  "presidential appointee," repeats over and over his favorite  saying "let's work, let's work," but does nothing.    The former vice president's vocabulary has become  substantially richer of late as regards the democratic  reformers. Many newer descriptions have appeared to supplement  widely known ones such as the "kids in pink pants". For  example, the minister for nationalities questions is suspect  because he "only learned to blow his nose five years ago." And  how, the orator asked, "was it possible to entrust the economy  to someone who has never held anything except a spoon, a  fountain-pen, and perhaps one other thing in his hands?!" Guess  who?    Roughly the same was said of representatives of the various  shades of opposition. The name "Travkin-Murkin" (my apologies,  I merely quote -- V.Ch.) is reinforced by the image of a  weathercock. Ivan Rybkin "has trimmed to fit the mold." While  Gennadiy Zyuganov is blameworthy because Rutskoy saw him on TV  on 2 October last urging the population to refrain from  demonstrations or other dangerous acts.    And so it went on. I apologize to all the people mentioned  here for citing these coarse insults. I do so only because  readers and voters should know what language our head of state  will be using with Russia and the rest of the world if Rutskoy  fills that role.    And the fear does exist, after all, that he could. At any  rate, it should not be discounted. The "democratic" language of  the barrack room, spiced with populist views on politics and the  economy, falls on fertile soil and does go down well, you know.  At the Khimvolokno joint-stock company's culture complex, the  hall, designed to hold 700 people, accommodated at least twice  that number, and thousands were left outside to listen through  loudspeakers. It would be bad enough if they had simply  listened and formed critical judgments, but they excitedly  applauded passages in Rutskoy's speech....    Clearly, aware himself of a certain similarity, Aleksandr  Vladimirovich deemed it necessary to stress his difference from  Zhirinovskiy, and he did this, of course, in his own inimitable  way: "You mustn't bamboozle people as Vladimir Volfovich does;  I have told him repeatedly: Cool it, man, cool it!"    Of course, Rutskoy acts much more subtly and adroitly than  Zhirinovskiy. On the whole his speech produced a perfectly  seemly impression. Everything looks as if it is dictated by  great concern for the country's future and for the people and is  emotional only for that reason. And even the coarse language  that spilled off Aleksandr Vladimirovich's lips caused a hum of  approval: Everyone understood that he spoke from the heart --  the disgraceful things going on around us are more than a person  can endure! Moreover, it turns out that this person is simple  and down to earth.    Great doubt arises, however, as to whether there is a  fundamental difference between the "concepts" of Rutskoy and  those of Zhirinovskiy. True, Aleksandr Vladimirovich did  repeatedly stress that order in the country must be introduced  by "economic methods." But here he recalled with manifest  pleasure a little scene espied in Singapore: Right in front of  him policemen were using bamboo sticks to administer a lesson to  an offender who had discarded a cigarette stub or spat in the  street....    But all this finds a broad and very vigorous response in  conditions where local authorities demonstrate a staggering lack  of will in pursuing reforms; where representatives of the  authorities actually steal everything that is not nailed down by  the state and create nothing at all for the common good; and  where in the last oblast Duma elections the heads of  administration roughly elbowed aside all candidates capable of  bringing into local lawmaking the interests of other social  groups and strata, have since impoverished local lawmaking to  the maximum extent, and now hold sessions without even letting  representatives of the press in.    These are the conditions in which leaders like Rutskoy are  snatching success. It is certainly time for politicians --  major and minor -- to open their eyes and realize that it will  not be only the capital voting in the forthcoming presidential  election. If things do not change very quickly in the provinces,  then (God forbid!) the prophecy of a great cataclysm in Russia  will come to pass. And that cataclysm will come not from the  East but from places like Kursk or Voronezh. At any rate, that  is the way it looks today to your observer from the provinces.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): At last, the real history of banking INTERNATIONAL BANKING 1870-1914 edited by Rondo Cameron and V I Bovykin Oxford Pounds 68, 655 pages BANKING IS an industry remarkable for its lack of history. Not in the sense that the activity of banking has no history: Professor Rondo Cameron reminds us that there were multinational banks as early as the 13th century. By the time of the Medici bank 200 years later, financiers had discovered the advantages of holding companies for controlling sprawling networks of international branches. Rather, the history is curiously unwritten, particularly in its later stages. Banking, after all, has long been vital to and inseparable from the trading impulses which move goods and services around the world. Yet we remain largely ignorant of the way in which banks responded to a demand for capital that became ever more international and intense after 1870. As Professors Cameron and Bovykin point out, in the period to the outbreak of World War One, international commerce grew at the unprecedented rate of more than 3 per cent per annum for the world as a whole, and much faster than that for the leading commercial nations. International investment forged ahead in similar fashion. Britain was singly responsible for 40 per cent of total foreign investment, but other western European nations also provided huge credits to borrowers such as the US, the Russian Empire, Latin America and Oceania. The market for capital became more integrated and international than ever. But what role did banks play in the process? And what were the reciprocal effects of nations' progress towards industrialisation on the banks themselves In an impressive attempt to address these questions, Cameron and Bovykin have orchestrated an army of scholars. They set out with the view that international activity was crucial to an understanding of the mechanisms by which banking structures in individual countries were formed into shapes recognisable as the precursors of today's systems. In 1870 Britain, for example, had the largest foreign investments and the best developed banking system. However, UK domestic banks were scarcely involved in international activity before 1890. Foreign investment was handled mainly by the private banks, which exploited their extensive overseas connections through the London Stock Exchange. Even when the domestic banks did become involved, they tended to do so indirectly, placing deposits at the disposal of bill brokers and discount houses for the short-term financing of trade. By contrast, Cameron suggests that in Europe there was a closer identity of interests between the private and joint stock bankers, with the result that the latter played a greater role in the mobilisation and deployment of capital for foreign investment. Obviously, however, there were considerable national differences and these are usefully explored by the various contributors. So too is the way in which the formation of national banking systems was influenced by the experience and activities of the international lenders. The single conclusion for which this volume will long be remembered concerns banks and those other conduits of capital, the multinational corporations. Contrary to their expectations, Cameron and Bovykin found that banks were not responsible for the emergence of multinational industrial enterprises. The banks certainly facilitated their expansion, mainly by providing short-term working capital and by financing the international movement of commodities. But their foreign investments were mostly undertaken in direct transactions with governments or in the form of social overhead capital, especially railways. With minor exceptions, banks did not take the initiative in organising trading concerns, nor did they control large volumes of equity capital. By and large, industrial companies grew by self-investment. Indeed, the final section of the book examines the rise of multinationals across a series of industries, from oil to electrotechnologies, and gives plenty of evidence for the bankers' reticence. One proposed chapter on the chemical industry was abandoned when the author showed that there was simply too little bank involvement to be of interest. Cameron posits a straightforward explanation. In both its private and joint stock forms, international banking had already developed into a highly specialised business. Its leaders recognised their risk-taking as quite distinct from that of industrial entrepreneurs, and where they paid too little heed to that central observation, they usually regretted it. By any standard, Cameron and Bovykin have put together an important volume. In the impoverished context of banking history, the book stands out as a key work which will form the basis of much future study. If there is a criticism, it is that the project has been too long in the making - it was conceived a decade ago, when it was remarkable for its cooperation between then Soviet and western historians. Inevitably, that seems less extraordinary today. Although there is a neat circularity about descriptions of bankers to the Russian empire, the reader cannot help noticing ideological confusion among some contributors which obscures important questions. There is, for example, an unhelpful debate on the connection between international banking and capitalist imperialism. It is a relief when Cameron dispatches the subject in a telling but diplomatic conclusion. Britain, which had both the largest empire and the most money to lend, made more than half of its foreign investments in independent countries. As for France, less than 10 per cent of its investments went to French colonies. The notion of a systematic connection between foreign investment and imperialism fails the simplest examination.</p>

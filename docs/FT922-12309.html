			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Signs of recovery seen in N England STATISTICAL evidence for recovery has emerged in northern England. Kirklees and Wakefield chamber of commerce and industry, which covers West Yorkshire south of the M62, says many local indicators of economic performance are now at their best for 24 months. The chamber, which surveys a representative sample of 120 companies each quarter, says sales and orders started rising again in the first quarter of the year. The indications, it says, suggest a sluggish recovery. Levels of trade are only back where they were when recession began to affect the north in 1990. Nevertheless, the chamber's quarterly survey shows the first positive balance figures - the difference between the proportion of companies reporting rises and falls in sales and orders - since the recession began. Quarterly comparison of balance figures for domestic deliveries gives the local trend. It was minus 48 percentage points in the first quarter of last year, minus 31 points in the second and third quarters, and minus 18 points in October-December. The latest survey shows plus 5 percentage points for the first quarter this year - 33 per cent reported rises and 28 per cent falls. Domestic orders show a positive balance of 10 per cent after four negative quarters last year. Since the balance for orders was minus 16 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year and deliveries have suddenly speeded up so far this year, it suggests that orders have shot up only in recent months and businesses have been able to fill them quickly. The test of whether this really is the beginning of recovery, rather than industrial customers replenishing depleted stocks on a just-in-time basis, will start to show only at the end of the current quarter, when more statistics become available. The Kirklees chamber survey also shows small positive balance figures for exports deliveries and orders. The effect on confidence has been immediate, with positive balances for investment in buildings, plant and machinery.</p>

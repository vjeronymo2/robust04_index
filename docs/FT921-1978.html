			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wilkes 66% lower at Pounds 2m after asset write-down JAMES WILKES, the engineering company fighting a hostile bid from Petrocon, yesterday reported pre-tax profits down 66 per cent in 1991 after a large exceptional write-down of assets to be sold. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.61m to Pounds 1.89m but at the operating level profits were only 5 per cent lower before the Pounds 2.76m exceptional item. The company is recommending a 5.25p final dividend, giving an unchanged 10p for the year, even though earnings per share fell from 22.4p to 4.6p. Mr Arthur Watt, Wilkes chairman, said the results were excellent given the recession. The exceptionals related to the closure of the aviation business and head office mansion. Wilkes said its bankers, NM Rothschild, had written to Petrocon saying it would withdraw a Pounds 7.25m credit line if the bid was successful. Rothschild's corporate finance department is advising Wilkes but the bank says its lending decision was made independently based on its lack of knowledge of Petrocon. A Petrocon adviser said the bidding company was prudent and that the borrowings revealed by Wilkes in its defence document were exactly as anticipated. Petrocon said that its final offer, worth 151p a share and valuing Wilkes at Pounds 27.5m, was generous, representing an historic earnings multiple of 33. Wilkes also stepped up its attack on Petrocon's management and in particular the record of Mr Colin Robinson, its chairman. Wilkes said there was little evidence to suggest Mr Robinson could develop businesses and that he had rarely held a company stewardship position for a sustained period. Mr Robinson said Wilkes had been selective in not highlighting his management successes at GEC and Heron Corporation.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Gardening: Digging in to stop the rot Sharp weather concentrates the mind, and the past week raises questions of frost and damp. Despite appearances, though, the frosts have not been so lethal as weatherpersons inclined us to think. I measure them by the scale of 1991 when frost at the same season damaged many of my half-hardy plants, including penstemons, beyond recovery. This year, their top growth is unscathed, partly because the previous weeks had been colder and their growth had slowed already. I had also taken a precaution, which I recommend. Just before the freeze, I double-wrapped my marginals in that great newcomer to garden centres, Fibre Fleece. This is a thin, white drape, like a nylon scarf, which takes many degrees off the frost or wind while allowing water to pass through and reach the roots of plants underneath. Now, we can wrap up vulnerable plants without exposing them to drought or rot. Thanks to Fibre Fleece, I still have unscorched silver convolvulus, living diascias and last year's verbena. Fibre Fleece comes in amply-priced packs for people with a few plants which they treat like pets. Those with bigger gardens should look for the large rolls at the back of the store: otherwise, they are available from such trade suppliers of garden goods as Joseph Bentley on Humberside. Owners of bigger gardens need to shop around. I wish there was a similar fleecing that would cope with the problem of damp. Between now and March, this is as much of a killer as frost, but we hear less about it because its effects are more haphazard. The thaw after a hard frost begins the problem. The frost upsets the fleshy leaves on plants like the blue-flowered agapanthus; but the lethal consequence is the damp, which then sits on the main crown and causes the plant to rot. The other day, I read an expert who was saying that my latest pleasures, the late-flowering schizostylis, are not fully hardy in winter. What he means (an expert grower assured me) is that, sometimes, they will rot away in a wet winter or after a thaw. This weakness is widespread, not least among plants with silver leaves. As the frost leaves us, how are we to cope with damp? On a small scale, we can dig grit or gravel round the roots and necks of alpines, pinks and silver plants when first we put them into the ground. Even now, we can usefully surround them with a layer of gravel to sharpen drainage until spring. On a larger scale, I find the problem more perplexing. How, for instance, do you deal with endemic damp all over a flower bed? The only answer is to drain it; but I have always skipped the ritual chapter on herring-bone drains in the old gardening dictionaries. The FT forgot to check this point before engaging me, but in those days they had the late Arthur Hellyer instead. He had land-drained and herring-drained more square rods of soil than any of us. What, then, does Hellyer recommend for beds which are turning into a swamp? His Gardening Encyclopedia (the 1993 edition is published by Hamlyn at the remarkably low price of Pounds 14.99 for 784 pages) is clear and uncompromising. On wet land, dig narrow trenches about 12 ft apart down to the level where the sub-soil becomes a pan on which the water sits. I have had a trench-digger; as a result, my future carrot bed looks like roadworks, with a pattern of trenches in which water is now sitting or trickling. Perfectionists would now lay drainpipes at this level, but I am not entirely sure we have reached the level where they are most effective. The easier option is to fill each trench with better drainage: Hellyer recommends well-burned clinkers from a boiler because they are especially hard and angular. No doubt clinkers would solve the problem - but, out in the modern Cotswolds, they have given way to gas. Certainly, a system of trenches is the answer to a poorly-drained area, but the cheapest possibility is to trust Hellyer and choose a faggot drain instead. This under-publicised option has much going for it. You find your faggots, lay them end to end in the trenches, cover them with turf (placed with the grass downwards), and then replace the topsoil to cover the burial. 'Well-made faggot drains will remain effective for years,' says Hellyer; in our gadget-minded generation, though, most of us probably have forgotten about them. The question arises: where do you find a suitable faggot? Country residents will have no problems: they need only to cut bundles of brushwood from a hedgerow, choosing hazel wherever possible. These bundles can be dropped into the trench, but you need to be sure the wood is not too soft or short of side branches. Then, you surface with turf and replace enough soil for a decent cabbage on top. If you cannot fleece it, faggot it: damp, at least, can be drained away, whereas frost retains the unpredictability which caught us all short this week and makes winter survival such a hazard.</p>

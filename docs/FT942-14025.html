			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK-China act to contain HK property prices Britain and China have acted to cool Hong Kong's overheated property market by increasing the annual allocation of new land for residential and commercial development, in a move which might presage the resumption of Sino-British co-operation over the territory. At a meeting of the Sino-British Land Commission, a bilateral body which governs government land sales, the two agreed on a 35 per cent increase to 31.4 hectares in land for residential, commercial and industrial development. Rising property prices have been a main political issue in Hong Kong this year. Chinese government officials and the Hong Kong government have seized on it to underline their concern for the public's welfare. Although few expect a dramatic improvement in Sino-British ties, the swift, businesslike meeting of the Land Commission suggested a more positive tone to bilateral discussions, something which has been visible in other contacts as well. This improvement comes at a time of heightened speculation that Mr Lu Ping, Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, is about to pay his first visit to the colony since January 1992. Property analysts said the announcement of the increased land allocation may have the effect of restraining price rises in the short term, but they doubted that it was sufficient to solve the supply problem in Hong Kong. Governor Chris Patten said late last month that the steep rises in Hong Kong property values, especially house prices, demanded 'exceptional' measures. Action has been promised by July. Over the past year the price of a 600 sq ft flat on the south side of Hong Kong island has risen about 40 per cent to HKDollars 3.5m (Pounds 299,145) from around HKDollars 2.5m.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S VISIONS ENJOY NEW SURGE IN POPULARITY;  </P> <P> DESIGN: THE FAMED ARCHITECT'S WORK IS SHOWING UP IN BUILDINGS, JEWELRY,  FURNITURE, T-SHIRTS AND NOTEPAPER AND COMMANDING HIGH PRICES.  </P> <P> Frank Lloyd Wright liked to furnish the homes he built, thus assuring that  nothing in his carefully executed designs was left to chance.  </P> <P> While the architect's works were reviled by many during his lifetime, they are  enjoying an unprecedented revival more than 30 years after his death.  </P> <P> Tourists are flocking to the public buildings and private residences he built,  and the seemingly countless items of furniture and home accessories attributed  to him continue to grow.  </P> <P> Although you couldn't give away his furniture for years, copies now  manufactured in Italy and marketed in the United States by Atelier  International sell at prices into five figures. Tiffany &amp; Co. does a  thriving business in reproductions of crystal, silver and china. Schumacher has  introduced Frank Lloyd Wright fabric, wall coverings and rugs, and  Oakbrook-Esser Studios of Oconomowoc, Wis., fabricates art glass windows.  </P> <P> Beyond Wright's own works, his influence on others seems to be growing. There  are 40 books on Wright in print, says Richard Carney, managing trustee of the  Frank Lloyd Wright Trust of Scottsdale, Ariz.  </P> <P> "I see a tremendous number of designs that are either influenced by or copied  from Mr. Wright," he says.  </P> <P> Most of the copies are faithful reproductions, but one might wonder what Wright  himself would think of an avalanche of other items, such as notepaper, T-shirts  and jewelry identified with the Wright name, which are sold via mail order and  at Wright museums.  </P> <P> Besides the product offerings, Wright buildings are being restored and museums  are scurrying to stage retrospectives. David Hanks of New York, a museum  curator, has organized several exhibitions, including one which will open at  the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., in November. The Museum of Modern Art in  New York has announced plans for a major retrospective in 1994.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, prices for original furnishings escalate in antiques shops and  auction houses.  </P> <P> After a prolific career that spanned 70 years, is it possible that Wright's  influence and his designs are more widely dispersed 31 years after his death?  </P> <P> "I think so," says Carney.  </P> <P> According to Hanks, Wright believed a home should offer a feeling of repose,  and that indoor and outdoor environments should be in harmony. These thoughts  and his love for Japanese art and natural wood -- he often used beautifully  grained wood such as oak -- are much appreciated today, he says.  </P> <P> Atelier distributes reproductions of Wright's best-known furniture, such as the  Barrel Chair and Robie and Taliesin chairs. Prices range from $1,200 for a side  chair to $14,000 for a large dining table. That may seem pricey, but not  contrasted with the $1.6 million recently paid for an original dining set.  </P> <P> In addition to the "Imperial" china, Tiffany offers the more informal "Cabaret"  pattern. Also in its Frank Lloyd Wright collection are a terra cotta vase and  crystal vases, candlesticks and a candy dish. Prices range from about $100 to  $300. This fall, Tiffany's is introducing some sterling silver accessories.  </P> <P> These companies, along with Schumacher and Oakbrook-Esser, are licensed by the  Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Since the licensing program began in 1986, the  number of products has grown substantially, according to Steve Kroeter, who  oversees all licensing applications.  </P> <P> "We started with seven pieces of furniture," says Kroeter. "Now there are 13.  And over the next five years there will be two more collections, each with  three to six pieces. More rugs have been introduced, and two new windows will  be added this fall."  </P> <P> For those who want to browse through the home furnishings reproductions, an  updated product catalogue will be available in September for $8.50 from the  Frank Lloyd Wright Catalogue, P.O. Box 5599, Stacy, Minn., 55079.  </P></p>

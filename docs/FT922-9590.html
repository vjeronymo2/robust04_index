			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Interest turnround pushes Stanhope to Pounds 15.3m loss STANHOPE PROPERTIES, the London office developer which is one third owned by Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian company, more than halved its pre-tax losses from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 15.3m in the six months to December 31. However, excluding exceptional items, the losses almost doubled from Pounds 8.77m. The deterioration resulted from an swing from interest receivable of Pounds 6.61m to interest payable of Pounds 7.09m. This followed an increase in borrowings from Pounds 35m to Pounds 165m and the waiver of the interest on outstanding shareholder loans to the Rosehaugh Stanhope Developments joint venture. The share of the losses of associated undertakings shrank from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 9.43m, partly as a result of this waiver. A charge of Pounds 1.19m resulted from the abortive merger talks with Rosehaugh, its partner on the Broadgate development in the City, which were broken off early this year. 'By common consent the property sector is experiencing the most difficult conditions in living memory,' said the company. 'While there are few, if any, signs of an early improvement, the anticipated further lowering of interest rates coupled with increasing economic activity should, in due course, bring a return of confidence to, and the recovery of, the London office market.' Stanhope said that it was actively pursuing a number of low risk partnership developments in the UK and Europe. It had recently been appointed by British Rail to act as its partner in a 12-acre mixed use scheme at Oxford Station. Turnover grew to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 19.6m), helped by a rise in the rent roll to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 4.5m). A subsidiary that specialises in fitting out offices accounts for 70 per cent of turnover. Administration costs were cut to Pounds 4.79m (Pounds 5.83m). Losses per share fell from 20.37p to 9.21p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Bohumil </F> Pecinka; place and date not given: "Will the Russian Bear Creep  Up on Us?"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pecinka] It seems that  participation in the Partnership for Peace [PFP] initiative is a  condition for our entry into NATO but not a guarantee of our  admission. Who will be the judge, the one who says the Czech  Republic is ready to join the Alliance? Are there any criteria  at all?    [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to set any  criteria because we have entered into the very sensitive area of  Europe's future security structure. If you were to set  criteria, you would now be saying: You, yes and you, no. Mind  you, it is possible to visualize very precisely who is capable  of fulfilling which criterion. On the other hand, if the  program is formulated politically--that is, provided it is  oriented toward forging political ties between the Alliance and  individual states--the countries that can and want to will come  closer to NATO, and vice versa. I would also like to say that  NATO's expansion is a process in whose quality we should also be  interested. It must also be in our interests to ensure that the  Alliance does not lose its quality. Too much opening up could  mean that states that could become a source of instability could  be integrated within the Alliance.    [Pecinka] Soon after President Clinton's visit to Europe, it  became apparent that there are, to say the least, two  interpretations of the PFP. The Central Europeans are thinking  about the fastest possible and individual admission into NATO.  On the other hand, Russia views this initiative as the first  step toward the transformation of NATO, which will ultimately  incorporate all of the postcommunist states at the same time....    [Zieleniec] It is clear that everyone interprets a given  political fact according to his own interests. I do not think,  however, that Russia's voice will be the decisive one here.    [Pecinka] What, then, will be decisive?    [Zieleniec] The security situation in Europe. Look,  unforeseen security developments in East Europe could mean that  NATO may try to provide security for the buffer zone and rapidly  expand toward the east. On the other hand, if slower  development were to act as a stimulus for stabilizing democracy  in Russia, rather than for confrontation with the West, this  would also be worth taking into consideration. I think the NATO  countries will come up with a solution with two alternatives,  which is a classic example of political tactics.</p>

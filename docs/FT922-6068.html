			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Leader of Names attacks militants MR PETER NUTTING, a prominent Names' leader and a member of Lloyd's Council, the insurance market's governing body, yesterday launched a ferocious attack on more militant Names' leaders. Mr Nutting, who earlier this year led a successful campaign for compensation by nearly 1,000 Outhwaite Names, resigned his chairmanship of the Lloyd's Names Association's Working Party on Friday. He said: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that some leaders and members of the committees of some action groups are involved in a highly organised and well orchestrated campaign of vilification against Lloyd's, its council and most of those who earn their living on the market.' Mr Nutting is particularly critical of legal efforts by Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting - that are designed to win injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down their deposits in order to pay insurance losses. He said such action 'strikes at the foundations of Lloyd's'. Although UK Names have so far been unsuccessful in two separate efforts to win injunctions, an American Name was granted an injunction by a Denver court last week. The Lloyd's Names Association Working party has been involved in discussions with Lloyd's about a bail-out scheme to help Names facing severe underwriting losses. However, it has not been supported by the biggest Names association, the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which has more than 2,100 members. The Gooda Walker Names' chairman, Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, is backing another effort to win injunctions for his Names and has been critical of Mr Nutting's more moderate approach. Mr Nutting also says that action groups should postpone any action until the Lloyd's reviews are complete. Mr Nutting said: 'I believe a number of action groups would be well-advised not to confuse activity with action which is in most cases premature and in some cases counter-productive. I strongly urge all members of action groups to reject the leadership of extremists.'</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Taking a hard line on soft commission: The fund manager's 'free lunch' comes under scrutiny Soft commissions, often criticised as the proverbial free lunch for fund managers, are under scrutiny by regulators around the world. Last week Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management group, disclosed that, from next January, it will no longer deal under soft commissions agreements. These arrangements (known in the US as 'soft dollars') involve a broker paying for goods and services for a fund manager, in return for receiving a minimum amount of commissions from the manager. MAM is 75 per cent owned by investment bank SG Warburg, which itself is an active soft commission broker. The fund manager says its decision is largely a reflection of the growing resistance among UK pension funds to soft commissions. Critics claim that soft commissions lead to a subtle form of bribery in which fund managers, eager to obtain the free goods and services, 'churn' client accounts to generate the requisite level of income. Moreover, there is a fear that in order to meet the targets, fund managers direct business through brokers who may not offer the best prices for securities. 'Softed' services typically include research provided by a third party, or information services such as Reuters or Bloomberg screens - services which fund managers would normally have to pay for themselves. 'If I didn't accept soft commissions, I would have to either lower my profits or raise my fees,' said one leading UK fund manager. Fund managers say the softed services make them better at their jobs, and so benefit clients. And soft commission brokers say there is nothing much different between their activities and those of stockbrokers: in both cases, fund managers are paying commissions to receive services (research material, in the case of traditional brokers). Many regulators are unconvinced. US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mr Arthur Levitt said the practice 'doesn't feel right, smell right or taste right'. This is despite the fact that, at around Dollars 750m in 1993, or 30 per cent of all commissions paid, the business is a large practice in the US. Regulators around the world are following a similar pattern in trying to control the business: first they have sought to restrict the range of goods or services available under 'softing' deals, and then they have pushed for better disclosure. In developed markets such as the US and UK, the first steps were taken in the 1980s, and attention has now switched to disclosure. The SEC is expected to publish proposals for greater disclosure of soft commission arrangements in January. Mr Ken Berman, an SEC staff member working on the proposal, says the result is likely to be a requirement for fund managers to produce 'some kind of report to investors that deals only with soft dollars'. For the first time, fund managers are expected to give details of the amount of soft commissions they engage in, and the services they receive. In many developing markets, - particularly in Asia, where soft commissions have soared on a wave of equity investment from the US - regulation is still at the first stage. In Hong Kong, regulators have proposed restricting the practice of giving fund managers cash rebates for minimum levels of business - a variation on softing which is already banned in the US and UK. According to solicitors Linklaters and Paines, softed goods and services in Hong Kong can include tickets to sporting events, and it is difficult to see how these benefit the end-client. Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission is proposing to ban cash rebates unless prior consent of the end-client has been obtained, and to ban fund managers from accepting softed services that do not demonstrably benefit clients. It also proposes that transactions with 'connected persons'  -such as the stockbroking arm of a fund manager's parent company - must be conducted at arm's length. Meanwhile, regulators say that the increasingly international nature of investment has made soft commissions more difficult to regulate. Indeed, critics of Hong Kong's efforts to crack down on soft commission abuses point out that local fund managers may be prompted to move their businesses to rival centres such as Singapore or Tokyo. MAM says the one part of its business which will still accept soft commissions is a small unit-trust operation in Tokyo. While soft commissions are just arriving in developing markets, the practice is fast being overtaken in developed countries such as the US by an alternative practice. 'Directed commissions' involve a fund manager's own client capturing the benefit of commission payments, rather than the fund manager. Clients ask their fund manager to arrange for part of their commissions to be directed to a broker who will pay for services such as the client's own performance measurement fees, or fees for investment consultancy. According to Greenwich Associates, the US consulting firm, around a half of all US pension funds engage in directed commissions. As the practice spreads, it seems certain it will eat into fund managers' profits. 'The real question we are debating is 'Who does commission really belong to?',' said one fund manager. 'Increasingly, the fund manager's client is seeing commission as his asset, not the fund manager's'</p>

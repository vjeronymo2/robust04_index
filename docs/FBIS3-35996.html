In  particular he emphasized that, having realized Ukraine's role  and significance in the world, the Americans have changed their  attitude to the republic.    In the course of talks, accord was achieved on a wide range  of issues of bilateral cooperation, in particular on cooperation  in the conversion sector, agriculture, and space development. A  joint committee for conversion issues has been set up and 25  schemes have been prepared, including in particular a program  for building accommodation for servicemen who will be released  from the army as a result of the reduction in the armed forces  of Ukraine.    A series of agreements and documents were also prepared,  which are to be signed during the visit by Leonid Kravchuk to  the United States, planned for March.

We hope that  they will do so.</p>

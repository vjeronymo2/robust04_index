			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Nechayev] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- Liberal-Democratic Party  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes that the police is so  corrupted it is unable to carry out anti-crime measures. The  police should be replaced with retired KGB officers, said  Zhirinovskiy.    In his opinion, the federal counter-intelligence service is  also unable to suppress crime since it "assists foreign secret  services". The latter, in their turn, concentrated on the  Russian Liberal-Democratic Party. Zhirinovskiy thinks that the  border should be partially closed and citizens of former Soviet  republics should be prohibited to visit large Russian cities for  six months in order to make anti-crime measures efficient.    "We demand to start anti-crime measures with cleansing of  the  Interior Ministry itself, removal of corrupted officials and  their replacement with retired officers of the KGB, the armed  forces and the Military Procurator's Office. If the  high-ranking officials are not replaced, the presidential decree  (against crime) will become an instrument against political  opponents and not criminals," Zhirinovskiy told a news  conference here today.    He also demanded to stop "predatory privatization", do not  hold joint exercises with NATO, do not send Russian peace-makers  outside the Russian Federation and raise the minimum salary to  50,000 rubles per month.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Ford restructures global technical operations FORD is restructuring the management of its worldwide technical operations, placing responsibility for both product and manufacturing processes under the control of one senior executive. The job has gone to Mr Louis Ross, 60, currently executive vice-president, International Automotive Operations. He will become Ford's executive vice-president and chief technical officer from October 1. Mr Ross's responsibilities are to include the final development and launch of Ford's new mid-sized 'world car', code-named CDW27, which will replace both Ford's Sierra in Europe early next year and the Topaz and Tempo ranges in North America next autumn. Mr Ross will also be responsible for the worldwide Automotive Components Group. It operates 51 wholly owned or joint venture manufacturing facilities in 13 countries. In creating the new appointment, Ford, like other major car makers, is adapting to swiftly-changing technology which is requiring much closer collaboration between product and manufacturing process designers and engineers. The 'simultaneous engineering' allows manufacturers to make large cost and other savings through much-reduced product development times. Mr Ross, who joined Ford as a research engineer in 1955, will be succeeded by Mr Wayne Booker, currently Tokyo-based vice-president of Asia Pacific Operations. Mr Booker's successor will be Mr Robert Sparvero, formerly general manager of Ford's export sales operations in North America.</p>

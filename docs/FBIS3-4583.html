			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Seventy percent of 300  single- seat constituencies being set up under new political  reform bills will be redrawn according to a 1991 plan presented  to then Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, according to a survey  released Saturday [26 February].    A KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey of politicians and people  concerned in 47 prefectures found that more than 200 new  single-seat districts will be invented according to the draft  plan.    Only 60 to 70 districts, mostly in the densely populated  Kanto and Kinki regions, will be newly created under legal  procedures after the expected passage of an amendment of the  package of political reform bills in early March.    The political reform bills, which were approved in January  after a long battle in the Diet, calls for replacing the present  511 multiseat constituencies for the lower house with a mix of  300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional  representation seats.    In about 45 new single-seat constituencies, the ruling  coalition parties must single out their candidates since they  have more than one incumbent lower house member in corresponding  present multiseat districts.    The opposition LDP, which was ousted from power last August  by the coalition government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro  hosokawa, must make similar adjustments of their candidates in  about 35 single-seat districts.    Totally new districts in which there are virtually no  "incumbent" members will come into existence as well, with the  number of such districts reaching more than 90 for the ruling  parties and nearly 120 for the LDP.    The 8th Election System Council, a government advisory  council, submitted the draft plan for redrawing electoral  districts for the lower house in June 1991 to Kaifu, then prime  minister and LDP president.    In drawing up the 300 single-seat constituencies, the  council  set 549,000 as an upper limit for the population of a voting  district and 274,000 as a lower limit.    The population of six of the proposed constituencies will be  allowed to remain below 274,000 as exceptions.    On the council's plan, many of those surveyed complained  that  it ignores regional history and geographical conditions, but  some said another plan would cause problems such as  contradiction of the weight of vote per voter.    Kaifu and his LDP successor Kiichi Miyazawa were dislodged  from power due to their failure to achieve political reform.    Kaifu, speaking to the LDP's local convention in Nagoya,  central Japan, said Saturday politicians should not intervene in  redrawing the single-seat districts.    The government "should redraw (the electoral districts)  fairly by entrusting the task with a third organization," he  said.</p>

Residents and military sources said masked activists  ordered the workers and the Israeli Arab driver off the bus in Nablus before  burning it. About 30 masked Palestinians from the Islamic fundamentalist  movement Hamas paraded through the Nablus casbah in what residents described as  an unusual show of strength.  </P></p>

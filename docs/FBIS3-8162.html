Participants said the talks, which began at the U.S. Embassy,  will aim for concrete results by March 15.    The U.S. special envoy for former Yugoslavia, Charles  Redman,  said he was optimistic. "We will have serious work and serious  talks," he commented before the start of negotiations.    The Moslem-led Bosnian Government is being represented by  Justice Minister Kasem Trnka. The Croats are represented by  Croatia's deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader and Bosnian Croat  leader Kresimir Subak. [passage omitted]    Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told journalists  Friday  he would probably go to Vienna this weekend to take part in the  talks. He planned to continue to Moscow Wednesday to meet his  Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, in a bid to secure Serb  participation in the project.    "Russia can play a positive role" in exerting its influence  on the Serbs, Granic told journalists during a visit to the  northern Italian city of Trieste, where he was taking part in a  meeting of Central European foreign ministers.    The main job for the Vienna talks, according to diplomatic  sources, is to work out the details of a constitution inspired  by the Swiss model of autonomous cantons. There could be three  cantons, the sources said; one Croat unit grouping the present  self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat republic and two Moslem units in  central Bosnia. The central government would have limited  powers, taking charge of foreign affairs, defense and trade.  Each side would take turns in holding the presidency and would  hold a balance of power in the parliament.    The talks should also lay the basis for a long-term military  agreement between Croat and Moslem forces, following a ceasefire  which began last Friday.    In Sarajevo on Friday, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  spokesman Major Rob Annink said the two sides had given the  green light for UN troops to patrol frontlines as early as  Saturday, to be accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems.  Talks will also begin on opening up six routes across  frontlines.    UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the  Croat-Moslem hot spots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor,  Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been  rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet.    Bosnian Army leaders and the United Nations have also warned  that more international troops were needed to enforce the  ceasefire. Brigadier-General Fikret Muslimovic of the Bosnian  Army, speaking from Zenica in central Bosnia, said the UNPROFOR  force was not large enough to keep the peace between Moslems and  Croats, who are confronting each other over large tracts of  territory. "It won't be possible," he said, "if more troops do  not come." [passage omitted]</p>

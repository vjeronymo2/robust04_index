To quote Nazarbayev, a new state entity -- the Eurasian  union  with supra-national bodies for coordinating economic and  military policies -- might be created.    Such a union should have a single parliament, council of  defense ministers and defense complex, and an inter-state  secretariat appointed by the heads of state.    Nazarbayev also said that such a union might pursue a single  economic policy, have common borders, and use a supra-national  currency retaining the member-states' national currencies.    The member-states would maintain good-neighborly relations  with other former Soviet republics.    Nazarbayev announced that this problem had been discussed in  Moscow with President Yeltsin.    Speaking about the talks, Nazarbayev emphasized that the end  must be put to the tendency of accusing Russia of all mortal  sins. He also said that the well-being of his republic was  inextricably linked with Russia.    He pointed out that the Russian-Kazakh summit marked a new  stage in the two countries' economic unification and represented  an example to be followed by the other CIS countries. The  agreements signed in Moscow provide for setting up financial and  industrial groups and joint ventures. They also envisage  measures to facilitate the movement of capital and labor between  Russia and Kazakhstan, said Nazarbayev.    To quote the Kazakh president, the Russian and Kazakh  defense  ministries would conclude an agreement on joint planning and  interaction. "In fact, a single defense system is being  created," he said.    The Russian and Kazakh governments have been instructed to  conclude an agreement on the utilization of military testing  grounds located in Russia and Kazakhstan, said Nazarbayev.</p>

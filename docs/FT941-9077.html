			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Chubb warns on cost of US disasters Chubb, the US insurer, announced yesterday that profits in the first quarter would be cut by Dollars 81m, or 90 cents a share, because of estimated catastrophe losses from the Los Angeles earthquake and the January winter storms across the US, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. It said it expected about Dollars 90m in pre-tax losses from the earthquake, and Dollars 35m from the winter storms, after reinsurance recoveries. Chubb is the second big insurer this week to warn of earthquake and storm losses. On Monday, Cigna said it would report after-tax losses of Dollars 85m in the quarter because of the two disasters.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY DIDN'T BUSH FIRST GET CITIZENS OUT?  </P> <P> First, before we start to cry over spilled milk, I would like to say I think we  should have waited to follow the U.N. lead and not gone into Saudi Arabia like  charging elephants.  </P> <P> Now that we are there, how to get out and not lose one American or Arab boy to  this debacle is our problem.  </P> <P> Let's say to the U.N., "What do you want us to do?" and do it.  </P> <P> Nothing wimpy about that. I think the whole world would breathe a sigh of  relief and the lives of thousands would be saved.  </P> <P> I am not taking a guilt trip from Secretary of State James Baker, who said, "We  have to stay united."  </P> <P> No one asked me if I wanted in and no one is asking me if I want out. I'm  saying I want us out in our unilateral role and back the U.N. in any role they  want us to take with the rest of the world.  </P> <P> EILEEN MURPHY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

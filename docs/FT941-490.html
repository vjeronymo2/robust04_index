			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Reuters raps information 'misers' Reuters, the news and financial information group, has revealed a lurking threat to British business - the information miser. Research commissioned by it showed that more than two-thirds of British directors believe their bosses and colleagues play 'information politics' by hoarding rather than sharing vital knowledge. Disinterested observers who might suppose Reuters has an axe to grind would be correct: the reporting of this new scourge coincided with the launch yesterday of two new Reuters on-line business information products. The survey of more than 500 British executives says one in three claims to have had vital business information withheld from them - half of those blaming the 'political' ambition of peers and seniors. Nearly 90 per cent believed a free flow of information was vital to their businesses. Two-thirds also believed they spent more time than they should just searching for the right information - an average of two hours per week. Ms Marion King, managing director of Reuters Business Information, said: 'Organisations need to have information policies - a formal method of communicating information upwards, downwards and around the organisation.' Reuters is marketing two information services - Business Briefing, which offers subscribers direct access to either current or archive information, and Business Alert, which automatically provides updates within pre-set criteria. Industry research estimates the European market for on-line information was worth Pounds 2bn last year and is projected to reach Pounds 4.77bn by 1997 - a compound annual growth rate of 24 per cent.</p>

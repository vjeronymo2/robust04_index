			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks consider Heron proposals THE FINAL proposals on a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing plan to rescue Heron, the property and trading group, have been sent for approval to the 82 banks involved after an agreement to recommend the proposals among Heron's lead banks. The banks have to approve the final documentation by the end of this month if Heron is to continue to meet its obligations. After bank approval, the company's bondholders will be consulted. The pressure on banks and bondholders to reach a speedy settlement was increased by Heron's decision earlier this month to stop paying fees it regards as not essential to achieving its restructuring. Final proposals were sent out to Heron's banks about 10 days ago after the banks' steering committee, led by Barclays, agreed the documentation. The process of refinancing was originally started last March. The banks had already given approval to the first outline of the refinancing proposals when this was made in October, but since then there has been extensive work on drawing up detailed final proposals for their approval. Under the October proposal, banks and bondholders which lent Pounds 775m to Heron's head office group are being offered Pounds 400m in equity, Pounds 300m in senior debt maturing in March 1997, and Pounds 75m in junior debt expiring in 2000. Banks which lent to other parts of the group will be repaid in cash from disposal proceeds over periods up to 1997. The banks are being asked to put in Pounds 20m of capital. Unless the refinancing is completed, Heron would go into receivership. The company itself set a deadline of the end of February for the refinancing to establish fresh terms on which the holding company can trade. Bondholders are expected to be offered detailed terms similar to the banks which have a small exposure.</p>

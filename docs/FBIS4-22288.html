Is Islamic Fundamentalism Such a  Threat to Russia?"]    [Text] Some of the buzz-words in current Russian political  cant are "civilization," "civilized behavior," "joining the  civilized world," etc. But the references are exclusively to  Western civilization; i.e., a term is used which was rejected by  Western sociopolitical thought itself back in the early 20th  century and was finally buried together with the collapse of  fascist ideology.    Advocates of the idea of "ushering Russia into civilization"  seem to forget the axiom of the diversity of civilizations:  Western Christian, Confucian, Moslem, Eastern Slavic, and  others. Each has its specific values and each will, in its way,  contribute to the pluralist world civilization of the 21st  century. Western domination of the Far East even in the  technological field is now in doubt. And if something like this  cannot yet be said of the Moslem world, who can predict the  future?    However, the emergence of this discarded idea in the  confused, sick social and political mind of Russia in a  transitional period is not accidental. It reflects the  unresolved question of Russia's self-identity. After the  collapse of communism, that extreme, radical form of ideology  imported from the West, the erstwhile debate between  "Westerners" and "Slavophiles" has turned into a debate between  "democrats" and "statists." The former advocate the idea of  transplanting Western values to our inhospitable soil, the  latter stress the preservation or restoration of special,  exclusive traits characteristic of Russia. Naturally, in the  framework of sociopolitical struggle there is no clearcut  watershed between representatives of different trends. Likewise,  there is no organic link between "democratic" and "statist"  convictions and the positions of their representatives with  respect to the Islamic world or Moslem citizens of Russia.  Representatives of the opposing camps may come to terms on the  basis of different premises for their negative attitudes towards  Islam. Freshmen of the market and democracy school highhandedly  attempt to teach Moslem countries and peoples the "values of  civilization," while rabid chauvinists impose upon them their  idea of "Russia ber alles." But strange as it may seem,  understanding and cooperation with the Islamic world is  advocated by both "communist-internationalists" and  anticommunist "new Eurasians."    The picture is complicated by the fact that the quirks of  history and geography require Russia to take a position in the  discordant relations between the West and Islam.    The old confrontation between East and West, between Western  democracy and communism, is being replaced by confrontation  between the West and the Islamic world. Western public opinion  is developing a partly true but generally artificial "enemy  image" of the Moslem world, while Russia is being drawn into an  unnecessary and alien conflict, the cost of participation in  which may prove to be deadly high. Threats to the fate of Russia  are appearing at three levels at once. Firstly, in relations  with countries of the Moslem world outside the former USSR,  especially those opting for models of sociopolitical orders  differing from the West. Following the twists and turns of  Western political behavior, Russia may get into confrontation  with countries with which it has no contradictions. The  unfriendly relations of Moscow with Iran and Libya, which have  taken no anti-Russian actions on the governmental level, is the  best example of this. If continued, such behavior will  inevitably further weaken the already greatly deteriorated  positions of Russia in the Moslem world.    An even greater threat may arise if Russia fails to launch a  dialog and cooperation with Moslem nations of the near abroad.  The matter here is not so much economic losses and difficulties  along thousands of miles of common borders. At issue is the fate  of Russian-speaking populations in the former soviet republics.  The ghost of Bosnia and Herzogovina is stalking Central Asia and  Transcaucasia.    Finally, the third level is Russian society itself. A  special  feature of Russia's historic development and geostrategic  position is that it has not just lived next to the Moslem world;  Russia has been as it were within that world, it was a border  situation not only in the geographical sense. The confrontation  between the two civilizations has been going on for a thousand  years, but there has also been an intermingling and interaction  of the cultural, sociopolitical and anthropological aspects. In  the final analysis, not only Slavs are Russians "by blood," but  also Ugro-Finns and Turks. There are common elements in music,  dances, ornaments, poetics, national character and psychology.  The life of Russian and Tatar villages in the Volga country  differs only in minor details. The Cossacks were constantly  replenished by Kalmyks, Circassians, Tatars and Kazakhs.  Hundreds of nobility family names are of Turkic origin. Vaguely  similar patterns can be found in Spain, the Balkans and India.  But drawing parallels is dangerous. On the Iberian Peninsula  history decreed that Islam would be eradicated, leaving behind  traces in culture, the anthropological type of people, the  psychology. A bloody drama has flared up again in the Balkans.  India is seeking with difficulty ways of cohabitation among  Moslems and non-Moslems. Will it find one?    Whereas in its search for self-identity Russia is in  contradiction with itself, which is leading to a split between  the intellectual and political elite and, as a consequence, of  the masses, among peoples with Moslem roots one can observe a  similar dualism with respect to themselves and the surrounding  world. Their situation may be very broadly defined as a struggle  between trends towards the Turkish or the Iranian model of  development. Western influence, market relations and political  practice draws them towards the early Turkish model (preferably  the authoritarian model of Kemal Ataturk), while their own  civilization, mythology, mass sentiment and demagogy tend  towards the Iranian model.    In any case, in the post-soviet independent Moslem states  the  self-identity of both the political elites and the masses is  based on Islamic nationalism. This assumes a certain  "distancing" from Russia, as well as raising the level of  anti-Russian sentiments. But whereas nationalism in the newly  independent states assumes orientation towards the West, Islam  looks to the East, or to be more precise in the strictly  geographic sense, to the South. During the first two years or so  of independence, the former soviet republics have already  experienced a period of euphoria over the acquisition of  brothers and cousins in both the ethnic and religious sense:  Turks, Iranians, Arabs, Pakistanis. They have already  experienced a period of hopes that "the West will help us" or  "fraternal Moslem peoples will help us." These hopes failed to  materialize in any real sense on either side. It turned out that  Turkey, Iran, the Arabs, and the West were all pursuing their  own attractively packaged but frequently self-serving  objectives. While with Russia it was necessary to find a common  language and mutual understanding.    "Attraction" will develop if, in the first place, Russia  sets  its own house in order, embarks on socioeconomic revival, and  will be able to launch a constructive dialog and cooperation  with both its own Moslem citizens and neighboring Moslem states.  The prerequisites for this are there. After all, Russia (like  the Soviet Union) was not an empire in the usual sense of the  word. It lacked at least two basic elements that characterize an  empire: economic exploitation of the outlying provinces by the  Center and preferential social and material status of the  Russian population with respect to other peoples. However,  rational prerequisites do not necessarily always determine the  social and political actions of people, political elites or  nations. Relations between people and entire nations are  frequently determined by nationalistic ideas and naked momentary  egoism.    The road of dialog and cooperation between Russia and  Moslems, as represented by communities, peoples and states, is  filled with a number of dangers. One of them is fundamentalism.  We shall not go into terminological or semantic investigations  or recall that the term itself appeared several decades ago in  Protestant religious thought.    The term fundamentalism assumes several interrelated  elements;    --references solely to one's own real or imagined values:  religious, cultural, legal, moral, ethical, sociopolitical, and  others;    --juxtaposition of oneself against others, dividing the  world  into "us" and "them";    --stressing incompatibility with others;    --readiness to resort to violence to impose one's own vision  of the world and way of life.    It will be readily noticed that this definition covers all  kinds of fundamentalism: Moslem and Protestant, Hindu and  Russian Orthodox, liberal and Bolshevik...    Differences between peoples may be promoted by ideas and  forces both within and outside a certain social entity. What  matters is the actual effect of different ideas and forces. In  this sense it would be worth taking a dispassionate look at the  manifestations of, specifically, Islamic fundamentalism. In its  extreme form it is an expression of the reaction of a society, a  civilization, to its inequality in the world. Colonialism has  gone but dependence on the West in the economic, technological,  cultural, information and other spheres remains. The Soviet  Union has collapsed, but de facto dependence on Russia remains.  This gives rise to similar developments in different countries,  be it "Moslem Brotherhoods" in Egypt, Syria or Jordan, the  National Salvation Front in Algeria, Jamat-i-Islam in Pakistan,  or the Islamic Renaissance Party in Russia and Central Asia. The  founders of Moslem fundamentalism in Russia are not necessarily  familiar with the writings of Moslem Brotherhood ideologues  Hasan al-Banna or Sayyid Quth, but they are as adamant as those  religious thinkers in their opposition to Western values,  calling for a return to "the true Islam," application of Sharia  as the legal basis of Moslem life, creation of an Islamic state  and a Moslem economy. They also take similar positions on East  Jerusalem and Palestine. Interestingly, though, Moslem  fundamentalists derive some organizational forms of their  activities from recent communist practice.    However, as in other cases, applying historical parallels to  fundamentalists may be risky. Religious political extremism has  gained virtually no foothold among Moslems in Russia. The  Islamic Renaissance Party is hardly more than a network of small  clubs. Nationalist slogans appeal more to the elites than to the  masses. And even in Central Asia (in particular, Tajikistan),  where the Islamic Renaissance Party was most successful, this  was a manifestation not so much of the injection of politics  into religion as simply clan hostility and rivalry.    Islamic fundamentalism poses no real threat to Russia. There  is the threat of extremism if the socioeconomic and interethnic  crisis continues to deepen, the threat of a rise of the  threshold of information rejection and of a loss of the ability  to engage in dialog. This makes impossible not only a transition  to the information society, with its movement of information,  but even the simple coexistence of peoples (Yugoslavia, Armenia,  and Azerbaijan). At some stage in conflicts between confessional  and ethnic groups their members simply cease to understand each  other, whatever the educational or cultural level of  individuals. A demonization as it were of the opponent occurs,  cutting off all possibilities for dialog and compromise.    Difficulties of mutual understanding and cooperation may  also  be due to objective circumstances. In this sense the example of  Chechnya is indicative. Russians and Chechens are alienated by  historic memories of genocide, of which the Chechen people were  victims three times: in the 19th century, the 1920s, and the  1940s-1960s, during the period of mass deportations from the  Northern Caucasus. The people survived, in particular, thanks to  the clan structure of their society and the extensive  proliferation of the Naqshbandiyah and Qadiriyah Sufi orders.  That same structure makes it possible to quickly gain new  socioeconomic positions in the developing market economy of  Russia, frequently by criminal means.    Understanding between non-Moslems and Moslems is hindered by  reciprocal incompetence and ignorance with regard to each other,  the spread of myths which, through repetition, acquire the force  of facts. It should be noted that in Russian sociopolitical  thought, to say nothing of the mass media, there is a mishmash  of entirely different concepts: "Moslem renaissance,"  "pan-Islamism," "Islamic fundamentalism," "Sufism." Similar  ignorance, combined with extreme anti-Russian or anti-Christian  attitudes, creates an explosive mixture on the other side.  Speculating on ignorance and emotions may yield short-term  political and daily life dividends, but it increases the level  of tensions in religious and ethnic relations. As a result,  instead of constructive dialog, the conflict expands.    References to sources, to the legal and behavioral norms of  Islamic civilization create difficulties both within a  multireligious society and in international relations, but these  difficulties are not basically insurmountable for coexistence  and cooperation. Sharia and the system of Western law (codified  and based on precedent) would seem to be worlds apart and  incompatible. The former regards law as a revelation of God, the  latter as the people's will or customs that have become the  norm. Identical situations (marriage, inheritance) are regulated  differently in the West and in Moslem society. History knows  examples of the total imposition of Western law (including  transformed into communist form) on Moslem societies: Turkey,  Yugoslavia, China, USSR. But hand in hand with the renaissance  of Islam goes a revival of Sharia norms in the area of civil,  family and other law. Is there a possibility for compromise?  Yes, there is.    Many Moslem legal scholars are "reopening the doors of  ijtihad," which were closed at the end of the 4th century of the  Hijri (the 10th century of our era), i.e. they again recognize  the ulemas' right to independently interpret and judge. For that  they have the formal tools. According to most of the schools of  Moslem legal scholars, there are areas in which Allah prohibits,  does not recommend or, on the contrary, permits or does not  object to, certain behavior or decisions. Between these four  variants lies a fifth, "grey" zone, in which Allah is neutral  and where the introduction of certain legal norms is possible,  as long as they do not contradict the four others, in which the  will of Allah is clearly expressed. Over the last century and a  half, Sharia has demonstrated considerable abilities to adapt to  new realities, from Osman trade and customs codes to traffic  rules, from the establishment of a banking system which managed  to skirt formal interest profit, to women's rights to education  and work outside the family, or the waiving of fasting for air  force pilots during Ramadan.    Russian society still must find a solution to problems  connected with the revival of the fundamental postulates of  Islam and the refusal of some citizens to obey a common unified  system of law. Perhaps public practice will move ahead of legal  norms and employers will take into account specific features of  employing Moslem manpower during the Ramadan fast, the state  will recognize Moslem holidays, to say nothing of cultural,  enlightenment or religious activities of Moslem communities or  the political rights of Moslem autonomous entities. In the final  analysis, both the Russian and Moslem peoples have the  historical experience not only of conflicts but also of  cohabitation and mutual enrichment.    Russia's place and role in the new world order depends not  only on its relations with the West, but also with the Islamic  world. It will either find understanding and a basis for  cooperation and constructive dialog with Moslems both outside  and within or will sink into a protracted conflict with no  solution in sight. It could bleed and weaken Russia so much that  it would become a significant element contributing to the  disintegration of the country and undermining its ability to  develop.    Blind imitation of Western sociopolitical and economic  models  can cause and is already causing their rejection by Russian  society. Mindless following of the most nearsighted Western  prescriptions of confrontation with the Moslem world can be  self-defeating. Russia should have its own road of internal  development, taking into account world experience, and its own  approach to the Moslem world.</p>

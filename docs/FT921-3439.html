			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Weighing the political risk WHICH BUDGET matters most: the one delivered by Mr Norman Lamont on Tuesday or the one to be delivered by his Labour opposite number Mr John Smith next week? If the stock market's unhappy response to Mr Lamont's fiscal package is anything to go by, Mr Smith's version will have to be taken seriously. The market's verdict was supported by the initial evidence from the polls: the first post-Budget survey by Mori suggested that Labour had a narrow three-point lead. Not that Mr Lamont should carry all the blame. The most striking feature of his Budget message was the unexpected extent of the deterioration in the public finances. From a surplus of half a billion in 1990-91, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) is expected to jump to Pounds 28bn in 1992-93, after allowing for privatisation proceeds of Pounds 8bn. By 1993-94 it is expected to reach Pounds 32bn. Against all that, the chancellor's Pounds 1 1/2 bn handout scarcely deserves to be called a bribe. His room for manoeuvre was phenomenally limited, and it seems questionable whether any other chancellor would have made a better fist of presenting a pre-election Budget in the midst of a recession. Much of the electoral debate hinges on the credibility of the main political parties in economic management. How credible is the prospectus that Mr Lamont is offering? Not quite credible enough, seems to be the stock market view, for it is hard to reconcile the forecasts in the Budget Red Book with what has been going on in the dealing rooms. Electoral fortunes The Treasury is looking for a buoyant recovery, with non-oil gross domestic product returning to 3 per cent real growth by 1993-94 and 3 1/2 per cent in the three years thereafter. The best that can be said about the equity market's dim response is that investors appear to have been struck more by the view that the government's electoral fortunes might be on the wane than by anything in Mr Lamont's growth assumptions. Scepticism would anyway be justified by the Treasury's recent forecasting record: having underestimated the recession by a mile, it would not be surprising if the forecasters were now to overestimate the speed and strength of the upturn. It is true that share prices were vulnerable to a setback. The downward movement was greatly exaggerated because of the extensive bull positions taken by market makers in advance of the Mr Lamont's speech. The unwinding of those positions, many of them established via the futures markets, has had a notably depressing impact on the FT-SE Index this week. But the more interesting question concerns inflation and the gilts market. Here Mr Lamont has a better story to tell, with RPI inflation down to 4 per cent in January compared with 9 per cent a year earlier. By the first half of 1993, it is forecast to fall to 3 1/4 per cent, with producer output prices down to 1 1/2 per cent. Does this make long gilts a bargain on yields of 9 1/2 per cent, showing a margin of more than 5 percentage points over the real yield on index-linked gilts? Once again the market's reaction was sceptical and the PSBR figures no doubt had something to do with it. Gilts, which became a rare commodity under Mrs Thatcher, are about to stage a big comeback. Ungracious reaction Yet there are good grounds for thinking that in this case the market's reaction was ungracious. One thing that differentiates the 1990s from the period of heavy borrowing under Labour in the second half of the 1970s is that exchange controls have gone. Another is that Britain is part of the European exchange rate mechanism. A PSBR representing 4 1/2 per cent of GDP, modest by the standards of the 1970s, will thus be much easier to finance in the global capital market that now exists. Admittedly the ERM is only a semi-fixed system, with Britain remaining, for the moment, in a wide band. The present premium of a little under two percentage points on sterling 10-year bonds against German bonds reflects the risks inherent in that position. Gilts have to allow something for the risk of trouble within the ERM system itself. At the core of the system, the Germans are deeply unhappy with the Maastricht deal and the French are witnessing a rising nationalist tide. And whatever the politicians say, gilt-edged buyers also have to weigh the risk of a British devaluation. All three parties are offering similar macro-economic policies. As far as the markets are concerned, everything hinges on the strength of their commitment to the ERM. The way for an incoming government to signal its commitment would be to fund a good portion of the enlarged PSBR with index-linked gilts, thereby demonstrating faith in a lasting low inflation rate. That, paradoxically, would also be a buying signal for fixed-interest gilts.</p>

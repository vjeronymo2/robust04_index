"Investment should be based on mutual interest with no  exploitation and it must be in line with the direction and the  interests of the people who own the country," he told more than  200 Cambodian officials and Thai businessmen at a seminar on  investment in Cambodia.    The seminar, entitled New Dimension of Cambodia's Investment  and Environment, is organised by the Board of Investment and the  Thai Embassy. It is the first major seminar since the formation  of the elected Cambodian Government. [passage omitted]    Mr Chuan, accompanied by a large delegation of public and  private sector officials, arrived on Wednesday for what embassy  officials called an "historic visit" aimed at boosting the often  troubled relations between the two neighbouring kingdoms.    The visit was to focus primarily on trade, which the premier  said had "expanded rapidly from around $600,000 in 1988 to $183  million in the first half of 1993". [passage omitted]    He said more than 10,000 million baht had been invested by  Thais in Cambodia and this showed they had great interest in  Cambodia. [passage omitted]    "We want to see the good investors drive out the bad."    The deputy governor of the National Bank of Cambodia said  the  Khmer Government did not control money transfers and foreigners  were free to transfer their profits.    Companies have to pay 20-30 percent income tax. The  Government will waive it for four years starting from when the  company makes a profit and waive import duty on materials and  machinery for export- oriented projects.    Federation of Thai Industries president Chokchai Aksaranan  called on the Cambodian Government to have a clear-cut policy on  trade and investment.    "The policy must be clear and transparent and must not be  changed so often," he said.</p>

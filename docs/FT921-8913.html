			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Midlands air route to US urged MIDLANDS MPS yesterday pressed Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, to give American Airlines special permission to operate daily services between Birmingham and Chicago. The politicians, led by Mrs Maureen Hicks, Conservative MP for Wolverhampton North East, said the Midlands business community was anxious to see daily transatlantic services from Birmingham. These are ruled out in the existing UK-US bilateral air agreement. The MPs want Mr Rifkind to relax the rules. Talks between UK and US officials start in Washington on Monday to review the agreement. British Airways has rights to operate a service from Birmingham to the US but does not believe such flights would be profitable. American Airlines is also seeking a licence to operate transatlantic flights from Nashville, Tennessee, to London Stansted. BA said yesterday it did not object to the UK granting rights to US carriers to operate provincial services in Britain, provided UK airlines were offered 'something worthwhile' in return. BA has urged that future air agreements with the US should be negotiated at a European level, rather than on a bilateral basis. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, warned in Dallas this week that the recession was prompting increasingly protectionist moves by governments to shield their national carriers. 'I fear there will be more protectionism from governments over the next year,' he said, singling out the UK government for preventing his airline from flying between Chicago and Birmingham and between Nashville and Stansted. US carriers have also become concerned by the tougher attitude being adopted by France and Germany to their bilateral agreements with the US.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRUINS, LONG BEACH VOLLEYBALL WINNERS  </P> <P> UCLA and Cal State Long Beach are all but assured berths in the NCAA men's  volleyball Final Four after winning Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn.  tournament matches Thursday at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> UCLA (23-4), the defending national champion, made short work of Stanford,  15-11, 15-9, 15-9.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Cal State Long Beach secured the other bid with a 9-15, 17-15,  17-15, 15-11 victory over second-ranked USC.  </P> <P> The Final Four is scheduled for May 4-5 at George Mason University in Fairfax,  Va.  </P> <P> UCLA and Cal State Long Beach play in the WIVA championship game Saturday at  Northridge, with the winner receiving the conference's automatic qualifying  berth. But even Saturday's loser, as the second-place finisher in a conference  that has delivered all 20 NCAA champions, is a lock to advance as a wild card  team. MIKE HISERMAN  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Law changes could dig into US mine profits - Congressional calls for tougher controls and higher royalties THE US mining industry is no stranger to trouble. As long ago as December, 1983, Business Week magazine on its front page announced 'the Death of Mining' in the States. To borrow Mark Twain's phrase, that death report was 'greatly exaggerated'. The industry emerged leaner and fitter from the horrors of the early 1980s, when it was decimated by low prices, and the US is still one of the world's most important mining nations. However, the US mining industry claims it now faces a new threat to its future prosperity - from those wishing to change the country's 120-year-old mining laws. Critics suggest that these laws have enabled mining companies to make huge profits at the expense of US taxpayers while destroying vast areas of land with a blatant disregard for the environment. Political pressure has built to such an extent that today there are two bills pending in Congress that aim to change the mining laws, one introduced by Senator Dale Bumpers and the other by Representative Nick Rahall, both Democrats. Mr Milt Ward, chairman of the American Mining Congress, the US industry's main trade association, suggests that efforts to change the General Mining Law of the United States have been fuelled by two forces. The first says it wants the US to be 'mine free in '93' and the other is made up of 'seemingly budget-minded legislators who think they have found a new source of federal revenues in the form of new mining fees and royalties'. Both Bills aim to change completely the present system under which anyone can explore US federal lands and win ownership of parcels for as little as Dollars 2.50 an acre after discovery of a valuable mineral deposit. Critics point out that fossil fuels are treated differently. Coal, oil and gas are leased to producers in exchange for royalties to the federal government, which retains ownership of the land. The Rahall and Bumpers proposals would give the US secretary of the interior much greater authority over hard rock minerals. Among other things, companies would have to submit plans for proposed operations for the secretary's approval and these proposals would have to be consistent with land use plans for the area. Companies would have to pay fees to hold mining claims and restore the land when mining was finished. The Bumpers Bill would require a royalty of at least 5 per cent of gross revenues; the Rahall Bill would charge rents based on claim acreage. The AMC says critics are not right to suggest that the law allows the sale of public lands and minerals for Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 5 an acre. That is just the administrative fee miners pay. They also pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop each claim. Neither is it true that the law does not require diligent development and production of minerals or allows speculation and unauthorised uses of public lands. The AMC says the law was designed to promote mineral development on public lands and it prohibits people from using mining claims for any other purpose. Mining companies are particularly concerned about keeping their right to go exploring on public lands. The present mining law gives US citizens the right 'to enter public lands, explore for minerals and, upon their discovery, perfect ownership of the mining location'. However, miners already are barred from two-thirds of the 688m acres of federal government land. According to Representative Barbara Vucanovich, a Republican who represents Nevada, the biggest gold mining state, to change the present law for a system where the federal government decided on day-to-day development would 'so thoroughly alter the way minerals may be developed in the US that they introduce considerable uncertainty to the industry'. In order to gain some perspective the AMC commissioned an independent study by the Denver branches of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, and Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs, a law firm. They asked 35 US mining companies about 75 projects to see what the mining industry would look like today if the Bills had been enacted. The researchers used a computer modelling system developed by the US Department of Commerce to evaluate economic impact on a regional basis, based on actual mining industry experience and assuming present economic conditions. The AMC has now published the study and it shows: With the fee and royalty provisions in place, some mines would not have been developed and other expenditures not made. This would have cost 10,000 to 30,000 jobs in mining and related activities in the west of the US; With the legislation proposed by Senator Bumpers in place, the federal government would have suffered a net loss of about Dollars 230m a year, while legislation proposed by Representative Rahall would have cost the treasury more than Dollars 125m annually in lost revenue and increased expenditures. Economic activity would stall in the 12 western states where most of the mining on public lands occurs. Under Bumpers, Dollars 3.8bn worth of economic activity would be lost to these states annually; under Rahall, Dollars 1.5bn a year. This loss of economic activity would not be distributed evenly. Most of the jobs would be lost in Colorado and Nevada, where many of mining's customers, consultants and suppliers are based. The AMC's approach is not entirely negative and it seems willing to compromise. To address perceived abuses of the present law, it has identified several areas where steps could be taken to respond to public concerns without gutting the essential components of the present law. It says these changes would not threaten public land access, result in unreasonable development costs or increased development litigation. Among other things the AMC says the mining industry would not object to paying fair market value for the surface estate of a mining claim, based on the highest non-mining use of the land. Neither does it object to holders of mining claims being given the option of paying an annual holding fee or performing annual assessment work. This would assure that claims were not held for speculative purposes. The law reform lobbyists praise the industry for recognising that some changes are needed but insist that its proposals fall far short of what is needed. They say the industry's study is unlikely to sway many votes in Congress in view of 'the clear abuses taking place under the present mining law, such as the private acquisition of valuable federal lands for very low patent fees.' Nevertheless, there was some comfort for the industry when Mr Manuel Lujan, the interior secretary, appeared at the AMC annual meeting in Washington last week. He said the industry might well have to face some changes to mining laws but 'the Department of the Interior will vigorously defend the basic tenets of the 1872 Mining Law.' He said: 'Just because a law is 120 years old doesn't mean it is irrational'. Many laws had stood the test of time. For example, the American Constitution had lasted even longer than US mining laws.</p>

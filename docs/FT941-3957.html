			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Tourists attacked in Egypt Suspected Moslem militants fired at a tourist boat on the river Nile yesterday, as security forces took a tight grip on the rest of Egypt as Moslems celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Reuter reports from Cairo. No one was injured in the attack on the cruiser, which took place near the Moslem fundamentalist stronghold of Assiut, 320 km south of Cairo. The militant Gama'a al-Islamiya group has claimed responsibility for eight previous attacks on Nile cruisers. In Assiut itself, a stronghold of the Gama'a, security forces prevented the group from holding a mass gathering at the dawn prayers marking the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Kaiser Aluminum turns in loss KAISER Aluminum, the US integrated aluminium company that is 87 per cent held by the natural resource company Maxxam, reported its first quarterly loss in six years. Earnings were battered by the deterioration in world aluminium prices and production cuts brought on by electric power cuts at Kaiser's plants in the US Pacific northwest. The company recorded a first quarter loss of Dollars 16.6m, or 29 cents a share, before the inclusion of special accounting charges. This compares with income of Dollars 8.4m, or 15 cents, in the first quarter of 1992. In the latest first quarter, Kaiser took an extraordinary loss of Dollars 21.8m to retire and reschedule debt. Kaiser's sales for the quarter were Dollars 442.6m, down from Dollars 463.7m last year. The company shipped 166,100 tonnes of primary and fabricated aluminium products, compared with 176,500 in 1992. Largely as a result of Kaiser's loss and operating deficits in its real estate business, Maxxam said it recorded a loss of Dollars 25.9m, or Dollars 2.74 a share, in the first quarter, exclusive of special accounting charges. That compares with net income of Dollars 900,000 or 10 cents in the first quarter of 1992. Maxxam had first quarter sales of Dollars 513.7m, down from Dollars 529.5 last year. Separately, Asarco, the integrated US copper producer, announced it was cutting its dividend by half after reporting continuing losses. The company will reduce its June 1 dividend from 20 cents per share, to 10 cents. That is its lowest payout since 1987. Asarco, earlier this week reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 31m or 74 cents a share.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The Central  Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea  in a statement Saturday sharply denounced the South Korean  puppet clique's suppression of the peaceful demonstrators  protesting against the opening of the rice market on Feb. 1, as  a brutal fascist repression infringing upon the elementary vital  rights and democratic freedom on the peasants and people of  other walks of life.    Recalling that the puppet clique of Kim Yong-sam, the  traitor  for all ages, is resorting to a wholesale crackdown, branding  the peaceful protests for defending the nation's dignity and  interests as "violence", the statement says the current struggle  of the South Korean peasants and students is by no means  "violence".    The real violence is the brutalities of the fascist clique  which is madly wielding the bayonet at the bare-handed peaceful  demonstrators and its boss is none other than the traitor Kim  Yong-sam, it points out. The statement calls upon the South  Korean peasants and students to wage a more daring struggle to  overthrow the treacherous Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and  establish a truly independent democratic government, in close  solidarity and unity with people of all other strata, holding  high the banner of struggle against outside forces and puppets,  which they have raised.</p>

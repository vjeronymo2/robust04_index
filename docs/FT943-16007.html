			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: MRCB wins go-ahead for Dollars 1bn rail project Malaysian Resources Corp (MRCB), a Malaysian conglomerate involved mainly in the property, media, and power sectors, has been given the go-ahead to develop the country's Brickfield's Central Station Project, an investment thought to be worth about USDollars 1bn. The deal will give MRCB rights to develop land, currently state-owned, in an undeveloped area of Kuala Lumpur. The project will include a railway terminal, airport shuttle services, a terminal for light rail transit, and bus and taxi connections. Offices, retail space and hotels are also planned. Financial details are subject to further negotiation between the government and MRCB, which has close ties with Malaysia's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim. Analysts were pleased to see progress in the government's privatisation programme. They said that privatisations have been delayed by two to three months by infighting between Mr Anwar and his influential predecessor, Tun Daim Zainuddin. However, some were concerned about the lack of any publicly available blueprint for the capital's transport system, and questioned whether there was any co-ordination among the private transport projects. Shares in MRCB, which has a market capitalisation of MDollars 2.4bn, closed the day 8 cents higher at MDollars 4.80 in moderate trading.</p>

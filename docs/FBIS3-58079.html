The representatives of various minority groups in  Turkey were the guests of a group of Belgian members of  parliament of various political parties.    Following strong condemnation from the Turkish Government  and  in addition to calls for support for the oppressed Kurds,  satisfaction was expressed at the way in which the Belgian  Government -- and especially Interior Minister Louis Tobback --  had reacted to the clashes between Kurds and Turks last weekend  in Saint-Josse and Schaerbeek [Brussels].    A spokesman for the marchers called upon the European  countries -- especially France and Germany -- to stop supplying  Turkey with arms and to exert international diplomatic pressure  for a truce between the Kurdish opposition and the Turkish  Government so that a solution may be sought through political  and democratic channels to the Kurds' right to  self-determination.    VU [People's Union] Senator Nelly Maes said that, according  to confidential information that she obtained from Finance  Minister Philippe Maystadt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are the main  customers for Belgian manufacturers of light weapons.    Her colleague, Willy Kuijpers, asked for the withdrawal of  the 42 licenses granted by various countries to Turkish arms  manufacturers and which make it -- after American Lockheed --  the world's largest arms producer.    Deputy Hugo Van Dienderen of AGALEV [Flemish ecologists]  would like to know which countries have been supplied with the  weapons produced by Belgium to the value of 5 billion Belgian  francs.  <H5>  Agitator </H5>   Kuijpers called upon the Turkish Embassy in Belgium to  remove  from the streets the man codenamed "Osman," a member of the  secret service whom he openly charged with being one of the  agitators involved in the New Year clashes in Saint-Josse.  Senator Sleeckx of the SP [Flemish Socialist Party] even  repeated charges of human rights violations observed during last  year's visit by a parliamentary delegation to southeastern  Turkey. He expressed his full support for minister Tobback and  his interpretation of Saturday's events. Senator Hugo Van  Rompaey of the CVP [Christian People's Party] was of the same  opinion and also hinted that former Turkish President Turgut  Ozal may not have met with a natural death due to having showed  signs of readiness to grant the Kurds a place to live of their  own. He also stated that he, too, would resort to arms if his  people were treated as the Kurds are treated. "The PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] people are guerrillas not  terrorists," he stated, while not advocating violence. He  stressed the need for a solution to the Kurdish problem through  dialogue.    Dr. Ismet, a lawyer and former senior lecturer at the  Sorbonne, who has supported the cause of the Kurds for the last  25 years, pleaded for the Kurds' right to self-determination,  even within the existing Turkish state system.    He wondered whether the federal states in the five countries  where Kurds now live could not achieve cross-border cooperation  and referred to Europe where the borders between countries are  now disappearing and to the federal structure of Belgium and  Switzerland.    He urged those present "not to fall into the trap of Turkish  propaganda" and said that the PKK members were not terrorists  but "a well-organized resistance," who were themselves calling  for an arms truce.</p>

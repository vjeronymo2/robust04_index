			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bosnian Serbs face Belgrade supply blockade SERBIA took swift action against the defiant Bosnian Serbs yesterday, announcing a halt to all but humanitarian supplies across the border, as President Bill Clinton warned that the Bosnian crisis could threaten the stability of Europe. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic moved to hamper the Bosnian Serbs' fighting capacity after they spurned his plea to back the international peace plan for Bosnia. Mr Clinton described the Bosnian Serbs' decision - made in defiance of possible air strikes by the US and its allies - as a 'grave disappointment'. He said their assembly's decision to put the peace plan before the Bosnian Serb people in a May 15-16 referendum was a 'delaying tactic' to consolidate their gains in the 13-month-old civil war with Bosnian Moslems and Croats. The assembly's refusal to endorse the peace plan was decided by an overwhelming majority of 51 votes to 2 with 12 abstentions early yesterday morning. In a clear message to his European allies, Mr Clinton said he had instructed Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, to be 'insistent' during his current tour of European capitals that tougher and collective measures be agreed soon. Mr Christopher vowed to concentrate efforts to end the war exclusively on punitive measures against the Serbs and said he was no longer pursuing a United Nations peace plan. Speaking in Bonn after meeting German chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, Mr Christopher said the failure of the Bosnian Serb parliament to back the peace plan meant that option was now closed. 'Until today we were basically discussing two different tracks. Now, we're focusing on a single track,' he said. The White House later said that a new UN Security Council Resolution would be required if further action in the form of air strikes or other military measures were to be taken. The Security Council held urgent consultations last night in an atmosphere of deepening crisis. It decided unanimously to designate Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, and the Moslem enclaves of Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac and Tuzla, as 'safe areas' which would be patrolled and, if necessary, defended by UN troops. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem foreign minister, claimed in Washington yesterday that 40,000 people would be 'massacred' in the besieged town of Zepa if the international community did not intervene in Bosnia's civil war. Bosnian Serb forces have refused to allow UN observers to visit Zepa to investigate Bosnian government charges that a full-scale Serbian assault had been launched. If Serbia's decision to halt supplies to the Bosnian Serbs is effectively carried out, it will starve the Bosnian Serb militia of the weapons and fuel needed to pursue the fight against the republic's Moslems and Croats. Branding the Bosnian Serb assembly's decision as irresponsible, the Serbian government in Belgrade said: 'Aid to the Bosnian Serb republic should in future be reduced to just food and medicines. . . . Reasons no longer exist for further assistance in money, fuel, raw materials etc.' Diplomats in Belgrade said the move was a sign of the Serbian government's desire to halt the war and stave off the threat of western military intervention. Belgrade's move came after Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, urged Serbia to seal off its border with Bosnia. Bosnia on the brink, Page 2</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil studies coffee stance GOVERNMENT officials and private-sector representatives met in Brasilia yesterday to try to hammer out a detailed Brazilian position for the next round of talks on the International Coffee Agreement, set to begin on May 27. 'The idea is to go to the meeting with a clear position,' said Mr Joaquim Libanio Ferreira Leite, director of exports for the Guaxupe Coffee Producers Co-operative. 'Up to now we have waited for the others' positions.' Brazil is expected to maintain its 10-point overall proposal announced prior to the April round of talks. Present discussions are aimed at defining specifics within those guiding principles, said Mr Celsius Lodder, director of the Department of Supply and Prices of the Economy Ministry, who is co-ordinating the government's participation. 'What we don't want to discuss right now is a quota for Brazil,' said Mr Lodder. 'We think there are other points that are more important.' The Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters says the country's coffee exports in the first four months of 1992 increased by 12 per cent over the same period last year, to 5.73m bags (60 kg each). But because of low prices on the world market receipts were down by 9.6 per cent at Dollars 425.6m.</p>

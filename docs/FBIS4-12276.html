			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 6 Apr (MENA)--An official Yemeni source has  denied a statement by an official at the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP], led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, about a north Yemeni military  buildup on the former border regions between the north and the  south of Yemen. The source said the YSP official's statement is  not true and aims to cover up the military buildup and movements  by the forces of the YSP in al-Dali' and Shabwah in the south.    The source warned against attempts by the YSP separatists,  as  he described them, to seriously escalate the military situation,  dragging the country into a crushing civil war that could lead  to separation and return the country to the situation it was in  before 22 May 1990, the day unity was declared.    The Yemeni source said the YSP separatists are seeking  military escalation to circumvent the Pledge and Accord document  and hinder the implementation of the decisions made by the  Council of Ministers in its latest meeting in Aden. The  decisions provide for withdrawing troops from the former border  regions.    The source denied reports that several countries offered  proposals to solve the Yemeni crisis on the basis of federation  or confederation. No Arab brother made such proposals. Indeed,  they all stressed support for the Yemeni unity and its  continuation, the source said.    The official Yemeni source stressed that the General  People's  Congress, led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, is eager for  dialogue among the political forces as the only option and the  best solution to protect unity, reach understanding on common  denominators to build the Yemeni state, and entrench the course  of unity.    The source denied reports that during the meeting in Salalah  in Oman, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih threatened to resort to  war to solve the crisis. The source said these reports are  false and are being promoted to cover up the YSP's unjustified  military escalation and preparation for war.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 20 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Tatsuro Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor  Corporation, was elected to succeed Yutaka Kume (chairman of  Nissan Motor Company) as chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Association [JAMA] at the association's regular  general meeting on 19 May.    During a news conference after taking over the chairmanship,  Toyoda discussed the pending automobiles issue between Japan and  the United States. He said: "With regard to objective criteria  (to gauge the openness of the Japanese market), it seems that  the government has some ideas of its own. However, I understand  that (the two countries) have not agreed on numerical targets."  He indicated that JAMA has no intention to set numerical  targets for imports of auto parts and finished cars from the  United States.    JAMA published an "action plan" to help promote the import  of  foreign-made auto parts and finished cars last March. As Japan  and the United States work toward the resumption of the economic  framework talks, certain quarters in the United States are again  asking for concrete numerical targets. Commenting on this,  Toyoda said: "Automobiles is a sector where cooperation is done  mainly within the private sector in both countries. On the part  of the Japanese makers, we feel that our efforts to increase  local production of cars in the United States and working for  (the elimination of friction) have not been fully appreciated.  Numerical targets have not been approved even between the two  governments."    Regarding objective criteria to measure the degree of market  liberalization, Toyoda took a cautious stance, saying: "Some  people suggest setting a number for car importers. Dealers  function differently in Japan and the United States. What do we  base this figure on? This is an issue that requires further  discussion."</p>

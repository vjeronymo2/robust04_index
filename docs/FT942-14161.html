			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: European expansion for Redland Redland, one of Britain's biggest building material companies, has merged Redland Koramic, its 50 per cent-owned Benelux brick joint venture, with the brick interests of Van Biervliet, a privately owned Belgian group, writes Andrew Taylor. The acquisition has been financed from Redland Koramic's own resources at no cash cost to Redland. The enlarged group, of which Redland initially will own 42 per cent, will have an annual turnover of Pounds 135m and produce more than 1bn facing bricks a year, making it one of continental Europe's biggest brick manufacturers.</p>

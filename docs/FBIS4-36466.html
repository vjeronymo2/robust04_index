			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F> Gur by Ya'aqov Eylon and Mikhal Gazit; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Eylon] Mr. Gur, is the  attitude emanating from Amman inspired by Damascus?    [Gur] No. Unfortunately, Damascus is still unyielding. So  far the Damascus attitude has been projected through the actions  of Hizballah, rather than peaceful advances. That is why I  attach such great significance to the Jordanian awakening.    [Gazit] Do you really believe Jordan awakened of its own  accord, that it was not affected by the green light it has  reportedly received from al-Asad?    [Gur] It is my opinion that it was an independent Jordanian  decision. I do not know how far-reaching their decision is, but  it is definitely not the result of Syrian prodding. I hope it  will mature and progress. If it affects Syria in a positive  direction, it will be doubly welcome. For myself, I see it as a  new line adopted by Jordan, which does not want to be left out  of the process -- which could happen, what with the continuing  implementation of the arrangement between us and the  Palestinians.    [Eylon] What they do want, Mr. Gur, is 320 square km between  the port of al-'Aqabah and the Dead Sea.    [Gur] I am very well acquainted with the disputed issues.  All these issues can be settled. I can tell you in no  uncertain terms that there is no reason why Israel and Jordan  should not reach an understanding quite quickly for the benefit  of both sides. As far as Israel is concerned, such an  understanding is important for the future of the negotiations  with the Palestinians too, because it opens up new, important,  and very consequential options for the next phases of  negotiations.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Members of the contact group for  Bosnia-Herzegovina that includes representatives of the United  States, Russia, France, Germany, Great Britain, and the United  Nations had talks today with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a report by Nedzad  Leko:    [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks, the first to  address the journalists was David Manning, head of the contact  group and representative of Great Britain:    [Manning, in English with superimposed translation into  Serbo-Croatian] We have had two very useful days of talks, both  here and in Pale. We have established two courses of action.  We need a cease-fire and we must accelerate the diplomatic  process. We have expounded our ideas to both sides. They  listened to us and presented their first reactions. We should  come back next week. We shall leave them time to think about  this so that next week we shall be able to see how far we have  got.    [Leko] [passage omitted] Speaking about the talks that he  had with the members of the contact group, President Alija  Izetbegovic said the following:    [Izetbegovic] Well, I do not have anything special to tell  you, apart from the fact that [word indistinct] Mr. Redman and  his associates said that the Serbs had agreed to comply with the  conditions of the ultimatum that [word indistinct] on Gorazde.  As far as we know, they still have not done so, but they are  supposedly going to. Of course, we are going to monitor their  activities and see what they will do.    The talks about the cessation of hostilities are continuing.  No special agreement has been reached as yet. This group, the  contact group will come again all together on 5 May to resume  the talks. That is all. They have informed us about the course  of the talks held in Pale.    [Leko] Foreign journalists asked President Izetbegovic  whether he is satisfied with the way the aggressor is complying  with the NATO ultimatum.    [Izetbegovic] I am not satisfied with what has been done in  Gorazde. Namely, they have kept armed people there as police  (?cadres) within the 3-km radius. And there is still some heavy  weaponry within the 20-km radius.    [Leko] Under what conditions will you negotiate with the  enemy, the foreign journalists asked.    [Izetbegovic] We have said that we will negotiate, provided  that that the conditions of [words indistinct] (?in Gorazde).  There are no other conditions. There is only the assertion that  there are going to be no special [words indistinct]. Of course,  we are going to demand guarantees of their compliance with the  cease-fire.    [Leko] One journalist asked: Are you afraid that the  aggressor may continue that same practice of redeploying heavy  weapons to other fronts?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, we pointed out this danger. We want the  international community to take some measures against the future  moving of heavy artillery and equipment that was concentrated  around Gorazde. In this respect we do not have any special  guarantees and it has therefore remained for our army to defend  (?these) free territories. This is the only guarantee. [words  indistinct] our [words indistinct] Sarajevo and Gorazde.  However, we cannot (?deny) that the international community has  nevertheless done something in that respect. Sarajevo [words  indistinct] is obviously under [words indistinct]. In Gorazde  [passage indistinct].    However, our army obviously has to defend these territories  and in this respect, I think that it is ready [to do so].    [Leko] Will you accept a permanent cease-fire?, the foreign  journalists asked.    [Izetbegovic] We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire  only. We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire only, of  between two and three months. They have [words indistinct]. We  have refused [word indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

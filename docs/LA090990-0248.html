			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEORGE MICHAEL'S CASE AGAINST FAME;  </P> <P> THE FORMER WHAM! STAR THOUGHT HE'D WALKED AWAY FROM TEEN ADULATION WITH HIS  'FAITH' ALBUM, BUT HIS SEXY IMAGE BECAME A NIGHTMARE. NOW HE'S TRYING TO MAKE  SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  </P> <P> What does George Michael have to complain about?  </P> <P> Here's an Englishman who came out of nowhere in 1984 to -- wham! -- break into  the U.S. Top 10 with a catchy, flyweight song, "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go,"  making him a pop star at 21.  </P> <P> Three years later, Michael made the almost unprecedented leap from pretty-boy  teen dream to respected adult pop artist. His first solo album, "Faith," sold  more than 14 million copies and won the Grammy for best album of the year. This  time it wasn't just teenyboppers speaking.  </P> <P> So, what's the problem?  </P> <P> Michael says his pop dreams proved to be a personal nightmare, leaving him on  the verge of an emotional breakdown during the early weeks of the 1988 "Faith"  tour.  </P> <P> Back now with his second solo effort, "Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,"  Michael is taking potentially revolutionary steps in hopes of reducing the  strain of his celebrity status.  </P> <P> In a campaign to downplay his exposure, he's not making any videos for the new  album, and he's not planning an extensive tour. He may just do a half-dozen or  so benefit concerts early next year, and even then he may concentrate on songs  by other people.  </P> <P> "It's quite simple, really," the singer said, sitting on the beachfront patio  of his manager's Marina del Rey apartment. "I decided that the thing I really  enjoy . . . the thing I really needed was my songwriting. I didn't need the  celebrity."  </P> <P> That sounds fine in theory, but complaints about pressures at the top are  commonplace in pop music. Artists frequently argue that videos trivialize a  song, and that touring for months at a time works against the creative process,  not to mention maintaining a normal lifestyle.  </P> <P> Doing something about these complaints, however, is rare because promotional  videos and touring are considered essential elements in building  multimillion-unit album sales. They are part of the price of fame.  </P> <P> Videos, in fact, may be a more important sales tool these days than live shows.  This is the age of the video star: Madonna, Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul . . .  and George Michael.  </P> <P> Despite a lightweight image left over from his days as a member of the duo  Wham!, Michael has proved a sharp pop strategist who understood in the early  '80s that good videos had become a key to success. His sexy image in the Wham!  and "Faith" videos most certainly contributed to his appeal.  </P> <P> The question that Michael's decision poses over the coming months: Can a record  maker compete on the charts in the '90s without videos and tours? If someone of  Michael's commercial stature and video presence succeeds, other artists may  also step away from the video grind. This could lead to a break in video's  stranglehold on the pop marketplace, where the trend is toward signing artists  for their video potential rather than their musical abilities.  </P> <P> But even Columbia Records is hedging its bet. It has released, with Michael's  permission, a video of the album's first single, "Praying for Time," that  consists simply of the song's socially conscious lyrics printed against a black  backdrop -- no images of Michael himself.  </P> <P> Another question raised by Michael's pledge: his credibility.  </P> <P> To a cynical pop world that has heard everyone from Frank Sinatra to David  Bowie threaten to say goodby to the microphone, the latest vows of George  Michael may seem like little more than a calculated publicity move. After all,  he's obviously still doing interviews.  </P> <P> Michael anticipated the question.  </P> <P> "I'm sure a lot of people are going to believe all this is just some sort of  gimmick . . . just another way to stir interest," Michael said in what was the  first of three U.S. newspaper interviews he had agreed to do -- with the Los  Angeles Times, the New York Times and USA Today -- in connection with the  release of the album on Tuesday.  </P> <P> " 'But I'm also sure that most people find it hard to believe that stardom can  make you miserable. After all, everybody wants to be a star. I certainly did,  and I worked hard to get it. But I was miserable, and I don't want to feel that  way again."  </P> <P> George Michael may be praying for time in his personal life and in his new hit  single, but he could also use something a little more down-to-earth: a good  sunscreen lotion.  </P> <P> Yes, Michael, a man known in the '80s for a tan so perfect that some speculated  he somehow dyed his skin, had a shiny sunburn on his nose and forehead as he  sat down for the interview.  </P> <P> Michael smiled when asked about the skin-dye rumors.  </P> <P> "I used to just sit out in the sun all the time because I loved it, so I always  did have a tan," he said, brushing self-consciously at his bright, glowing  nose. "But now I get bored doing that. I start getting restless . . . and,  besides, I'm starting to burn. That's something that never used to happen."  </P> <P> The singer, who had picked up the burn while riding a bike around the  neighborhood that morning, was dressed casually in a white T-shirt and shorts  topped off by a Lakers cap. He nibbled at some vegetables and other snacks on a  table in front of him.  </P> <P> Michael, who has what he describes as a "vacation/investment" house in Santa  Barbara but lives chiefly in London, seemed unusually at ease for someone who  says he doesn't enjoy interviews.  </P> <P> He didn't act overly friendly or overly dramatic. More than anything, he seemed  to be taking care of a final chore before going on vacation -- and that's what  he may consider his break from video work and media exposure to be.  </P> <P> The sunburn added a welcome human touch to a persona that has often come across  as a touch calculated.  </P> <P> But why the final round of goodby interviews? Why not just drop out of sight?  </P> <P> "I think it was important, not really for the people who have always doubted  me, because they'll still doubt me," he said. "I did it for the people who have  supported me. I think they are owed some sort of explanation.  </P> <P> "But it won't really be goodby to my way of thinking because they'll still have  the most important part of me, which is the music. The rest -- the whole video  image -- was just a creation . . . something I wanted in the beginning because  of all the childish fantasies about (craving) love and attention.  </P> <P> "The truth is, it all got much bigger than I ever imagined -- and much harder  to control. Ultimately, I wasn't comfortable with that kind of visibility and  power. Once I became more confident as a writer, I realized I didn't need all  that other bolstering."  </P> <P> Arrogant is a word that was often applied to the handsome young singer during  his early days as the leader of Wham!, the English duo whose hits, besides  "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," included "Everything She Wants" and "I'm Your  Man."  </P> <P> And it's easy to understand why, when you see such quotes as this one from a  1988 interview with the English pop magazine Q:  </P> <P> "People have always thought my career has been incredibly calculated and  premeditated but it runs along pretty well parallel lines with most people's  careers. It's just that the decisions I have made personally have been much  more . . . correct."  </P> <P> For a while, everything the pop sensation did was indeed correct -- and  blatantly calculated, a trait that makes some observers suspicious now about  Michael's true intentions. Two other tags applied to Michael more recently  seemed more appropriate: articulate and down-to-earth.  </P> <P> The way he tells it, George Michael was born to be a pop star. It's as if  nothing else really mattered during his childhood. Even the name was part of  the pop creation.  </P> <P> Michael didn't shy away from questions about his childhood in various London  suburbs, but almost every answer involved music. "I wanted to be a pop star  since I was about 7 years old," he said flatly.  </P> <P> Born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in London on June 25, 1963, Michael is the  son of a Greek father and an English mother. One of three children, Michael,  whose father operated a restaurant, described his upbringing as middle-class  and his childhood as "stable, happy."  </P> <P> Young Georgios did well in high school, where he was especially fond of English  and art. But his passion was music. He loved listening to records, especially  Elton John, Stevie Wonder and Queen. He didn't just listen to them -- he  dissected them. He was fascinated by song construction and how arrangements  were pieced together.  </P> <P> But Georgios didn't think about pursuing music until he met Andrew Ridgeley, a  schoolmate who shared his love for music and his hunger for fame.  </P> <P> They formed their first band, a ska-influenced outfit called the Executive, in  the summer of 1979. The group played a few dates and recorded a two-song demo  that they sent to record companies, but it was rejected.  </P> <P> Undaunted, the pair continued to write songs together while working at various  odd jobs. Excited by the energy of the British dance-club scene, they recorded  another demo tape. This time the tape -- featuring such original tunes as  "Careless Whisper" and "Wham! Rap" -- led to a record deal in 1982.  </P> <P> Unusually headstrong, George Michael -- as Panayiotou began calling himself  around this time -- rejected attempts to turn the duo, called Wham!, into a  traditional rock band that would follow the normal club circuit in England.  </P> <P> In "Bare," an autobiography recently published in England, Michael explained  his thinking at the time. "We were very aware of how the music business was  changing, how you could suddenly reach more people with a video on MTV than  with a 90-date tour of the States. We knew it was the future . . . that for the  first time you didn't have to be a band."  </P> <P> About those days, Michael recalled during the Marina del Rey interview, "I was  shocked at how little most people seemed to know in the record business and how  willing they were to listen to anyone who seemed to have a firm idea about what  was needed."  </P> <P> Michael most certainly had a firm idea -- and it worked. He made it from high  school to the top of the British charts in less than a year.  </P> <P> America was next.  </P> <P> At first, everything was wonderful in Wham! The success. The screaming fans.  And Michael fueled the frenzy. He danced around the stage in tight shorts and  flashed the brightest smile since David Cassidy.  </P> <P> It was a time of flamboyance in pop . . . the start of the video age. Such  rivals as Duran Duran and Culture Club were equally flamboyant, but Michael and  Wham! outdistanced them all in England, coming up with slick and generally  disposable pop that also had an undeniable edge of craft.  </P> <P> There were doubts about Wham! at every step in its U.S. assault. At first,  record company sharpies in this country said that the group's teen appeal  wouldn't translate well here. They were wrong.  </P> <P> "Wake Me Up . . ." and "Careless Whisper" both went to No. 1. Other insiders  raised their eyebrows in 1985 when Wham! tried to sell out stadiums. Wrong  again.  </P> <P> However, Michael, who emerged as the heartthrob and creative center of the  group, knew he had to get away from the teen-ish Wham! image and sound if he  were to have a long career. So, the inevitable breakup.  </P> <P> "I think one of the things that people loved about Wham! was the sense of  friendship we projected, and that friendship was genuine," Michael said.  "Andrew brought a lightness, a fun to the whole thing.  </P> <P> "But he knew that Wham! was a finite thing and that it was just a question of  when. We agreed very early that we wouldn't let it burn out . . . that when it  got to a certain height, we'd stop it, and we did."  </P> <P> Several small moves helped establish Michael's solo credibility, including a  well-received appearance on a Motown TV special, where he sang with his  childhood idols Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson. Another was a hit duet, "I  Knew You Were Waiting for Me," with Aretha Franklin.  </P> <P> Yet "Faith" was his biggest test.  </P> <P> The album was designed to both hold on to the legion of Wham! fans, yet exhibit  a new maturity of songwriting that would attract an older following. It  succeeded remarkably well.  </P> <P> Videos for songs like the sensual, aggressive "I Want Your Sex" and the catchy,  rockabilly-tinged "Faith" were MTV smashes, while such numbers as the dark,  disillusioned "Hand to Mouth" suggested a deeper dimension.  </P> <P> If the album's success was liberating, the "Faith" tour proved a horror show --  and led to Michael's dramatic decision to step out of the normal pop  guidelines.  </P> <P> The singer's mood darkened slightly as he recounted the "madness" of the early  days of the 1988 "Faith" tour.  </P> <P> "Actually, I can remember the exact moment that I decided I must change my  life," he said.  </P> <P> Naively, Michael had thought he would be able to leave the frenzy behind when  he stepped out of Wham!  </P> <P> "We (opened) the 'Faith' tour in Japan, which was fine because they are  reasonably quiet, and they listened to the music. But then we went to  Australia, and the roof came off the first place we came to. The screaming. I  thought, 'God, it is happening all over again . . . I'm not going to have a  chance to really sing,' " Michael recalled, reliving his displeasure at the  clamor and the huge sites. "And I realized I had to do it for 10 months."  </P> <P> "It was devastating," he said of the "Faith" tour experience. "I was hugely  temperamental, and I had a major problem with my throat, which didn't help at  all because people thought that was just part of my being temperamental, and it  wasn't. . . .  </P> <P> "It was a combination of things, including being on the road for that long. I'm  someone who really needs a center. I was very close to what I could call a  breakdown until I finally took a month off, because of (throat) surgery, and  sorted it out. I made the decisions that I'm acting on."  </P> <P> Why does the video star now hate videos?  </P> <P> Two reasons. Chiefly, they violate Michael's sensibilities as a songwriter, but  he also has grown uncomfortable in front of a camera. (He refused to have his  photo taken for this article.)  </P> <P> "Videos force you to think of (songs) in a certain way rather than being free  to interpret them however you like," he said. "Some songs are very good video  songs . . . 'I Want Your Sex' and 'Faith' . . . but very little in this album  is right for video.  </P> <P> "When you are trying to express things with metaphors and much more subtlety,  that's when you are doing yourself a disservice by making a video. I don't want  to say I won't do another video ever, but I won't do one for the foreseeable  future. If my life goes the way I want it to, I would like to never step in  front of a camera again."  </P> <P> On that issue, Michael added, "I don't know. It's strange. At some point in  your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a  certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs  you more and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns  you off . . . and it does feel like it is taking something from you. I don't  know how to explain it any more than that. It is like taking something you  don't want to give."  </P> <P> Beyond the question of videos and interviews, photo sessions and tours, the  real challenge facing George Michael at the start of the '90s is the depth of  his artistry.  </P> <P> Even with his fame and the "Faith" Grammy, there is still an anonymous quality  to Michael's music up through "Faith." Much like Billy Joel, he has a sense of  craft as a writer, but he has yet to establish an original or arresting vision  that gives his music a distinctive, significant edge.  </P> <P> Though he was an early bloomer as a pop star, he is getting something of a late  start as a serious writer. By 27, Bob Dylan had already written "Highway 61  Revisited," the Beatles had released "Rubber Soul," Bruce Springsteen had  recorded "Born to Run" and U2 had delivered "The Joshua Tree."  </P> <P> Michael appears to recognize that challenge. He said he hopes staying off the  road will give him more time to work on his writing, and that he has begun to  explore writers of such extraordinary vision as Dylan, Joni Mitchell and the  Beatles. He also was planning to do an album of dance tunes for early next  year, but now may continue to write in the more serious vein of "Listen Without  Prejudice." He does exhibit more personal revelation in key songs on the new  album (see adjoining review).  </P> <P> One encouraging sign of independence is that Michael isn't going along with the  flattering comparisons of his new single, "Praying for Time," with John  Lennon's idealistic "Imagine."  </P> <P> In pointing out that the socially conscious song has attracted the most radio  airplay of any single since 1985's "We Are the World," USA Today described its  tone as similar to that of "Imagine."  </P> <P> "It's not like 'Imagine' at all," Michael said. "It's much more negative. I'd  like to say things are bound to get better, but I don't really believe it. The  song is my own way of trying to justify people's actions and their selfishness,  I suppose."  </P> <P> Sample lyrics from "Praying for Time":  </P> <P>  And it's hard to love, there's so much hate  </P> <P>  Hanging on to hope  </P> <P>  When there is no hope to speak of  </P> <P>  And the wounded skies above  </P> <P>  Say it's much too late  </P> <P>  So maybe we should all be praying for time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Michael leaned back in his chair and shrugged.  </P> <P> The world, he said, seems like a "place where things are running out of time.  Everything is getting more violent. You need more protection all the time and  it has gotten so bad that people's general attitude is, 'What the hell? I think  I am going to hold on to what I've got.' The key line for me is the one about  it's hard to love, but there's so much to hate.  </P> <P> "The only real copout in the whole thing is the line about praying for time.  Maybe I'd think that if I had children . . . I'd want to reach for straws. But  I don't think that will make the slightest difference. I'm very much  fatalistic."  </P> <P> Besides making more music, Michael hopes to use the extra time to grow on a  personal level. Relationships, he said, have been a problem for him.  </P> <P> "Well, they really haven't been difficult in the last few years, because I just  haven't had one," he said. "I have been pretty disastrous with relationships,  and I have kind of decided I was going to give myself a rest from them for a  while."  </P> <P> While Michael's goals about concentrating on music and personal growth rather  than show-biz marketing sounds good, Michael is bound to feel anxious if album  sales slip substantially.  </P> <P> There's not a great danger in releasing the first single from an album without  a video because the momentum from the last album will cause large numbers of  fans to buy it.  </P> <P> But the real test of an album's commercial strength normally comes three to six  months after its release -- when videos for a second or third single are  released to keep public interest high.  </P> <P> Tommy Mottola, president of CBS Records, is thrilled about the strong initial  radio response to "Praying for Time," the album's first single. But he's also  clearly a bit anxious about the singer-songwriter's decision not to do  promotional videos.  </P> <P> "I think you'll have a lot of disappointed fans because there is no video, but  when they get to understand his point of view and hear the record, I don't  think there will be any problem," he said, trying to put the most optimistic  slant on the situation in a phone interview from his office in New York.  </P> <P> "He explained that he wants to do more work, more songs, more albums rather  than have his time diffused with touring and doing videos and things that  really rub him the wrong way. And if doing those things are going to cause that  kind of a reaction in an artist, then what's the point of doing them?"  </P> <P> Bob Merlis, vice president of publicity for rival Warner Bros. Records, called  Michael's move a "noble experiment," but said he thinks the importance of video  is so firmly established in the pop world that it is difficult to imagine  anything dislodging it.  </P> <P> "I can't see a flood of artists following Michael's lead even if his album  matches the sales of 'Faith,' " Merlis said. "Besides, Michael is a special  case. He's already a multi-platinum artist who has a following. It'd be  different if he were starting out. More than a test of the importance of video,  I think the move may be a test of loyalty of Michael's audience."  </P> <P> Isn't Michael worried about sales?  </P> <P> "I'm sure everyone (at CBS) is terrified that all this is going to sabatoge the  album," the singer said. "But I honestly feel I am in a very privileged  position because I have the luxury of knowing that simply because of the size  of the last album, this album will be heard . . . regardless of whether I make  videos or not.  </P> <P> "I also have enough faith in the songs to believe that if people hear the  album, enough will like it. I don't necessarily believe it will sell 14 million  copies. I'd be very surprised if it does, but I do believe it is a much better  album, and I think that in itself will compensate for part of the lack of  presence."  </P> <P> Reflecting on the gamble involved in his experiment, Michael added:  </P> <P> "I can't lose because I know what the alternative is. I'm not stupid enough to  think that I can deal with another 10 or 15 years of major exposure. I think  that is the ultimate tragedy of fame. . . . People who are simply out of  control, who are lost. I've seen so many of them, and I don't want to be  another cliche."  </P></p>

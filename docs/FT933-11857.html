			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market focus on Boots FURTHER speculation over the likely direction of strategy at Boots, the UK retail and drugs group, inspired another day of hefty turnover in the shares. Weekend press speculation added to rumours that Boots may be considering disposing of its drugs research arm, following the decision to withdraw Manoplax, its top-selling heart drug. The company has made no comment on the wide-ranging rumours which have raised questions over the future direction of the company. The situation gained added spice last night as City analysts met Boots' management to discuss the question. Doubts over the future of the drugs arm prompted further concern in the media over the group's loss-making home products business, Do It All, shared as a joint venture with WH Smith. One newspaper suggested that the division would be rationalised and given a more up-market image. However, many analysts were sceptical, because of the costs of the leases on many of Do It All outlets. Do It All has suffered from the intense competition in the home products market, which has involved frequent price wars and tight margins. Any attempt to make the business more quality-led and compete with J. Sainsbury's Homebase would be very fraught, according to analysts. The speculation boosted Boots' shares, one analyst commenting that 'it shows that the company is not afraid to consider biting the bullet'. They closed 10 up at 442p in very heavy turnover of 8.5m. WH Smith 'A' appreciated 5 to 444p.</p>

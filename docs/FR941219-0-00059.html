			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Several commenters discussed proposed variations to the Servicing Disclosure Statement. These variations included permitting a lender to: (i) state its reasons for servicing or not servicing loans; (ii) identify the types of loans it services and, by the percentages of each type of loan transferred, the types of loans it sells; and (iii) advise the borrower of the new servicer, if any, at settlement. One commenter suggested that &sect;3500.21(c) contain a statement that the use of the sample language in the appendices be considered as compliance with the disclosure requirements of that paragraph. Fifteen commenters recommended that lenders should not be required to obtain written acknowledgements of the Servicing Disclosure Statement from loan applicants whose applications are rejected or withdrawn. One commenter recommended that actual percentages be used rather than rounding to the nearest quartile. Commenters also requested that HUD permit longer than 31 days to calculate the percentage after the end of the calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The elements contained in the rule and Servicing Disclosure Statement comply with the Secretary's mandate under Section 6 of RESPA. The Secretary is required to develop a disclosure statement that would notify applicants for federally related mortgage loans about the servicing procedures, transfer practices and requirements, and the available complaint resolution process. In addition, the Secretary must develop an acknowledgement that the disclosure has been read and understood, as evidenced by signatures of the applicants when such a statement appears in the application. As in the interim rule, the Secretary has determined that is in the applicant's best interest for the signature to be at the end of the Servicing Disclosure Statement, because this directs the applicant's attention particularly to the servicing transfer issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the precise wording of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is left to the lender's discretion, HUD presumes that lenders will use the sample language in developing their own forms. However, HUD will not give blanket approval to forms that it has not seen; the lender must determine the appropriate language to make proper disclosure to the borrower. Only the language in the model Applicant's Acknowledgement is mandatory and must be followed precisely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though the Department believes that most lenders will use the simpler alternative language allowed by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, approved September 23, 1994), the Department has adopted the suggestion of permitting a longer time for computation of the previous year's percentages. The final rule allows the lender to calculate the percentages no later than the end of the first quartile in the next calendar year (March 31). Under his Section 19 authority, the Secretary has also created an exemption to the disclosure requirement, including the signed acknowledgment, if an applicant is turned down for credit within three business days of receipt of the application. This exemption makes all the mortgage servicing notice provisions consistent with good faith estimate amendments in section 951 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Merger and/or Acquisition of Servicing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Several commenters asked various questions as to what disclosures were necessary when a servicer buys another servicer, with or without changing the servicer's name, or merges one servicer into another servicer. In addition, two comments concerned the functions of ``master servicers'' and ``subservicers.'' The entity holding servicing rights is frequently called the ``master servicer,'' and the entity performing the actual servicing is called the ``subservicer''. Two situations were posited: first, the rights to servicing are sold, but the subservicer remains the same. Second, the subservicer changes, but the master servicer remains the same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The controlling consideration in whether a Notice of Transfer must be delivered for a sale, transfer, or assignment is whether there is a significant change of servicing that potentially affects the borrower. In ordinary transfers of servicing between distinct entities, the Notice of Transfer is always required. In certain other situations_e.g., transfers between affiliates, transfers because a servicer or subservicer is bought or merged into another entity, and transfers between master servicers when the subservicer stays the same and when the subservicer changes_a Notice of Transfer is required unless there is no change in the payee, the collection address, account number, or the amount of the payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Six commenters suggested that when there are multiple applicants, it should be sufficient for the lender to give the Servicing Disclosure Statement to one of the co-applicants in a face-to-face interview. One commenter requested that a co-signer not be considered as a person who applies for a loan, therefore obviating the need for the co-signer to receive a Servicing Disclosure Statement. Another commenter asked how long a lender must keep co-signers' signatures on file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delivery of a single Servicing Disclosure Statement in a face-to-face meeting with one or more applicants is acceptable, and the Acknowledgement may be signed at that time. For each applicant or co-applicant who is not present, the Servicing Disclosure Statement may be delivered on his or her behalf to an applicant who is present, or may be mailed within 3 business days by first class mail, postage prepaid. While a co-signer might be an integral party to the transaction, a co-signer is primarily interested in timely payments of the mortgage, not in who holds the mortgage servicing. Therefore, a co-signer's acknowledgment is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The signed acknowledgments are to be in the loan package. Consistent with other record-retention requirements of part 3500, the lender must keep the signed acknowledgments for five years after the date of settlement of the loan unless the lender disposes of its interest in the loan and does not service the mortgage. In this case, the Servicing Disclosure Statement would be part of the transferred loan file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

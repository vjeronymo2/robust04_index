			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Letter: The line from there to here Sir, I have always felt that I should take note of the commentary of the Financial Times, but if a vital, direct ancestor of mine died childless (Observer: 'Title tattle', July 15), I feel singularly ill-equipped to do so. The first Lord Kingsdown was in fact my great-great-grandfather's elder brother. And perhaps I could add there is a third Kingsdown in Kent, whose church, reconstructed by my collateral ancestor (sic) with the assistance of Pugin, I can see from this house, which has always been my home. Kingsdown, Torry Hill, Sittingbourne, Kent ME9 0SP</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / W German production up by 2% in August WEST German industrial production increased by a seasonally adjusted 2 per cent in August against July. The largest increase was in capital goods, which rose by 4.5 per cent. Manufacturing went up 2 per cent and the construction sector by 3 per cent, according to the economics ministry. However, output for the two months of July and August remained unchanged compared with May-June. German economists pointed out that while foreign demand, mostly from the US and Asia, was picking up, domestic orders continued to decrease. They warned that the energy tax planned for 1994 and extra burdens on pension funds from next January, would partly dampen any upswing in domestic demand. Output for the two months was 6.5 per cent below the level for the same period last year. However, this represented a slight improvement over the months of June and July, when it stood at 6.9 per cent below the previous year, and over May-June when it was 7.3 per cent below.</p>

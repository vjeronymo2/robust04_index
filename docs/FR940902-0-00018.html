Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 219(d) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that require certain 1993 and earlier model year urban buses having engines, which are replaced or rebuilt after January 1, 1995, comply with an emission standard or control technology reflecting the best retrofit technology and maintenance practices reasonably achievable. On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses (58 FR 21359). The Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program requires affected operators of urban buses to choose between two compliance options. Option 1 establishes particulate matter (PM) emissions requirements for each urban bus in an operator's fleet whose engine is rebuilt or replaced. Option 2 is a fleet averaging program that sets out specific annual target levels for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, EPA stated that it would review the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1, 1994, and publish the post-rebuild PM emission levels for urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild levels are to be used by operators choosing to comply with Option 2 for calculating their fleet emission levels. This  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document fulfills that commitment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No equipment had been certified as of July 1, 1994. This notice therefore confirms that the default provisions of the final rule that are designed to assure emissions reduction for the program shall be effective for the first two years of the program, 1995 and 1996. Emission levels that are to be used in the event that no equipment is certified by July 1994 are set forth in the table provided at 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) of the regulations promulgated in the April 1993 final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preamble to the April 21, 1993 final rulemaking stated that EPA intended to publish in this notice a table indicating required post-rebuild PM emission levels for all affected urban buses. EPA also stated that it would append its determination regarding post-rebuild emission levels to the CFR as an appendix to part 85 subpart O (the subpart of the CFR containing the urban bus retrofit/rebuild regulations). However, because no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994, the default post-rebuild emission levels, which are already contained in the regulation, will apply. Thus, EPA believes that there is no need to add an appendix to subpart O at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In July 1996, EPA will review the retrofit/rebuild equipment certified by July 1, 1996 and publish the emission levels which must be used by operators using Option 2 for calendar years 1997 and thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Review of Certified Equipment and Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the emissions and cost requirements for the urban bus retrofit/rebuild program. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(B)(5), operators choosing to comply with Option 2 must use the PM levels specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild PM level'' in the table provided at &sect;85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) for calculating the target level for their fleet (TLF). The determination of whether to use the pre-rebuild emission level or the post-rebuild emission level must be made in accordance with 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An urban bus operator choosing Option 2 must be able to demonstrate that its fleet level attained (FLA) is equal to or less than its TLF. In general, an operator choosing Option 2 has the following strategies available to comply with this requirement:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

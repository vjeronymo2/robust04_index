The president, Flight- Lieutenant Jerry John  Rawlings, took the salute at the parade. Addressing the  ceremony, President Rawlings restated the commitment of the  government to the cause of the nation.    [Begin Rawlings recording] The government of the progressive  alliance comprising the National Democratic Congress, the  National Convention Party, and the Egle Party, is conscious of  the record of achievements of the revolutionary decade that  brought Ghana out of conditions of despair and hence our  commitment to build on the gains that have been made. In  rededicating ourselves to the task of nation-building today, we  will be guided by the fact that at the end of the day, we will  be judged not by the amount of political rhetoric we would have  generated, but by the concrete and practical achievements we  would have made in improving the quality of life of our people,  especially those in the rural areas.    Countrymen and women, there is a time for political fanfare,  there is a time for elections and there is a time for work --  for nation-building. Over a year has passed since the  presidential and parliamentary elections were held. While some  may already be setting their sights on 1996 and are dreaming  about their ambitions, we must remember that there is a lot of  hard work which needs doing now. No matter our political  persuasions, we must cooperate with each other in ensuring the  peaceful development of our nation. As a government, we  recognize that democracy thrives in an atmosphere of tolerance.  It is for this reason that the government continues to ignore  the various acts of provocation orchestrated by some political  interests. However, those amongst them who might be  contemplating going beyond their ugly noises must take note that  the government has a constitutional responsibility to maintain  law and order. [end recording]    President Rawlings spoke against acts of provocation by some  political interest groups. He also spoke about the need to  foster national unity.    [Begin Rawlings recording] Our individual and collective  loyalties to our families, ethnic groups and political parties  should not be allowed to divide us as a nation. We all have a  responsibility to promote unity, stability, and development and  to be actively involved in resolving situations which militate  against this unity. Countrymen and women, as we commemorate the  fifth anniversary of the inauguration of the Fourth Republic, we  should more than ever before be mindful of the challenges that  lie ahead. And it is only through our collective efforts that we  can build an enduring foundation for national development. In  the year ahead, let us have little less of the unproductive  political rhetorics and a little more concerted and practical  efforts in those areas which directly affect the lives of our  people. Productivity, rural development, export promotion, the  elimination of waste -- these are things which we can all  contribute towards no matter our affiliations or opinions.  These are the things which will make our nation competitive in  the global economic context.    As we celebrate the first anniversary of the Fourth  Republic,  we must thank God for bringing us this far. We must enter the  new year with renewed determination to strengthen the  foundations of national unity, stability, and development.  Noble countrymen and women, I wish to congratulate the  contingents on parade for an excellent drill. I also wish once  again to commend our officers and men in the Armed Forces, the  police, and the security agencies as well as our various  revolutionary organs and supporters for their diligence and  dedication to national unity. I thank you and wish you all,  once again, a happy anniversary and a happy new year. God be  with you. [end recording]</p>

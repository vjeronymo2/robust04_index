			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: First Financial wins Western Union auction First Financial Management, a data processing company, has won the bidding for Western Union, the world's biggest non-bank money transfer company, with a Dollars 1.153bn offer, a US bankruptcy court judge said yesterday, Reuter reports from Newark. Western Union, which was put up for auction by the bankruptcy judge in June, though not itself in bankruptcy, is owned by New Valley, which has been operating under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since March. Atlanta-based First Financial Management's winning bid beat that of its rival Forstmann Little, a leveraged buy-out firm, which dropped out of the bidding at Dollars 1.143bn. The third bidder, First Data, a credit card processing company spun off by American Express two years ago, also dropped out of the bidding. Bankruptcy Judge Novalyn Winfield said: 'Well, this long process is over and the marketplace seems to have won. This seems to be the highest and best offer for the company.' Mr Carl Icahn, who owns about Dollars 80m worth of New Valley bonds, said: 'This open bidding is terrific. I think it should be adopted in other bankruptcy cases.' He said he bought the bonds at 20 cents to 30 cents on the dollar and would be repaid in full.</p>

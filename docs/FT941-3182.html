			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / People: Yates' logical move to put theory into practice Martin Read, nearing the completion of his first year as managing director of Logica, the UK computing services company, is continuing his reconstruction work on the company's management team. Latest recruit is 45-year-old Jim Yates who, but for tardy paperwork connected with a Citroen DS23 he was buying, would be back in his native Australia, rather than taking responsibility for Logica's troubled North American and Asia Pacific operations. Educated at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, he was an officer in the Australian Army signals corps when in 1974 he decided to tour Europe, ostensibly for a couple of years. Held up by the paperwork needed to export the car from the UK and at a loose end, he accepted a job as computer programmer at Ferranti International and stayed for 16 years. When the company was brought down by fraud at ISC, its US subsidiary, he was given charge of clearing up some of the mess, which convinced him that British companies could make a better job of managing their overseas subsidiaries than often appeared to be the case. More recently he has been managing director of GEC/ Alsthom's transport signalling business and md of GEC Information Systems. As director of international operations at Logica he has the opportunity to put his theories into practice. The US has been a black hole for Logica for some years. Much of the restructuring work has been done but profitability remains elusive. Yates got rid of the Citroen when Ferranti supplied him with a company car. He regrets that; the car has become a collector's item and is worth more now than he sold it for.</p>

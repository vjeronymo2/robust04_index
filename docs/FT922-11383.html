			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Fishing: The biggest catch of all - Russia is the latest 'in' angling destination A CENTURY ago, Norway was the place for the moneyed angler seeking something out of the ordinary. For a time, in the 1920s and 1930s, Sweden, and in particular the River Em, where the giant sea trout ran, was the place to be seen. Later still Alaska and Canada held sway, although Iceland had its enthusiasts. But now now there is only one wilderness which the fashion-conscious fisherman need bother with - Russia. The sporting possibilities revealed in the wreckage of the Soviet Union have been hungrily seized upon by specialist travel companies. So far, attention has been focused on the salmon rivers of the Kola peninsular, which thrusts itself like a thumb into the Barents Sea north east of St Petersburg. The reports are of great runs of salmon, and sport of a quality now almost unheard of in the West. Already the frontiers are being pushed further back. I see that one company is offering trips to Kamchatka, with the promise of Pacific salmon. Another invites you to join what it calls a research fishing trip to somewhere called Yakutia, in Siberia, where sturgeon may be caught. I am afraid that I have no first-hand experience. I was offered the chance to go to Kola last year, but decided that ten days in the treeless, mosquito-infested tundra, pulling out salmon as fast as I could and putting them back again (catch-and-release is accepted practice) might not be as much fun as it first appeared. There was also  - I confess it with shame - a nagging fear that I might not pull anything out, and that reputation and self-esteem might suffer. However, although I have not fished in Russia myself, I have before me an entertaining account from one who has - although his experiences are a far cry from those glowingly advertised by Messrs Abercrombie and Kent and the rest. I met Marius-Adrian Dumitru while I was fishing in Transylvania a couple of years ago. His exceedingly pretty wife gave me a bag of cherries on a hot and thirsty day, and he and I talked fishing and became firm friends. Last autumn, he travelled to St Petersburg as a guest of the city's Anglers' and Hunters' Association. His description begins arrestingly: 'Numberless are the rivers and lakes of the great Russian taiga, but how to reach them?' Certainly, many people reached them, and some of them for ever. Marius found the Russians a very hospitable people. 'I was assailed', he writes, 'with real delicatessen richly aspersed with the never-failing vodka.' He also found his hosts entirely ignorant on matters of fly-fishing. On the River Vilojba - about 200 miles east of St Petersburg  - Marius was able to show the Russians what they were missing. From the Vilojba, Marius travelled north, to Karelia and the lake of Ladoga. He met a Romanian girl, Roxana. 'She proved to be my fairy as, after a whole week of endless rain, I finally had a wonderful autumn day. We crossed dark fir tree forests, past rivers and clear lakes, towards our destination.' Ladoga is celebrated, apparently, for a species of trout called the Kumja, which grows to 15lb and more. But Marius concentrated on another fish: 'Above me, thousands of ephemerids flew incessantly, and the grayling came to the surface to take my forgeries. When the setting sun lengthened the shadows of the trees over the lake, I felt a fish hang heavy on the end of my line. It was sixteen inches long - perhaps one-and-a-half pounds. Then the rain came down again.' Perversely, perhaps, I find this sort of thing more congenial to my imagination than the thought of ten days of salmon plunder in Kola. I would love to wander the streams that feed Ladoga. I could be lured to the lakes of Armenia, or to mighty Baikal. Kamchatka sounds a little chilly, and as I cannot find Yakutia on the map, I will have to reserve judgment. One place I am very keen on at the moment is Outer Mongolia. The other day, leafing through a 65-year-old copy of The Field, I came across a photograph of a Mr V. de Franck, holding a vast fish, a taimen of 58lb. Of the taimen I know no more than that it is a relative of the salmon. de Franck describes it as a grim and vicious fighter, and since he caught 37 of them on a two week trip, I am prepared to take his word for it. The river on which he enjoyed this sport was the Gan, whose limpid waters - he says  - flow from the Hingan Mountains across the plain of the North Barga. I have been unable to find the Gan, or the town of Kantagaitu (The Elks Are Here, in English), where he stayed. But the Argun - into which the Gan flows  - forms the border between Russia and China, so it must be on one side or the other. As a final recommendation, de Franck says: 'This territory is 100 per cent safe from the Chinese brigands who infest other parts of North Manchuria and have closed many promising fishing and shooting grounds to the sportsman.' What more do I need to know? I have always wanted to be an authority on something. Why not the Manchurian, or Mongolian, taimen?</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / ATTORNEY GENERAL;  </P> <P> LUNGREN ASSAILS SMITH WITH FEINSTEIN MEMOS  </P> <P> Employing Democrat Dianne Feinstein as his source, Republican state attorney  general candidate Dan Lungren sought to discredit the crime-fighting record of  his Democratic foe, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, during a rare joint  televised appearance Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lungren, appearing on a KCBS-TV "Newsmakers" taping scheduled to be broadcast  Sunday, waved in the air Smith's 1986 and 1987 performance reviews from  then-San Francisco Mayor Feinstein. In the letters, Feinstein, the Democratic  candidate for governor, stated that Smith's felony conviction rate was lower  than that in other major metropolitan areas across the state.  </P> <P> "These are annual reviews of the office of Arlo Smith -- and these are her  words, they are not my words," Lungren said.  </P> <P> "If you're going to be arrested for a felony anywhere in the state," the former  five-term congressman added, "the best place to be is Arlo Smith's San  Francisco."  </P> <P> Smith countered that since he became district attorney in 1979, San Francisco's  crime rate has declined by 25% and the number of convicts committed to state  prison has more than doubled.  </P> <P> "That's why peace officers who know best who is effective have supported my  (candidacy)," said Smith, who has split the state law enforcement community's  endorsements almost 50-50 with Lungren.  </P> <P> Later in the day, Feinstein entered the fray herself.  </P> <P> In a letter faxed to reporters by the Smith campaign, Feinstein said her  performance reviews of Smith had been written "in the heat of budget battles"  between the mayor's office and city department heads.  </P> <P> "Unlike you," the letter to Lungren continues, "Arlo Smith is a law enforcement  professional with 36 years of experience prosecuting killers, rapists and drug  dealers. Arlo Smith has prosecuted death penalty cases at every level of the  state and federal courts, and won them."  </P> <P> "California needs an attorney general who is an experienced prosecutor," she  concluded. "This is no time for on the job training for a politician who is  only qualified for an entry level position in the attorney general's office."  </P> <P> Feinstein's 1987 letter, based on statistics gathered by the state attorney  general's office, stated that Smith's office registered yearly conviction rates  ranging from 56% to 59% from 1983 to 1985 -- about 20% lower than the statewide  average and more than 25% lower than the average in Los Angeles. The percentage  of felony case filings in San Francisco that resulted in prison sentences was  10.7% in 1985 -- just below the state average of 12%, according to the letter.  </P> <P> In a 1987 response to the letter, Smith called the statistics "misleading,"  noting that the state itself cautioned that counties vary in the accuracy of  statistics they report.  </P> <P> The candidates' caustic flap over qualifications highlighted an unusual day in  which Smith and Lungren taped the only two TV joint appearances they are  scheduled to make in the Los Angeles media market.  </P> <P> Both 30-minute broadcasts -- the second one was KNBC-TV's "Channel 4 News  Conference" -- are to be aired Sunday, the same day the first live televised  debate has been scheduled between Feinstein and her Republican rival, Pete  Wilson. The only other joint TV appearance between Smith and Lungren this fall  is planned in San Francisco a week from Sunday.  </P> <P> During and after the forums Wednesday, Lungren lashed out at Smith for refusing  to appear more often with him in public forums. Referring to Smith's campaign,  he said: "They wanted to do two in one day . . . (and) they want it on TV the  same day as the gubernatorial (debate). What for? The idea would be to try and  hide it."  </P> <P> Smith, who is neck-and-neck in the polls with Lungren, countered that the three  appearances provide "plenty of opportunities to get the issues discussed and  aired."  </P> <P> Smith's stance is in sharp contrast to the one he took last spring. Then, as a  decided underdog in the Democratic primary race against Los Angeles County  Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, Smith agreed to appear four times across the state with  Lungren in moderator-free, Lincoln-Douglas style sessions.  </P> <P> At the time, he criticized Reiner's refusal to participate in head-to-head  debates, saying: "The public has a right to have information on candidates who  are seeking the office of attorney general. It can't be done in 30-second  television shots."  </P> <P> The candidates also clashed Wednesday on abortion rights.  </P> <P> Smith, emphasizing his staunch support of the issue, said he would refuse to  defend the state in court if legislation were approved to restrict Medi-Cal  funding for abortions. He said he would also refuse to defend a parental  consent law limiting teen access to abortions.  </P> <P> Both laws, Smith said, trample on womens' right to privacy guaranteed in the  state Constitution. "(As attorney general) you are the state's lawyer, you're  also the people's lawyer," said Smith. "One of those duties is to protect  constitutional rights."  </P> <P> Lungren, a vehement abortion foe, said he considers both types of restrictions  constitutional and would thus defend them in court.  </P> <P> "The obligation of the attorney general is to represent the interests of the  state unless there is an absolute obvious conflict (with the Constitution),"  Lungren said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUIZ-SHOW SCANDAL  </P> <P> For years I have cussed at Howard Rosenberg's cussedness and smart-alecky  remarks in his TV columns, but "How Did the '50s Quiz-Show Scandal Ensnare a  Tennessee Minister?" (Nov. 5) made me realize Rosenberg can be a great writer.  I think he, or the remarkable Stoney Jackson, summed up television's role in  modern society with: The quiz-show scandals "produced a moral lassitude in  America, and I think we are still feeling the results of the betrayal."  </P> <P> TROXEY KEMPER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

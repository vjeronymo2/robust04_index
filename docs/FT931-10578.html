			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Japan signals tougher stance over trade talks with US JAPAN is ready to take a much firmer stance in trade talks with the US if the Clinton administration insists on an industry-by-industry approach to cutting Tokyo's Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28bn) trade surplus with the US. The tougher line, spelt out by a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry at the weekend, could signal growing friction with the US, where several members of the administration's economic team favour a sectoral approach to opening up the Japanese market. Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of Miti's international trade policy bureau and one of Japan's most senior trade negotiators, said the country wanted a more equal partnership with the US. The two countries had to address the trade issue in the context of wider concerns, such as stimulating world economic growth. 'We completely reject the sort of approach to set some market share for imports into Japan. We do not want to proceed down that road,' he said. Japan wanted a more macro-economic approach to the trade issue. This conflicts with recent remarks by Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of President Bill Clinton's council of economic advisers, in favour of sectoral talks on the surplus. If the US wanted to propose micro-economic talks, Japan would co-operate, but it was not the route preferred by Tokyo and it would be embarked upon with little enthusiasm. Mr Okamatsu also spelt out earlier threats that Japan would retaliate against any unilateral trade sanctions imposed under the so-called Super 301 provisions of the US 1988 trade act. A bill proposing the revival of the provisions was presented to the US Congress last week, as well as a bill to raise sharply the tariff on mini-van imports. Mr Okamatsu said Japan would first seek a ruling from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body, on any Super 301 measures against its exporters. If Gatt ruled in Japan's favour, Japan would consider withdrawing tax and tariff concessions on US imports into the country. Japan's global trade surplus has grown rapidly in the past two years, largely because the slowdown in its economy has cut demand for imports. The global surplus surged by 37.6 per cent last year to Dollars 107.06bn. Mr Okamatsu said Japan was keen to continue with the macro-economic aspects of the long-running US Structural Impediments Initiative - designed to remove structural obstacles to trade - as they looked at the 'total picture'. But it preferred not to pursue the detailed sector by sector talks which have focused on Japanese business practices which US companies allege block imports. Mr Okamatsu said Japan would take further measures to stimulate demand for imports. Japan ready to come out fighting Page 3 US rebuffs EC on Gatt talks timetable Page 3</p>

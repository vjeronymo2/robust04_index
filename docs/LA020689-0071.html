			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mattel Inc., where shrinking operations have left office and parking spaces  vacant, is completing a deal to trade most of its 36-acre headquarters complex  in Hawthorne to a developer in return for office space in a $150-million  mixed-use project on the site. Comstock, Crosser &amp; Hickey Development Co.  of Manhattan Beach is to renovate Mattel's six-story tower and build the toy  company a second office building and parking structure on eight acres of the  site. In exchange, the developer will receive the remaining land, where it will  build office space, a hotel, restaurants, a health club, a large retail store  and perhaps a shopping center.  </P></p>

The circles' proof of the existence of the undeclared split  is that one ministry does not know what another does, and that  some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] ministers are trying to free  themselves from the so-called "Sanaa grip," especially as some  of these ministers have for several weeks been living in Aden  and other southern governorates.    Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has  confirmed the statement attributed to a Foreign Ministry  official to the effect that the ministry had no prior knowledge  of the Omani oil minister's visit to Hadhramaut last Sunday [26  December] -- a visit during which he held talks with Yemeni Oil  Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Husaynun.    The official newspaper AL-THAWRAH published this statement  yesterday, saying that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry had received  a memorandum from the Omani Embassy, seeking assistance to allow  the "private" plane carrying the Omani minister to land at  al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut.    The statement also said that the ministry had known nothing  about the visit, and the same applies to Transport Minister  Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad's travel to Cairo to attend the Arab  transport ministers' conference. Sources have told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT that the statement in question was made in reply to  Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas statements about the  two visits when he "confirmed" the Foreign Ministry's knowledge  of them.    A General People's Congress source has told AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT  that the oil and mineral resources minister and the transport  minister (who represent the YSP in the present coalition  government) did something unusual. The source added: It is  logical and natural for all foreign contacts with fraternal or  friendly states to be conducted via the Foreign Ministry,  because it is the country's main contact channel, as is the case  in all states. [passage omitted]    Sources following the situation have linked what happened to  recent reports about continued attempts by a number of YSP  ministers, especially those who have for several week been  living in Aden, to free themselves from "Sanaa's grip."    The sources said that these ministers' nonparticipation in  regular government meetings since the Aden meeting held in  October -- even though most of these meetings are chaired by  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas -- is evidence of their wish to make  their own independent decisions, be it with regard to internal  policies concerning their ministries or even matters concerning  Yemen's relationship with other states.

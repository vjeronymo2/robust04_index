			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: BHP tops forecasts with 22% advance A SHARP increase in earnings from its steel division helped Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian minerals and steel group, report a 22.1 per cent increase in first-quarter profits after tax, to ADollars 316.1m (USDollars 206.5m). The performance was much better than many analysts had predicted: forecasts had generally ranged between ADollars 250m and ADollars 300m. The shares rose on the news, closing 52 cents higher at ADollars 15.96. Earnings per share for the quarter, to the end of August, rose 17.3 per cent to 23.7 cents. Group sales were up 7.9 per cent at ADollars 4.15bn. BHP attributed the figures to a much stronger performance by its steel division, aided - in turn - by the lower exchange rate with the US dollars. This segment turned in an operating profit of ADollars 135.8m, compared with just ADollars 53m last time. BHP said steel operations had benefited from lower unit costs, attributed to a 14 per cent increase in total raw steel production, its highest quarterly level since 1981. Australian domestic steel 'despatches' were 991,000 tonnes, a 14 per cent increase year-on-year, while export steel despatches from Australia were 629,000 tonnes, up 28 per cent. On the minerals side, BHP saw a small 4 per cent decline in profits, to ADollars 152m, reflecting lower US dollar prices for copper, iron ore, manganese and Australian and Indonesian coal. Profits from the petroleum unit fell 2.6 per cent, to ADollars 133.6m - again due to lower world oil prices. These were only partially offset by higher US gas prices and the weaker exchange rate. Profit from the service companies advanced sharply, from ADollars 5.9m to ADollars 418.7m.</p>

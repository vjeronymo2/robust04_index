			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs slam funding of London's railways THE Commons transport committee yesterday delivered a strongly worded warning that underground and rail services in London would rapidly decline without a big increase in investment, Richard Tomkins writes. In a report on transport investment in the capital, MPs said they had received clear evidence from both Network SouthEast and London Underground that present levels of investment were insufficient to maintain or improve the transport system. They acknowledged that investment in London's transport in the past few years had been higher than in previous decades, but said earlier under-investment had 'heaped up trouble' for the future. The report recommended a government commitment to a sustained and higher level of investment. London's Public Transport Capital Investment Requirements. Transport Committee. HoC Paper 754. HMSO.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, May 16 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav President  Zoran Lilic said on Monday that the visit of Russian Patriarch  Aleksiy II to the people of Serbia and Montenegro was "a great  contribution to the efforts being invested for peace and harmony  in the lands of former Yugoslavia...which has been Yugoslavia's  policy from the start." Lilic was speaking in a meeting with  the visiting pontiff of the Russian church, Patriarch Aleksiy  II, and his host, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church.    Patriarch Aleksiy II said this was a difficult time for both  Russia and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and said it was his  dearest wish -- in his capacity as emissary of the Russian  Orthodox Church -- to witness a reconciliation among the nations  living in the former Yugoslav lands. He explained that his main  task on this visit was to put into practice an initiative, moved  jointly with Patriarch Pavle, to effect a meeting with the  leaders of the Croatian Roman Catholic community and the Bosnian  Islamic community -- Cardinal Franjo Kuharic and Reis ul-Ulema  Mustafa Ceric, respectively -- in an effort to show the people  that conflicts should be dealt with through talks, not war.    President Lilic said that the two churches had every  spiritual and moral right to embark on such a mission, and  described Effendi Ceric's refusal to take part in such a meeting  at this time as proof that the Moslems are still committed to  the war option for settling the dispute in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "Experience teaches us that, whatever compromises the  Bosnian  Serbs might make, the Moslems invariably upset all agreements  and stage-manage incidents at crucial times, in which they kill  innocent civilians," Lilic said. He added that the Moslems'  chief objective was to keep up the campaign of satanising the  entire Serbian nation in the global media, to which the Russian  patriarch added that not even the Russian media had painted an  objective picture of the position of the Serbs.    Patriarch Aleksiy II said the Russian church and people  believed that sanctions against Yugoslavia were unjust and  should be lifted, a position that had been supported by the  State Duma (parliament lower house), which had asked that Russia  lift the blockade of Yugoslavia.    The United Nations imposed draconian sanctions on Yugoslavia  in May 1992, because of the country's alleged involvement in the  civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. President Lilic  said it was clear to the whole world that the sanctions had  missed their target, and that the Bosnian war could be ended  only if all Bosnia's warring nations -- Moslems, Serbs and  Croats -- were treated equally, i.e. if the Serbs, too, were  given the right to self-determination, just as the other  Yugoslav nations.    Brotherly nations, such as the Montenegrins, Serbs and  Russians, must be united on the basic questions of nation and  state, said Lilic and added that these nations "should do their  all to cherish their tradition, their spiritual orthodox  culture, by living in peace and harmony with the other nations  and confessions, as is the case in Yugoslavia where the 50  religious communities practice their religious affairs  unhindered."</p>

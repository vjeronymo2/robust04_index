This statement was made  by an Army source, who, with reference to his position, does not  wish to be named.    He said that, according to the customs and commercial  documents, Tamara should have been exported to Oman. However,  it was not transported to the Arab sultanate but was exported  from the Czech Republic to the United States via a Polish port,  said the source.    The U.S. Department of Defense was interested in Tamara.  According to the experts, the Czech radar system can reveal even  the "invisible" Stealth aircraft, whose development cost the  Pentagon billions of dollars. The U.S. Department of Defense,  therefore, decided to have a look at Tamara.    However, Czechoslovakia would obviously not have sold Tamara  to the Americans because U.S. research would have diminished the  customers' interest in this product.    Jaromir Novotny, director of the Defense Ministry's Foreign  Relations Department, has confirmed that the Americans now own  Tamara.    The Trade and Industry Ministry has confirmed that, in 1991,  a license was granted to Tesla Pardubice, the manufacturer of  Tamara, to export the radar system to Oman. It is apparent from  the documentation available that the Omani Defense Ministry had  pledged to be its end user.    Germany is the only Western country to have this  state-of-the-art radar system in its arsenal; it acquired it  after the dissolution of the GDR National People's Army.  Communist Czechoslovakia had sold Tamara and its predecessor,  Ramona, only to the Soviet Union and Syria.    Josef Opocensky, the director of the Tesla Pardubice state  enterprise, does not know anything about Tamara being exported  to the United States and insists that it was sold to Oman.</p>

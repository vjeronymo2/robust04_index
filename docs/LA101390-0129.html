			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN WANTED ON DRUG CHARGES IS ARRESTED AT MOTEL  </P> <P> A 29-year-old man wanted by North Carolina authorities on drug charges was  arrested Friday as he walked out of a Costa Mesa motel room, FBI officials  said.  </P> <P> Todd Christopher Lynch of Charlotte, N.C., was indicted June 6 by a federal  grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to distribute in excess of 5 kilograms of  cocaine, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said.  </P> <P> He said Lynch apparently learned of the impending grand jury indictment and  fled North Carolina before it was handed down.  </P> <P> Cox declined to say how authorities learned of Lynch's presence in Costa Mesa.  The investigation was conducted by FBI agents and officers with North  Carolina's Charlotte and Mecklenberg County police departments.  </P> <P> Lynch was arrested without incident at an undisclosed motel on Newport  Boulevard, Cox said. However, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun "was within  his reach," he said.  </P></p>

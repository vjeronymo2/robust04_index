			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Greek minister prepares for strike siege MR STEFANOS Manos, Greece's new economy minister, is likely to spend much of this week besieged in his office. Striking workers in the banking and power sectors, as well as bus depot employees, will gather at the ministry building in central Constitution Square from today, protesting against the conservative government's decision to freeze public sector wages this year. Four days of walk-outs are timed to coincide with the debate in parliament on legislation banning pay increases for workers in state-owned corporations. The government says a pay freeze is the only way to ensure that both unions and heads of public sector enterprises obey the call for austerity. Mr Manos, 52, may be the right man to enforce harsh measures. As environment minister, he launched the much-delayed Athens Metro project last year, but then walked out of the cabinet when his plea to stay on and tackle the city's pollution problem was rejected. But he will need all the persistence with which he is credited if Greece is to make up lost ground after a miserable economic performance in 1991, the first year of a three-year stabilisation programme launched in return for an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.56bn) loan from its European Community partners. The government is already in the embarrassing position of being denied the second Ecu600m tranche of the loan which was due last month. It will not be paid unless the government can present the European Commission with a new five-year convergence plan by the summer, enabling Greece to participate in European Monetary Union. The plan would have to outline the government's strategy to reduce inflation and the budget deficit. Little progress was made towards last year's targets for reducing the public sector deficit by trimming the civil service payroll, cracking down on tax evasion and raising extra revenues through privatisation and sales of state land. The government's ambitious plans were later modified or simply postponed because of fears that reform would alienate conservative voters. The government borrowing requirement fell by fewer than three percentage points last year to around 14 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with a target of 10.5 per cent. The budget deficit for last year was almost Dr600bn (Pounds 1.76bn) more than projected. The only bright spot last year was a 60 per cent drop in the current account deficit, which declined to Dollars 1.46bn as imports slowed in response to shrinking consumer demand. The inflation rate is forecast to fall this year from 18.1 per cent to 13.5 per cent. But this target may be hard to achieve even with a wage freeze since more administered prices are being liberalised, while private sector workers are expecting pay increases of at least 15 per cent. To improve revenues this year, Mr Manos is expected to press the Finance Ministry to speed up computerised checking of returns from businesses and self-employed professionals, and to carry out its promise to bring 60,000 farmers into the tax net this year. But Mr Manos's biggest problem will be to convince the cabinet that his fellow EC finance ministers will be reluctant to release any more of the loan until a long overdue law to reform the pension system takes effect. Draft legislation, which would reduce welfare spending, has been ready for several months, but the government is delaying its introduction in Parliament for fear of triggering a prolonged confrontation with the socialist opposition.</p>

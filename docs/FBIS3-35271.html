Although the security expert declined to elaborate on  the extent of this penetration, he noted that it is  semi-comprehensive and is bound to obstruct the terrorists'  movements and curb their operations.    The security expert added that the penetration has been  expanded to cover most of the terrorist organizations, thus  enabling the security services to have an overall picture of  these organizations' leaders, members, internal, and external  affiliations, centers, and sources of arms and funds.    The security expert, who preferred to remain anonymous,  pointed out that the penetration has also enabled the security  forces to carry out successful operations that have led to the  fall of several terrorist leaders and to strike at the  perpetrators of some operations before they were carried out.    The security expert said that this successful development  does not mean the end of the terrorists. He cautioned that some  absconding members might carry out serious terrorist operations.    The security expert made these statements before the  incident  in al-Sayyidah Zaynab, on 14 February, during which the  following three terrorists were killed: Tharwat Hajjaj, Mustafa  Mahmud 'Ali Musa, and 'Atif Khalil 'Id.    Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry has nearly completed a new  procedure that would protect prosecution witnesses in terrorist  cases and encourage citizens to give any information dealing  with terrorist activities to facilitate arrests.    The proposed procedure imposes complete secrecy on persons  who give information and intensifies their protection in the  event that they become prosecution witnesses. [passage omitted]    A security source said that after the assassination of  Sayyid  Ahmad Yahya, the prosecution witness in the case of the  assassination attempt against Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, a  state of fear engulfed prosecution witnesses in other terrorist  cases. Some of these witnesses wanted to withdraw their  statements. Other witnesses even failed to show up before the  interrogation authorities. The interior minister then issued  instructions to study the entire situation. [passage omitted]</p>

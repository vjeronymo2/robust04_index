			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  3 HELD IN AMBUSH SLAYING OF BOY, 16  </P> <P> Three Harbor City gang members have been arrested 11 months after police say  they ambushed and killed a non-gang member, a 16-year-old Wilmington boy who  was walking home from a Lenten youth group at his local church.  </P> <P> Rafael Pereda, a high school track medalist and weightlifter, was shot several  times as he walked home from church last March 22. The suspects were "parked  there, waiting, not for anybody in particular," Los Angeles Police Detective  Larry Kallestad said. The motive was "pure gang territorial reasons," the  detective said. Although Pereda had never belonged to a gang, he "was the right  age to be a gang member and the suspects chose him because he fit that profile  and he was in a rival gang neighborhood."  </P> <P> Kallestad said two of the suspects -- Kevin Stave, 18, of Harbor City, and  Hector Acuna Garcia, 17 -- were already in custody on other charges. Stave  faces an unrelated narcotics charge and Garcia, although a juvenile, is being  tried as an adult along with two other gang members in a double drive-by  killing in Wilmington last August, Kallestad said.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old youth, allegedly the driver of the murder car, was also arrested.  </P></p>

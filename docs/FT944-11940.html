			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: ASX wins legal battle over new options The Australian Stock Exchange yesterday won a significant victory in its battle with the Sydney Futures Exchange over who should run the market for individual share futures. A Federal Court judge ruled that the ASX could go ahead with the launch of low exercise price options (LEPOs). These are designed as very deep 'in the money' call options, whose exercise price could be as little as 1 cent. The options' structure means that they should trade directly in line with the underlying physical stock, but - because of the option market's margin system - the full price only becomes payable on expiry. The ASX had proposed launching LEPOs last May, a response to the SFE's decision to introduce futures contracts on three individual shares - BHP, News Corporation and National Australia Bank. The SFE was the first to offer individual share futures, and it has subsequently added four contracts (for MIM, Western Mining, Westpac, and BTR Nylex). Hoping to curtail the ASX's rival ambitions, the SFE mounted a legal challenge to LEPOs, arguing that these were in effect futures contracts and hence could not be traded on the ASX. Under Australian corporation law, there is a strict divide between the two exchanges' potential territories: SFE is restricted to futures trading, while the ASX can only trade securities. The SFE's argument centred on the fact that an investor was actually obliged to exercise the options, through 'economic imperative', and this obligation made the LEPOs 'eligible commodity agreements' - bringing them within the definition of futures contracts. In his court ruling yesterday, Mr Justice Sackville said that it was undeniable that the taker of the option had a powerful incentive to exercise the option or close it out. But, he added, 'he or she is not bound to do so, in the sense of owing a duty to the writer of the option or anyone else'. Accordingly, he dismissed the SFE's claim, and ordered it to pay the ASX's costs. The SFE, acknowledging that it was disappointed, said it was taking legal advice over whether to appeal.</p>

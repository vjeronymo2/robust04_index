			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The lure of the drug trade - A year ago Dr Jan Steiner became her own boss. She tells Clive Fewins the joys of being a one-woman company FROM HER early days as a medical student in Sydney Jan Steiner was hooked on drugs. The obsession was not a clinical condition but professional. Steiner decided early on that she wanted to work in research rather than follow her father into general practice. After Steiner qualified in 1969 she took the academic route, working as a clinical pharmacologist in London, Kansas City and Oxford. 'I never thought I would end up running my own business in the medical field,' said Dr Steiner. 'But I suppose from the time in 1981 when I was offered a job at the G D Searle laboratories in High Wycombe I began to hatch the idea of doing my own thing one day.' In 1985. when she was made redundant when Searle closed the labs and working in senior management jobs with two other large pharmaceutical companies, Dr Steiner is indeed her own boss. Twelve months ago, at 46, she started Oxford Therapeutics Consulting Ltd. It is a one-woman show, and that is the way she intends to keep it. 'If I am successful I do not necessarily see the expansion route as employing other people,' Dr Steiner said. 'I have a number of collaborators whose expertise I can call upon. Their specialities lie in areas of expertise different from my own, from scientific, to patenting, to venture capital and regulatory matters.' 'Where I am based at The Oxford Science park on the outskirts of the city there is an excellent back-up service that includes typing, photocopying and telephone answering, so really I plan to stay on my own. I am my own managing director - managing to direct me.' At times the direction wiggles a bit, but the essential path is clear. Steiner's company is a consultancy that helps start-up companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields to establish themselves. It does this by helping them to assess the market fully and thoroughly, before investing what might be several million pounds in research at the cutting edge of medical science. Steiner knows of only a handful of start-up companies of this sort in the UK but approaching 400 in the US, so her interests cross the Atlantic. On a recent trip to the US she visited 15 companies in nine days, and came back with potential orders worth Dollars 15,000. However, this work was geared less to assessing markets than smoothing the passage across the Atlantic of the products of the US companies, most of which are larger and a few years older than their British start-up counterparts. Not very patriotic one might think. But Steiner, who still carries an Australian passport, points out that in such an embryo field of applied medical science there is room in the market for everyone. 'From a trip to the States like my recent one I am able to show my British clients how the American companies have managed to grow and to market their products,' Steiner said. 'By studying closely what is happening over there I am in a good position to help British companies to fly the flag and to avoid costly mistakes. In this business the stakes are so high and the costs so astronomical that there is no leeway if you make a mess of it. It is incredibly important to get it right first time.' The problem of successful biochemical start-up has to be cracked in the universities, Steiner thinks. 'A lot of the work going on in British universities is so clever that it is a desperate shame not to develop and commercialise it,' she said. 'Yet so often all the odds seem to be stacked against the academics who are trying to develop their discoveries. If you are an academic in America and you have a classy discovery you set up a company to develop it. It's as simple as that. All the back-up and assistance you need is usually in place. 'But here in Britain it's very different. For a variety of reasons people here are not so motivated to grow rich. But also here academics are not so well-served by their universities. Far too often they just publish their findings and leave it at that. Alternatively they might licence their findings to a major producer - all too often an American company. Far too much intellectual property still goes out of the country.' But political and economic pressures, have helped create a new alertness in some of Britain's biggest universities, says to Steiner. 'They are also realising that as a lot of these discoveries and inventions are funded by Joe Public in the first place, the public purse can rightly expect to see some return on its capital,' she said. Many British universities now have technology transfer offices and are carrying out technology audits, scanning through scientific advances to assess which might be worth large-scale commercial development. Steiner is working with some of these departments in the biochemical field. She is also helping to steer some of them along the tricky path to seedcorn capital or wealthy 'business angels' who are happy to invest in a field which is forbiddingly hard to understand and frighteningly long-term in the eyes of the average investor. After 12 months of hard work Steiner is seeing little so far in the way of profits. 'I put Pounds 30,000 of my own money into OTC, and my business plan indicates that I will need to spend Pounds 20,000 including start-up costs, to run the business for the first year,' she said. 'As far as I can tell those figures are about right, and make ample allowance for my visit to the States, which cost Pounds 2,500. 'As I expect to turn over Pounds 20,000 in the first year I therefore expect to break even. 'I am quite prepared to put more of my savings into the business in the second year should it prove necessary. But the indications are that, even paying my collaborators for the expertise I buy in, I should be sowing a profit by this time next year. 'I am optimistic. And even on my less optimistic days I am enjoying working for myself so much that optimism pushes me along. 'On top of that at the end of it all I am hopefully doing something that can do people a bit of good and advance people's quality of life.'

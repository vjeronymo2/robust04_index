			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The PT [Workers Party] platform, released on 14  March, has elicited a negative reaction from the Church  throughout our country. Fathers and bishops, even some of those  identified as belonging to the progressive wing, with ties to  the PT, denounced the platform's points involving abortion,  contraception, and homosexual relations.    Juazeiro da Bahia Bishop Jose Rodrigues, a representative of  the progressive wing that openly supported PT candidate Luiz  Inacio Lula da Silva during past presidential elections,  condemned the platform. He believes the two issues will cause a  great "deterioration" in Lula's candidacy. The bishop noted:  "The PT wanted to be responsive to these minority groups, but  ended up alienating the majority." He added: "The people, in  general, do not approve of these proposals."    The PT is not actually proposing the regularization of  abortion or of marriage between homosexuals. The platform  merely proposes "the establishment of regulations for the  performance of abortion under safe conditions, through the  public services." Concerning unions between homosexuals, the PT  wants "proposals for legal changes guaranteeing the rights of  married homosexual couples concerning civil marriage contracts,  social security, partition of goods, and inheritance."

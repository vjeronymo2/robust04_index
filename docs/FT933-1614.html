			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Ex-Swans workers win Pounds 1.5m payout UNIONS representing more than 700 workers made redundant at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, since it went into receivership in May have won compensation for their members totalling about Pounds 1.5m, Chris Tighe writes. An industrial tribunal judgment, announced yesterday, ruled that Price Waterhouse, the receivers, breached section 188 of the 1992 Trades Union Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act by failing to consult on the redundancies. The six shipyard unions involved said the ruling established the principle that workers' rights could not be waived in receivership. The payments will be up to a maximum of about Pounds 2,600 per person. The unions will now seek another 90-day protected period for the 80 Swans workers who are to be made redundant next week. Price Waterhouse said last night that criticisms made in the judgment failed to appreciate the commercial realities of the situation.</p>

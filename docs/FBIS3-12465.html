			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has reaffirmed the League's stance on  how to properly solve the Libyan-Western dispute over the  Lockerbie issue through negotiations, mediation, and judicial  settlement in line with Clause 33 of the UN Charter's Chapter 6.    In an exclusive statement to MENA, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  explained the circumstances of the crisis, noting that in its  legal aspect, several countries--the United States, Britain, and  France--are asking another country, Libya, to hand over two of  its citizens for trial by the authorities of those countries on  charges attributed to them.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that in this case the dispute is over  a well-known phenomenon in international law called "the  extradition of criminals". He explained that international law  places certain controls on extradition, including the  stipulation that handing over criminals is a sovereign matter  which cannot be imposed on any country. Also, he pointed out,  there must be a treaty or agreement among the concerned  countries according to which a country is committed to handing  over its citizens to the country requesting the extradition.    'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the most recent international  trend permits a country to refuse to extradite its nationals.  He pointed out that the eighth UN conference on the prevention  of crime and the treatment of criminals which was held in Havana  in August 1991 approved a model draft agreement for the  extradition of criminals, the fourth article of which stated  that a country can refuse to extradite an individual who is one  of its citizens.    He added that although the Arab League fully condemns the  blowing up of the plane in question and the death of innocent  victims, yet it believes that, from a purely legal perspective,  the United States, Britain, and France have transferred the  issue from the legal and judicial sphere to the political  sphere, something that is contrary to the original character of  the case.    He explained that the U.S. and British judicial systems  stipulate that in order to extradite criminals there should be  an extradition treaty between the country requesting the  extradition and the country which is asked to hand over the  wanted individuals. Also, these judicial systems require that a  court verdict be issued permitting an act of extradition. He  further explained that according to the system applied in  France, the Libyan Government can legally hand over the wanted  individuals but on condition of reciprocal treatment.    'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that since there is no extradition  treaty between Libya and the three concerned countries, it is  difficult to force the Libyan Jamahiriyah to comply.    He noted that Libya has condemned international terrorism  and  expressed willingness to cooperate in the trial of the suspects  in a neutral country. Consequently, he said, it might be  appropriate for those three countries to show responsiveness to  this Libyan wish and to the good offices that several other  parties are making to reach a solution that will maintain Libyan  national sovereignty and be in agreement with Article 33 of the  UN Charter's which calls for solving disputes among countries by  peaceful dialogue.    'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary general for  political affairs, announced that the League will continue its  efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis in a manner that will  preserve Libya's dignity and sovereignty.    He added that the Western countries have exploited the UN  Security Council for the purpose of issuing resolutions against  Libya without fear from any party whatsoever. He said he  believes these resolutions are contrary to the UN Charter and  represent a dangerous precedent that will undermine the world's  confidence in the United Nations.    Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid recently met with Ibrahim  al-Bishari, Libya's permanent representative at the Arab League,  and reviewed with him the developments of the crisis, the Arab  League's role in it, and the possibility of holding a meeting of  the Arab seven-member committee on the sidelines of the next  Arab League meeting in March.</p>

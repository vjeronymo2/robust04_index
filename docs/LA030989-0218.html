			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 'KILL THE UMP, GO TO JAIL' BILL BACKED  </P> <P> With little debate, the Tennessee House voted 95 to 0 today for a bill to  establish a jail term of up to six months for assaulting a referee or umpire at  a sports event. The bill is designed to allow schools to prosecute unruly fans  if the official is not available to file charges. The measure is sponsored by  Rep. Tommy Head (D-Clarksville). His sister, Pat Head Summitt, is coach of the  Lady Vols basketball team at the University of Tennessee.  </P></p>

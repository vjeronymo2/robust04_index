			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: European integration back on the agenda  -Capital &amp; Credit As European Union finance ministers held cosy fireside chats on economic and monetary union near Lake Con-stance last weekend, the markets were fervently hoping that they had not forgotten the lessons they had learnt over the past few years. With many countries in the EU now enjoying economic recovery, it was inevitable that the push for European integration would once again become an important issue on the political agenda. But despite Emu's low profile during the past two years, the subject remains a contentious one, as last week's speech Mr John Major, by the UK prime minister, condemning the notion of a two-speed Europe, so clearly illustrated. As far as European bond investors are concerned, their main worry is that French and German politicians will resume their quest for Emu and a single currency without adequate consideration of the economic fundamentals. 'Economic union and political union have to move together. Whenever the politicians moved too fast there was turbulence in the exchange rate mechanism and in the bond markets,' said Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International. 'If the markets do not believe that Emu is sustainable then it will break down.' Recent proposals by Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party calling for the creation of a 'hard core' of five nations - France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - have set alarm bells ringing. Analysts fear markets could be in for renewed volatility if the issue of a two-speed Europe takes centre stage. Mr Glenn Davies, economist at Credit Lyonnais in London, said: 'I have my doubts about whether this factor is having much impact yet, but any country that looked like it was going to be left out (of the inner core) would suffer.' Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets, agreed. 'If we do get an inner core, then a higher risk premium will be attached to Italy, Spain and some of the Scandinavian countries which are likely to be left out,' he said. If some countries were to go forward without the others it would inevitably lead to yield spreads widening between the high-deficit countries and the inner core. Although the UK has ruled itself out of Emu for now, because of sterling's suspension from the ERM, its progress on inflation and reducing its budget deficit would allow it to qualify for an inner core, analysts say. As a result, some believe UK bond yields would not suffer if the UK decided to remain outside Emu, either due to a lack of domestic political support or because of the government's desire to hold on to a floating exchange rate. 'If the UK did not join in, this would not imply that gilt yields would have to go as high as Italy's or Spain's,' said Mr David Miles, senior UK economist at Merrill Lynch. He noted that by 1996, the UK's budget deficit would be well below 3 per cent of gross domestic product, one of the guidelines set down as a qualification for entry into Emu. Yields on Danish bonds could also be protected against any widening. Although Denmark has an opt-out from the third phase of Emu, it has said it would meet the Maastricht convergence criteria by 1997, even if it did not join the hard core. As a result, Danish bonds would continue to be judged on fundamentals, said Mr John Hall, European economist at Swiss Bank Corporation. By contrast, Belgium's high budget deficit has cast doubts over its eligibility to be part of an inner core. IBJ estimates its budget deficit is likely to run at 5.8 per cent of GDP this year. However, the new government has presented further savings. The most obvious casualties would be the high-yielding bond markets of Italy and Spain, which would suffer if investors believed their progress towards economic convergence were insufficient. 'The question for Italy is fiscal policy. We feel Spain is doing well and will continue to do well. But I don't think the risk-reward is attractive in Italy,' said Mr Hall. Meanwhile, some investors have been quick to look for opportunities created by Emu's renewed publicity. Mr Hall said Ecu-denominated bonds would benefit from any form of Emu, since the Ecu's status as the EU's single currency would increase in importance. 'With Ecu bonds trading at 105 basis points over Germany and 50 over France, that has to be good news for Ecu bondholders,' he said. Before the CDU's proposals for an inner core were announced, the yield on the 10-year Ecu bond was 16 basis points over its theoretical counterpart, that had narrowed slightly to 14 basis points towards the end of last week. After a difficult year so far, investors are hardly relishing the thought of yet another factor which could destabilise bond markets. But with Germany and France likely to be banging the drum ever louder for a two-speed Europe, the issue is unlikely to go away.</p>

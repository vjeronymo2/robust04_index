			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> THIRD MILD QUAKE SINCE FRIDAY JIGGLES COUNTY  </P> <P> A mild earthquake Monday was more of an annoyance than anything else to  northern Orange County residents awakened by the 5:44 a.m. temblor.  </P> <P> No damage or injuries were reported in Orange or Los Angeles counties.  </P> <P> Seismologists at Caltech said the shaker registered a 2.9 and was centered  beneath the Hacienda Heights area in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The quake followed two temblors that shook the Southland over the weekend. A  quake measuring 3.7 struck 1 mile northwest of Brea late Saturday night. On  Friday, seismologists reported a magnitude-3.4 quake centered 27 miles offshore  from Oceanside in northern San Diego County.  </P> <P> "I felt it," La Habra Police Capt. John Rees said about Monday's quake. "But it  wasn't as big as the night before. This one really smacked us. Normally, you  hear a rumble that precedes the quake. This time I didn't hear anything."  </P> <P> Rees said operators at the La Habra station received a few calls about the  temblor but no reports of damage or injury to residents.  </P> <P> Police and public safety officials in nearby Brea and Placentia also reported  no damage.  </P> <P> Monday's temblor was unrelated to the twin quakes in October, 1987, which  caused much damage in nearby Whittier.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Japanese curb stays THE UK will continue to restrict imports of cars from Japan at least until the end of 1994. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, said that in the light of the 'present economic circumstances' it would remain a restricted market for at least a further two years. Earlier this year the government caused consternation in the industry when it announced it was examining the possibility of ending all restrictions on imports of Japanese new cars from the end of this year. A voluntary export restraint - or 'gentleman's agreement' - has existed in the UK since 1975, limiting Japanese imports to no more than 11 per cent of the market for new cars. This restraint must be withdrawn from the end of this year with the start of the single market in Europe. Last year the European Commission reached an agreement with the Japanese government on continuing limits on direct EC imports of cars from Japan until the end of 1999. The agreement assumes that the UK, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain remain restricted markets until the end of the decade, and that Japan observes voluntary restraint on overall vehicle exports to the EC during this period.</p>

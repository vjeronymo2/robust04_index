			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is considering applying this approach to light vehicles by proposing both a requirement mandating the installation of ABSs on light vehicles and road tests that serve as a check on the performance of the ABS. The agency requests comments about the possible benefits and shortcomings of using this approach for light vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In developing the proposed definition for ``ABS'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking, NHTSA referred to the definitions of ``ABS'' adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Economic Commission for Europe's (ECE) Regulation 13, Annex 13 (1988). Based on these definitions and other considerations, the agency proposed the following definition of ``antilock brake system'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> a portion of a service brake system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip during braking by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular rotation to one or more devices which interpret those signals and generate responsive controlling output signals; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) transmitting those controlling signals to one or more devices which adjust brake actuating forces in response to those signals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this definition describing fundamental and necessary performance aspects that any braking system must have to be considered an ABS, the agency believes that any ABS would be permitted, provided that it is a ``closed loop'' system that ensures feedback between what is actually happening at the tire-road surface interface and what the device is doing to respond to impending wheel lockup. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency requests comments about whether to apply to light vehicles the approach proposed to improve the lateral stability and control of heavy vehicles. Is it necessary and appropriate to supplement the combination of a definition of ``ABS'' and an equipment requirement with one or more ``check'' tests to ensure the lateral stability and control of light vehicles? Is the definition of ``ABS,'' as proposed in the heavy vehicle NPRM, appropriate for light vehicles? What are the advantages or disadvantages of a requirement expressly mandating an ABS instead of taking the more indirect approach of adopting dynamic tests? Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion that the proposed definition for heavy vehicle ``ABS'' is sufficiently broad to allow a variety of ABSs, the agency welcomes comment about the use of this definition for light vehicles. Would it ensure suitable stopping distances and cover all appropriate brake designs, while not unnecessarily prohibiting brake systems that effectively prevent wheel lockup in a sufficiently wide variety of circumstances? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Test Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. In the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, NHTSA proposed that such vehicles would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve test, but decided not to propose additional tests such as a split mu test or a lane change test. The agency believed that such additional tests would be impracticable for heavy vehicles given the criteria set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PACCAR.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notwithstanding the agency's tentative decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking to propose only a braking-in-a-curve test, the agency is seeking comment on whether to require that light vehicles be capable of stopping without loss-of-control in the following test maneuvers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) While turning on a low mu surface; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) While stopping on a straight line split mu surface; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) While in transition from a high mu surface to a low mu surface; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) While in transition from a low mu surface to a high mu surface. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

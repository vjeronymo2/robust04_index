			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Management: Flying in the face of tradition - Companies have intensified the search for cheaper executive travel. Danny Green outlines a new option Your staff want to fly business or first class. They insist they need the extra space to work so that they can arrive fresh for that vital business meeting. What is more, they want to take every trip on the same airline to earn frequent flyer points. Yet your company's margins are tight and there is a board edict to save money. How can you keep your executives motivated, but retain a grip on the cost of business air travel? The problem is not new, but now the hunt for better travel management has spawned an approach which is based on fees rather than on commissions. The appearance of this approach has divided the ranks of the corporate travel managers into the bold and the sceptical. The traditional pattern has been for companies to engage travel agents to buy airline tickets, reserve hotel rooms and rent cars. The agents recoup the cost of running their businesses through commissions from airlines, hotels and car rental agencies. The standard rate for airlines, for example, is 9 per cent of the cost of a ticket. The disadvantage with this approach is that travel agents have little incentive to search for cut-price tickets. Saving money for clients cuts their commission. Companies and travel agents have tried to overcome this by arranging split commissions, or by rebates for bulk purchases of tickets. Typically, the client company might get back one third of the commission from the agent, or 10 per cent of the ticket price from the airline, as a reward for putting a lot of its business through one agent or airline. These changes, however, do not adequately encourage agents to save their clients money, says John Cash, manager purchasing, fleet/travel, for Rank Xerox. He has turned instead to an alternative based on management fees. The principle is that the client pays the agent a fixed fee, with a bonus based on savings above a pre-set target. The commission is split between the two parties by arrangement. Rank Xerox is using Thomas Cook, although similar fee-based deals can be arranged with other large agencies including American Express, Hogg Robinson and Wagons-lits. Thomas Cook claims that savings of up to 40 per cent on tickets are possible and practices 'open book' accounting in which the client sees where the agency earns its money. Cash is pleased by the results so far. 'A management fee brings more focus and dedicated support from the agent to incentivise them to save you money.' Agents are keen to push the idea further. Colin Rainbow, commercial director of Wagons-lits, explains that agencies are suffering as business travellers seek cheaper tickets. 'The travel agent still has to have the same level of service but the (commission-based) margin is being very much diminished. The management fee approach allows open book accounting: the client knows he's getting everything he can get.' The system is not without its reasoned opponents. The airlines, which are mostly losing money, do not like it. By persuading companies to spend less on air travel, management fees reduce the size of the whole cake, says Stephen Wolf, head of United Airlines, the second biggest US carrier. Some clients do not like it either. Dennis Campbell, travel and catering manager at Esso Petroleum, says: 'Management fees can be inflexible. You could spend more time arguing with your agent on who's doing what work.' 'You end up discussing terms with the travel agent for extra work.' Campbell often deals with airlines directly using the travel agent for market intelligence and advice. 'The name of the game nowadays is management information, building up patterns of destinations,' he says. He can use information, for example, that the London-Houston flight is emptier on Tuesdays and Thursdays than on other days: 'We are working with airlines on pushing business to slack days.' In spite of this kind of resistance to replacing commissions with fees, the notion is now spreading beyond the UK to the rest of Europe. Wagons-lits already has a handful of fee-based clients on the continent, especially in France. The trend may have been given extra momentum by airline industry deregulation, which began in earnest in Europe on January 1, 1993. That is already increasing the number of discount fares on offer: as a result, finding the cheapest deal is becoming more complex than ever.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jutta Roitsch report: "FDP Warns of `Descent to Third </F> Class'"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 29 May -- "Germany is in danger of  sleeping through its future," said FDP [Free Democratic Party]  Chairman Klaus Kinkel on Saturday [28 May] at the opening of his  party's Research and Technological Congress in Frankfurt. "We  are faced with a descent to third class in the industrial fields  of communications, biological science, and environmental  science, with which we are going to have to earn our keep in the  future," he said.    Backed by Education Minister Karl-Hans Laermann and  Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Kinkel promised that the FDP would  gear itself to the "elites," for which he earned a round of  applause from the 200 or so representatives of science and  industry attending the opening. Kinkel said that the term  "elites" still possesses a negative meaning in Germany. "He who  offers excellent services in his work, and thus lays the basis  for future prosperity, has no political lobby. Once again we  need a standard of education that produces elites, and a society  that respects these elites," he said.    At this congress, not a single FDP politician referred to  the  "civic right to education" that liberal politicians like Ralf  Dahrendorf and Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher had once referred to.  According to Kinkel, the task of a liberal party is to  "courageously and firmly alter the philosophy of ownership."    "We need a modernization of the way of thinking,  particularly  among our elites," said Kinkel. This view was seconded by Tyll  Necker, chairman of the Association of German Industry; Andre  Leysen, chairman of the executive board of the Belgian Agfa; and  Hans-Joachim Langmann, chairman of Merck. All three called for  a "spiritual flexibility" (Leysen) and an "ability to adapt"  (Langmann) in order to combat lethargy. One cannot attain first  place without a readiness to take risks and introduce changes,  it was said.    Hartmut Michel of the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in  Frankfurt said that the mistrust of new technology must be  combated at kindergarten stage by means of interesting picture  books on the subject of science.    The political conclusions stemming from this were: "Even  more competition and a deregulation of the telecommunications  sphere" and tax concessions for scientific research (Kinkel and  Necker), a "technological council," to increase the  receptiveness of new technologies (Necker), and a curb on  parental desires and a greater influence of teachers on  children's upbringing (Lermann), in order to make access to high  schools and colleges more tough.</p>

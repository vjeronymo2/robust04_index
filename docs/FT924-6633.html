			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Fashion executive sues on dismissal MRS Jenifer Rosenberg, founder of J &amp; J Fashions, which was acquired earlier this year by Claremont Garments, has started a High Court action, alleging constructive dismissal. Until November 13 Mrs Rosenberg was an executive director of Claremont with day-to-day responsibility for the product and product development divisions of the group. She was given notice of dismissal on October 19, less than five months after Claremont acquired J &amp; J Fashions. Claremont denies constructive dismissal. Mrs Rosenberg was the winner in 1986 of the Veuve Clicquot/Institute of Directors Businesswoman of the Year award.</p>

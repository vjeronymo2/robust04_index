			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Business failures fall 14% Business failures fell 14 per cent in England and Wales in the first quarter of the year, according to figures released yesterday by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group. However, Dun &amp; Bradstreet warned that companies were facing as many cashflow difficulties as a year ago, hindering a further reduction in failures. It found in a separate survey that 80 per cent of companies' cashflow problems were worse or no better. A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce reported that 94 per cent of small companies reported negative effects as a result of late payment, and 85 per cent backed the introduction of statutory interest on overdue bills. The Institute of Credit Management, however, warned that the proposed introduction of a statutory right to interest on late bills could cripple small businesses. Dun and Bradstreet found that there were 10,941 business failures in the three months to April, compared with 12,648 in the first quarter of last year. The number of company liquidations in the same period fell 17 per cent to 4,295, while the number of business bankruptcies fell 11 per cent to 6,646.</p>

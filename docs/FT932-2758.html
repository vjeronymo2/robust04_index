			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Goldman fingered One should not be misled by the size of the fine, trivial though Pounds 160,000 is for an institution as large as Goldman Sachs. In the context of its limited powers of investigation, the Securities and Futures Authority has come up with some damaging indictments of Goldman's dealings with the Robert Maxwell empire. No investment bank with global pretensions can relish the revelation that, for seven business days in 1991, it had a shortfall of up to Pounds 20m in its regulatory capital. No such bank can happily admit that, on three separate occasions, it failed to consider the full implications of late delivery - itself the rarest of events - of securities it had bought from clients connected with Mr Maxwell. Publication of such findings is an important part of the sanction process. The revelation that Goldman's procedures and supervision were inadequate deals a blow to its reputation more damaging than any fine. That is about all one could have expected from an inquiry confined to the remit of examining Goldman's compliance with SFA rules. But the SFA chooses its words carefully. It says it 'did not conclude' that Goldman or any of its personnel participated or were aware of any illicit conduct. That seems to leave the door open to further investigation in the light of other enquiries still in train. The statement that Goldman was not aware of illicit dealings by Mr Maxwell or his associates is anyway a rather limp exoneration. Given Mr Maxwell's dwindling reputation at the time, perhaps it should have tried harder to make itself aware. The ease with which it flouted SFA rules suggests a culture that was too laisser-faire.</p>

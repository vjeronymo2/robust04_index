			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: A brazen pot among earthen vessels - Vernon Bogdanor argues that the great Lord Curzon was a bully who was rightfully denied the premiereship CURZON by David Gilmour John Murray Pounds 25, 601 pages Enoch Powell once declared that the lives of all politicians, unless cut short in mid-career, end in failure. No 20th century life illustrates this dictum better than that of George Nathaniel, 1st Marquess of Curzon. Viceroy of India in 1898 before he was 40, Curzon left an indelible mark on that sub-continent. 'You will never send to India', declared John Morley, 'and you have never sent to India, a viceroy his superior'. After a period in the wilderness, Curzon returned to office in 1915, to became foreign secretary from 1919 to 1924, under Lloyd George, Bonar Law and Baldwin. His achievements in the foreign office were, if anything, even greater than in India. It was Curzon who achieved a peace treaty with the Turks at Lausanne in 1923, Curzon who helped ease France out of the Ruhr in 1923, Curzon who began the revision of reparations that culminated in the Dawes Plan, Curzon who resolved the Corfu crisis without either alienating Mussolini or weakening the League of Nations. He remains among the greatest of 20th century foreign secretaries. And yet, it all turned to ashes. As number two to the ailing Bonar Law, Curzon had every expectation of the premiership. He was, John Simon had declared, 'the brazen pot' among 'the earthen vessels' of the Tories. Yet, within sight of the finishing post, the prize was snatched from him by someone he regarded as 'a person of the utmost insignificance', Stanley Baldwin. The story is well known how, lacking such modern appurtenances as a telephone, Curzon waited in his house at Montacute until the village post office received a telegram from the King's private secretary asking if Curzon would receive him in London. Returning to Carlton House Terrace, he was told that the King had already appointed Baldwin since, with the Labour opposition unrepresented in the Lords, it was essential that the prime minister sit in the Commons. 'Such was the manner in which it was intimated to me that the cup of honourable ambition had been dashed from my lips and that I could never aspire to fill the highest office in the service of the Crown'. The dramatic career of this Imperial proconsul has already inspired a number of biographies. The official biography, published in 1928, three years after Curzon's death, was written by the Earl of Ronaldshay, a future Secretary of State for India under Baldwin and Chamberlain. In 1934, Harold Nicolson published a study of his diplomacy, Curzon: The Last Phase. In 1960, Leonard Mosley was employed by Beaverbrook to do a hatchet job, while in 1969 two further biographies appeared, a life by Kenneth Rose and two volumes by David Dilks, Curzon in India, on the viceroyalty. Given this plethora of biographical material, it is not clear why a further volume should be needed. Although Curzon is David Gilmour's first book on British history, he proves himself a master of his subject. He is a formidable researcher, having consulted no less than 77 collections of private papers. His judgment is generally sound and his style clear. There are one or two nuggets of fresh material, especially on the 1916 ministerial crisis which made Lloyd George prime minister and the Chanak crisis of 1922 which destroyed him. Yet he does not really have enough that is new to say to justify a 600 page book. Perhaps what Curzon really needs is not another biography but a short interpretative essay of the kind that Roy Jenkins does so well. Gilmour's book, like most biographies, presents the case for the defence, claiming that Curzon was a more sensitive person and more riddled with self-doubt than he appeared. He argues that many of the more outrageous utterances attributed to Curzon were either apocryphal or self-mocking. Did he ever say, upon seeing soldiers bathing, 'Dear me, I had no conception the lower classes had such white skins'? Did he really hail a bus and direct it to Downing Street, feigning surprise when it did not go there? In the last resort, for all his achievements, it cannot be denied that there was something utterly preposterous about the ex-Viceroy. In public, he appeared pompous, dictatorial and conceited. A bully to his inferiors, he cringed before Lloyd George and failed to defend the prerogatives of the foreign office against the prime minister's 'Garden Suburb'. The man who had declared in 1902 that an increase in soldiers' pay would merely 'find its early correlative in increased syphilis and intoxication', would hardly have proved a suitable premier during the labour unrest of the 1920s. In rejecting him for the premiership in 1923, George V made his own not insignificant contribution to foiling the British revolution. Vernon Bogdanor is Reader in Government, Oxford.</p>

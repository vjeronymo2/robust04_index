The draft budget for next year will, however,  "certainly no be adopted by parliament before the Bundestag  elections (16 October)," government spokesman Dieter Vogel  announced after the Cabinet meeting.    However, the Federal Government will stick to the usual  dates  and pass the draft budget in the Cabinet at the end of June.  The basis are the overall economic basic data, which have to be  presented this April, and the next tax estimate in May.    Vogel added: "The Cabinet is aware of the fact that extreme  thrift in budget policy and in the demands of the individual  ministries is necessary also for 1995." The chancellor did "not  leave any doubt" as to this necessity. The Cabinet members  "will take this into account when working out their plans for  1995," Vogel said.</p>

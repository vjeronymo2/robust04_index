			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / BSkyB fails to take up home-shopping TV option British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television consortium, has decided not to exercise its option to keep a 50 per cent stake in QVC, the home-shopping channel which is part of the Sky multi-channel subscription package. The surprising decision has been taken even though the channel appears to be doing well and is heading for revenues of at least Pounds 40m in its first year on air. The channel was set up as a joint venture between QVC, its highly successful parent in the US, and BSkyB, the satellite group in which Pearson - owner of the Financial Times - has a significant stake. To retain its 50 per cent stake, BSkyB was required to inject substantial amounts of further cash around now but has decided not to do so. As a result, the BSkyB stake in the home-shopping venture will fall to 20 per cent on August 1. One BSkyB executive suggested that the stake may have been of more value to QVC than to the satellite company because a lot of BSkyB's energies are now being directed to the planned launch next year of pay-per-view for films and sports events. The decision not to keep up its stake in QVC has been taken despite a growing stream of profits at BSkyB. Before interest charges the satellite company is now making operational profits of Pounds 3m a week. Even after interest payments profits are running at Pounds 1.5m a week from a base of 3.3m homes subscribing to at least one BSkyB service. QVC had good pre-Christmas results but its business 'fell off a cliff' during the first three weeks of January. After that, however, sales began to grow again and executives are now confident that they have a business which in the short term will start to compete with mail-order catalogues and eventually with conventional retail outlets. Much of QVC's coverage is demonstrating individual items which can be bought by credit card, with the emphasis on 'impulse' buys. Yesterday's themes ranged from gemstones to leisurewear and gardening products.</p>

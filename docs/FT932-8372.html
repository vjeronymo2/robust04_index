			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Increased spirits sales help Allied-Lyons to 15% rise ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, reported a Pounds 10m increase in full-year pre-tax profits to Pounds 620m, in line with market expectations. Spirits operations grew but brewing profits were affected by higher bad debt provisions and the sale of 550 pubs was reflected in lower retailing profits. On an FRS3 basis, excluding property, profits before tax for the year to March 6 rose 15 per cent from Pounds 439m to Pounds 505m. Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, said the current year had started encouragingly. Lower interest rates and sterling's devaluation had increased competitiveness. said. 'Our exports grew last year by over 12 per cent to Pounds 402m and we expect further benefits this year.' Trading profits of the spirits and wine operations were 2.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 421m. Shipments of Ballantine's scotch whisky, the group's most important brand, rose 7 per cent, while the partnership with Domecq achieved a 20 per cent increase in sales in Spain. Courvoisier cognac increased share in the US, UK and in Japan, where shipments were 32 per cent higher in a market that declined 7 per cent. Allied also announced yesterday that it is buying Perrier-Jouet/Barton &amp; Guestier (PJBG), a French distribution operation, from Seagram. PJBG has handled Ballantine's, the leading premium whisky in France, for 32 years and will provide a base for distribution of other Allied brands. The deal, for an undisclosed price, will raise the group's control of its worldwide distribution from 88 per cent to 93 per cent. Brewing profits fell from Pounds 75m to Pounds 67m, after a charge of Pounds 17m against bad debts. A provision of Pounds 28m has been carried forward into the current year. Beer volumes - led by Tetley and Castlemaine - rose in a UK market which declined overall by 2 per cent. The merger of the brewing operations with those of Carlsberg is expected to bring benefits from rationalisation in 1994. Five depots have been closed and another two are due to go. Retailing profits were Pounds 7m lower at Pounds 217m. Dunkin' Donuts, which opened a further 240 outlets in the US last year, achieved 11 per cent sales growth; and Baskin-Robbins sales were ahead of last year's. Victoria Wine off-licences in the UK recorded sales growth of 6 per cent. Food manufacturing suffered from the UK recession and profits declined from Pounds 102m to Pounds 88m. A revaluation of the group's pubs resulted in a Pounds 312m reduction in values, of which Pounds 41m was taken to the profit and loss account. Borrowings were marginally lower at Pounds 1.8m. Earnings per share improved 3.5 per cent to 35.2p; and a final dividend of 14.05p lifts the total payment 5 per cent to 21p. Lex, Page 26</p>

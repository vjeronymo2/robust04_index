			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Schindler in sharp decline SCHINDLER, the world's second-largest lifts group, suffered a 34.7 per cent fall in consolidated net profit to SFr87.3m (Dollars 58.5m) in 1991, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The decline reflected sharp reductions in demand, mainly in the UK and North America, and pressure on world prices. Group operating revenue was nevertheless up 8.8 per cent to a record SFr4bn, with currency translation contributing 3.3 per cent. Operating revenue in the elevators and escalators division was up 9.9 per cent to SFr3.7bn, while revenue from rolling stock sales fell 3.4 per cent to SFr283m. However, new orders for rolling stock soared from SFr95m in 1990 to SFr554m.</p>

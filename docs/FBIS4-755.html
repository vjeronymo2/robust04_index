			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has rejected the recent  categorization of Nigeria by the United States of America as one  of the four countries not cooperating with it in the fight  against drug trafficking. The head of state, General Sani  Abacha, stated Nigeria's objection to the classification today  in Abuja during his maiden press briefing of media executives.  State House correspondent Chris Nguw reports that Gen. Abacha  described the briefing as an opportunity for forging a  productive government-media partnership:    [Begin recording] [Nguw] The head of state's briefing  centered on six options: government-press relationship [words  indistinct] policy, foreign policy, the imminent constitutional  conference, drug trafficking, and the Nigerian-Cameroon dispute  over the Bakassi Peninsula. One of the highlights of the  briefing was his reference to the United States' recent listing  of Nigeria as an uncooperative country in the fight against drug  trafficking as a political [words indistinct] genuine component  of the United States policy on drug control. Gen. Abacha said  the United States' pronouncement was a surprise, especially as  Nigeria's efforts at combating drug trafficking are well known  had been recently applauded by the American Embassy in Nigeria  and the United States drug administration. He said his  administration would, however, not be deterred in the fight  against drug trafficking.    [Abacha] [Words indistinct], should be understood by all  concerned that this administration is going to continue its  fight against drug trafficking and the related crimes [word  indistinct] to ensure that the drugs [words indistinct] in our  society. We shall intensify our antidrug crusade. Of course,  we believe it is right to do so in our national interest and to  protect our society from its cancerous effects that we have  observed in Western societies. We urge the Western governments  to look inwards into their owns societies and (?calm) the  excessive appetite of their own [word indistinct] which create  the drive for drugs. [applause] Nigeria does not produce any  hard drugs. Nigerians are not a drug consuming people.    [Nguw] On the political economy, the head of state  identified three major sources of conflict, not only in Nigeria,  but also in other African countries: the heavy debt burden, the  effects of the structural adjustment program and last of them,  as he put it the conflict-ridden [word indistinct]  democratization process going on on the continent. He said  [word indistinct] of the idea of the national conference in  Nigeria has been raised on non-partisan interests. (?Referring)  to the issue of government and the media, Gen. Abacha assured  the media executives that his administration is willing to  accommodate criticisms and that free flow of information will be  encouraged. However, he appealed to the media not to publish  [words indistinct] facts and to remember that discretion is the  better part of journalistic prowess.    On foreign policy, Gen. Abacha said Africa stands [words  indistinct] the centerpiece of policy. Outside the continent,  he said Nigeria is reviewing her diplomatic representation in  the former Soviet Union to ensure the nation's presence in the  (?15) republics that have emerged from the breaking up of the  Soviet Union. Some members of the Provisional Ruling Council  and ministers were present at the briefing which went into a  closed-door session shortly after the head of state's address.  [end recording]</p>

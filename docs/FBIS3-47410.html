			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning, some 50 citizens and students  belonging to the Pusan Alliance for Democracy and National  Reunification visited the American Consulate located in  Taechong-tong, Chung-ku, Pusan and demanded that the United  States apologize for the unfair ruling recently imposed by a  U.S. court against Ilchin Company, an enterprise that produces  synthetic diamonds, and that it suspend the implementation of  super Section 301.    An open letter to the Clinton administration declares that  the U.S. court's ruling ordering the Ilchin Company to suspend  the production of synthetic diamonds and abolish its production  facilities, as well as implementing super Section 301, is an  economic aggression act against small and weak countries in an  effort to ease the economic crisis of the United States, which  the Pusan Alliance for Democracy and National Reunification  decided to struggle against.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Midlands joins electrical retail group MIDLANDS Electricity yesterday confirmed it was to join a consortium with two other privatised regional electricity companies to create the UK's third-largest electrical retailing business. Midlands said it would exercise its option, first announced in May, to acquire 28 per cent of the shares of E&amp;S Retail, an electricity joint venture created by Eastern Electricity and Southern Electricity. These two companies will each hold 36 per cent of the remaining shares. Midlands will transfer all its 82 stores, including three out-of-town outlets, to the joint venture on April 1. This will swell the joint venture's store portfolio to 311 shops with a combined turnover of about Pounds 250m. Only Dixons and Comet, owned by the Kingfisher Group, have bigger turnover in the electrical retailing sector. Midlands said: 'On its own our retailing business is not of sufficient size to have a future by itself and we believe that the joint venture is the right thing to do to strengthen its future.' The jobs of 800 Midlands stores and distribution staff will be secured although an unspecified number of redundancies will result from the abolition of some administrative support functions. The combined retailing business will be run as a separate company from Bicester, Oxfordshire, under the direction of E&amp;S's current chief executive, Mr Eamon Bradley. However, Midland's trading director, Mr Bryan Clayton, will join the board of E&amp;S in an executive post. 'It is a completely free-standing operation focused on retailing which is divorced from the electricity companies,' said Mr Bradley. He said the main thrust of future expansion would come from out-of-town superstores. The joint venture will run 11 such stores following the merger but has plans to open up to 50 within five years. The company will fund this expansion programme from its own financial resources. The three companies' stores will continue to trade under their regional trading names although E&amp;S Retail will be renamed to reflect Midlands' inclusion. Lex, Page 24</p>

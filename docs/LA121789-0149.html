			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READ ALL ABOUT IT;  </P> <P> FROM ONCE-OBSCURE ASIAN CUISINES TO CLASSIC FRENCH TO THE LASTEST GRAIN CRAZE,  THE VARIETY OF COOKBOOKS AVAILABLE FOR GIFT GIVING SWELLS AS CHRISTMAS  APPROACHES. TO HELP CULL THE BEST FROM THE REST, THE TIMES' FOOD STAFF HAS  REVIEWED THE YEAR'S MOST INTRIGUING COOKBOOKS.;  </P> <P> THE OPEN HAND COOKBOOK, COMPILED AND EDITED BY ROBERT C. SCHNEIDER (POCKET  BOOKS: $18.95, 304 PAGES).  </P> <P> A collection of menus by such noted food personalities as Hubert Keller, Alice  Waters, Laura Chenel, Rene Verdon and Jeremiah Tower could not fail to draw  interest. What makes this book even more worthwhile is its charitable purpose.  A portion of the proceeds will be turned over to Project Open Hand. Founded in  San Franciso in 1985 by Ruth Brinker, this organization provides two meals  daily to AIDS patients who are unable to market and cook.  </P> <P> The menus are divided according to season and cover such diverse situations as  an unintimidating dinner for friends, an eastern European dinner, an ambitious  dinner for four and a simple southwestern dinner for a summer's eve. This is  not a fancy book, but it offers plenty of substance. BARBARA HANSEN  </P></p>

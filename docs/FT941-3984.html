			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / First warehouse club opening The UK's first British-owned warehouse club, selling goods in bulk at discount prices, opens tomorrow in Croydon, south London, Neil Buckley writes. Cargo Club, operated by UK cash-and-carry company Nurdin and Peacock, is the second US-style warehouse club to open in Britain. The first was opened in November at Thurrock, Essex, by Costco Europe, 60 per cent owned by the largest US club operator PriceCostco, with partners Littlewoods of the UK and France's Carrefour. Cargo Club remains close to the original US concept of the warehouse club - a broad but selective range in no-frills surroundings; grocery products sold mostly in bulk quantities; and an annual membership fee of Pounds 25. Mr Mark Riches, managing director (above), says Cargo Club has been carefully tailored to British tastes and needs. 'We are trying to appeal to a wider audience than Costco,' he said. Cargo Club plans further stores this year in Wednesbury, West Midlands, and Bristol, and four more stores in 1995, with an eventual target of 30. Costco is building stores at Bushey, Hertfordshire, and in Liverpool.</p>

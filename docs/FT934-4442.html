			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Hays to pull out of insurance broking HAYS, the business services group, has decided to transfer its in-house insurance business to Alexander &amp; Alexander, the international brokers based in the US. The group has consequently agreed to sell its St Olaf insurance broking business to a management buy-out. St Olaf will continue with its non-Hays clients, which comprise a substantial minority of its current business. Hays said this move would produce ongoing annual savings of more than Pounds 600,000. The changes will result in some 20 redundancies, about half the St Olaf staff, although some may be re-employed by Alexander &amp; Alexander. Mr Ronnie Frost, executive chairman of Hays, said: 'Hays does not view insurance broking as a long-term activity, and as the group becomes increasingly international, it requires an international rather than a UK broker to service its insurance needs fully and cost-effectively. The move would allow St Olaf's management to devote their time to servicing their portfolio of clients.</p>

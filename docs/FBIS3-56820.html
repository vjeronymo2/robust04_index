			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has emerged from reliable sources that a Russian  deputy defense minister, General Kondratyev, has recently  visited Georgia. He said that although he is regarded as an  enemy in Georgia, his stance is the same as that of the Russian  president and defense minister -- the territorial integrity of  the Republic of Georgia. As for the political status of  so-called South Ossetia, it is an internal affair of Georgia.    To verify this information, we turned to Giorgiy  Karkarashvili, defense minister of the Republic of Georgia. He  said that he does not possess such information. As for General  Kondratyev, nobody in Georgia regards him as an enemy, the  minister pointed out, adding that during the first talks on the  conflict in Abkhazia General Kondratyev had a rather objective  and sensible stance.</p>

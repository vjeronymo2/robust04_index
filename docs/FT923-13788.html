			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Oceana regrets lack of co-operation by Etam OCEANA, the South African-controlled investment company, expressed regret in its annual report yesterday that the management of Etam, the fashion retailer for which it made an unsuccessful hostile bid last year, was not co-operating with it. In his statement in the report, Mr Stanley Lewis, Oceana's chairman, said: 'Our only regret is that we have thus far been unable to persuade the board of Etam to meet and discuss how our experience and expertise through board representation can be made available. This is disappointing.' Oceana launched a bid for Etam in June last year, but only managed to raise its stake to 34.4 per cent. Etam resisted the bid, and has requested the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog, to inspect the accounts. As predicted in its preliminary statement earlier this year, Oceana has used equity accounting to include 34.4 per cent of Etam's profits for the second half on its own profit and loss account. The accounting policies state that it is Oceana's policy to equity account for earnings and tangible net assets for its investments in Etam, as well as two other companies, Gioma and Handbags. It has changed its policies to writing goodwill off immediately against reserves. It has written off Pounds 17m in goodwill in the year to March 31, leaving an unrealised gain of Pounds 9.8m which has not been credited to the revaluation reserve.</p>

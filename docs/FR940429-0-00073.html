			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary also received a number of comments directed to the requirement that agencies must have a systematic program of review to ensure what in previous regulations was described as the ``validity and reliability'' of its standards. Some commenters believed the wording in the NPRM was preferable to the phrase ``validity and reliability'' because of the various technical interpretations often given to those words. Others, however, found the wording in the NPRM vague and generally not as strong as the original wording. All commenters, regardless of their concerns about the specific wording, agreed that the requirement was exceedingly important in assessing whether the agency is a reliable authority as to educational quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, several commenters requested that the limit on preaccreditation status be extended from five to six years to accommodate some agencies' practice of granting preaccreditation for six years and then reviewing the preaccredited institution or program every two years during the six-year period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that the various wording changes suggested by commenters for &sect;602.23, of which two are described above, substantially reduce the effectiveness of the section by shifting the emphasis away from agencies' overall responsibility to have effective standards that ensure educational quality. With regard to the request that the maximum preaccreditation period be lengthened to six years, the Secretary understands the rationale presented by those agencies that conduct very thorough, and in some cases on-site, reviews of preaccredited institutions or programs throughout the preaccreditation period. However, the Secretary notes that not all agencies follow this practice of conducting thorough on-site reviews throughout the preaccreditation period. In these instances, the Secretary believes that the addition of another year of preaccreditation is not justified. For this reason, the Secretary does not accept the suggestion to extend the maximum preaccreditation period to six years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the ``validity and reliability'' issue, the Secretary has carefully considered all of the comments, especially those directed to the level of technical and statistical precision that is often associated with the words. However, in light of the Secretary's decision to list the twelve required accreditation standards in &sect;602.26 as they appear in the law, with no elaboration, the Secretary believes the strongest possible language is necessary in this section to make very clear the importance of this requirement in establishing sound accreditation standards. For the same reason, the Secretary believes it is necessary to add to this section a requirement that an agency must demonstrate that each of its standards provides both a consistent basis for determining the educational quality of different institutions and programs and a valid measure of the aspects of educational quality that it is intended to measure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement in &sect;602.23(b)(5) has been revised to incorporate the ``validity and reliability'' language. A requirement has been added that an agency must demonstrate that each of its standards is effective in determining educational quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 602.24&blank;Accreditation Processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary received numerous comments about the provision pertaining to unannounced site visits, most of which were directly related to the definitions of ``prebaccalaureate vocation education'' and ``vocational education.'' Many commenters preferred that unannounced visits be restricted to those institutions offering non-degree vocational education, while others felt that all institutions offering vocational education, regardless of the credential awarded, should be subject to the requirement. Many commenters suggested that the term ``institution that offers vocational education'' should be restricted to those institutions whose predominant offerings are vocational. The word ``predominant'' was defined by these commenters to mean more than 75 percent of an institution's course offerings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters also believed that the purpose of the unannounced site visit as stated in the NPRM_to determine whether or not the institution or program continued to be in compliance with the agency's standards_was inappropriate. One commenter wanted the regulations to require accrediting agencies to publish clear guidelines for when and how an agency will conduct an unannounced visit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has carefully considered all comments received on this issue, as well as those on the broader issue of the burden these regulations would impose on institutions and accrediting agencies. The Secretary has also reexamined the House-Senate Conference Report regarding the requirement for unannounced inspections of institutions that offer vocational education. This report describes the House language as requiring unannounced inspections of institutions that are predominately vocational in nature, while the Senate language speaks more generally of requiring these inspections for all institutions that offer vocational education. As this report also notes that the House deferred to the Senate on this issue, the Secretary believes it is the clear intent of Congress to require accrediting agencies to conduct unannounced inspections at all institutions that offer vocational education or training. The Secretary also believes that Congress' use of the term ``inspection'' rather than ``review'' or ``evaluation'' is evidence that the purpose of the unannounced visit is not necessarily to conduct a full review of the institution but to determine whether, at a minimum, the institution actually has the personnel, facilities, and resources it claimed to have, or appeared to have, either during its last evaluation by the accrediting agency or in subsequent reports to the agency. The Secretary wishes to point out that an accrediting agency has the flexibility to determine how best to carry out these unannounced inspections in a manner that achieves the purpose of these inspections but minimizes the cost to institutions and the burden to accrediting agencies. The agency also has the flexibility to examine, during the unannounced inspection, other aspects of an institution, such as whether it maintains adequate records or whether it actually provides the programs and support services it advertises. As agencies are responsible for monitoring institutions throughout their accreditation period, as described in &sect;602.24(b)(4), the Secretary wishes to point out that these unannounced inspections can and should serve a useful purpose in helping agencies meet this responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

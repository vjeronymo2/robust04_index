Chepurskiy,  Administration of Main Petroleum Pipelines, Tyumen; UDC  621.384.326]    [Abstract] Formulas are derived for computing the  probability of detecting thermal anomalies arising when there is  leakage from gas and oil pipelines. At least 100 such accidents  occur in Russia annually and the number is expected to increase.  The key parameters of the thermal anomalies (_D_T[.sub]R[/],  S) arising with escape of the product from a pipeline and  ambient inhomogeneities (_D_T[.sub]back[/]) were studied in  key sectors of the Ural-Siberian gas pipeline during summer,  autumn and winter under different meteorological conditions  (clear, cloudy, rain, snow) with simulation of leakage of the  product into the atmosphere, in the ground at different depths,  into snow and into the ground beneath snow. Observations were  made at altitudes 0.05...0.2 km in the spectral range 8-14 m  with registry by a specially developed helicopter-borne thermal  imager, whose principal technical specifications were optimized,  outfitted with a device for measuring the difference  _D_T[.sub]R[/]. The behavior of these parameters as a  function of many other variables (including helicopter speed and  altitude) was ascertained. For example, the maximum level of  background radiation temperature fluctuations  _D_T[.sub]back[/] is dependent on season and prevailing  meteorological conditions: 3 K (summer, daytime, clear), 1 K  (summer, daytime, cloudy), 2 K (winter, daytime, clear), 0.5 K  (winter, daytime, cloudy). Such measurements are illustrated in  the example of several thermal anomalies arising during real  leaks into snow-covered ground. Figure 1; references 2: 1  Russian, 1 Western.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics shows nothing in the portfolio is sacred - Martin Dickson analyses the Dollars 1.525bn sale of the tactical military business that consolidates Lockheed in this segment GENERAL Dynamics, the second-largest US defence contractor, should perhaps be renamed the Incredible Shrinking Company. For the announcement yesterday that it intends to sell its tactical military aircraft business to Lockheed for Dollars 1.525bn in cash is the most remarkable move yet in a 14-month-long contraction of the company through a programme of asset sales. Businesses already sold off include Cessna, the light aircraft manufacturer (to Textron) and its missiles operations (to Hughes Aircraft) but yesterday's deal is in an entirely different category, since the aircraft operations are widely regarded as the company's crown jewel. The Lockheed deal therefore suggests that nothing in the General Dynamics portfolio of businesses is now sacred. It is conceivable that it could shrink to a small rump, holding a lot of cash to be distributed to shareholders. This policy of controlled liquidation represents the most dramatic move by a US defence contractor to cope with the end of the Cold War and the consequent cuts in Pentagon spending, which is forcing the US military business into a series of mergers. Only last month General Electric said it planned to sell its aerospace division to Martin Marietta for Dollars 3bn. Mr Jerry Cantwell, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, thinks that these two big deals are likely to 'break the jam of defence industry transactions waiting in the wings'. The deal also represents a significant consolidation of US military aircraft capability in the hands of Lockheed, one of the financially and technologically strongest businesses in the sector. General Dynamics' tactical military aircraft business, based in Fort Worth Texas, will have 1992 sales of about Dollars 3bn and employs some 20,000 people worldwide. Its main product is the F-16 fighter. It is also a member of the three-company team, led by Lockheed and including Boeing, which last year won a Dollars 9.5bn contract with the US Air Force to develop the F-22, a new generation of radar-dodging fighters. The F-22 is supposed to take the place of the F-15 Eagle, the air force's primary, but ageing fighter, and could be worth tens of billions of dollars in sales to the contractors over the next 20 years, though rising costs could eventually pose a threat to the aircraft from Congress. Mr William Anders, the chairman of General Dynamics, has noted the programme 'could ultimately become unaffordable because of the growing overheads and fixed-cost burden' carried by the contractors. Lockheed, which will now account for two thirds of the F-22 programme, should be able to reduce these cost overheads, though Mr Daniel Tellep, its chairman, gave no indication yesterday of how this might be achieved. Mr Tellep did, however, say that Lockheed hoped to use the F-16's international sales network to lift its own limited foreign aircraft sales. Production of the F-16 is well past its 1980s peak, with the Fort Worth plant building some two dozen this year in a factory designed for annual output of 256 aircraft. As US demand has diminished, the Bush administration has gone out of its way to bolster production at the plant by approving the sale of 150 of the fighters to Taiwan and a Dollars 1.85bn upgrade of aircraft serving with four European countries. Lockheed said yesterday that the Fort Worth division would retain its management and workforce. Lockheed's aircraft group - with products ranging from the C-130 transport to the F-117 stealth fighter, provides about a quarter of the group's revenues. Analysts had argued that it would benefit from greater mass in this area and the General Dynamics deal would provide that, creating a Dollars 6.5bn military aircraft business ranking first in the industry. The deal, will, however, make it harder for Lockheed to meet its long-term goal of a 60-40 mix between its defence and non-defence businesses, compared to the current 70-30 ratio. Some strategists argue there is little point in defence contractors trying to diversify their way into civilian business to overcome the shrinking defence budget, since their record in other areas is so poor. Far better to bunker down and concentrate on running their core military businesses more efficiently. This argument has been embraced strongly by Mr Anders, who this year announced plans to sell off non-defence businesses and concentrate on four areas, which might be built up by acquisitions - tactical military aircraft; armoured vehicles; nuclear submarines and space launch systems. What has surprised Wall Street is Mr Anders's willingness to sell off one of these supposedly core operations. However, Mr Anders has complained that his efforts to buy businesses have been frustrated by the reluctance of other defence contractors to sell off sub-critical businesses. He warned that he would be willing to dispose of an operation if this was the best way of keeping its franchise viable. The Lockheed deal reflects this, and may eventually lead to another share buy-back.</p>

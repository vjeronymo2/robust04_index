			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI SOLDIERS URGED TO DEFY IMMORAL ORDERS  </P> <P> A left-wing kibbutz movement has called on Israeli soldiers to refuse to carry  out illegal or immoral orders when serving in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> Elisha Shapira, a reserve lieutenant colonel and head of the Kibbutz Artzi  movement, a group of 84 collective farms, said there has been an increase in  incidents in which soldiers are ordered to beat Palestinians until their limbs  break or to commit other excessive acts.  </P> <P> "The fact is that in the field many irregular incidents are going on and  soldiers are carrying out dozens and dozens of illegal orders," said Shapira,  who performed his reserve duty near the West Bank town of Nablus earlier this  year.  </P> <P> Shapira said he learned of the excesses from his reserve service and through  reports from members of the Kibbutz Artzi movement, which has 40,000 members.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Israel's collective farms have produced a disproportionate  number of combat soldiers and pilots, including several chiefs of staff.  </P> <P> The call to disregard illegal orders, first made on Israel Television on  Monday, follows Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's announcement that new orders  are being issued to soldiers, loosening restrictions on when they can use live  ammunition.  </P> <P> Soldiers will now be allowed to use live rounds, day or night, against any  masked suspect who disregards orders to halt. In the past, only plastic bullets  could be used, and masked activists were subject to arrest primarily at night.  </P> <P> Shapira said the call was not directly connected to Rabin's directive.  </P> <P> In February, 1988, Rabin issued an order saying soldiers should use "force,  power and blows," as an alternative to gunfire, to quell Palestinian violence.  </P> <P> The order was widely interpreted to mean that soldiers could beat Palestinian  suspects as punishment, and Arab hospitals reported treating hundreds of broken  bones. Orders were later clarified to say that soldiers could use only  sufficient force to arrest suspects.  </P> <P> More than 550 Palestinians have been killed and thousands more injured during  the nearly 21-month intifada, or Palestinian uprising. Most have died as a  result of gunshot wounds, although some deaths have been attributed to  beatings. Thirty-five Israelis also have died in the violence.  </P></p>

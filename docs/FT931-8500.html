			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Europe's other steel industry reels: Output has halved as markets collapse to east and west THROUGHOUT central and eastern Europe a bloated steel industry is in the throes of a painful contraction proportionately far greater than that facing the industry in western Europe. Steel output in the region has virtually halved, and employment fallen by a third, over the last three years, as a result of the collapse of military spending and the impact of macro-economic 'shock therapy'. Furthermore, hopes of increased sales to the west, to compensate for the loss of the Soviet market, have been dashed by US and EC anti-dumping measures. East European imports last year accounted for less than 3 per cent of the EC market, despite rapid growth in the export of flat steel, pipes and other products. The position is likely to be exacerbated further by the latest EC proposals to ask eastern European countries to impose minimum prices on steel exports  -or face anti-dumping duties. Deprived both of former artificially low Soviet energy and raw material supplies and the demand for armaments, the steel industries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria are all involved in down-sizing and plant closures on a large scale. Poland's steel-consuming shipbuilding industry now has full order books until 1995 and steady economic growth is expected to resume this year, after three traumatic years of decline, but it still plans to cut steel capacity from the present 16m tonnes to 11m tonnes of raw steel before the turn of the century. By then, employment will be down to 43,000 from the present 110,000, itself 50,000 down on mid-1980 levels. The Ostrowiec and Szczecin mills are to be closed. Parts of the Batory, Bobrek, Buczek and Bankowa plants in Silesia will also be shut down. Meanwhile, two of the largest integrated steel plants, at Katowice and Krakow, are to be merged into one smaller company with the installation of modern continuous casting lines. At present, the bulk of Polish steel comes from outdated and polluted open-cast equipment, with only 7 per cent produced by continuous casting. The old plant is to be replaced by electric arc furnaces and scrap-consuming mini-mills under a Dollars 4.5bn modernisation plan. The plan predicts that by the end of the century Polish steel exports, at 2m tonnes, will be below the 2.5m tonnes of 1990, while imports will have risen from 300,000 to 1.1m tonnes. Last year, Poland earned around Dollars 460m from its steel exports, mainly to Germany and other EC markets. But the main development was the sale of Huta Warszawa to Lucchini of Italy, which is investing Dollars 200m in a modern strip mill to produce steel sheet for the new Fiat car plants in Poland. With plenty of indigenous coal supplies, but little iron ore, the east and central european steel industries are all heavily dependent on ore supplies from Russia and the Ukraine. Both Huta Katowice in Poland and the East Slovakian steel plant at Kosice in Slovakia are directly linked by rail to Krivoi Rog in south eastern Ukraine. But future supplies to the plants hinge on completion of a new pelletisation plant whose construction has been abandoned by Germany and others. Until now the Czech and Slovak steel industries have resisted contraction better than their competitors elsewhere in central Europe, with output declining from 15m tonnes in 1989 to around 11m tonnes in 1992. The main steel plants in Bohemia and Moravia are particularly well-placed to supply cheap steel for the construction boom taking place in eastern Germany. In comparison, output by the Romanian industry, which is the third largest in eastern Europe, has fallen by 60 per cent from 14.5m in 1989 to an estimated 5.3m in 1992. Romania has become the main partner in the Krivoi Rog project because of its dependence on Ukrainian supplies. Meanwhile, the industry is battling to keep up production and find markets for its steel in the Middle East rather than the EC. It is a similar story of sharply falling output among the smaller producers such as Bulgaria and Hungary. Plagued with energy and raw material shortages the Bulgarian industry has seen output halve to under 1.5m tonnes in 1992 with mills reduced to seeking hire-rolling contracts to provide minimum employment. In Hungary, capacity and output have both fallen by over 50 per cent over the last three years as part of a broader strategic shift out of energy and raw material intensive sectors into lighter industry and processing. Output has fallen from 3.7m tonnes in the mid-1980's to 1.6m tonnes last year when employment was down to 23,000 from 61,000. Only two steel-making centres survive, at Dunaujvaros on the Danube and Dimag at Diosgyor in eastern Hungary. A third steel centre at Ozd has closed down but might re-open as a much smaller scrap-based mini mill of around 400,000 tonne capacity. Heavy investment by General Motors and Suzuki have created new demand for high quality sheet steel for the new car industry. But the future of heavy steel making plants such as Dimag is problematical. Heavy investment is required to reduce capacity from the current 1m tonnes to around 600,000 tonnes using modern convertor technology. However, finding the resources for this type of modernisation is going to be hard. For while the EC's rescue package may have offered new hope to western European steelmakers, it has served to push their eastern counterparts even further out into the cold. The type of integration and cross-investment beginning to emerge among eastern and western producers in other industrial sectors is not going to come easily to steel.

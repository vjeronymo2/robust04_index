El Chacal;  place and date not given; from the "This Morning" newscast]    [Text] Mr. Jose Angel Talavera:    The socioeconomic woes you say prompted all of you to take  up  arms will not be resolved by following a bloody path, because  instead of creating the necessary conditions to overcome the  dire poverty our peasants live in, fighting will worsen the  situation because of the mourning, hatred, and pain that every  war triggers.    There are more convincing and effective means, if they are  well-organized with the definite support of the peasants, to  demand and defend the rights that we all have as Nicaraguans.  I, as well as those around me, will never allow you to be  neglected or ignored once you disarm, as is the case with former  Army members and with former Nicaraguan resistance members.    The stability we are all striving for must not solely  benefit  the traditionally powerful and wealthy people from the  countryside and the city. Instead, it must basically benefit  the workers who, along with the heroic Nicaraguan peasants,  constitute the essential foundation of the Nicaraguan nation's  life.    On behalf of the General Staff and the Military Council of  the EPS [Sandinist People's Army], I guarantee respect for and  protection of the lives and assets of all those who disarm  immediately to rejoin the country's everyday life. We will  support the mechanisms agreed upon with you in order that you  will feel truly certain that the personal safety of each one of  you will be guaranteed.    The Nicaraguan fatherland and people require absolute peace.  I am sure that you will contribute to achieving this absolute  peace by disarming with dignity and by later striving in a  civilized manner for peace, which is in jeopardy because of the  severe unemployment and socioeconomic inequalities that all  Nicaraguans face.    [Signed] Sincerely, Army General Humberto Ortega Saavedra,  Commander in Chief of the EPS</p>

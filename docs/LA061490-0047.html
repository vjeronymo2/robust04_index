			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPACE CADETS  </P> <P> Northridge Junior High School student Mary Guzman was understandably nervous  Wednesday. The eighth-grader was scheduled to pilot her first space shuttle  mission after lunch.  </P> <P> "I don't want to mess up," Guzman said.  </P> <P> But the 13-year-old Reseda resident took command of the joy stick and guided  her three colleagues to a perfect landing after a 93-minute flight aboard the  Northridge Discovery Simulator -- a computerized plywood and plexiglass copy of  NASA's space shuttle cockpit.  </P> <P> "That was fun," she said after landing.  </P> <P> The full-size space shuttle cockpit -- outfitted with flashing lights, gauges,  800 toggle switches, two computer screens and a view of Earth from space -- was  built by students and faculty with a $7,000 grant from GTE Corp.  </P> <P> The shuttle crew followed the flight's progress on two computer screens.  </P> <P> The craft's purpose is not space exploration, but to interest eighth-graders in  fractions, decimals and scientific notation, said math teacher Ronn Yablun, who  organized the project.  </P> <P> Like it's real-life counterpart, the school's space shuttle is designed to be  reusable. Yablun said he plans 10 missions a year beginning in the fall.  </P></p>

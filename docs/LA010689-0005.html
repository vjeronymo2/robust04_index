			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST IMPRESSIONS: VICTOR HUGO'S REDUX  </P> <P> In her books about her early life, M.F.K. Fisher talks about her parents  dressing up and going out to The Victor Hugo to eat. It was obviously a big and  very grown-up restaurant. It was, in fact, a downtown landmark until it moved  to Beverly Hills in 1934 and ultimately closed.  </P> <P> A few years ago, Max au Triangle opened on the site of the old Victor Hugo.  That, unfortunately, closed, too. Now there's a new restaurant on the same  site. It's called . . . Victor Hugo's, and it's at 235 N. Beverly Drive, (213)  858-7292.  </P> <P> It's hard to imagine that this contemporary room, done in white and dominated  by a huge glassed-in kitchen, has much in common with an old-line Los Angeles  restaurant. In fact, with its sleek and comfortable chairs, its lack of windows  and its zinc-topped bar, this looks like a restaurant that belongs in modern  mid-town Manhattan.  </P> <P> There's nothing old-fashioned about the menu, either. You have here a trendy  selection of appetizers such as mussels stuffed with goat cheese in a roasted  pepper vinaigrette, grilled Japanese eggplant in a coulis of yellow tomatoes  with mozzarella (the mozzarella was missing when I tasted the dish), salads,  pastas and entrees such as grilled Norwegian salmon.  </P> <P> While this Victor Hugo's may not resemble the old one, it is, in its own way, a  big and very grown-up restaurant.

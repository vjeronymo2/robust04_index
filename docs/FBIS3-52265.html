			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman this  morning opened the 21st conference of the General Assembly of  the Arab News Agencies Union [ANAU]. [passage omitted]    Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman delivered a speech  in which he said: A few days ago, we bid farewell to 1993,  which witnessed sweeping events throughout the world, the  gravest of which in our region was the aggression Israel  committed against Lebanon to depopulate the south and eradicate  the peace process from its roots. Israel was calculating on the  assumption that by its new aggression, it would be able to  impose new facts in the arena of conflict in order to avoid the  requirements of peace and to undermine the U.S. initiative,  which considers the implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 a basis for achieving a just and  comprehensive peace in the region.    The minister pointed out that the second event was the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was born in the back corridors of  Oslo away from the Madrid framework and the Washington talks and  even further away from joint Arab coordination that Syria  considers a true expression of the unity of the Arab position in  the peace talks and its commitment to achieving peace on all  tracks.    The information minister said that these two events were  part  of Israeli attempts to disavow the resolutions of the  international legitimacy and to single out this or that Arab  party by using force against it and drawing it into unilateral  negotiations in order to create a deep rift in the Arab position  and to impose the peace of the occupier and the outlaw.    Dr. Salman said President Hafiz al-Asad has asserted that a  comprehensive and just peace requires an end to the occupation,  aggression, injustice, and any other form of hegemony.  Therefore, no one can divide peace or bargain over it. The  minister also said that events proved the president's assertions  to be true. Propagators of alternatives to the Madrid formula  have not only lowered their voices, but also acted haphazardly  in the crisis of their unilateral agreement.    The information minister touched on the summit expected to  be  held between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill Clinton  in Geneva in 10 days amid a negative propaganda campaign aimed  at harming the meeting and belittling its importance. He said:  This summit will be held within the framework of the Syrian and  U.S. efforts committed to achieving a just and comprehensive  peace in the region. He expressed his hope that this important  summit will produce good results that lead to the implementation  of the resolutions of international legitimacy that Israel has  been trying to disavow.    The minister also reaffirmed that everything pertaining to  our national and pan-Arab issues shows the importance, on both  the political and professional levels, of joint ANAU action in  the field of news coverage in the Arab, regional, and  international arenas. Dr. Salman stressed the importance of  conveying facts to the Arab citizens and world public opinion,  promoting Arab solidarity, defending our Arab nation's just  causes, and explaining to the world our nation's achievements  and human values.

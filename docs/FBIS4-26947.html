			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special column" by reporter Li Yafei (2621 0068 7236): </F> "Capital Games and Profit Losses -- Investigating and  Considering the Performance of Some Partly or Wholly  Foreign-Owned Enterprises"]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- Fake foreign investment  is commonplace in China. Playing on China's eagerness for  foreign capital, some foreign businessmen have exploited China's  policy and management loopholes to engage in fraudulent  practices and put up false fronts during the investment process  in an attempt to seek profits by hook or by crook. During a  recent investigation of some partly or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises, this reporter found a whole range of falsehoods in  the entire capital circulating process encompassing investment,  operation, production, marketing, and profit distribution. To  put it bluntly, these are "capital games" played by foreign  businessmen. Such economic games cannot bring us real benefits.  <H5>  I. Where Have the Profits Gone? </H5>   China's phenomenal success in using foreign capital since  reform and opening up should be recognized. While foreign  capital has largely been used in a healthy manner in various  localities, we must take note of new circumstances and problems  that have surfaced.    According to incomplete statistics compiled by relevant  departments, losses incurred by partly or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises in China totaled 7 billion yuan in 1992, twice the  amount of 1990. Their total losses from 1990-92 came to 16.2  billion yuan. Cumulative losses in some enterprises outstripped  their registered capital, causing their debts to exceed their  capital. It is reported that the losses were caused by many  factors, chief among them being the false reporting of losses.  Since its founding in 1986, a joint venture in Guangdong has  reported losses every year and chalked up 920,000 yuan in total  losses. However, it increased its capital by $3 million on  three occasions in recent years.    How did it manage to increase capital despite its losses?  Behind this anomaly is the "business savvy" exhibited by some  foreign businessmen in secretly diverting their profits.    Profit diversion is a practice widely adopted by investors  the world over to seek excessive profits and evade taxes, and  examples of this practice abound among foreign investors in  China. Some of these foreign investors provide high price  quotations for the equipment with which they make investments in  an attempt to disguise inferior quality, reap some profits early  in the game, or exaggerate the investment-dividend ratio. Some  control export and import channels, and divert profits to the  companies in their home countries by providing high price  quotations on imported raw and semifinished materials, and by  depressing the prices of export goods. Some ask their partners  to share unreasonable charges and fraudulently increase capital  so that they can divert profits and increase their losses for  purposes of tax evasion. Using the regulation that exempts  partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises from income tax  within the first two years of profit-making, or that grants them  income tax reductions within the first three years of  profit-making, some foreign investors misreport their losses and  intentionally delay their profit-making year to evade taxes.  Still others set up "dummy companies" in tax havens around the  world and divert their profits to such companies in what amounts  to an international tax evasion exercise. The list of such  practices goes on and on.    Relevant experts have estimated that foreign joint-venture  partners have spirited profits totaling several billion U.S.  dollars out of China by resorting to two practices alone:  importing equipment at high prices, and exporting goods at low  prices.  <H5>  II. The Secret of "Contracted Capital": Large Sums of </H5> Contracted Capital but Small Sums of Actual Investment    Although they sign many investment contracts covering  sizable  amounts of capital, some foreign businessmen make far smaller  investments in reality, do not pay their registered capital, and  default on payments in violation of contractual obligations,  thus creating an illusory, bubble phenomenon.    According to an investigation by relevant departments of  1,187 partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises whose  contractually stipulated deadline for paying capital was up, 668  of them, or 56 percent, failed to pay their registered capital  in violation of contractual obligations. The defaulted capital  totaled $900 million, or 53 percent of payable capital.  According to the contract, the foreign partner of a joint  venture which was set up in Beijing in November of 1991 is  supposed to invest $100,000 in cash but has thus far failed to  pay a single cent. The enterprise in question has become a  joint venture in name. Real estate companies account for a high  percentage of enterprises which have failed to pay their  registered capital.    In making investments, many foreign businessmen make every  effort to keep their registered capital down. After making  small capital contributions, they raise capital by taking out  loans from domestic banks in the name of the joint ventures,  with their Chinese partners undertaking all risks pertaining to  their loans. Loans obtained by a foreign-funded enterprise in a  certain province totaled $1.7 billion, or 46 percent of the  paid-in capital, at the end of 1992. Using massive amounts of  domestic capital to set up partly or wholly foreign-owned  enterprises is contrary to China's goals of using foreign  capital. Some foreign businessmen who use equipment as  investment capital provide high price quotations for their  low-cost equipment and fraudulently increase their paid-in  capital. In evaluating some equipment whose prices were  reported by foreign businessmen, relevant departments found that  83 percent of the prices were misrepresented and were  substantially lower than the actual prices; some were even  over-reported by several times.  <H5>  III. Being "Dummy" Means Lacking Foreign Capital </H5>   Partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises enjoy some  policy-related preferential treatment, prompting some people to  employ this loophole. The result is some "dummy partly or  wholly foreign-owned" enterprises.    According to one tactic employed by these people, they  enlist  the assistance of their foreign partners in completing relevant  formalities without asking the latter to make capital  contributions. A wholly foreign-owned enterprise in Inner  Mongolia, for example, is actually a dummy one set up by local  businessmen who pose as foreign investors. In east China, some  foreign businessmen, using their passports and some assets  certificates issued abroad, do business without capital  investment, sign joint-venture contracts, and collect "service  charges." According to another tactic, foreign partners make  themselves available for relevant formalities while their  Chinese partners remit foreign exchange out of China on their  behalf. Some Hong Kong-registered enterprises or foreign  representative offices in China make themselves available for  relevant formalities while their Chinese partners remit foreign  exchange out of the country so that the enterprises outside of  China can reinvest those foreign exchange remittances in China.  Still other foreign businessmen bring in capital in accordance  with relevant provisions, and after obtaining capital  verification certificates and joint-venture licenses, both the  Chinese and foreign partners remit foreign capital contributions  out of China under various pretexts in accordance with privately  concluded agreements. Even more outrageous is that some foreign  businessmen produce false capital verification certificates and  false bank receipts. Last year, capital verification  certificates and bank receipts produced by eight wholly  foreign-owned enterprises in Haikou City were found to be fake.    IV. Profiting From the Chinese With Their Foreign  Exchange Receipts    Virtually all foreign businessmen undertake in their  contracts to balance their foreign exchange and to set ratios  for sales to their home countries and for exports. Departments  in charge of examining and approving their applications also  specifically require them to do so. In reality, many partly or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises only undertake to do so on  paper. According to an analysis by relevant departments on the  sales performance of partly or wholly foreign-owned,  production-oriented enterprises, only 15 of them met the  contractually stipulated export ratios in selling their products  while the rest failed to meet those ratios. A significant  number of those enterprises sold all their products on the  domestic market. To solve the problem of balancing their foreign  exchange, they brought in foreign currency through foreign  exchange markets, imported raw and semifinished materials for  processing and sale in China, earned large amounts of renminbi,  and converted it into foreign currency in foreign exchange  markets, thus giving rise to the bizarre phenomenon of  "profiting from the Chinese with their foreign exchange  receipts." Such actions not only have had an adverse effect on  China's still fragile foreign exchange markets but also have  compounded the country's balance of payments.    Some foreign businessmen abuse their exclusive selling  rights  to quote unit prices or issue invoices on their own for export  goods, which they sell at low prices to their parent companies,  subsidiaries, or other affiliates abroad. Some foreign  businessmen appropriate their Chinese partners' funds, default  on payments, or swindle their Chinese partners of their money  under the pretext of exporting goods. They also chronically  refuse to remit their payments for goods. Consequently, a  growing amount of outbound joint-venture capital fails to make  its way back to China, an amount which sometimes even vastly  outstrips the foreign partners' total capital contributions.  <H5>  V. Dispelling Illusions and Stressing Practical Results </H5>   Faced with problems of every description in connection with  foreign investment, people should seriously consider and study  solutions to such problems.    The first issue to be considered is how to stress practical  results in using foreign capital and to pay attention to  studying capital-related issues.    In recent years, many localities evaluated their leaders'  job  performances in light of the number of joint ventures set up  locally. They determined the number of new joint ventures to  set up in any given year. This practice has fueled some  illusory, bubble phenomena in the course of developing partly or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises. At present, we should set our  sights on improving the quality and efficiency of introducing  foreign capital, focusing on solving such crucial problems as  small actual foreign capital input, failure to pay registered  capital, small numbers of joint ventures which eventually become  operational, large numbers of deficit-ridden joint ventures, and  capital flight. In evaluating the results of foreign capital  utilization, we should consider actual foreign capital input and  the resultant economic benefits. Activities involving dealings  with foreign businessmen and setting up enterprises are  graphically reflected in capital flow. Therefore, we should  thoroughly study and explore capital-related issues within the  context of the actual status of foreign capital utilization.  This carries strong implications for China's current economic  activity.    The second issue to be considered is how to strengthen the  legal system and improve the state's macroeconomic regulation  and control.    We should devise scientifically conceived plans regarding  the  development of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to  reduce the degree of recklessness in setting up such  enterprises. Banks should develop rules governing loans for  foreign-funded enterprises at an early date so that foreign  capital will be truly used in China instead of letting foreign  businessmen use domestic capital. We should explicitly forbid  banks to grant loans for use as capital contributions by Chinese  partners in state-controlled projects, so that our limited  capital will only be used for projects badly needed by the  country.    The third issue to be considered is how to exercise strict  management in accordance with the law and how to devise relevant  preventive measures.    We should earnestly carry out work pertaining to capital  investment and resolutely plug the channels through which dummy  joint ventures are set up. As a rule, we should revoke the  business licenses of partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises  if their foreign partners have failed to invest capital or have  made investments in renminbi without justifiable reasons after  the joint ventures have been registered for more than one year.  To prevent foreign businessmen from providing high price  quotations on low-cost imported equipment in an attempt to  disguise inferior quality, we should evaluate non-capital  investments made by foreign businessmen. Economic, trade,  industrial, commercial, customs, commodity inspection, foreign  exchange, and taxation departments, as well as banks, should  institute sweeping preventive measures regarding the capital of  partly or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, so that an  integrated and strictly regulated administrative system will  take shape.    The fourth issue to be considered is how to actively fight  against tax evasion.    Profit diversion and tax evasion involving international  capital in multinational transactions demand urgent attention  from tax offices. Currently, we need to urgently devise laws  and regulations on fighting tax evasion and study the methods of  combating tax evasion.    The fifth issue to be considered is how Chinese enterprises  should master the law of foreign capital utilization to reduce  the degree of recklessness in using foreign capital.    As China opens wider to the outside world, its enterprises  should quickly learn the secrets of international capital flow,  master the law of foreign capital utilization, and reduce the  degree of recklessness in all stages of using foreign capital  ranging from finding investment partners, determining  joint-venture projects, and conducting feasibility studies to  signing contracts, building and launching projects, engaging in  production and marketing, and distributing profits. We should  encourage a scientific and practical approach. In the volatile  market economy, we should constantly sum up our experiences and  learn from our mistakes in managing foreign capital so that our  enterprises will operate more efficiently as they gain more  experience.    The sixth issue to be considered is how to deal with illegal  foreign businessmen in strict accordance with the law.    We should never accommodate foreign businessmen who amass  ill-gotten wealth by hook or by crook in violation of Chinese  law. We should let the whole world know that China welcomes  foreign investment and protects foreign businessmen's legitimate  rights and interests. However, we should never allow foreign  businessmen to seek staggering profits by hook or by crook in  violation of Chinese law.</p>

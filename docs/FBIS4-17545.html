			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Results of State Duma Hearings on </F> Foreign Economic Activities. Government Is Recommended to Give  a Meaning to its Policy"]    [Text] As KOMMERSANT-DAILY already wrote on 20 and 22  April, the parliamentary hearings on foreign economic activities  organized by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Duma Economic  Policy Committee, are unlikely to alter appreciably the  Chernomyrdin cabinet's foreign economic policy. The committee's  recommendations can still be considered as a rather promising  option in a bid to improve Russia's foreign economic ties.    The Economic Policy Committee proceeds in its  recommendations  from the fact that "a sensible state foreign economic policy is  absent." This finds an expression in that Russian exports are  increasingly raw-material-oriented which adds no hard currency  sources for the Russian budget. Besides, Sergey Glazyev  believes, the existing sources for adding to the budget from  foreign economic activities are far from being fully used. He  is confident that a tougher control over customs and hard  currency, coupled with the abolition of invalid easy terms, can  alone add to the budget between $8 billion to $12 billion.    The committee also asked the Duma to expedite the passing of  a package of three economic laws that propose to delimit clearly  the functions of the authorities, to define the rights and  duties of the participants in foreign economic activities, as  well as to set the norms on non-tariff regulation and export  control.    As for the government, it was recommended to submit to the  Duma a program for expanding the export of finished products, to  coordinate the industrial, foreign economic, scientific and  technical policy, to make public the procedure for the  registration of special exporters, as well as to join hands with  the Central Bank to impede the outflow of capital abroad.    Burdened with the current problems (including those created  by the foreign economic activities lobby), the government is  hardly enthusiastic about Glazyev's recommendations -- they  cause irritation because, from the political point of view, they  detract from the professional prestige of the executive branch.    Many others are also unhappy with Sergey Glazyev's  persistence. For example, as he was preparing the foreign  economic activities hearings, he applied to the  "Rosvooruzheniye" state corporation but its chiefs declined to  provide information about its operations. In response, the  Committee decided to hold on 24 May hearings on  military-technical cooperation.</p>

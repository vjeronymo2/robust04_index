			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on NHTSA's review of the failed diaphragms, contacts with diaphragm manufacturers and other available information, the agency has concluded that diaphragms used with air-applied, mechanically held parking brake systems do not fail catastrophically. Rather, the typical failure mode with these systems is a gradual deterioration through extended use. The agency further notes that GM/Volvo White and Freightliner, which use ITI air brake chambers as original equipment on their vehicles when ordered by a customer, have not experienced any catastrophic failures with these systems. Accordingly, the agency concludes that the current requirement to require vehicles to meet the parking brake requirements with ``any'' single leakage type failure is unnecessarily design-restrictive with respect to air-applied, mechanically held air brake systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ITI requested that NHTSA exclude diaphragms entirely from failure testing with respect to the parking brake requirements. However, NHTSA has decided that an exclusion would be inappropriate. A diaphragm is an integral part of the parking brake system, and the failure of a diaphragm can have adverse safety consequences. Therefore, excluding diaphragms from such testing would be inconsistent with the safety purposes of the standard. Such an exclusion would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the parking brake requirements which serve to ensure that a driver can safely park a vehicle in the event of a leakage-type failure in the service brake system. Because diaphragms do fail, as ITI readily admits, it would be inconsistent with the parking brake requirements to exclude such an important component in the brake system from the relevant test requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Test Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed a test procedure that it tentatively concluded would identify the ``worst case'' leakage-type diaphragm failure that is likely to occur with brake systems using common diaphragms. Under the proposed procedure, the first step would be to determine the threshold level of diaphragm leakage-type failure (or equivalent level of leakage from the air chamber containing that diaphragm) at which the vehicle's parking brakes become unreleasable. A measurement would then be taken of the leakage rate associated with that level of failure. The proposal explained that the ``threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate'' is the rate of reservoir air pressure decrease, for whichever of the vehicle's reservoirs that is experiencing the most rapid decrease in pressure level, that results from that threshold level of leakage. The agency proposed that a vehicle would be required to meet grade holding requirements with a level of diaphragm leakage-type failure that results in a reservoir leakage rate that is three times the threshold maximum reservoir leakage rate. This ``three times'' safety factor was included to account for the possibility that a small diaphragm failure could grow larger between parking brake applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Midland-Grau, ITI, and Allied Signal believed that the proposed test procedure was unnecessarily complex. Midland-Grau stated that the procedures were difficult to follow and could be interpreted in many ways. Midland-Grau requested that NHTSA modify the test procedure so that it could be easily followed. Moreover, it stated its preference for testing parameters that are concise, and lead to consistent test results that allow easy assessment of whether the system passes or fails. ITI requested that the agency simplify the test to make it less complicated. Allied Signal criticized the proposal for being overly complex, claiming that multiple attempts would be necessary to establish the size of diaphragm failure for both release and application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the proposal in light of the comments, NHTSA believes that the proposed test procedure, with minor adjustments, is appropriate to evaluate brake systems that incorporate a common diaphragm. The agency further believes that the test procedure is not unreasonably complicated. In particular, the agency's experience at VRTC in running the tests indicates that the tests are not overly burdensome and that with a valving meter in place, various pressure levels of leakage can be obtained relatively quickly and without much difficulty. The agency notes that to simplify testing, it could have specified a fixed orifice size to be used for all systems. However, such an approach would have prevented certain parking brake systems and thus have been unnecessarily design restrictive, since the size of leak at which sufficient force is generated to park the vehicle varies for different systems. In contrast, the variable leak rate procedure that the agency is adopting in this final rule may be used to evaluate any brake system regardless of its design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

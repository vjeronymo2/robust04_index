			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Return from high risk to historic core business News of Hanwa's resolve to wash its hands of speculative financial transactions reverberated through Japan's business and financial community yesterday. In its heyday, as a leading player in the stock and currency markets, Hanwa enjoyed a formidable reputation. Its huge deals could send the currency market into pandemonium and banks scurrying for cover. Speculative transactions increased under the leadership of Mr Shigeru Kita, who was known as the god of zaitech, or speculative financial trading. Mr Kita, who took the helm in 1983, was widely regarded as a canny investor ,particularly after he correctly weakening in 1985. In early 1987 he directed company funds away from speculative market transactions and back towards its core in time to shield Hanwa from the worst effects of the stock market crash. Mr Kita had started the business - with two brothers - of selling steel to a government scheme back in 1946 in war-ravaged Japan. But his natural instinct for financial deals led him to dabble in real estate from the earliest days of the company. In addition to being a leading investor in stocks through specified money trusts, known as tokkin, and a feared speculator in currencies, under Mr Kita's direction, Hanwa was also built up Japan's commercial paper market. At the end of 1989 it accounted for up to 25 per cent of the entire market in Japan. The It provided huge profits by allowing Hanwa to invest proceeds in short-term deposits at higher rates. But the strategy started to unravel with the pricking of Japan's asset bubble in the early months of the decade. By the spring of 1991, Hanwa began to feel the effects of Japan's stock market fall. It reported appraisal losses on its cross-shareholdings in other company's stock and on securities investments. One year later, Hanwa reported that it would halve the level of its investment funds. It entered into a furious public and legal battle with Yamatane Securities over a promise which Hanwa claims Yamatane had made to repurchase securities after three months at a price that would yield a 12 per cent return. It demanded the securities firm repay Y4bn (Pounds 24.1m) to cover the loss it had incurred. At the end of last year, the company was further undermined by rumours that Hanwa faced financially difficulties and had exceeded its limit on credit by Y56.4bn. The news sent Hanwa's share price plunging Y100 in one day late in December to Y455, a far cry from the peak of Y3230 the shares reached on 1991. By the end of December, Hanwa's share price had fallen to as low as Y387. Hanwa's undoing by its own speculative ventures is all the more ironic since the company's core business of trading in steel products has been a solid one offering relatively high returns. The soundness of its main operations and its finances (despite Y950bn of outstanding loans to banks) is attested to by the fact that none of its banks, which are also major shareholders, feel the need to send directors to assist Hanwa in its restructuring. Rumours about its financial difficulties had been exaggerated and the share price has recently started to recover. Reflecting on the fate that befell the company, Mr Takashi Iwama, vice-president, said yesterday that the decline of the Japanese stock markets was the single most significant factor behind its current misfortunes. Others were more inclined to blame lax management controls which allowed the company to sink deeper and deeper into the speculative frenzy of the late 1980s and the lack of strong direction from management once things were clearly seen to be going wrong. Although Hanwa's recent financial troubles were well known, the final decision to admit failure and withdraw from financial transactions, which generated huge profits in the past and in which it still has Y1.3 trillion of outstanding funds invested, came as a surprise to many. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at BZW in Tokyo, said that while 'Hanwa was known to be in trouble, this created quite a shock.' The lessons of Hanwa's experience are bound to have an effect on other Japanese companies which were equally caught up in the speculative heat of the late 1980s. While investments in tokkin specified money trusts and fund trusts have already declined from a peak of Y43 trillion in February 1990 to Y23 trillion last September, according to BZW estimates, the decline of these investment techniques is bound to accelerate further, analysts say. At the same time, cross-shareholdings, which have been a major support for stock prices in Japan are likely to be affected by Hanwa's decision to sell off assets. Hanwa is big enough to constitute a significant jump' in the unwinding of cross-shareholdings, according to Mr James Jason, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo. But for corporate Japan, after years of busily pursuing one diversification after another and one lucrative financial deal after another, the harshest lesson may be the importance of focusing on core businesses. 'Hanwa had a good reputation in the steel business,' says Mr Hiroyuki Suzuki, steel analyst at Nomura Research Institute. 'We expect more companies to follow its example and concentrate more assets on their original businesses.'</p>

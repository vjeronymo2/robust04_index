			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Igor Yavlinskiy report under "INFORM" rubric: </F> "Andrey Vladimirovich, Are You Pro-Serb?"]    [Text] Bonn -- Andrey Kozyrev and his German colleague  Klaus Kinkel know each other well and can get down to business  without any preliminaries. That is why Kozyrev managed to pack  a lot into the three hours he was on German soil. He and his  team traveled by military helicopter to Bonn's "Petersberg"  residence for honored guests, he had a conversation with Kinkel,  he had a bite to eat, and he appeared before journalists.    The agenda included: putting the final touches to the  program for Boris Yeltsin's upcoming visit to the FRG; an  exchange of opinions on the progress of the elections in the  Republic of South Africa; discussion of the situation in the  Near East; and problems of bilateral relations. But the key  question was Bosnia and, in particular, President Yeltsin's  proposal to hold an international meeting on settling the  conflict with Russia, the United States, the EU [European  Union], and NATO participating. In the minister's opinion, it  should specifically result in a consolidated approach to this  problem from the world community. Russian diplomacy's main  thesis is that there must be no reliance purely on a military  solution involving force and that it is essential to try to make  full use of all peaceful methods to extinguish the conflagration  of war in the Balkans. A meeting of foreign ministers of the  states and political organizations invited by Boris Nikolayevich  to the conversation on Bosnia is due to be held in the near  future in order to reach final agreement on disputed points.    The world community's next task is to insist on a cease-fire  in Bosnia and to start working out the conditions for and  principles of a comprehensive peace settlement. And, as  progress is made toward the set aim, the vise of economic  sanctions against Yugoslavia must be gradually loosened.    "Do you represent the Serbs' interests?" a German journalist  asked.    "No, I represent Russia," Andrey Vladimirovich replied.</p>

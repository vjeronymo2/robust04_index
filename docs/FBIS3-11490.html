This was confirmed by more than 3,000 international  observers  who were at the polling sites throughout the country. They were  there since the Voting Table Boards were installed up until the  time the vote count was carried out by the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal in the Presidente Hotel.    From Perquin, Morazan, Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst, who  will  be the new UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) chief, has told  PRENSA GRAFICA "the patience with which the electoral process  was carried out and the people's will and determination to vote  made us realize a page has been turned in El Salvador's history,  inaugurating a new, truly democratic and participative era."    Onusal participated with 900 representatives from 52  countries.    As did the rest of the delegates, the missions observed  aspects such as voter registration, the supply of electoral  equipment, the composition of the Voting Table Boards and any  delays in their installation, and in ballot receipts.    Reports will be officially presented during the week.    The international observers were made up mostly of official  missions, such as the U.S. Mission headed by Brian Atwood, the  AID administrator who claimed to be "very satisfied at having  thus reaffirmed U.S. support for the consolidation of the  democratic process in El Salvador."    The importance of these elections brought to our country  observers who do not belong to established organizations. Many  are members of churches and student groups, as is the case of  the Moecen (Mission of Electoral Observers of U.S. Citizens),  which had 500 delegates. Four of the delegates were U.S.  congressmen.    "Our commitment demonstrates support for the people's  decision and wish to carry out an important role in securing  peace," U.S. Democratic Congressman Dan Hamburg of California,  said.    Attending personalities included Ignacio Lozano (1976-77)  and  Edwin Corr (1985-88), former U.S. ambassadors to EL Salvador.    "I can view the process positively. Now nobody can voice  criticism there is any sector without a voice or without the  right to participate in political activities in El Salvador,"  Corr stated. He witnessed the elections in Suchitoto, Cuscatlan.    The international observation of elections is relatively new  and was born from an initiative of the international community,  after certain governments or parties engaged in the armed  conflict decided to move toward a democratic development.</p>

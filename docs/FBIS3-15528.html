			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] A report we received not so long ago said that  Azerbaijan's military forces pounded the Armenian defense  positions in Karabakh and the military unit in Fizuli with  artillery fire at about 0730 this morning. Later they tried to  penetrate the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's defense lines.  However, thanks to the successful efforts of the Karabakh  artillery units, the offensive was halted. The Azerbaijani  units were forced to retreat after suffering several casualties.  The reports we received as of noon today say that positional  fighting is continuing at that part of the front line.    The situation is tense on other parts of the line of  confrontation, but relative peace prevails.    Meanwhile, the provocations from Azerbaijani territory  against Armenia seem to be unending. The defense positions  around Berkaber in Idzhevanskiy Rayon were fired on at 1900  yesterday. The Armenian border guards refrained from returning  fire. No one was hurt.    The situation along the rest of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border has been relatively peaceful. Meanwhile, the neighboring  republic must realize that it is impossible to involve Armenia  in the conflict through provocative activities. Armenia  maintains a peaceful policy.</p>

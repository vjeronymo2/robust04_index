			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Civilian Regime Which </F> Repeats an Old Tune"]    [Text] According to radio reports from Seoul, on 21  January, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique convened a meeting  called the 27th central anti-espionage operations meeting and  decided that the goal of the so-called anti-espionage operations  this year is to establish a total national security posture.    At the meeting attended by the rabble in charge of national  security, the bastards recklessly found fault with us and  babbled that they must increase the preparedness for immediate  reaction to unconventional warfare, strengthen the total defense  system involving the people, the government, and the military,  and conduct exercises in a real combat situation for  unconventional warfare to counter a so-called provocation.    This is the repetition of the old tune of the preceding  dictators and an intolerable challenge to us, who are  persistently making efforts for peace in the country and its  reunification.    As everyone knows, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the  previous dictators, talked about the so-called anti-espionage  operations or someone else's provocations and loudly talked as  if we would launch a southward invasion at once. The people of  the world acknowledge that we have never launched a southward  invasion and that threats of aggression come from the South to  the North, not from the North to the South.    The Kim Yong-sam regime, which calls itself a civilian  government, repeats the old tune which has already been sung.  This means the Kim Yong-sam regime is no different from the  preceding military fascist dictatorships. Learning from the  preceding dictators, it does so to justify its maneuvers to  prepare for a war of northward invasion under the pretext of  someone else's nonexistent provocation.    All fellow countrymen in the North and South and abroad are  filled with a resolve to make this year a year when they will  achieve great national unity and open a new phase in the  fatherland's reunification. They also expect that in step with  the fellow countrymen's heightened ardor for reunification,  North-South relations will be led to detente and peace.  Meanwhile, through several rounds of contacts, the DPRK and the  United States have removed a series of obstacles that had  deadlocked DPRK-U.S. talks and achieved a breakthrough to make  progress in the talks.    When bright prospects have opened for peace in the country  and its reunification, the Kim Yong-sam ring is using the old  tune, which the preceding dictators chanted over and over again,  as a means to aggravate North-South tensions and embarking on a  road toward confrontation.    From the very beginning of new year, the South Korean  warmongers found fault with us and recklessly made bellicose  remarks about immediate punishment or complete military  preparedness. This is no accident. The Kim Yong-sam ring  decided that strengthening the total defense system involving  the people, the government, and the military and conducting  exercises in a real combat situation for unconventional warfare  will be the goal of the so-called anti- espionage operations  this year. This means that it will conduct larger-scale war  exercises this year.    A few while ago, the South Korean puppets babbled that they  would conduct a large-scale joint military exercise, a  combination of the Ulchi and Focus Lens military exercises, with  the United States in August in case they discontinue the Team  Spirit joint military exercise. Facts show the Kim Yong-sam  regime is a group of warmongers and an antinational group that  follows the preceding military fascist groups' footsteps.    The South Korean puppets are rushing toward confrontation  and  war, not national reconciliation and unity, this year. The  reason is clear. The bastards are facing a serious crisis in  their rule. The Kim Yong-sam ring has loudly babbled about  reforms, talking as if they would do something. However,  nothing has changed in South Korea. Rather, fascist suppression  has been stepped up, a worse economic catastrophe and greater  difficulties have been inflicted on the people. Not only the  people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification  but also the workers' strikes have been suppressed brutally, and  as a result of the treacherous opening of the rice market, 6  million peasants, agriculture, and the overall economy are  threatened with a catastrophe. Moreover, the Naktong and Han  Rivers and other rivers have been contaminated, and, therefore,  numerous people face difficulties in getting potable water.  Therefore, the South Korean people call the Kim Yong-sam regime  a civilian fascist or non-civilian regime and participate in the  antigovernment struggle to overthrow the bastards.    Flustered at this, the Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to divert  the people's attention somewhere else by talking as if we would  launch a southward aggression at once, thus, inspiring a sense  of urgency. However, this is a foolish dream. No one will be  deceived by the theory of threats of southward invasion, which  has already been done before.    The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless war maneuvers will further  inspire the South Korean people's resistance. The Kim Yong-sam  ring must ponder over grave consequences from its reckless war  maneuvers, act with discretion, and leave office without delay.</p>

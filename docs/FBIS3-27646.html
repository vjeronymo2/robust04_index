Lin Chien-hsiung, director of the Department of National  Treasury, made the announcement on the opening day of US-Taiwan  tariff reduction negotiations.    US negotiators had earlier requested Taiwan revoke its  monopoly alcohol and tobacco tax in accord with General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) regulations.    Taiwan currently imposes monopoly taxes on the imported  products averaging NT$16.6 (US$0.61) per pack of cigarettes and  NT$660 (us$24.4) per liter of alcohol.    After the monopoly tax is lifted, imported alcohol and  tobacco will be subject to normal taxes, Lin said.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Trade News: Frustration in Geneva at failure to break deadlock THE failure of the Washington meeting to break the farm subsidies deadlock has cast a pall of gloom over negotiations in Geneva, where trade officials have been struggling to stitch together detailed country-by-country deals on tariff cuts and services liberalisation. These talks ground to a halt before Easter when it became clear that the US and the EC were still far from resolving differences over farm trade, the crux of the Uruguay Round for most countries. Trade officials said yesterday they did not expect serious negotiations to resume in Geneva until there were signs of a breakthrough in the bilateral talks on agriculture. 'Without a significant development at the political level we're not going to make progress,' one diplomat said. There is deep frustration among smaller Gatt members, both rich and poor, that nothing can move until the two biggest traders have sorted out their differences. Even if Washington and Brussels could reach accord by the end of June, their agreement would have to be endorsed by all 108 participants in the round. Officials warn that other outstanding issues may not fall into place as easily as has been assumed. In the negotiations on market access for goods, progress has been blocked principally by the failure of the US and the EC to agree tariff cuts for industrial and farm products. In services, Washington has angered trading partners by proposing to exempt a range of services from multilateral market-opening measures. US officials say that some of these proposed exemptions would be scrapped if other countries improve their offers to open domestic markets to foreign services suppliers. But Washington's insistence on keeping its maritime shipping out of a Uruguay Round agreement, a key sector for many countries including Japan and EC members, remains a serious threat to the negotiations. Officials also say that new areas of disagreement have begun to appear as they comb through the legal text of the draft 'Final Act', the package of rule-based accords presented last December after five years of negotiations. In particular, the US and some other countries are having second thoughts about the role and functions of the proposed Multilateral Trade Organisation, which would incorporate the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and administer the proposed accords on services and intellectual property. In addition, the possibility remains that, if changes are made to the agriculture text in the draft 'Final Act' at the behest of the EC, other countries will try to secure their own amendments. This could provoke a general unravelling of the carefully balanced text. For instance, the US administration is under strong pressure from industry lobbies at home to toughen the proposed rules on intellectual property protection and anti-dumping, while Japan, South Korea and some other countries oppose proposals to convert all farm import barriers to tariffs. Officials in Geneva agree there is no chance of a Uruguay Round package coming into force at the beginning of next year as envisaged. A failure to reach agreement in the Uruguay Round would not only hit the world trading system, it could also damage financial markets, Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday.</p>

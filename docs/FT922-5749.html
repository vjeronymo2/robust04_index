			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Government gives boost to home-grown capitalism THE focus of Hungarian privatisation is to turn inwards, to give preference to domestic over foreign investors, the government announced yesterday. Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's privatisation minister, launched a battery of measures designed 'to give a push to local investor demand'. The most concrete change in policy is an explicit commitment that domestic investors will be preferred over foreign companies in the case of similar bids, whereas price was previously the all-important factor. Further help for domestic investors who cannot afford to buy a state company outright will come in the form of concessional leasing or option arrangements. The new schemes will be financed partly by using Ft16bn (Pounds 110m) of the Ft57bn (Pounds 392m) of privatisation sale proceeds forecast for 1992. Hungary has also turned towards Czechoslovak-style privatisation schemes to spur domestic ownership by distributing some state property rather than selling it. The government is to hand over state assets to institutions such as universities, though mass distribution of shares to the public at large is still not on the agenda. The change of emphasis comes at a time when both the government and privatisation itself are increasingly unpopular and marks a concession to political pressure for home-grown and popular capitalism after two years in which Hungary has relied almost exclusively on foreign corporate investors to take property off state hands. Nine out of the top ten privatisations by value last year were to western companies. Mr Szabo said that it was necessary to favour domestic investors in order to preserve the overall momentum of privatisation at a time when public showed a 'tendency' to suspect foreign economic domination. A survey this month showed that opinion was divided on privatisation with 39 per cent in favour of selling off state industry and 34 per cent against. Public attitudes to foreign investment and privatisation have been coloured by their coincidence with a deep recession which saw gross domestic product fall by 10 per cent last year. Hungary has been, until now, the most welcoming of east European countries to western investment, a stance rewarded by Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) in accumulated foreign direct investment, about 60 per cent of the total for the region as a whole. The inflow helped boost the private sector to 25-30 per cent of gross domestic product.</p>

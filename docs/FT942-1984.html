			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Dollar slides as traders test resolve of central banks: Bank of Japan acts to stem sharp rise in yen The dollar fell to a postwar low against the yen yesterday as foreign exchange markets tested the willingness of the world's central banks to intervene in support of the US currency. After dipping below Y100 in Europe to reach a new low of Y99.85, the dollar rallied early today in Tokyo amid reports of Bank of Japan intervention. Bankers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars at Y100.4, Y100.6 and Y101. As the dollar continued to edge higher, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, Japan's minister of finance, said his country would take 'decisive' steps on excessive currency movements in consultation with other Group of Seven members. Japanese ministries were due to hold an emergency meeting later today to discuss the yen's rise. Earlier, the US currency finished in New York at Y100.335 after closing in London at Y101.225. Central banks last stepped in to support the dollar in early May, when it had appeared to be testing Y100. After the intervention, the dollar gradually climbed back to Y105, but in recent days it has been falling steadily against the yen and the D-Mark. Analysts warned that without intervention this time, the dollar could quickly fall even further. Agency reports quoted a US Federal Reserve official as saying that the bank was unlikely to respond to the dollar's decline by increasing interest rates. The official blamed rising US inflationary expectations and the widening trade deficit for the fall. Yesterday's plunge came after figures from the US showing that the April trade deficit widened to Dollars 8.4bn,(Pounds 5.52bn) from a revised Dollars 6.87bn in March. However, the key trade gap with Japan narrowed to Dollars 5.48bn from Dollars 5.8bn. Earlier in the year, traders had believed that the US administration was trying to drive down the dollar against the yen to exert pressure in the trade talks with Japan. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, has since tried to dispel the impression that the US is happy to see the dollar fall. However, a recent change in sentiment towards the D-Mark, on the grounds that German interest rates may have reached a low, has increased pressure on the US currency. Fears that the Japanese government might lose a vote of no confidence also hit the dollar, since a change of administration in Tokyo might make resolution of the trade dispute more difficult. The dollar's fall did little to help sentiment on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 33.93 to 3,707.97 - having been more than 50 points lower during the afternoon. In Tokyo early today the Nikkei 225 average was down nearly 400 points in mid-morning, having dropped 338.87 to 20,813.16 in the previous session. Europe's markets closed too early to reflect the full impact of the dollar's decline, but continued to be driven down by fears of higher US interest rates and inflationary pressures. Early weakness in the US Treasury bond market also had a knock-on effect on European bonds. In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 30.9 to 2,940.2, ending only nine points above its low for the year. In Germany, the DAX index, which fell 4 per cent during Monday's official trading, yesterday managed a 14-point rally to 1,983.27. But after-hours, it dropped back to 1,957.08.

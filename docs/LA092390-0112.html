			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FLAUNTING IT  </P> <P> Hurrah! The trend to build "monster" homes totally out of scale with their lot  and neighborhood character may be halted by revising current building codes  ("Blockbuster Homes Could Get Busted By Revised Codes," Sept. 9.)  </P> <P> La Jolla and Point Loma are not the only communities suffering from extravagant  structures.  </P> <P> In North County, the crest of Fairbanks Ranch resembles "hotel row" from a  distance and Rancho Santa Fe has its share of over-built, over-designed "spec"  houses -- usually painted pink.  </P> <P> Enough already. If builders and architects need to cater to the owner who must  make a financial statement of his worth to every passer-by, wouldn't a discreet  front-lawn sign stating "We are very rich" do just as well?  </P> <P> PAT COLOGNE  </P> <P> Rancho Santa Fe  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: FIVE SOCKERS NAMED TO MISL ALL-STAR TEAM  </P> <P> Five Sockers -- midfielders Branko Segota and Brian Quinn, defenders Kevin Crow  and George Fernandez and forward Zoran Karic -- have been selected to the  Western Division team that will be coached by the Sockers' Ron Newman in the  Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star Game Feb. 21 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> Crow, a six-time selection, has been the MISL's defender of the year three  times. Fernandez, a first-time selection, has played in 105 consecutive games.  Segota, making his eighth appearance, leads the Sockers in scoring with 14  goals and 20 assists. Karic, a first-time selection, is second on the team with  24 points. Quinn, a six-time selection, is the Sockers' playmaker and has eight  goals and 15 assists in 17 games.  </P> <P> Also selected was St. Louis' Fernando Clavijo, a defender who played for the  Sockers from 1984-88.  </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State has received oral commitments from Tim Gutierrez, a 6-foot-3,  200-pound quarterback from Santa Clara High School, and Marc Ziegler, a 6-4,  215-pound tight end from Mira Mesa High.  </P> <P> Gutierrez finished his three-year high school career with 7,272 yards passing,  third best all time in the Southern Section, fifth in the state and ninth  nationally. He completed 210 of 334 passes for 2,939 yards (fourth in the  state) and 18 touchdowns last season. Gutierrez hasn't yet qualified to play at  SDSU because he hasn't passed the Scholastic Aptitude Test. If his score isn't  high enough, he said he will likely enroll at a community college in the Oxnard  area and then transfer to SDSU.  </P> <P> Gutierrez was also recruited by New Mexico and Cal State Fullerton. He said he  chose SDSU because of its pass-oriented offense.  </P> <P> "It's the type of offense I eventually want to go in and run," he said. "And  San Diego State's program is rising."  </P> <P> Ziegler joins Mira Mesa teammate J.J. Rowlett as having committed to SDSU.  </P> <P> "Marc is a great athlete," Mira Mesa Coach Brad Griffith said. "He's going to  have to do a little weight work to get a bigger upper body, but he's got great  hands, and he can really be a factor in their program."  </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Christian Heritage used a school-record 14 three-pointers to defeat host The  Master's, 86-80, in a nonconference game in Newhall. The victory was a  school-record ninth in a row for CHC.  </P> <P> The Hawks, ranked No. 1 in the National Christian College Athletic Assn.,  trailed, 68-63, with 5:45 remaining. But CHC then hit three consecutive  three-pointers to take a 72-70 lead and never trailed again.  </P> <P> Brad Soucie and Will Cunningham each had six three-pointers. Soucie finished  with 26 points, Cunningham 23 and Mark Kraatz 16 for CHC (18-4).  </P> <P> Warren Daniels made a pair of free throws with six seconds left to lift Cal  Baptist over Point Loma Nazarene, 76-75, in a Golden State Athletic Conference  game in Point Loma.  </P> <P> PLNC's Gary Litten got off a last-second shot but missed. PLNC is 6-15, 0-6,  Cal Baptist 8-10, 1-5.  </P> <P> The Crusaders were led by Mike Flores with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Ron  Hubbard and Brian Thurston added 16 points. Daniels led the Lancers with 25  points.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Chapman College's James Cass allowed just two runs on five hits over seven  innings to beat U.S. International, 12-2, in the Gulls' season opener.  </P> <P> Kevin Crabtree had a home run for USIU. Mike Whisonant was the loser, allowing  six runs in four-plus innings. Chapman, which got homers from Doug Yates, Tom  Allison and Mark Landeros, improved to 2-0. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold fever returns to Ghana Ghana, once called the Gold Coast, is going through the third gold mining boom in its history and its output of the precious metal will reach 2m troy ounces in 1996, according to Mr Godfried 'Geo' Kesse, who recently retired after 20 years as director of the Ghana geological survey. He was also an adviser to the minerals commission and a director of Ghana's state gold mining corporation. Since its first gold rush started in 1880, Ghana has produced at least 41m ounces but output dropped to an all-time low of 280,000 ounces in 1982-83. Then a new government launched an economic recovery programme, changed the mining laws and made other moves to attract foreign capital into mining in Ghana. These changes, and the country's relative political stability, encouraged phenomenal growth in the past seven years, Mr Kesse points out in a paper prepared for the Investment in Mining conference in New York this week. In a country where no new gold mines had been brought into production since 1940, six have been opened since 1988. And at least USDollars 800m has been invested in the gold sector alone with 66 Ghanaian and 19 foreign companies being issued with prospecting licences (mainly for gold) and 10 companies winning mining leases. Gold output surged to 1.2m ounces last year and is on track to reach 2m ounces in 1996. Much of the production will still come from Ashanti Gold Fields, recently privatised by the Ghanaian government, with the rest coming from new projects and big expansion and rehabilitation programmes at other mines, says Mr Kesse, 61, who was awarded his geology degrees at universities in California. He has now joined the Ghanaian gold rush as chairman of African Star Resources which has a 76 sq km concession near the Ashanti mine at Obuasi. African Star's parent company, Pacific Comox of Canada, recently raised CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.8m) which will mainly be spent on the Andansi Asaasi project where there are old underground workings developed between 1900 and 1930. 'There are 1,000 feet of underground workings but there has never been any drilling or geophysical work,' says Mr Douglas MacQuarrie, president of Pacific Comex. African Star is also participating in an initial 16,000 sq km airborne geophysical survey, the first high-resolution survey ever carried out in Ghana. It will cover most of the gold bearing greenstone belt in south western Ghana.</p>

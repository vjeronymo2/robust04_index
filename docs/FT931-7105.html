			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Drought declared over in California CALIFORNIA'S five-year drought is officially over, after last weekend's snow storms in the Sierra Nevada capped a wet winter, bringing reservoir levels close to normal levels. Governor Pete Wilson declared the drought ended this week, but warned citizens they should not give up their water conservation measures. Officials had been reluctant to declare the drought over, for fear Californians might resume their old ways of profligate water use, but Los Angeles has received 23 inches of rain during this winter season. But water experts warn that the ground has dried up so much since 1986, the last wet year, that it may take several years for it to be replenished. The drought has hurt California's farmers, who account for over 60 per cent of the state's 50bn-gallon-a-day water consumption, harmed forests through insect infestation flourishing in the dry conditions, and ravaged fisheries, with salmon stocks particularly low. California has always depended on billions of gallons of water being pumped to irrigate farms, water suburban lawns and fill city bathtubs in defiance of its basically arid conditions. Rainfall is usually low, averaging less than 10ins in San Diego, 14 in Los Angeles and 20 in San Francisco, but since 1987 it has ranged between 61 per cent and 86 per cent of these normal levels. Reservoirs had dropped by last year to little more than half their normal levels, and the snowpack on the Sierra dwindled. Los Angeles considered building a water pipeline from Alaska, but instead rationed water supplies for 13 months during the worst of the drought, and retains curbs on watering lawns and hosing pavements. The city of Irvine installed parallel plumbing systems in some office buildings to allow 'grey water' from washing to be recycled for flushing.</p>

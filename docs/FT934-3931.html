			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Long arm of the ombudsman  -Small companies are now eligible for assistance What do you do as someone running a small business if your bank transfers money out of your personal account and into your company's account without authorisation? Or if the cash takings you deposit in the deposit machine at your branch go missing through some error? Apart from considering changing your bank, one answer - if this type of mistake or misbehaviour occurred after January this year - is to complain to the banking ombudsman. The two examples come from his annual report, published last month, and in each case the bank in question made either a repayment or some compensation. Sole traders, partners and unincorporated companies have been able to have their complaints taken up by the banking ombudsman since the scheme started in 1986. But only since January this year has its scope been extended to limited companies with an annual turnover of up to Pounds 1m. To make a complaint to the ombudsman as a small company you follow the same procedure as if you were a personal customer. In taking up your complaint with the bank initially, you should write to your branch setting out the problem and the remedy you seek. If you do not get a satisfactory reply, you should ask the bank to refer the matter through its procedures, and if you and it still do not agree, to issue a 'deadlock' letter. This deadlock is officially the trigger for the banking ombudsman to become involved, but if you face undue delays from your bank in reaching this point, an earlier referral of the papers to the ombudsman can speed up progress. The ombudsman asks a bank to respond within six weeks of a case having been raised. Once the ombudsman has decided that he can take up the case, then the customer will be asked to sign a waiver of confidentiality, and the ombudsman will write to both parties asking for all relevant information. The scheme is not necessarily the answer to a small business's prayers in its dealings with a bank. Its remit is limited, and in most cases last year, the ombudsman found in favour of the bank rather than the customer. Laurence Shurman, the lawyer who holds the post of ombudsman at present, has been at pains in the annual report to spell out the limits of his powers. 'If a bank is in breach of its contract or if there is evidence of maladministration or of some other breach of duty from which loss, damage or inconvenience results, then the ombudsman may be able to intervene and award compensation,' he said. 'What I cannot do in the absence of maladministration or some other breach of duty is to interfere with a bank's commercial decision, whether it be on lending or otherwise.' He added that if a bank refused to make a loan or decided to demand repayment on reasonable notice of an overdraft then provided it had fulfilled its duty, these were decisions in which 'neither a court nor the ombudsman can interfere'. The extension of the scheme to small businesses has prompted the ombudsman to begin separating out business from personal customer complaints, so next year's report should be more informative about how far businesses are using the scheme and how helpful they are finding it. This year's report said that of the almost 5,000 new complaints made between April and September this year, business accounts represented 15 per cent. The National Federation of Small Businesses campaigned for the extension of the ombudsman scheme to small companies and is pleased that this has happened. But Bernard Juby, chairman of the federation's trade and industry committee, is doubtful that it will lead to a great deluge in cases, since only a small proportion of small businesses are incorporated companies. He added, however, that many people did not realise the scheme already extended to unincorporated businesses, and so the greater publicity from the extension of the ombudsman's role might encourage small businesses which were already covered to come forward with complaints.</p>

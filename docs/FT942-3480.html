			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (2): Process still painful - Services sector growth is not fast enough The rundown of the county coalfield is both part of a long-term trend and a manifestation of a realignment in the county economy. The trend away from traditional industries and the growing emphasis on light manufacture and services is thus part of a wider national phenomenon, but no less painful for that. Seen in crude figures for employment covering the whole of the county, jobs lost in the collieries during the 1980s were amply offset by the rise in the number of jobs available in the services sector. This has emerged in the growth of local financial, distribution and catering services and the expansion of jobs in education, health and public administration. But the county figures tell only part of the story. In the first place, the growth in the financial services sector has been marked in the south of the county, around Nottingham. With one exception, Cotgrave, the working mines of the 1990s have been in the east and north of the county. There is thus some geographical mismatch between those needing jobs and those readily able to provide them. Analysis of the latest unemployment figures, as the national economy moves out of recession, shows falls in the areas around Nottingham and Newark, a significant manufacturing centre. But there have been rises in the areas where coalmining has been the dominant economic influence. Second, the speed of closures since the government's first announcement of major changes at British Coal in October 1992 has upset any notions of a cosy trade-off in jobs between one sector and another. Between 1961 and 1992, 44,000 colliery jobs and 26 pits were lost. In the last 18 months, more than 8600 jobs and nine pits were lost. As elsewhere in the UK, the role of the services sector has been growing in the county economy. It now accounts for 62 per cent of jobs. But the growth has not been quick enough to absorb a sudden influx of people on to the labour market. Third, the mines have been a source of well-paid employment. 'All mineworkers getting other jobs can expect to have drop in pay - the vast majority at any rate,' said Winsor Lewis, Midlands regional manager of British Coal Enterprise. This has been borne out by a survey of former Silverhill miners, carried out by the Coalfield Communities Campaign. This showed a fall in average weekly pay from Pounds 243 to Pounds 149. It showed that half of the new jobs won by former miners were in factories and warehouses. These three factors provide a pattern of a well-paid and concentrated industry, frequently in relatively isolated pockets away from the growth areas of the county economy. Yet the rundown of the coalfield cannot be seen in narrow geographical terms. The spending power of the individual miner may have been brought to bear in particular localities, but the spending power of British Coal influenced much wider areas. The withdrawal of much of that spending has not yet been fully quantified. But in recent months there has been a series of redundancy announcements at companies adjusting to the loss of British Coal demand. Herbert Cotterill, Dale Group, Longwall Roof Support Repairs are cases in point. Last November, Nottingham Trent University contacted 26 companies supplying British Coal. It found that half had scaled down their investment intentions and had, on average, reduced numbers on the payroll by 15 per cent. Companies highly dependent on British Coal were having difficulties in securing bank loans. But the uncertainty among British Coal suppliers is matched by uncertainty about the fate of its customers for the remaining collieries. The Nottinghamshire pits have been reliant on coal-fired power stations, of which there are five in the county alongside the River Trent. The switch from coal-fired to gas-fired power stations makes the future of these power stations, and possibly 1,500 jobs, unclear. Any closures would have an effect on the future of the coal rail freight network. Such changes would speed the reduction of the county's traditional industrial base. The problem arising from the coalfield closures is that, latterly, they have come too quickly for the economy easily to adjust to the extra twist of change. This is made more difficult to handle because of a longer term downturn in the number of jobs provided by the textile and engineering industries. Between 1981 and 1991, that is just after the recession had started to bite, employment in the metal goods, engineering and vehicles sector fell 27 per cent and in the 'other manufacturing' sector, which includes textiles, it fell by 21 per cent. Further, the speed at which small companies were growing throughout the 1980s was slower than the national average. The growth in the number of businesses registered for VAT was 20.7 per cent for Nottinghamshire, against 27.2 per cent for the East Midlands and 28.4 per cent for the UK. So when the future of the coalfield was thrown into doubt, the county's economic position was relatively weak. Phil Asquith, director of economic development at Mansfield District Council, referring to two inward investments, said: 'Each step forward, like bringing in Toray and Johnson Controls, and the government shuts another pit - so its like walking the wrong way on a moving pavement at an airport.'  -----------------------------------------------------------                      COLLIERY EMPLOYMENT  -----------------------------------------------------------                     Oct 1992     April 1994    Sept 1994 Collieries         BC figures    Estimates     Estimates  ----------------------------------------------------------- Permanently closed  ----------------------------------------------------------- Bevercotes               800           0              0 Cotgrave                 620           0              0 Manton                   737           0              0 Ollerton               1,019           0              0 Rufford                  806           0              0 Silverhill               817           0              0 Employment             4,406           0              0 Job losses             4,406       4,406          4,406  ----------------------------------------------------------- Operational BC  ----------------------------------------------------------- Bilsthorpe               935         540           480 Harworth               1,203         835           550 Thoresby               1,212         851           600 Wellbeck               1,057         757           750 Employment             4,407       2,983         2,380 Job losses                         1,424         2,027  ----------------------------------------------------------- Reopening on lease  ----------------------------------------------------------- Clipstone (reopened)    967          200           240 Calverton (reopened)    752            0           200 Annesley/Bentinck       879            0             0 (mothballed) Employment            2,598          200          4,40 Job losses                         2,398         2,158  ----------------------------------------------------------- Totals  ----------------------------------------------------------- Employment           11,811        3,183         2,820 Job losses                         8,628         8,991  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nottinghamshire County Council  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

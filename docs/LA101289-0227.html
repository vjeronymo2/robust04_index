			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> RECALL OF DRAIN CLEANER URGED  </P> <P> The nation's trial lawyers called today for the recall of Lewis Red Devil Lye,  warning that the drain cleaner available nationwide is explosive and its use is  "akin to playing Russian roulette."  </P> <P> The warning was the first in a campaign by the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of  America to reveal information about dangerous products that is uncovered during  litigation but is often kept secret under out-of-court settlements.  </P> <P> American Home Products Corp., which sells the drain cleaner, acknowledged in a  statement issued in New York that lye can be dangerous but said Lewis Red Devil  Lye is safe when used according to label instructions.  </P> <P> The lawyers group said it knows of 21 people who have been hurt when the 100%  lye drain cleaner was poured down a drain and then "blew back" after mixing  with water, showering the user with a burning mixture of lye and drain sludge.  </P></p>

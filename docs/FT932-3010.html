			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bradford Property falls to Pounds 21m BRADFORD Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted residential property company, yesterday announced a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 23.1m to Pounds 21.1m for the 12 months to April 5. The total dividend is increased by 21 per cent from 4.45p to 5.4p with a recommended final of 3p. The dividend is increased to a level that matches the surplus from property rentals after payment of tax and preference dividend. The company's business centres on buying tenanted properties at a discount to reflect the statutory rights of sitting tenants under the Rent Acts and selling them with vacant possession. Since the 1988 Housing Act, the company has been able to let property that becomes vacant free of rent controls. About 90 per cent of its portfolio is currently subject to rent controls. Dealing profits were down, from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 9.45m, reflecting the state of the housing market over the last year. However, the surplus from property rentals increased from Pounds 9.79m to Pounds 11.8m. This partly reflected acquisitions of new property, including a portfolio from Asda Property. It also resulted from larger rent increases. The interest charge was Pounds 1.76m, against a credit last time of Pounds 15,000. That reflected the acquisition of property worth about Pounds 60m during the past two years. Earnings per share fell from 10.76p to 9.87p. Net asset value per share fell from 175p to 170p. COMMENT The City was prepared to overlook Bradford's fall in profits yesterday in favour of its exceptionally strong dividend prospects. This year's 21 per cent dividend increase may be followed by increases of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent for the next couple of years, as rental surpluses swell. In addition to rent rises in its existing portfolio, the company may benefit from more acquisitions. With gearing of 15 per cent, the company could, in principle, sink another Pounds 100m into new acquisitions. But like the property sector as whole, the shares are probably due for a period of consolidation. The shares, which yesterday dipped from 197p to 192p, are trading on a 7 per cent premium to assets, assuming a rise in net asset value to 180p next year. But taking a long term view, the shares should prove a rewarding play on an improvement in the residential property market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Duetoft: NATO Agreements Are </F> Pure Self-Deception"]    [Text] The chairman of the Folketing's Foreign Affairs  Council, Peter Duetoft, is currently causing great turbulence  among the government parties on the question of Denmark's  approach to NATO's new agreements with the countries of East  Europe, the so-called Partnership for Peace agreements.    The agreements do not guarantee that the NATO countries  would  automatically intervene the moment that Poland, Hungary, or the  Czech Republic, for example, became the target of aggression.  On the other hand, the agreements do make sure that in a crisis  situation the threatened countries have a guarantee of so-called  consultation with the 16 NATO countries.    "But if this partnership is simply joint maneuvers and a  consultation in a crisis -- then it is nothing. If there is no  built-in automatic mechanism providing help, it is much easier  to say, `Oh well, we need not take this too seriously,'" said  Peter Duetoft, who compared the agreements to the 1938 Munich  agreement.    "I am furious, because I am afraid that things could end in  the same way. In 1938 the agreement did not commit anyone to  anything. People just wanted to play along with Hitler. My  position is that if this does not end in new members for NATO  before the next Russian presidential election in two years'  time, the agreements are worth nothing, and the same could  happen again. And then the agreements would simply be a bluff or  a self-deception. It is not realistic that the countries could  become NATO members once Zhirinovskiy (infamous and popular  Russian right-wing extremist) is president. It would be too  late and too great a provocation. And that risk is a very real  one," Peter Duetoft said.    Radical Liberal foreign policy spokesman Jorgen Estrup  thinks  it extremely unfortunate that Duetoft is airing his criticism at  the present time.    "Raising one's voice at the present time is not particularly  helpful. Duetoft should have voiced his objections before the  government had decided its line. It seems a little easy and  cheap to say this now," Estrup said.    Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (Social Democratic Party)  did  not want to go into Peter Duetoft's motives for voicing his  criticism now:    "But in my contacts with the countries of East Europe I have  come up against a strong desire for a security guarantee now --  but it has of course proved impossible to reach agreement on  this. Nevertheless, we have a good compromise. For it is clear  that the goal is an expansion of NATO. In addition, the  countries are getting an extremely important crisis management  tool in the form of consultation with the NATO council."</p>

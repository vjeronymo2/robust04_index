			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Remarks by Oleg Dobrodeyev, editor in chief of information </F> service of NTV television company, recorded by Anna  Politkovskaya, under the rubric `Television": "Is NTV  Independent?"]    [Text] Oleg Dobrodeyev, 35-year-old editor in chief  of the information service of the NTV television company,  assures us: "We depend only on common sense..."    The NTV television company, which originated in the bosom of  ITA Ostankino, began its permanent daily broadcasting on  Channels 3 and 4 in 1993. Various things were said about the  "youngster": that all the journalists who had transferred there  had sold out lock, stock, and barrel to the financial group  Most-Bank and that it is through their mouths that the high  commercial financial circles of Russia broadcast from the  screen. But discussions are discussions, and it is difficult to  imagine a weekday evening without the information program  "Segodnya" (anchors--Tatyana Mitkova and Mikhail Osokin) or the  end of Sunday without "Itogi" (Yevgeniy Kiselev).    Oleg Borisovich Dobrodeyev is a Muscovite, a specialist in  modern and recent French history (MGU [Moscow State University]  history faculty and graduate school), and an ace of domestic  television. At one time he was the chief of all currently  existing main information television services of Russia without  exception. And he left it all: He was never satisfied by the  concept of information broadcasting--neither on "Vesti" nor  especially on ITA. Last year he finally got a chance to do  things exactly as he thinks they should be done.  <H5>  We Are Dependent. But Only on Common Sense </H5>   Independence is a fairly arbitrary thing, and those who say  that TV can be completely independent today are being less than  candid. Of course, we are independent of the power structures in  selecting and preparing programs and we determine our own  information priorities, but here we are guided by OUR OWN vision  of what is happening. Watch, let us say, the news on BBC or ITN,  their interpretation of the events in Southern Ireland, and you  will immediately be able to see that not everything is so  simple. Even the companies that frequently give only simplified  outlines as information, and that is how CNN operates--an  excellent service, which is remarkable in crisis  situations--even they have their own particular predilections  and unconditional priorities, their own sympathies and  antipathies.    Our company's main priorities are the same as those of other  worldwide companies--NEWS. In the first place, we do not  influence political events but simply register them. In the  second place, we are not on the side of one or another political  party or grouping and we try to give the information picture of  the day in all its diversity. Information, in our view, implies  a certain reasonable framework as well: We do not chase after  sensational news, we try to give only verified information, we  cannot allow ourselves to be too categorical in our assessments,  and we do not allow those who speak on our programs to be too  categorical either--whatever they may say, there is editorial  control, and that is normal. Of course we do not give only pure  news announcements but at the same time we have no shows with TV  hosts. In the future we will try to get away from commentary.  But the attitude of the host or journalist toward the event  could be manifested also in the selection of information; nobody  is insured against that--it is impossible to run everything  through a computer so that it will have an ideal design in its  final form. Nonetheless, the makeup of the program, its  information portraits, each topic--these are never random on  "Segodnya" or "Itogi," they do not appear in one place or  another just because that is what somebody wants. And in this  respect we depend only on common sense.    There are socially significant events which undoubtedly  influence the subsequent course of the political or economic  process. Therefore, as a rule, the political news goes first,  but it can also be something else that happened today but did  not yesterday and will not tomorrow. For example, the loss of a  person who was involved in many people's lives. For example, on  the day of the death of Yevgeniy Leonov we decided to begin the  program with this particular piece of news. We try to approach  information from a position of universal value--human life. We  always place the problems that are bothering our compatriots  today in the first segment--and this is our fundamental  position. Even if only to break down the stereotype of abstract  state news: Here are state interests and here is the human  being, who is very separate from them. The tradition of  Ostankino news was precisely not to air anything that pertained  concretely to a given person, whether it be Chernobyl or the  tragedy in Baku.  <H5>  NTV Does Not Sing the Praises of Financiers </H5>   I know many bankers, but this is in no way reflected in our  work. People see us every day and we cannot allow ourselves such  a luxury as to declare our predilections from the screen.  Moreover this is unproductive: As soon as we join with one  financial group or political party or another, regardless of  whether they are our investors or not, our ratings will  immediately start to fall. This is why we have no commercial  pieces, as other leading information services now do, in which  the anchor gives the lead in: "Today is the anniversary of such  and such a commercial structure," and later in the middle of the  information program, among other pieces, there appears a newsy  but purely complimentary piece created in keeping with all the  rules of commercial advertising and production. The commercial  financial information is woven into the fabric of the program  and it undermines confidence in everything else. Such pieces  should be used only during advertising time.    The problem of today's TV and of all journalism for that  matter is that aesthetic boundaries are erased and ideas about  what is permissible and what is not evaporate. And after the  commercial financial information, which is shown daily (we are  quite well aware of where and how it is placed), it is  impossible to avoid the next stage, which we have encountered  anyway, especially during the last election campaign. It is  POLITICS FOR HIRE. NTV, incidentally, is the only company that  has never given its air time to any political party for money.  Naturally, they have asked us. But this was the fundamental  position of both the leaders and all the workers. The strangest  thing we have in journalism today is when representatives of one  party or another come to an interview with an envelope in their  hand.  <H5>  NTV's Prospects </H5>   It will be simply reasonable, consisting of three components  which are mainly interesting to the audience: information,  entertainment, and sports. I would like for us to synthesize the  BBC's balance, CNN's efficiency, and ABC's accounting for viewer  interest. At the same time we understand quite well that we are  living in Russia and working for a Russian audience, and we must  make certain adjustments, taking into account the specific way  in which we are viewed. One thing I can promise for sure--NTV  will not do any political programs since they bring the lowest  ratings and nobody needs them.    "Itogi" is primarily analysis. And that is why those who  receive it, those who do not receive it, and those who are  indifferent to it are checking their political watches against  it. The most difficult thing today is simply to register the  event and give all existing viewpoints. Not to influence what is  going on, not to have an impact on what the journalist  encounters and, of course, not to harm it to any degree.  Everything is filled with contradictions nowadays, and to  represent it adequately to the audience without being on one  side or the other is very difficult. But we think that there are  some things that are inadmissible in journalism. We must not,  for example, air an interview if it provokes a situation of  conflict.  <H5>  Our Ratings Are Rising </H5>   We especially order a determination of our ratings from  sociological services. And so far we are satisfied--we have a  fairly large number of viewers, the number is always with two  figures, in the millions, naturally. Our audience is more  knowledgeable than the audience of Ostankino's "Novosti" and  "Vesti." We are watched by people who do not need a readymade  assessment of events, who can put the facts together for  themselves. Although, of course, we do not set a special goal of  having news for the elite. Throughout the world companies invest  colossal amounts of money in analysis of television audiences,  since the rating means the value of advertising on which  commercial TV exists. The value of each program is determined by  its rating, which is typically determined the day after a  program is aired.    So far we do not intend to increase our broadcast time: We  need to assimilate what we have now, which, in my view, is at  fairly good times--1900 and 2200. The audience, as a rule, is  not always the same and therefore no more than 20 percent of the  newscast is repeated. Thus we end up with a very large amount of  information broadcasting--a whole hour. Moreover, in a month or  two our correspondent network will be in operation, and then it  will be possible to speak further about the development of the  NTV news service. For now we rely on help from stringers  (nonstaff investigative reporters). The correspondent network  will be fairly compact: two regional foreign correspondent  bureaus--in the United States and Germany, and about 10-12 (in  the first stage) in Russia and nearby foreign countries--in  Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg, Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg,  Syktyvkar, Saratov, Riga, and Tbilisi.</p>

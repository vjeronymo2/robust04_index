			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Japanese groups join video conferencing standard Japan's largest telecommunications and computer companies plan to launch products and services for desktop video conferencing based on standards established by Intel and other US companies. NTT, NEC, Fujitsu and Just Systems have joined a group of US companies that endorses the Personal Conferencing Specification. In joining the group the companies have signaled their intention to introduce PCS compatible products. PCS is a standard that defines protocols permitting inter-operable, PC-based conferencing and communications. PCS compatible products such as Intel's Proshare allow PC users to see each other as they talk and share data and computer applications. 'This announcement is very good news to PC users all over the world,' said Mr Andrew Grove, Intel president and chief executive. 'Having leading companies in the Japanese PC and telecommunications industries join this activity is a key step in making PC-based conferencing a worldwide application. NTT's role as a leading network service provider in integrating PCs and communications in Japan is critical.' In Europe, the PCS standard has been criticised by some industry executives because it is not an international standard. Intel said, however, that in addition to the Japanese support announced yesterday several European telecommunications and computer companies plan to endorse the standard before the year-end. Establishing standards for inter-operability is critical if the desktop video conferencing market is to flourish. It will enable users in different countries using different types of equipment to participate in video conference calls. Mr Yoshi Takayama, director of NEC, said: 'PC-based personal conferencing capability is expected to be a critical tool to enable the great leap of personal productivity. NEC is committed to broadening the desktop conferencing market and is planning to be the first in the Japanese market to offer the system.' 'We believe it is very important to develop and promote a worldwide standard such as PCS in the personal conferencing segment,' said Mr Yasunori Kanda, general manager of Fujitsu Personal Business Division. 'We are going to introduce PCs with personal conferencing capabilities.' Just Systems, a leading supplier of Japanese word processing software, said it would also support the PCS standard and announced plans to link more than 1,000 PCs in its own research laboratories via Intel's Proshare personal conferencing products. Intel said it planned to incorporate an existing standard called H320 for stand-alone room-sized video conferencing systems into its Proshare products by the end of this year. This will allow Proshare users to take part in conferences with users of traditional video conferencing equipment. However, H320 systems do not allow the simultaneous sharing of data and applications.</p>

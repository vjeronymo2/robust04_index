			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Court to review warehouse finding THE COURT of Appeal yesterday allowed the UK's three biggest supermarket chains to continue their attempt to block planning permission for a US-style warehouse club - which would sell goods ranging from baked beans to car tyres - at Thurrock, Essex. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco appealed after the High Court rejected their application for a judicial review of Thurrock Borough Council's granting of planning permission to Costco, the US warehouse club operator. The High Court must now review the planning consent in early autumn. Costco said it had spent 'several million pounds' on its site next to the Lakeside shopping centre and the warehouse was less than four months from completion. The superstore chains are contesting Thurrock's decision to grant general use approval for Costco's scheme, rather than classify it for retail use. Thurrock says it believes Costco's business plan sets it apart from conventional retailers, and has secured a legally-binding agreement from Costco that it will not depart from that plan. Warehouse clubs sell goods at bargain prices to members who pay an annual fee. Costco said they do not fit into any existing UK planning category. But Mr John Littman, partner at planning consultants Rapleys, which is advising the three superstore chains, said the clubs must be considered as retailers. 'It is essential that warehouse clubs are subject to the same planning controls as other major retailers if the planning system is to operate consistently and effectively in the public interest,' he said. Since the High Court hearing in June the Department of the Environment has published a planning policy guidance note which says that warehouse clubs should be considered retailers for planning purposes. But Thurrock said yesterday it was 'very happy' with its decision. 'We are quite confident the High Court will support our original judgment, because it was based on very sound reasoning,' the council said. Just how seriously the retailers are taking the matter is demonstrated by their unprecedented decision to launch joint legal action. They have appointed a public relations agency to handle the issue. Mr Paul Moulton, managing director of Costco, said he had 'not been in the UK long enough to judge whether the big three are typically this altruistic in their protection of the planning laws. It seems suspicious to me'.</p>

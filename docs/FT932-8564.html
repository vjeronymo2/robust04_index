			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Devaluation sets scene for higher Madrid Spain's 8 per cent devaluation of the peseta last Thursday provided a spur to equity prices in Madrid last week, while the soaring gold price underpinned the advance seen in Johannesburg. Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of UK and European equity strategy at Goldman Sachs, comments that the peseta devaluation is good news for Spanish equities over the medium term for four reasons: It has allowed interest rates to fall, particularly important because Spain is one of Europe's most interest rate-sensitive markets. Since the peseta has now fallen by more than 20 per cent since last autumn, foreign investors may find the market attractive on the assumption that there is little further currency risk. Furthermore, foreign investors had been deterred by the possibility of a new tax on short term speculative flows which now looks extremely unlikely. The devaluation provides competitive advantage for industry, although the direct benefits to quoted companies are relatively modest because of foreign currency debt. The likely improvement in trade performance will make Spain's recession less deep. Mr Wadhwani believes that the market could rise by at least 7 to 8 per cent, although he cautions that after the initial euphoria, investors might focus again on uncertainty surrounding the forthcoming elections. 'While the ride to rather higher levels could be a bumpy one, it remains our favourite European market on a 12-month view.' Hopes that the bullion price would breach Dollars 370 an ounce supported Johannesburg. One London-based analyst noted strong US and European demand last week for South African gold shares which, he said, remained cheap on yield considerations compared with their North American counterparts. He added that the sector's latest quarterly results had been good and that the outlook for the current quarter was also positive.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                 % change in local currency**     sterling** US Dollars**              1 Week   4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                          1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.87    +1.59    -14.39   +1.99     +0.55         +2.18 Belgium      +1.81    -3.96     +2.10  +10.15     +9.22        +10.98 Denmark      +0.77    +5.32     -8.59  +18.38    +18.37        +20.29 Finland      -4.78    +9.35    +42.10  +41.49    +30.91        +33.04 France       -1.44    -6.28     -6.83   +2.28     +2.89         +4.55 Germany      +1.40    -2.78     -7.39   +7.21     +6.66         +8.39 Ireland      +3.01    -5.02     +9.23  +27.46    +17.28        +19.17 Italy        -0.57    +5.24    +22.35  +26.65    +24.85        +26.86 Netherlands  +0.21    -2.42     +4.54   +9.65     +9.22        +10.99 Norway       +0.81    +3.53     -8.07  +14.72    +14.55        +16.40 Spain        +5.89    +6.02     -0.93  +19.31    +10.16        +11.94 Sweden       +0.86    +6.66    +15.28  +11.84     +6.01         +7.73 Switzerland  +1.03    +1.28    +11.74   +6.59     +5.98         +7.69 UK           +1.81    +1.09     +6.36   +1.43     +1.43         +3.07 EUROPE       +1.11    -0.20     +2.88   +6.02     +5.29         +7.00 Australia    -0.01    -2.45     -3.08   +6.93     +7.45         +9.18 Hong Kong    +3.21    +6.22    +19.01  +28.07    +26.24        +28.28  Japan       -1.54    +1.97    +15.76  +21.14    +34.21        +36.37 Malaysia     +2.79   +10.27    +41.64  +24.29    +24.58        +26.59 New Zealand  -0.35    -0.24     -0.11   +3.90     +8.00         +9.75 Singapore    +4.39    +6.12    +13.70  +15.39    +15.27        +17.14 Canada       +0.52    +4.26     +6.21  +10.28     +8.27        +10.02 USA          -0.60    -2.05     +6.62   +0.81     -0.79         +0.81 Mexico       -2.98    -9.40     -8.72  -10.48    -12.16        -10.73 South Africa +4.61   +12.38     +6.00  +25.00    +27.47        +29.53 WORLD INDEX  -0.32     0.00     +8.15   +8.55    +10.62        +12.41  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 14th 1993.

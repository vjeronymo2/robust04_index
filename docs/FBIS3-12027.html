			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] President Itamar Franco yesterday announced that he  does not intend to prolong the crisis that erupted among the  three branches of government if the Federal Supreme Court (STF)  upholds a petition for an injunction filed by the Union of  Legislative Employees (Sindilegis) against the government.  Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said the government will  comply with any STF ruling on the matter. He noted, however,  that a ruling against the government would undermine the chances  of success of the economic stabilization plan launched by  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso.    Sindilegis filed a petition for an injunction to force the  government to transfer the funds required to cover the 10.94  percent increase obtained by the judicial branch and by Congress  by converting their salaries to URV's [Real Value Units] on the  20th instead on the 30th of each month. The government wants  all salaries to be converted into URV's on the 30th. According  to the spokesman, if the STF does not pass a ruling on the case  by 30 March, the government will reissue Provisional Measure  434, which created the URV and set up guidelines for converting  salaries into URV's.    Franco's major concern now is that an STF ruling in favor of  Sindilegis could encourage other public servants to file similar  petitions demanding a 10.94 percent increase. In this case, the  spokesman said, the government will face serious difficulties  because it would not have sufficient funds to cover these salary  increases. Executive branch employees' salaries are converted  into URV's on the 30th. Ambiguities in Provisional Measure 434  and different interpretations of the law have caused the STF to  follow another formula for converting its salaries into URV's,  thus provoking an impasse.    Congress, the government, and the STF have until 30 March,  when the 30-day period following the issuance of the provisional  measure expires, to reach an agreement to end this  confrontation. For instance, Congress may rule that a  provisional measure establishing that salaries must be converted  into URV'S on the 30th applies not only to the executive branch  but to the legislative and judicial branches as well. This  solution would preclude a re-issuance of the measure by the  executive branch.</p>

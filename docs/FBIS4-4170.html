			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Military conflict  between Cambodian Government troops and Khmer Rouge guerrillas  is spreading from Pailin to Poipet, a senior officer of the  Defense Ministry said here today.    He said that government troops were fighting Khmer Rouge  guerrillas in Poipet, an important Cambodian-thai border town in  the west of Battambang Province, in the past few days. The  Khmer Rouge started an offensive against the government troops  on April 26, he added, but disclosing no details.    A representative of the Khmer Rouge said here yesterday that  after the recapture of Pailin on April 19, their guerrillas have  pushed the fighting toward an area about 30 kilometers from  Battambang.    Broadcasts of Khmer Rouge radio monitored here today also  said that the guerrillas took over the headquarters of the 4th  division of the government troops in Treng, along road No. 10  yesterday morning.    There is no signs of a cease-fire from the two warring  sides,  although all parties have responded positively to the King  Norodom Sihanouk in favor of a roundtable meeting on peace and  national reconciliation, scheduled for May 2-7 in Phnom Penh.</p>

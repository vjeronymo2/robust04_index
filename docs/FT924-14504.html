			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SPECULATIVE buying in anticipation of a cut in UK base rates gave an early boost to derivates, much of which petered out later in the day, writes Joel Kibazo. In Footsie futures, the December contract saw demand mostly from independent traders at the session's opening and the first bargain was struck at 2,560. Further demand in anticipation of positive news on UK interest rates drove December higher and by 10.30am it was trading at the day's high of 2,585. The lack of an announcement on interest rates led to a sharp retreat in the contract and it fell to 2,550, the low point of the day. The early strength of Wall Street proved a stabilising factor and December slowly clawed its way back to end at 2,580, around 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was reasonable at 9,893 lots. Volume in the options reached 32,468 lots with the FT-SE 100 option trading 13,760 lots. Amstrad was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,557 lots dealt. The June 30 calls were the busiest series. This was followed by Barclays at 1,886 lots, and then by Asda, in which 1,508 trades were recorded.</p>

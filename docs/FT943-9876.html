The writs pursue the organisations for breach of contract and/or negligence in respect of advice given to Astra before its acquisition of PRB, the Belgian munitions company, in 1989. There are no sums specified in the writs, which are a holding action designed to beat the six-year statute of limitations after which it is impossible to bring a case. The PRB acquisition cost Astra Pounds 22m, and the writs are likely to seek damages for at least this amount as well as costs and interest. Paine Webber was the merchant bank advising on the PRB acquisition, and Stoy  -Astra's auditors - conducted due diligence. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the writs would be served in the next four months. The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's highest regulatory body, started an investigation in May into the role of Stoy Hayward as Astra's auditor following publication of a Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report. Stoy Hayward said last night it was surprised by the move. It added: 'If the receivers do decide to proceed, it will be most vigorously defended.'</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP;  </P> <P> S. AFRICA'S CONFERENCE OF MANY COLORS;  </P> <P> THE RULING AFRIKANERS ARE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN WITH THEIR LONGTIME ENEMIES OF THE  AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS. EVEN IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE 'TALKS ABOUT TALKS' ARE  ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A LONG AND ROCKY JOURNEY.  </P> <P> On one side is President Frederik W. de Klerk and the seven most powerful men  in South Africa, each of them white and each of them an Afrikaner.  </P> <P> All but one were children when their fathers' generation forced apartheid onto  South Africa, and they grew up in the cradle of white privilege. Now  middle-aged lawyers, professors and businessmen, they say they want to break  with the past and end apartheid.  </P> <P> On the other side, in a rainbow of colors, are 11 leaders of the enemy -- the  African National Congress, the guerrilla movement that has waged war on  Pretoria for 30 years.  </P> <P> Older than De Klerk's men, most are in their 60s or 70s. They include a black  economist, a white Afrikaner pastor, a mixed-race teacher and both black and  white lawyers.  </P> <P> Five have spent half a lifetime in exile in Lusaka, Zambia, vilified by  successive Pretoria governments as terrorists. Three have spent half their  lives in prison here in this city. And three others have spent half their lives  under police surveillance, banning orders and periodic detention inside their  country.  </P> <P> These two warring sides come together Wednesday on the tip of Africa, where the  Afrikaner ancestors of De Klerk's delegation first settled among the indigenous  tribes of Africa three centuries ago.  </P> <P> Their three days of historic talks, coming amid a whirlwind of change in South  Africa, will be the first important test of the chances for peace.  </P> <P> But even if the talks are successful -- and there is no guarantee of that --  they will mark only the beginning of a long, rocky journey to the negotiating  table and, later, an even more jarring trip toward a new constitution.  </P> <P> "What we have at the moment is a compromise -- the ANC and the government are  talking to each other about talking to each other," said Mark Phillips, a  researcher at the Center for Policy Studies in Johannesburg. "But neither side  has met the other's preconditions for talks."  </P> <P> On the table in Cape Town will be the ANC's preconditions for negotiations. It  wants the four-year-old state of emergency lifted, returning exiles indemnified  from prosecution for past crimes and political prisoners freed from South  Africa's jails.  </P> <P> "It's going to be quite a difficult process to keep this thing on the rails,"  said Cheryl Carolus, a Cape Town anti-apartheid activist and one of the ANC  delegates. "There need to be a lot more gestures on the state side."  </P> <P> Also up for discussion is increasing violence in the country and the  government's insistence that the ANC end its armed struggle. The ANC's  guerrilla war has been dormant for months now, and Anglican Archbishop Desmond  M. Tutu has publicly urged its demise.  </P> <P> The ANC has refused, though, until the government agrees to a mutual  cease-fire.  </P> <P> Most political analysts expect the government to meet some of the ANC's demands  in the coming months, if not sooner. The state of emergency, key sections of  which were abandoned by De Klerk in February, could be partially lifted,  analysts say.  </P> <P> And the government may be prepared to begin releasing political prisoners as  well. In recent weeks a few prisoners have been freed early, and restrictions  on those activists still in prison have been eased.  </P> <P> Any progress will depend, though, on getting these two widely divergent groups  of South Africans to see eye-to-eye. And that may hinge on personalities.  </P> <P> De Klerk and ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, the delegation leaders, have  met three times and spoken of their mutual respect. While in prison, Mandela  also met often with Gerrit Viljoen, a retired professor of classics who is  minister of constitutional development, and Hendrick (Kobie) Coetzee, minister  of justice.  </P> <P> But this will be the government's first encounter with ANC exiles such as Thabo  Mbeki, 47, the pipe-smoking head of international affairs. Mbeki, a first among  equals in the ANC's exile headquarters, has charmed hundreds of white South  African visitors to Lusaka with his relaxed, urbane demeanor.  </P> <P> The most controversial members of the teams are likely to be Adriaan Vlok, the  government minister of law and order, and Joe Modise, the commander of the  ANC's military wing. The government's longstanding distaste for communism also  may put it at odds with Joe Slovo, a white lawyer and former ANC military  commander who is general secretary of the South African Communist Party.  </P> <P> Even if the delegations manage to get beyond their immediate differences, a  host of other obstacles to a peaceful future in South Africa lurk just beyond  the meeting room. Among them are:  </P> <P> * The ANC wants a new constitution to be drawn up by a constituent assembly,  elected in a one-person, one-vote election for all races. However, the  government believes that the constitution can be drawn up by "recognized  leaders" in South Africa without a vote.  </P> <P> * Violence in the black townships, which the South African Institute of Race  Relations says is running at the highest level in modern times.  </P> <P> * Internecine warfare has been increasing in Natal province, where supporters  of the ANC are fighting those aligned with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha  Buthelezi.Some anti-apartheid leaders had hoped that Mandela and Buthelezi, who  represents about 2 million Zulus, could resolve their differences and present a  united front in eventual talks with De Klerk. But Buthelezi seems destined to  occupy his own seat in any negotiations with the government.  </P> <P> * The role of the government's nominally independent black homelands. The  rulers of two of the four homelands have been overthrown in recent weeks, and  angry residents want their South African citizenship back.  </P> <P> One of the larger issues is the future of apartheid. The government has  promised to remove or amend most racially discriminatory laws, but dismantling  the system will be a topic for negotiations.  </P> <P> Teams at the Table  </P> <P> When the South African government and the African National Congress meet for  talks on Wednesday, these people will be at the table  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> * President Frederik W. de Klerk.  </P> <P> * Gerrit Vijoen, minister of constitutional development.  </P> <P> * Stoffel van der Merwe, minister of education and development aid.  </P> <P> * Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, minister of foreign affairs.  </P> <P> * Hendrick (Kobie) Coetsee, minister of justice.  </P> <P> * Adriaan Vlok, minister of law and order.  </P> <P> AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS  </P> <P> * Nelson Mandela, ANC deputy president.  </P> <P> * Walter Sisulu, head of ANC Interim Leadership Core.  </P> <P> * Rev. Beyers Naude, patron of the United Democratic Front anti-aparteid  coalition.  </P> <P> * Archie Gumede, co-president of the United Democratic Front.  </P> <P> * Alfred Nzo, ANC secretary-general.  </P> <P> * Thabo Mbeki, ANC director of international affairs.  </P></p>

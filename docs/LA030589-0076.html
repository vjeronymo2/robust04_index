			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN PATIERNO  </P> <P> The obituary of John Patierno (Part I, Feb. 28) contained a major error of fact  which does injustice to the brilliant engineering record established by  Patierno over the past 33 years.  </P> <P> The article leaves the impression that Patierno left behind an ongoing B-2 wing  redesign at the time of his death. That is incorrect. As The Times previously  reported (Oct. 29, 1988), "The effort to redesign the wing started about five  years ago when the Air Force changed its assumptions about how low the bomber  would have to fly, requiring that the plane have a stronger structure, Gen.  Larry D. Welch said in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The Times also noted that Welch said the new wing is both lighter and stronger  and has an even smaller radar visibility than the original design. "It was a  brilliant effort," he added.  </P> <P> That "brilliant effort" was led by, and completed under the direction of, John  Patierno. The results of that effort were built into the first B-2, which  rolled out for the first time last November.  </P> <P> LES DALY  </P> <P> Senior Vice President  </P> <P> Public Affairs  </P> <P> Northrop Corp.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROF. T. BLAISDELL; HELPED PLAN RECOVERY OF POSTWAR EUROPE  </P> <P> Thomas C. Blaisdell Jr., whose half-century of public service and scholarship  included a prominent role in planning the reconstruction of postwar Europe,  died Tuesday. He was 93.  </P> <P> Blaisdell was a distinguished professor of political science at UC Berkeley who  continued teaching long after assuming emeritus status in 1963.  </P> <P> After a long career in public service starting in the New Deal era and  culminating in his leadership in helping plan European recovery after World War  II, Blaisdell joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1951.  </P> <P> Active in publishing and lecturing well into retirement, Blaisdell taught  freshman seminars in political science and international relations as recently  as last year.  </P> <P> Born in 1895 in Pittsburgh, Pa., Blaisdell graduated from Pennsylvania State  College in 1916. He earned a master's degree in social history at Columbia  University in 1922 and his doctorate there in 1932. He taught at Columbia from  1925 to 1932.  </P> <P> In 1933, Blaisdell went to Washington to join Franklin D. Roosevelt's "brain  trust" in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Over the next two  decades, he held a number of federal positions, working first on helping the  nation recover from the Depression and then on European postwar reconstruction.  </P> <P> Blaisdell was assistant secretary of commerce during the Administration of  President Harry S. Truman.  </P> <P> Although he was modest about his role in postwar European recovery, colleagues  have called him one of the principal architects of the Marshall Plan,  proclaimed in 1947 by Secretary of State George C. Marshall.  </P> <P> A widely published author, Blaisdell's best known work was "The American  Presidency in Political Cartoons." Written with Peter Selz, a Berkeley art  history professor, the 1976 book received wide acclaim.  </P> <P> No services have been set.  </P> <P> The family asked that donations be sent to the Fund for Cal in the Capital, the  Young Musicians Program, both at UC Berkeley, or the Harry S. Truman Institute  in Independence, Mo.  </P> <P> Blaisdell is survived by a son, Thomas; a brother, William; two grandchildren  and two great-grandchildren.  </P></p>

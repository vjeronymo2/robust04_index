			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Asia greets Burma human rights abuses with deafening silence: Latest atrocities by the military junta have failed to spur neighbouring countries into action THE INVISIBLE, inaudible 'Asian way' of dealing with human rights abuses in Burma is being severely tested by the latest flood of refugees into neighbouring countries, following a series of army offensives and reported atrocities against ethnic minorities by the Burmese military junta. Worst affected have been the Moslems of Arakan in western Burma. In the past two months about 100,000 of them have fled into Bangladesh with tales of forced labour, torture, rape and killings at the hands of Burmese soldiers. And the exodus is continuing. Yesterday the United Nations World Food Programme said it was granting Dollars 1.9m in emergency supplies to help Bangladesh cope with the influx which it estimated at 1,200 refugees a day. Last week the UN High Commission for Refugees allocated Dollars 1m in emergency funds for the refugees. Bangladesh said yesterday that thousands of the migrants were on the verge of starvation because relief efforts were inadequate. Speaking before the latest UN announcement, one official described food and medical help received so far as 'only a drop in the vast sea of needs'. Other ethnic groups and guerrilla armies on Burma's frontiers have suffered, too, as has the Buddhist majority in whose name the Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) claims to be fighting. Most Asian governments have greeted the actions of the Slorc junta - which is detaining Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and refuses to give way to the government-in-waiting elected in 1990 - with a deafening silence. Amid the growing international outcry over events in Burma, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, took pains to defend the regional policy of 'constructive engagement' with Burma during the summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) at the end of last month. Mr Goh urged his audience of journalists to understand the 'culture of Asean', which, he explained, involved private discussions rather than European-style public efforts to change the world. 'We do not interfere,' he said. 'We just have our bilateral contacts.' Human-rights activists complain that those contacts include selling arms to Burma and stripping the country of natural resources such as gems, teak and fish, while ignoring the plight of the Burmese. Western companies have also been criticised for dealing with Burma, esp-ecially in oil exploration, but western governments have roundly condemned the Burmese authorities. A loose alliance of Burmese opposition groups based in the beleaguered town of Manerplaw on the Thai border is now hoping to persuade Asian governments that they need to take a firm line against Burma in the interests of regional security, however unmoved they may be by human rights abuses. Bangladesh has appealed for international help in handling the refugees. At least one Bangladeshi soldier has been killed by Burmese troops. Thailand - another destination for refugees - has already seen confrontations this year between its border patrols and the Burmese army. The Thai press has criticised both the Burmese and Thai governments over human rights in Burma, and Thai Prime Minister Anand Panyarachun said bluntly last month: 'I don't like what's happening in Burma.' A small number of refugees have also fled to Nagaland State in India, whose government has been one of the few in Asia to take a strong moral stand against the actions of the Burmese authorities. Burma's opposition will nevertheless find it difficult to persuade Asia to isolate the junta. China, Burma's principal arms supplier, appears to be unimpressed by the pleas of the Burmese people. Thailand is ambivalent. The foreign ministry is sensitive to western criticism on the issue of Burma and the government as a whole is anxious to keep the country's borders secure, but the military is notorious for its profitable part in stripping Burma of its teak trees. Burmese rebel groups, however, believe that the Thais are reluctant to allow the Burmese army to overrun Manerplaw, which is controlled by the Karen National Union with the assistance of monks, students and politicians from Rangoon. Opponents of the junta want the UN to take a much stronger line on Burma (so far there has been only a mild resolution passed by consensus in the General Assembly), even if they recognise that the UN is unlikely to recognise the Manerplaw-based elected government. They also want economic sanctions imposed on Burma, and in this area they believe that western countries are no less guilty than Burma's silent Asian neighbours and Japan. 'Without economic sanctions, the Slorc can get cash to buy arms,' says Mr Hla Phay, spokesman in Bangkok for the National League for Democracy, the party which won the Burmese elections but which was excluded from power. Asian and western governments, however, doubt the effectiveness of sanctions. As Mr Anand said: 'Burma is not now ready to listen to anybody.'</p>

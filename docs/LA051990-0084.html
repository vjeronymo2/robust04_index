			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABBOTT MAKES MOST OF HIS SECOND CHANCE;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: TWO DAYS AFTER LOSING IN MILWAUKEE, ANGEL PITCHER BEATS BLUE JAYS  AFTER FINLEY FALLS ON WET STREET.  </P> <P> One small misstep by Chuck Finley gave Jim Abbott an opportunity to take a  giant step toward redemption.  </P> <P> Finley's fall on a wet street in Toronto Friday left the Angels' scheduled  starter with a sprained right ankle and Manager Doug Rader and pitching coach  Marcel Lachemann with three possible substitutes. Abbott had started Wednesday  but threw only 47 pitches in 1 1/3 innings before exiting, little enough work  to make him a stronger candidate than Willie Fraser or Scott Bailes and big  enough an embarrassment to make him embrace an unexpected second chance.  </P> <P> "Lach came up and said to me, 'We might have to have you in the pen,' but I  said, 'I can start if you need me,' " said Abbott, who had seen Finley fall but  didn't know the extent of the mishap. "He mulled it over and said, 'Go ahead.'  "  </P> <P> Once out there, Abbott never looked back. He pitched 6 2/3 innings, striking  out a season-high five and earning a 4-2 victory before a sellout crowd of  49,339 at the SkyDome.  </P> <P> "You hate to see anybody get hurt, and I'm glad it's not serious, but for me,  I'd have had to think about (Wednesday's loss) until my next start," said  Abbott, who won for the first time since May 1 and improved to 2-3. "Coming  back from such a bad game, maybe this was a blessing in disguise.  </P> <P> "I just tried to go out with a little more specific game plan, to get strike  one, and if I didn't get it, to fight for it on the next pitch. When I walked  the lead-off guy, I thought maybe for a little bit, 'Here we go again,' but  that's what I have to battle and not let that throw my concentration off and  just throw strikes."  </P> <P> After such a poor performance, he said, "I had nothing to lose." His teammates  were determined that he would not lose, rewarding him with strong support that  resulted in the Angels' third victory in their past nine games.  </P> <P> Donnie Hill doubled and scored during the Angels' three-run third inning and  hit a home run in the fourth off Dave Stieb (5-2). It was Hill's first home run  since Aug. 28, 1988, when he was with the Chicago White Sox. He played  flawlessly at second base and was involved in four double plays turned by the  Angels.  </P> <P> "The way Abbie pitched was really a boost," Hill said. "Abbie threw great. He  moved the ball in and out and had a lot of movement on his fastball. It seemed  like every time he needed a ground ball, he got it."  </P> <P> The Blue Jays, who have lost four consecutive games and have fallen 2 1/2 games  behind the AL East-leading Brewers, scored in the seventh inning on a two-run  home run by catcher Pat Borders. Toronto recorded only two fly-ball outs  against Abbott and three against sinkerball specialist Mark Eichhorn, who  gained as much satisfaction from saving the game for Abbott as he did in  defeating his former Toronto teammates.  </P> <P> "He threw great and I was going to do my best to preserve this one," said  Eichhorn, who was credited with his sixth save in seven opportunities. "I was  pretty anxious when I went out there. I wanted to keep the ball on the ground  because they've got so much power. Make one mistake and they'll take you out of  the ballpark."  </P> <P> A misstep took Finley out of Friday's game. But Abbott took a huge step forward  in regaining lost confidence. "When a starter gets knocked out early, he can  brood because he's got to wait to get back out there, but a reliever might get  a chance the next day," Lachemann said. "In that sense, it did work out good.  We're not tickled about what happened, and we're glad Chuck's injury isn't  serious, but it may all work out for the best."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Chuck Finley, who suffered a sprained right ankle when he fell on a  rain-slickened step Friday, was told to rest for several days. X-rays showed no  serious damage and the swelling subsided by Friday night. The Angels probably  will recall a pitcher from triple-A Edmonton if Finley doesn't recover by his  next scheduled start Wednesday, and if Friday's start takes a toll on Jim  Abbott.  </P> <P> "It started raining real hard and we were dodging under the overhang," said  Finley, who, as a left-hander strides onto his right foot during his delivery.  "We went down three steps and the last was maybe a half-step. I was going along  and the next thing I know, I'm on my back and I see skyscrapers and white teeth  in Bert Blyleven's ugly old face."  </P> <P> Finley has sprained the ankle twice before in similar circumstances.  </P> <P> Kent Anderson's third-inning ground out produced his first RBI of the season.  It scored Donnie Hill, who had doubled and taken third on a fielding error by  left fielder George Bell. . . . Kirk McCaskill and his wife, Dana, became  parents of their first child Thursday when 10-pound, 9-ounce Riley Nicholas was  born at 6 p.m. Mother, father and son are doing well. "He came out a kid, not a  baby," said McCaskill, who remained in California for the birth and rejoined  the club Friday.  </P> <P> McCaskill is scheduled to pitch today after missing a turn because of stiffness  in his right elbow. . . . Dante Bichette wasn't in the lineup Friday, only the  second game he didn't start. "Dante needs a rest. He's been out there virtually  the whole season," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's going to be very difficult  juggling people around. Dante has the ability to be an everyday player. Whether  he will be in literally every day, play 150, 155 games, remains to be seen."  Only Chili Davis and Wally Joyner have started every game.  </P> <P> Dave Winfield singled in his starting debut and made one unofficial error. "In  the hotel I called the bellboy and said, 'This is Dave Winfield of the New York  Yankees,' and he said, 'What?' " Winfield said. "I said, 'Oh, the California  Angels.' I have to get used to that."  </P> <P> Shortstop Dick Schofield (strained hamstring since March 27) jogged at  half-speed in California for the first time. . . . Bob McClure (sore left  elbow) hasn't improved since throwing last Sunday and will be examined when the  Angels return home.  </P></p>

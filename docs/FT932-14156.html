			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Singapore hits another record high BUYING from government-managed public funds and arbitrageurs failed to offset the day's losses entirely, as the yen's appreciation against the dollar prompted profit-taking and kept investors cautious, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average of 225 issues lost 185.52 at 20,112.34, after trading between a session low of 19,890.47 and an opening high of 20,254.09. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 11.53 to 1,553.57, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.76 to 1,215.80. Volume on the first section languished at an estimated 370m shares, down from Friday's 561m, and declines led rises by 771 to 268. Investors held the sidelines before the Bank of Japan intervened to stabilise the yen's rise beyond Y111 to the dollar. Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, mentioned a stronger yen as one strategy to cut Japan's trade surplus, following a meeting on Friday with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington. In spite of the session's low turnover, Mr Isao Takahashi, senior manager of equity trading at James Capel Pacific, predicted that more institutional investors will enter the stock market in the short term since the 20,000 level served as a firm support to this session and because some market participants had missed out on last week's rally. He added, however, that the Nikkei's upside is limited to around the 21,500 mark due to a lack of fundamental incentives. The strengthening of the yen pressured exporting issues. Sony weakened Y90 to Y4,770 and TDK, the world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tapes, fell Y90 to Y3,980. Sumitomo Metal and Mining, the most active stock for the third consecutive trading session, climbed Y30 to Y980 as gold and platinum prices maintained high levels. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 174.76 to 21,810.07 in volume of 20.3m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets moved in widely divergent directions. SINGAPORE continued its record run, closing at a fourth consecutive all-time high, although some profit-taking was evident during the afternoon. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 8.67 to 1,772.02, supported by institutional and retail buying, in volume of 403.4m shares. Prices peaked at an intraday record of 1,781.39. SEOUL closed at its highest level for 20 months after individual investors actively bought financial shares in the wake of recently lowered interest rates. The composite index added 13.46 at 725.76. Turnover came to Won880bn, after Won471.6bn in Saturday's half-day session. The market sustained a firm note established early in the session with buying of high-technology related shares. The buying spree then spread to the financial sector as steelmakers and carmakers took a rest from recent steep rises. KARACHI, by contrast, dived to its lowest level since November 1991 after President Ghulam Ishaq Khan sacked the reformist Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The 100-share index lost 36.98 to 1,069.79. Mr Daniel Smaller, head of emerging markets at Lehman Brothers in London, said the market had fallen about 7 per cent over the last month as political worries grew. Mr Muddassar Malik, director of BMA Capital Management in Karachi, added that, while political uncertainty was likely to continue for the next couple of months, economic fundamentals remained strong with no shift in direction expected from a new administration. HONG KONG saw profit-taking among bank shares. The Hang Seng index lost 17.0 at 6,680.15, after rising to 6,709.38. Turnover fell to HKDollars 4.0bn from HKDollars 4.53bn as investors became cautious ahead of the Sino-British talks on the colony's future, which begin on Thursday. AUSTRALIA eased as investors took profits, the All Ordinaries index closing 6.8 off at 1,696.4 in turnover of ADollars 221.4m. Broker JB Were commented that falling bond yields and a cut in corporation tax, which has added some 7 per cent to eps expectations for 1993/94, have contributed to the 8.6 per cent rise in the index over the last quarter. KUALA LUMPUR's inexorable advance continued, the composite index gaining 2.93 at 664.95, after reaching 665.48. Some analysts maintained that the market would consolidate this week after strong gains over the previous fortnight. Turnover remained very high, at MDollars 1.4bn. TAIWAN recouped some of last week's losses on bargain hunting but some brokers said investors remained unsettled because of the possibility of the US imposing trade sanctions in the near future. The weighted index rose 86.40 to 4,577.48 in TDollars 33.5bn turnover. BOMBAY turned lower in thin trading and the BSE index shed 38.63 to 2,261.15.</p>

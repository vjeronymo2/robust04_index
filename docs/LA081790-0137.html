			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIRAL INFECTION HOSPITALIZES MAYOR SHERIDAN  </P> <P> Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan was hospitalized this week after she complained of  severe headaches.  </P> <P> Sheridan's doctor said she is suffering from a viral infection and dehydration,  City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Thursday.  </P> <P> Sheridan, who was admitted Wednesday to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, is  being given sedatives and heavy doses of antibiotics, he said. She is scheduled  to undergo more tests today to determine the cause of her headaches. Sheridan  is expected to remain in the hospital through the weekend, Brady said.  </P> <P> Sheridan, 55, said Thursday from the hospital that she had been feeling ill  Tuesday but attended the City Council meeting anyway. The next morning,  Sheridan said, she awoke with a severe headache and called her doctor, who  later admitted her to the hospital.  </P> <P> Her hospitalization forced her to miss a fund-raising reception Wednesday for  the Irvine Barclay Theatre, a joint city-university theater nearly completed on  the UC Irvine campus.  </P> <P> Her doctor has not provided a release date from the hospital, but Sheridan said  she hopes it will be soon.  </P> <P> "I have a lot of stuff to do," she said.  </P></p>

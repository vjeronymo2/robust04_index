			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "London Exchange Lures Chinese Firms"] </F>   [Text] The London Stock Exchange yesterday wooed Chinese  firms in a bid to participate in the country's economic boom.    The exchange held a seminar in Beijing, at which it  introduced itself to Chinese business leaders and explained how  firms can list their shares on the London market.    The seminar attracted officials from some large firms,  securities companies and banks.    The exchange showed its commitment to working with the  Chinese by sending Nigel Atkinson, head of listings, to the  conference. This followed the March visit to Beijing by the  chairman of the exchange.    The British delegation, which arrived last Saturday, had a  series of detailed discussions with Chinese securities  authorities. Atkinson described the talks as very constructive.    "It is still in an early stage, but I believe the  willingness  on both sides will take the talks forward," he said.    The discussions were aimed at briefing Chinese authorities  on  the regulatory requirements of the exchange, he said. The  London group will also find out if Chinese firms have any  special requirements, he added.    "We are conscious of the special requirements in Hong Kong,"  Atkinson said. "We need to make a study as to whether we need to  do something similar in London."    He added that his side wants a formal agreement signed to  ensure the Chinese understand stock exchange rules.    And the China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected  to  come up with a formal memorandum.    Atkinson said the number of Chinese firms seeking overseas  listing will group rapidly in the coming years.    "We feel it is very important for London to respond to the  need as an international stock market," he said. A number of  Chinese companies have already expressed interest in listing  shares in London, he said.    But before they formally apply to London, they need approval  from Chinese authorities.    "We are waiting for our turn," he said. "We hope it will be  soon and the capital market in London is very keen to  participate in Chinese is sues."    The central government has selected 22 domestic firms for  possible overseas listing this year. Most of them will be  listed in Hong Kong with some in New York or London.    Atkinson said Chinese firms which will arouse international  investors attention have substantial growth potential.    And they will need good long-term prospects, he said.    If Chinese firms want to list their shares in London, the  first thing to do is to appoint a sponsor familiar with that  market, he said.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Observer: Dog bites hack John Drummond left his dog Jamie, a spaniel, tied up outside the Halifax Building Society in Kensington yesterday. On his return he found Jamie being interviewed by a three-man camera crew from the US network, CNN. The hacks explained they were quizzing the hound on its views on the Euro-elections because they could not find any humans with opinions. Jamie 'was very tight-lipped', says Drummond. And lest you doubt this tale, Jamie's master is head of Integrity Works, an ethics consultancy, so he can be counted on not to tell fibs.</p>

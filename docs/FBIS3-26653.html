The standing committee  of the provincial party committee has attached great importance  to this conference and in particular has heard and studied  reports presented to it. At the conference, Comrade Keming  delivered a work report in which he reviewed and summed up  Jiangsu's work in discipline inspection and supervision in 1993  and laid down arrangements for the work to fight corruption and  promote honest practices for 1994, with which I agree  completely. Now, I would like to state some opinions based on  discussions by the standing committee of the provincial party  committee.  <H3>  I. Conscientiously Review Experience in Discipline  Inspection and Supervision in 1993 and Correctly Analyze the  Current Situation of the Anticorruption Struggle. </H3>   Jiangsu maintained sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  growth last year; the general situation was good. Jiangsu also  intensified discipline inspection and supervision and has in  particular done a great deal of work to achieve periodic results  in promoting the anticorruption struggle. This has produced a  positive influence on reform, development, and stability and  made new contributions to the overall work of the province. On  behalf of the provincial party committee and government, I  hereby extend my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to the  broad masses of discipline inspection and supervisory workers  throughout the province and my warm congratulations to advanced  discipline inspection and supervisory organs and outstanding  discipline inspection and supervisory cadres commended by the  provincial party committee and government.    Since the beginning of 1993, party committees and  governments  at various levels throughout the province have followed the  arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial  party committee to earnestly intensify discipline inspection and  supervision and promote improvements in party work style and  building clean government while proceeding with economic  construction, reform, and opening up. Particularly since late  August, they have firmly implemented the CPC Central Committee  and State Council decision concerning the anticorruption  struggle in the near future and the guidelines of the Second  Plenary Session of the Commission for Discipline Inspection  under the CPC Central Committee. They have made timely  mobilization and arrangements to earnestly strengthen their  guidance. Meanwhile, discipline inspection and supervisory  organs as well as political and legal departments at various  levels have conscientiously exercised their duties and actively  launched efforts to ensure sound and orderly progress in the  anticorruption struggle. According to the requirements of the  CPC Central Committee and the provincial party committee,  leading party and government cadres at and above the county  (department) level have conscientiously initiated  self-inspection and self- correction and have generally enhanced  the consciousness of observing clean standards and  self-discipline. Overcoming obstruction and resistance,  discipline inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs have  concentrated their efforts in emphatically investigating and  handling a number of major cases as well as punishing a group of  corrupt people. In the meantime, all businesses and enterprises  run by party and government organs were screened throughout the  province; all unwarranted charges were screened and rectified;  all overseas tours at the public expense were also screened and  rectified at the request of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council. Proceeding from actual situations, many  localities and departments took effective measures to settle  problems that the people strongly resented. Through unified  anticorruption struggle, party and government cadres at various  levels have become more aware of the importance of the  anticorruption struggle and have enhanced their consciousness of  the principle of promoting material civilization and socialist  ethics at the same time; thus the trend of spreading negative  and corrupt phenomena were effectively checked, party work style  and general practice in society were improved, and remarkable  achievements were made, at this phase, in the three tasks of the  anticorruption struggle in the near term.    However, we should soberly realize that the achievements  scored in the anticorruption struggle are only preliminary and  are far from sufficient compared with the people's expectations  and the demands of the CPC Central Committee and the provincial  party committee. Progress and achievements in work among  various areas and departments are not balanced. Some areas and  departments failed to strictly enforce discipline and were slack  in dealing with corruption cases. We still need to consolidate  our achievements in the anticorruption struggle. Under this  circumstance, if we are a little slack in our ideology and work,  corruption will repeatedly recur. As the situation develops and  reform deepens, we will encounter many new situations and  problems which we will need to study and solve. Anticorruption  and promoting a clean administration are very heavy and  formidable tasks. We must not overestimate our achievements;  still less should we be satisfied with the accomplishments of  the former stage of the anticorruption struggle. We must remain  sober-minded and further deepen the anticorruption struggle.  <H3>  II. Further Define the Guiding Ideology for Discipline  Inspection and Supervision Work To Give It Full Play </H3>   To comprehensively carry out the party's basic line and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress, seize opportunity,  deepen reform, open up wider to the outside world, quicken the  pace of building a socialist market economic structure, and  strive for greater victories in the cause of socialism with  Chinese characteristics are great historical tasks faced by the  whole party. According to the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the actual  situation in our province, the Seventh (Enlarged) Plenary  Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC Committee further defined  the goal and ways of thinking for future reform, opening up, and  economic development in Jiangsu. According to the tasks set by  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, our  province must attain two major goals by the end of this century:  First, within five years, we should establish a basic framework  for the socialist market economic structure; second, on the  basis of our doubling our gross provincial product [GPP] ahead  of schedule in 1993 for the second time, we should double our  GPP again by the end of this century. In this way we will lift  Jiangsu's economy to a new level, and the people in our province  will be able to lead a fairly comfortable life sooner. The new  situation and tasks set new, higher demands for discipline  inspection and supervision work. Party committees, governments,  discipline inspection, and supervision organs at all levels must  further define the guiding ideology for discipline inspection  and supervision to unswervingly serve reform and opening up,  economic construction, and social stability.    It is necessary to actively explore new thinking and new  approaches to strengthen work related to discipline inspection  and supervision under the new situation of economic development  and socialist market economy; put forward new demands on modes  of thinking and the code of ethics of party members and cadres;  and continue to promote building party style and clean  government in a bid to create a better social and political  environment. It is only under an environment characterized by  political and social stability and with a fine work style that  we will be able to steadily promote reform; achieve sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development, and enable our people  to live and work in peace and contentment. As workers involved  in discipline inspection and supervision, we have an important  duty to create such an environment. We should view problems  from a lofty, overall perspective to secure a better  understanding of the importance of discipline inspection and  supervision and thus a more definite guiding thought.    To meet overall demands this year, personnel involved in  discipline inspection and supervision should intensify  supervision and inspection related to implementation of party  line, principles, policies, major party and government policy  decisions, and important state laws to uphold the authority of  the party Central Committee and to ensure smooth enforcement of  government decrees. This year will be a crucial year for the  establishment of a socialist market economic system, and  momentum to be gathered and measures to be taken in reform will  be unprecedented. Work related to discipline inspection and  supervision should unfold according to guidelines set by both  the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth Provincial CPC  Committee. We should tighten party and government discipline;  firmly reject noncompliance with decrees and prohibitions,  selfish departmentalism, decentralism, and local protectionism;  check the unhealthy tendency of going against the party's  democratic centralism; and strictly investigate and punish  various erroneous actions interfering with and impeding the  implementation and enforcement of party line, principles,  policies, and major reform measures, so as to guarantee  successful reform and healthy economic development. Building  party style and clean government and the struggle against  corruption should be carried out in such a way that the  provincial party committee's major missions for this year will  be accomplished and a successful reform and construction  guaranteed.    Party committees and governments at all levels should  strengthen leadership over work related to discipline inspection  and supervision by taking the job as an important part of our  overall mission. We should put forward demands and arrange work  assignments regularly and support discipline inspection and  supervision organs in carrying out their duties, particularly in  investigating and punishing major cases, conducting special  operations, and rectifying unhealthy practices. In addition, we  should pay attention to personnel training in discipline  inspection and supervision organs and help them solve practical  problems, including improvement of working and living conditions.  <H3>  III Continue Fighting Corruption; Further Improve  Party Style Regarding concrete tasks to be carried out  in Jiangsu this year in fighting corruption and building party  style and clean government, on which Comrade Keming has already  made wide-ranging arrangements, I would like to emphasize three  points. </H3>   1. It is necessary to enhance understanding on  anticorruption  through proper study. Practice in many localities and units on  fighting corruption and promoting clean government has proved  that firmness in attacking corruption lies in understanding,  particularly among the leading cadres. When understanding is  enhanced, firm action will follow. In the meantime, we should  organize leading cadres and cadres involved in discipline  inspection and supervision at various levels to continue their  conscientious study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping" and use his expositions on correcting party style,  promoting clean government, and fighting corruption to further  unify thinking and enhance understanding. These are  prerequisites to deepening the anticorruption drive.    It should be well understood that the principle of "being  firm in attending to both material progress and cultural and  ideological progress" serves as an important part of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The deeper reform and opening up goes, the  faster the pace of establishing a socialist market economic  system, the more the economy is advancing, the more we need to  fight corruption and strengthen party style and clean  government. We should sum up struggles against corruption  launched earlier and through such review further enhance the  understanding of leading cadres at various levels on the great  importance of fighting corruption. Party schools at various  levels should make honest government and the anticorruption  struggle a basic subject to be taught on a long-term basis. In  this respect, discipline inspection and supervision organs may  compile teaching materials in cooperation with other relevant  departments. Through rotational cadre training programs and  regular education we should be able to continuously strengthen  the resistance of party members and cadres to various negative  influences, prompting them to voluntarily wage struggle against  corrupt phenomena.    2. To meet the requirements of the Central Committee and the  provincial party committee, we should properly implement the  three tasks set for fighting corruption. As far as the  anticorruption campaign and promoting party style and clean  government are concerned, the party Central Committee and the  State Council have clear provisions -- from guiding thoughts,  policies, and principles to missions -- with emphasis on doing  three tasks well in the near future. In this regard, proper  arrangements were made by the work meeting and the Seventh  (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Eighth Provincial CPC  Committee held last year. Party committees at all levels should  further strengthen leadership. Party and government leaders  should assume personal responsibility to accomplish missions set  by the Central Committee and the provincial party committee;  consolidate and broaden periodic results; and persist in pushing  ahead building party style and clean government and in fighting  corruption. First, we must make sure that party and government  leaders at various levels are honest and self-disciplined.  Leading cadres at various levels, particularly party and  government leaders at the county (department) level and above,  should strictly implement relevant stipulations of the Central  Committee and the provincial party committee by setting a good  leadership example in practicing honesty and self-discipline.  Honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres is a  self-motivated action based on firm party spirit. In the course  of developing a socialist market economy, leading cadres at  various levels should firmly bear in mind the party's  objectives, namely performing their official duties honestly and  working hard for the benefit of the people. We must see to it  that, at any time and under any circumstances, we must be able  to clearly differentiate and separate right from wrong and  public from private, perpetuate the purity and progressiveness  of the Communists, and regulate our conduct with strict party  discipline and state policies and laws. Second, we should step  up investigations of major cases and punishment of corrupt  elements by adhering to the well-defined guidelines set by the  central authorities that emphasize concentration, firmness, and  seriousness. Party and government leaders at various levels  should resolutely support discipline inspection, supervision,  and procuratorial and judicial departments in handling cases  according to law and discipline, lending them a helping hand in  resisting interference and obstruction. In the meantime, good  knowledge of the limits of policy is essential, and all  investigations should base on facts and laws to ensure fairness.  Investigation results of major cases bearing on public  interests should be selectively publicized to motivate the  people and educate the cadres and the masses.    Third, we should continue to tackle some special problems  in our efforts to correct unhealthy practices. Tackling special  problems is important work in the anticorruption struggle, so we  must carry it out step by step and in a planned way. At the  present time we should focus on achieving success in tackling  special problems. We should pay attention to improving the  party's workstyle and promoting honesty in performing official  duties and to consolidating our achieved results. While  tackling the above-mentioned problems, we should also make  efforts to investigate problems which have evoked strong  repercussions among the masses and propose plans to solve those  problems in the spirit of seeking truth from facts in light of  the actual situation in various localities and departments. If  we can persist in tackling those problems, we will certainly be  able to achieve continuous and new successes.    3. We should attach importance to improving the party's work  style and being honest in performing official duties during the  festival period. The Spring Festival will arrive soon. Whether  we spend a happy, clean, and honest festival will be a practical  measure of the results of our anticorruption struggle during the  earlier period. It will also be a practical matter of whether we  can win the people's confidence. Various localities and  departments must firmly implement the guidelines of the  "circular on strictly forbidding the use of public funds for  feasting, buying gifts or indulging in extravagance during the  New Year and Spring Festival period in 1994" issued by the  general offices of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council and the opinions of the general offices of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government on  implementing the circular's guidelines. We should simplify  meetings. Meetings which can be canceled must be resolutely  canceled, and meetings which are necessary should be conducted  in a frugal manner. We should strictly control various  celebration and commendation activities and vigorously advocate  civilized, thrifty, and simple customs. Various localities must  firmly cease doing all things clearly forbidden in the Central  Committee circular. We should pay particular attention to  stopping the practice of using public funds to eat and drink  without restraint, buy gifts, to wantonly distribute procurement  and gift coupons. Leading cadres at various levels, especially  leading groups at the provincial level, should take the lead in  setting good examples and be responsible for improving units  under their jurisdiction. They should do a good job in  improving the party's work style and ensuring honesty in their  respective localities and departments. Party organizations and  discipline inspection and supervision organizations at all  levels should strengthen inspection and supervision and promptly  stop and correct phenomena that violate regulations. They  should criticize and educate units that violate regulations and  deal strictly with cases of serious violation of regulations.  We should consolidate the results of the anticorruption  struggle by doing a good job in improving the party's workstyle  and promoting honesty during the festival period.    It is hoped that in the new year the broad masses of cadres  belonging to discipline inspection and supervision organizations  and judicial departments at various levels in the province will  stive to improve themselves, further heighten their spirit, work  in a solid manner, improve the party's work style, promote  honesty in performing official duties, unfold the anticorruption  struggle, and make new contributions to ensuring the successful  accomplishment of the goals of reform and development in this  province!</p>

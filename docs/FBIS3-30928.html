			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zoran Pirolic] </F>   [Text] The negotiating process, which in recent days more  or less progressed visibly within Sarajevo and outside it,  simultaneous with NATO threats that it would bomb the Serb  positions around the capital, culminated in a result whose true  form, significance, and consequences still remain to be seen.    General Michael Rose, commander of the UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who presided over the negotiations between  the representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the  aggressor, Serbian side, this afternoon said that this was a  very small step in solving a very great problem. According to  his words, the agreement has three basic points.    [Begin Rose recording in English] ....that there should be  an immediate cease-fire in and around the city.... [end Rose  recording]    [Words indistinct] and that there will no more attacks on  the  city or from within the city; second, that the UN peace forces  would be posted at all key and sensitive locations outside of  the city; third, that all heavy weaponry would be placed under  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] control; and fourth, that a joint  commission would be formed to oversee this task. The joint  commission would be headed by French General Andre (Subirou),  commander of the UNPROFOR sector in Sarajevo. A series of  details, and the establishment of locations for posting the Blue  Helmets, will still have to be agreed, said General Rose.  According to him, this might be the beginning of a  normalization of life for Sarajevo citizens. The British  general said that the cease-fire would go into effect at 1200  [1100 GMT] tomorrow [10 February], and that Brigadier General  (Subirou) would deploy his troops as soon as possible. Asked to  state the difference between today's and earlier agreements that  were violated practically at the moment they were signed,  General Rose said that the difference was that this time  Karadzic's Serb army was ready to withdraw its heavy weaponry  and to place it under the efficient control of the peace forces.  This can be a result of the changed strategic circumstances in  which they have found themselves, added the British general.    There were no conflicts regarding the definition of heavy  weaponry, and Sir Michael Rose maintains that all weapons whose  caliber exceeds 12.7-mm will be placed under control. The other  question that could prove to be controversial, and that the  aggressor's side will try to manipulate, is the distance to  which the heavy weaponry should be withdrawn. General Rose  believes that this issue is not of paramount importance, and  that if a distance of some 30 km around Sarajevo is agreed upon,  there are bound to be areas that are not appropriate for placing  heavy artillery. UNPROFOR will work on placing this weaponry  under as tight control as possible. This, of course, also  includes the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's heavy artillery.    There is no minimal distance from the city if the heavy  artillery is under our control, said General Rose. No  signatures were put on the agreement reached at Sarajevo  airport, yet the Brit does not deem this to be a particularly  significant detail. He said that the negotiations between the  representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Serbian  side continued and that they concerned a series of details  connected to the agreement. The Brit said that he had met with  President Izetbegovic today around noon, and that the president  of the Presidency of our country asked for clarifications on  three or four points, after which he authorized the military  representatives of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to come to the  airport and agree to the agreement.    In response to a question pertaining to the possibility of  air strikes against the Serb artillery if the agreement is not  observed, General Rose said:    I will keep my thoughts to myself, and leave the decision to  General Jean Cot and Mr. Yasushi Akashi. He was optimistic when  he added that everyone was now facing a complete change, but we  have heard these words, in one form or another, from other  commanders of the peace forces in Bosnia.</p>

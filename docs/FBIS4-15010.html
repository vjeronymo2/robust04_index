			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Search for Way to Rapprochement"; </F> followed by text of Draft Confederative Agreement submitted by  Sergey Shakhray, leader of Party of Russian Unity and Accord]    [Text] The proposals which Nursultan Nazarbayev advanced  recently on a search for new forms of integration of independent  states and on the creation of the Eurasian Union attracted the  wide attention of various political forces and elicited  ambivalent comments.    Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord [PRUA] and Russian Federation minister of nationalities  affairs and regional policy, in turn issued a statement in  support of the idea of a confederative union of Eurasian states  and passed to the editorial office the draft Confederative  Agreement which he advanced in 1992, which was announced in  the PRUA election platform, and which is published below. The  party's statement says, in particular, that "not only the  peoples but also many political forces in the CIS countries are  already prepared not just to discuss the idea of creating such a  union but also to work out specific questions of its activity."    We advance, the PRUA declares, the idea of forming an  International Working Group comprising representatives of  countries which wish to conclude the Confederative Agreement or  of political and public organizations which share this desire.  We are also prepared to take on the resolution of  organizational-technical and financial questions relating to  ensuring this group's activity.    The draft Confederative Agreement, the statement reads,  should be regarded as a conceptual base for a future interstate  treaty. The simultaneous elaboration of a package of necessary  treaties and agreements directly associated with the idea of a  Eurasian confederation is proposed.    (Draft) Confederative Agreement    The Russian Federation,    acknowledging the historical significance and  effectiveness of the interstate relations achieved within the  framework of the CIS,    striving, in the name of the interests of the peoples of  the High Contracting Parties, for further integration and  effective cooperation on economic, sociocultural, and defense  questions,    confirming that none of the provisions of this agreement  is directed or can be interpreted to the detriment of the CIS or  of the treaty relations and other relations of each of the  contracting parties among themselves or with other states, and  preserving the independence and the inviolable sovereign rights  of the states that are party to the agreement, have [as  published] agreed on the following.    I: The High Contracting Parties conclude the Confederative  Agreement, whose contents and the ways to implement which are  defined by this document and by treaties signed on its basis.    II: The High Contracting Parties have agreed to the creation  of the Confederative Economic Community (CEC) as the  basis of the Confederative Agreement.    The CEC ensures:    the revival and development of a common market of the  Confederative Agreement member countries as a single economic  area without customs borders and not hindering free cooperation  among business subjects or the circulation of commodities,  services, and capital within the Community,    the creation of a common currency system and banking  system based on the preservation of the national currencies of  these states and on agreed principles of credit and monetary  regulation,    the implementation of a concerted customs and  export-import policy in respect of states which are not parties  to the Confederative Agreement,    the creation of the Eurasian Investment Bank to  fund programs and projects aimed at the economic development of  the countries that are party to the Confederative Agreement,    the phased standardization of the civil-law and financial  legislation of the states which have concluded the Confederative  Agreement.    To carry out the tasks facing the CEC, the CEC  Governmental Committee is formed and is empowered to adopt  decisions on questions of the implementation of a common  economic policy in accordance with the provisions of this  agreement.    The terms and procedure for the activity of the CEC and its  organs are established by the Economic Treaty  concluded on the basis of this agreement.    III: The High Contracting Parties have agreed to the  creation  of the Defense Union, which is based on the national  armies of the states that are party to the agreement and on the  Joint Armed Forces and Joint Military Command of the  countries that have concluded the Confederative Agreement.    IV: The High Contracting Parties have agreed on unity of  action on the main questions of social policy, education,  science, health care, and culture.    The parties pledge to abide by common social insurance and  pension provision regulations.    V: To resolve common questions of the countries that are  party to the Confederative Agreement, the High Contracting  Parties create on parity principles the General Political  Council and also the Security Council, which  operate in accordance with the principle of unanimity.    The structure, the operating procedure, and the budget of  the  organs are determined by the General Political Council in  accordance with this agreement.    VI: The High Contracting Parties have agreed to create the  Court of the Confederative Union. The court has in  its jurisdiction all questions that arise in connection with the  application of this agreement and the accords concluded on its  basis.    The court is formed and resolves cases in accordance with  the  Statute on the Court adopted by the General Political Council  and to be approved by the legislative organs of the countries  that are party to the Confederative Agreement. The  Institute of Model Legislation is formed under the  Court of the Confederative Union.    The High Contracting Parties have agreed to establish  unified  principles of legal aid enshrined in a special agreement.    VII: Any CIS member state and other European and Asian  states  may apply to the General Political Council to be admitted as  members of the Confederative Agreement which adopt a decision in  accordance with the principle of unanimity after consultations  with the CEC Governmental Committee.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Deed does make sense MY UNCLE has just died aged 100, leaving an estate of Pounds 372,000. The inheritance tax will be Pounds 88,000. His wife, who is 97, has an estate worth Pounds 105,000, from which she pays Pounds 320 a week in a nursing home. When I asked the solicitor about a deed of variation to transfer Pounds 60,000 over to her to save on tax (about Pounds 25,000), he said that as there were 12 beneficiaries to sign, it would cost as much as it would save. Is this right? And do the expenses of the funeral, including a stone, come out of the estate before tax is due? It would appear from your letter that your uncle has left your estate to beneficiaries other than his wife, and that a transfer of assets would need their agreement. If the wife's will leaves her assets to the same beneficiaries, then, unless she changes her will in the meantime, the beneficiaries would only be losing the cash flow use of the money, but could be saving tax, by a deed of variation. Assuming that his wife has not made any previous chargeable gifts, then it would be possible for her to make annual gifts of Pounds 3,000 using her annual exemption. If she has not made any gifts for the previous year, she can make a gift of Pounds 6,000 in this tax year. The most tax-efficient arrangement would be for a sum to be transferred to her by way of a deed of variation so that her eventual chargeable estate was valued at Pounds 150,000 and was, thereby, covered by her own nil rate band. If we assume that she was able to give away, say, Pounds 6,000 using the annual exemption, then this would reduce her chargeable estate to just under Pounds 100,000. Therefore, a deed of variation transferring Pounds 50,000 to her would bring the chargeable estate approximately in line with the nil rate band, so that no tax would be payable. This could give rise to tax savings of around Pounds 20,000. I do believe there is merit in the deed of variation and that this matter could be put to the other beneficiaries. I can also confirm that reasonable funeral expenses are deductible for inheritance tax purposes. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of Stoy Hayward.

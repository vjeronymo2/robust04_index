			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Trans West African Highway scheme Environmental and engineering management consultant WALLACE EVANS has been awarded two contracts in Sierra Leone and China with a total construction value of Pounds 23m. The Government of Sierra Leone has appointed Wallace Evans for the Pounds 16m improvement of a 120 km section of the Freetown to Conakry highway - the principal link between Guinea and Sierra Leone and gateway to the economically vital port of Freetown. The road is part of the strategically important Trans West African Highway that runs from Morocco in the north to Nigeria in the south. The project includes the design for the rehabilitation of the 30km section between Massiaka and Rogbere and the design of a new road between Pamelap on the Guinea/Sierra Leone border and Farmoreah in Guinea. Tender documentation for 74 km of new road between Rogbere and Pamelap, the design of which was completed in December 1992 by Wallace Evans under an earlier commission, is also included in the EC-funded study. The superstructure for a Pounds 6.5m cable making factory in China is to be designed by the Wallace Evans firm. Construction work is due to start shortly on the 200,000 sq ft building, located 10 miles from Bejing. The project is a joint venture between the Chinese government and a South Korean cable and wire manufacturing company. Wallace Evans has designed the single-storey steel superstructure to withstand earthquakes. Staff undertook a detailed study of Chinese regulations, which took account of the climatic regional variations, followed by complex computer calculations to assess the stress the building would need to withstand.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALUE OF BOOTLEG CASSETTE SEIZURE PUT AT $2.6 MILLION  </P> <P> Police searching for a robbery suspect accidentally discovered a bootleg  cassette factory in Fullerton containing 100,000 counterfeit Latino,  country-Western and rap tapes, the largest seizure in Orange County history,  authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> The seizure represented an estimated loss of $2.6 million to the recording  industry, police said.  </P> <P> The bootleg operation seized Wednesday may be connected to similar raids  conducted last month in Los Angeles County, police said Thursday. Also  confiscated were 2,300 original master tapes, labels and other packaging  materials and recording equipment valued at $50,000. Officials said the dubbing  machines were capable of producing 12 tapes every 90 seconds.  </P> <P> The bootleg operation in Fullerton was discovered by two Los Angeles police  detectives who went to Unit J of an industrial complex at 2524 Fender Ave. on  Wednesday to serve a search warrant in an unrelated robbery case. The person  they were looking for had listed CST Environmental as his work address.  </P> <P> Although CST Environmental had moved away, the bootleg operation hadn't  replaced the name on the door when it moved in about six weeks ago, Fullerton  Police Sgt. Glenn Deveney said.  </P> <P> "They (Los Angeles police) saw employees dubbing cassette tapes and recognized  it as a pirating operation," Deveney said, adding that the Fullerton Police  Department was then called in to investigate.  </P> <P> Based on interviews with five employees who were detained briefly,  investigators said the counterfeit tapes were being manufactured day and night,  resulting in the production of about 30,000 cassettes a week. Police said the  employees were paid $150 a week.  </P> <P> "This is one of the larger piracy warehouses," Fullerton Police Detective Joe  Caracci said. "It's one of the more sophisticated ones."  </P> <P> About 70% of the tapes confiscated in Fullerton were by Latino artists, such as  Alex Bueno and Los Mier. The other cassettes included recordings by M.C.  Hammer, Milli Vanilli and Willie Nelson.  </P> <P> Such tapes are sold at swap meets at below-market prices, police said.  </P> <P> Police believe that the operation was distributing the tapes nationwide.  Caracci said evidence showed some of the tapes were being shipped to El Paso,  Tex., with other locations listed on business documents. Some were probably  distributed in Los Angeles, Caracci said.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of Mexican-American and Hispanic people (in the Los Angeles  area). And like everybody else, they go to swap meets; we go to swap meets, and  these tapes are made for the region."  </P> <P> A recording industry spokeswoman said a raid in Chino on Aug. 28 resulted in  the confiscation of tapes and equipment representing a potential annual loss to  the industry of $45 million. Police searched two more locations in Ontario the  next day, where an additional 20,000 tapes were confiscated. No dollar value  was available.  </P> <P> Eight people were charged with violations in those raids, according to Trish  Heimors, a spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Assn. of America Inc. The  bootleg recordings confiscated were mostly by rap artists, including 2 Live  Crew and Stevie B.  </P> <P> Consultants for the association have joined Fullerton police in the  investigation.  </P> <P> Caracci said all these bootleg operations could be connected, but he declined  to elaborate.  </P> <P> Police said the owner of the Fullerton business operated under three or four  names, but they had narrowed it down to one name by Thursday. They also believe  that a second "silent partner" was involved.  </P> <P> "We will find the man that leased the office. There's no problem with that,"  Caracci said. "Anybody above and beyond him, I doubt it."  </P> <P> One nearby business owner said he was surprised by the raid because the suspect  earlier had told him that he sold clothes and tennis shoes at swap meets.  </P> <P> "I guess I had an underlying feeling that something was wrong because it was  sort of clandestine the way trucks would be coming up and loading little  boxes," said Dan Short, the business owner.  </P> <P> John Fahel, whose family business in the same complex sells wholesale tennis  shoes at swap meets, said the suspect telephoned his office Wednesday during  the police raid after calling his own business and suspecting something was  wrong.  </P> <P> Fahel said they met within the last few weeks -- drawn together because they  are both Arab nationals -- but had not worked together at swap meets.  </P> <P> "We did not know what this guy did," Fahel said. "We do an honest living."  </P></p>

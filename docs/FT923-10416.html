			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Honecker flown home to face trial THE UNDIGNIFIED tug-of-war over Mr Erich Honecker, the former East German communist leader, ended last night when he was flown from Moscow to Berlin to face trial for the alleged manslaughter of defectors shot while trying to escape to the west. Months of negotiations between Germany, Russia and Chile - in whose Moscow embassy he took refuge to avoid extradition - came to a head when he was taken from the embassy to a military aircraft at Moscow's Vnukovo airport. The 79-year-old hardliner, who led East Germany for 18 years until 1989, landed at Berlin's heavily guarded Tegel airport and was immediately driven to Moabit prison. Two doctors examined Mr Honecker in prison and ruled he was well enough to withstand jail, a justice official said. After a more thorough examination, the Berlin district court must decide whether he will remain in jail. He will appear before a judge today. The official said Mr Honecker's trial was expected to start 'some time this year'. Mr Honecker faces charges of manslaughter in connection with the deaths of 49 East Germans shot while trying to escape to the west between 1961 and 1989. One question to be answered is whether Mr Honecker is fit to stand trial, having had an operation for kidney cancer in 1990. The other doubt concerns the legal basis of charges against him. An 800-page indictment has been drawn up by the Berlin justice department, accusing Mr Honecker and five fellow leaders of the communist government of complicity in the killing of defectors at the Berlin Wall and the border with West Germany. The problem is to make the charges stick in terms of the law of East Germany which was prevailing at the time. The Berlin authorities have levelled the charges on three fronts: that Mr Honecker and his colleagues, including Mr Erich Mielke, the former head of the Ministry of State Security (Stasi), exceeded their powers under East German law; that they broke international laws, in particular the UN convention on civil rights; and that they infringed basic human rights. Mr Honecker argues that he cannot be found guilty on that basis, because he was empowered under East German law to issue administrative orders, including the order to shoot to kill.</p>

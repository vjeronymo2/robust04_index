			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: German subsidiary drags Kewill into midway loss HIGH COSTS and poor sales at one German subsidiary forced Kewill Systems into a small loss midway and cast a pall over prospects for the full year. The Surrey-based computing services company, which markets a portfolio of manufacturing and accounting software products, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 172,000 for the half year ended September 30, compared to a profit of Pounds 1.7m. Turnover fell from Pounds 21.46m to Pounds 15.42m, reflecting the continued shrinking of Weigang, one of the German companies, and a movement away from hardware distribution in Europe. Losses per per share amounted to 3.58p (earnings 13.56p). Mr John Overstall, chairman, said once the Weigang situation had been resolved the company would apply to the Court to approve a capital reduction to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves. He said most of the operations had continued steadily. Triffid Software, in particular, had contributed Pounds 600,000 of UK operation's total pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m. Han Dataport, the other German subsidiary, made Pounds 500,000. Weigang lost Pounds 1.3m, however, after a sharp fall in orders at the end of 1991. Interest costs rose to Pounds 413,000 (Pounds 279,000). Mr Overstall said marketing efforts had been stepped up in Germany and staff at Weigang should be reduced to 29 people by April next year. The company still retained some 400 German customers and should break even next year.</p>

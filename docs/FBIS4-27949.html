			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press statement" by Kang Sok-chu, DPRK first vice minister </F> of foreign affairs and head of the DPRK delegation to the  DPRK-U.S. talks issued in Pyongyang on 3 June -- read by  announcer]    [Text] Kang Sok-chu, first vice minister of foreign affairs  and head of the DPRK delegation to the DPRK-U.S. talks,  published a press statement on 3 June on the recent U.S.  orchestration of an anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the reactor  core refueling of our experimental nuclear power plant.    He said:    It is one year since the DPRK-U.S. joint statement was  published.    The joint statement was the first of its kind in the history  of the DPRK-U.S. relations in which the sides promised each  other to ban the use of Armed Forces, including nuclear weapons,  and the threat with them, mutual respect of sovereignty and  non-interference in each other's internal affairs. It was of  weighty importance in that it laid the foundation for the  DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula and a practical end to the hostile  relations between the two countries.    Looking back on the past year, however, we must note with  regret that the principles of the joint statement have not been  observed.    As everyone knows, with the publication of the joint  statement, we temporarily suspended the effectuation of our  declared withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT] and, even with this unique status, we accepted on the  highest level the inspection of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] for the continuity of safeguards.    And, fully considerate of the apprehensions of the United  States, we promoted with sincerity the working-level contacts  for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the  South and even made a momentous decision to replace the graphite  moderated reactor system with a light water reactor system at  the sacrifice of the independence of our nuclear power industry.    The package solution to the nuclear issue which we were to  propose at the third-round of talks included all the questions  in which the United States might be interested, such as the  resumption of the routine and ad hoc inspections of the agency  pursuant to the safeguards agreement, our return to the NPT and  the dismantling of the radiochemical laboratory with the  replacement of the graphite moderated reactor with the light  water reactor.    We do not intend to drive a bargain with the United States  over the nuclear issue or get something from it in this  connection. All we want is an end to the U.S. policy of nuclear  threat to us and the removal of the hostile relations between us  and the United States and the abnormal relations between us and  the agency.    Only then can the nuclear issue be fundamentally resolved  and  thus peace be consolidated on the Korean peninsula and,  furthermore, security be ensured in the Asia-Pacific region.    The United States, however, failed to give any practical  assurances that it would renounce its policy of nuclear threat  and stifling against us [urie taehan haek wihyop apsal  chongchaegul] and, while using the phraseology of DPRK-U.S.  talks, refused even to sit down at the negotiating table with  us, leading the talks to an actual collapse. So we have not had  even an opportunity to discuss the package solution with the  United States.    The past year since the publication of the DPRK-U.S. joint  statement has been, in the final analysis, a period in which the  United States has not sought a solution to the problem through  the talks but, on the contrary, used the signboard of the talks  as a tool of pressure and a way of tricking us, according to the  reversed mode of thinking that it would come to the talks when  the problem is solved, and a period in which it forced South  Korea to open its rice and arms markets over the nuclear issue  and pursued only its selfish aim.    It is not difficult to see the motive of the start of the  U.S.- orchestrated anti-DPRK pressure campaign over the core  refueling at our experimental atomic power plant.    Core refueling is an indispensable normal process of the  operation of an atomic power plant. Furthermore, as we have  declared, we have taken measures to fully preserve the technical  possibility of ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods when our  unique status will have been removed as expected and we firmly  ensure the non-diversion of the spent fuel rods.    Despite our well-intentioned step, however, some officials  of  the IAEA Secretariat concluded [kyollon hayonnunde] that the  possibility of later measurement of fuel rods was lost. The  Secretariat may give up measurement, if it does not want it.    For our part, we preserve the scientific and technical  possibility of it. So, if the nuclear issue is solved between  our country and the United States, not only the measurement of  fuel rods but even more complicated problems than that would be  solved without difficulty.    The honesty of our nuclear activities in the past could be  seen clearly in the well-meant step of allowing an additional  inspection [chuga sachal] of the radiochemical laboratory.    This notwithstanding, they tried to find fault with the core  refueling, saying the possibility of measurement was lost. This  is an insidious attempt to call in question our graphite  moderated reactor system now in operation and put the brakes on  the development of our existing nuclear energy industry as a  whole, not to inquire into our nuclear activities in the past.  In the final analysis, this cannot be construed otherwise than  part of their political plot to stifle our system.    This is borne out by such ill-boding moves within the United  States of late as open calls for UN sanctions [yuen chejae],  multinational sanctions [tagukchok chejae] and preemptive strike  [sonje tagyok] at peaceful nuclear facilities of the DPRK.    Should the United States thus totally give up even the  DPRK-USA talks now, we would be left with no other choice but to  conclude that our efforts for a diplomatic solution have failed.    If the United States is willing to have the talks now, our  proposal for a package solution is still valid. But, if it  chooses a strongarm measure, our option too will change. [kurona  manil migugi kangkkwonui kirul taekhandamyon, uriga kalkildo  tallajilkosida] We will go over to the next process of our  nuclear activities and cannot but expand our independent atomic  energy industry by the present method. [urinun uri haek  hwalttongui taum kongjonguro nomogal kosimyo, chigumui  pangsiktaero charipchok haek tongnyok kongobul touk hwaktae  sikyo nagaji anulsuoptta]    In case the United States declares the foundation of the  DPRK-USA talks has been destroyed, the foundation on which we  have temporarily suspended the effectuation of our declared  withdrawal from the non-proliferation treaty will collapse.    We have already notified the parties concerned that economic  sanctions [kyongje chejae] would be regarded as a declaration of  war against us.    In this case, not only the parties joining in the sanctions  [chejae] against our Republic but also those backing such  sanctions will be held responsible.    This is not what we want.    The United States must not take our patience for a sign of  weakness.</p>

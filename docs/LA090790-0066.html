			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS BLAME COLUMBIA S&amp;L LOSS ON LAVISH BUILDING  </P> <P> Federal regulators on Thursday alleged that former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan  Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel caused the thrift to lose $29.2 million by  building a lavish $54.7-million headquarters in Beverly Hills that was to have  featured anti-terrorist bomb shelters in bathrooms, stainless steel floors and  a multilevel gymnasium.  </P> <P> The allegations were added to earlier civil charges filed two months ago by the  federal Office of Thrift Supervision against Spiegel, who headed the Beverly  Hills-based thrift until Dec. 31. In those earlier charges, the OTS said  Spiegel squandered $19 million of the thrift's money on such items as corporate  jets, condominiums, submachine guns and loans to friends.  </P> <P> The OTS had been seeking to force Spiegel to pay Columbia $19 million in  restitution and fine him an additional $5 million. What is unclear is whether  the OTS is seeking the entire $29.2-million loss on the building as additional  restitution.  </P> <P> Dennis Perluss, a lawyer for Spiegel, said the new allegations are vague on  that point. Tom Mason, an OTS spokesman, said that the agency is "seeking a  substantial amount of the $29.2-million loss. The numbers will firm up as we go  along."  </P> <P> Perluss refused to comment on the OTS allegations. He said he and Spiegel's  other attorneys plan to prove that the charges are without merit.  </P> <P> Columbia is now insolvent, largely because of losses in its portfolio of risky  junk bonds. It has agreed to sell the bonds for $3 billion to a Canadian-led  partnership, although the sale must be approved by regulators and could be  scrapped by the prospective buyer should fighting break out in the Persian  Gulf.  </P> <P> Details about the bomb shelters and other extravagances at the still-unoccupied  Wilshire Boulevard headquarters building were first reported by the Los Angeles  Times in July. The building was originally projected to cost $17 million, less  than one-third what it actually cost, and has a market value of $24 million,  according to the OTS. Columbia has put the 80,000-square-foot building up for  sale.  </P> <P> In its allegations, the OTS blames Spiegel for the losses by personally  ordering design changes, among them the "survival chamber" bathrooms with  bulletproof glass. Sources have said that Spiegel wanted them in the building  as protection against possible terrorist attacks. The headquarters also was to  feature compartments storing independent air and food supplies, stainless steel  floors and leather wall coverings.  </P> <P> The OTS alleges that Spiegel never received approval from directors for the  building and never informed them of the cost overruns. Columbia's new  management scrapped most of those features before they were completed to make  the building more marketable, even though materials to build them were already  bought. But some features, such as the building's limestone exterior, could not  be eliminated because it was too late.  </P> <P> The new allegations did not include some other areas of Spiegel's spending that  investigators have reviewed, such as his extensive personal security detail and  the use by Spiegel and his family of Columbia's Hyatt Newporter resort in  Newport Beach.  </P> <P> In a separate development, OTS Director Timothy Ryan decided that  administrative proceedings against Spiegel and former Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. would be made public. Both men are  expected to face hearings before administrative law judges later this year. The  regulatory agency is seeking $40.9 million in restitution from Keating, former  chairman of the Irvine-based thrift's parent, American Continental Corp., and  five other American Continental officers.  </P></p>

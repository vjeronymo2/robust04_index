			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / BCCI deal for creditors struck: Liquidators to announce Dollars 1.8bn payment from government of Abu Dhabi The liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International will today announce that they have reached an historic agreement with BCCI's main shareholder to begin the process of paying creditors. The liquidators are expected to claim that the agreement, which would secure Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.14bn) from the government of Abu Dhabi, has been agreed without a dissenting vote by creditors' committees in London, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Progress towards the payment of an interim dividend, now expected next year, will depend on the agreement being cleared by courts in the three separate jurisdictions. However, the agreement has been drawn up specifically to avoid legal problems which brought about the failure of an original settlement when it reached the Court of Appeal in Luxembourg last year. While no dissenting vote has been registered against the scheme it is likely to prompt vociferous opposition from creditors who fought bitterly against an earlier settlement both in and outside the courts. The long-awaited agreement will be notified to creditors from tomorrow and more than 40,000 booklets explaining the deal are expected to be posted to creditors in Europe alone. The agreement is understood not to contain a specific dividend offer because of uncertainties over the level of the bank's assets, such as unclaimed deposits, and the number of creditors taking part in the scheme. If creditors from other jurisdictions decide that more can be claimed through the scheme than through local administrations they will join it and so reduce the average dividend. Another factor making it difficult for the liquidators to put forward a dividend figure is the continuing costs of running the liquidation itself. At one point these were thought to be running at Dollars 300,000 a day. Unofficial estimates put the assets of the bank at up to Dollars 4bn. It is thought that up to Dollars 3bn is still held unclaimed in branches of the bank. The earlier agreement gave a range of compensation from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn. The new offer is not linked to claims and the realisation of assets. The original offer required creditors to waive their rights to seek damages from Abu Dhabi. It is understood that this condition has been removed from the new offer to be published today. The new offer is also likely to mean that creditors at branches of BCCI in the United Arab Emirates will get the same dividend as other creditors. The original document left this unclear. The new agreement is also expected to include the creditors of ICIC Group - a BCCI subsidiary which was covered by the original agreement but only to the extent that any dividends paid would be similar to those of BCCI creditors. The progress of the scheme through the courts is likely to be relatively swift. The earlier plan that was eventually thrown out in Luxembourg was given prompt treatment in London and the Cayman Islands. In the meantime creditors will be invited to make comments on the agreement to the liquidators.</p>

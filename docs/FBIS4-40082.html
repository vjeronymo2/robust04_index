			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Afonin] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 13 Jun -- A treaty on the foundations  for friendly relations between the Russian Federation and the  Socialist Republic of Vietnam--that will strengthen the legal  basis of all- round cooperation between the two states--will be  signed during an official visit to Moscow by Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet [15-17 June]. Viktor Ivanov, deputy  director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, reported this to the ITAR-TASS correspondent today.  Other documents are expected to be signed, including agreements  on trade and economic cooperation in the agro-industrial  complex, and an agreement on cooperation in the fishing  industry. Ten intergovernmental agreements between Russia and  Vietnam have already been signed.    The diplomat noted that the visit was important because a  Vietnamese prime minister will meet Russian leaders for the  first time since the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  [passage omitted]    He said, however, that there were a number of complex and  delicate issues in Russo-Vietnamese relations. These include  the problem of Vietnamese debts to the former Soviet Union,  which amount to around 10 trillion rubles (previous years  prices). [passage omitted]    The other matter is the Vietnamese community in Russia that  numbers several tens of thousands of people. The diplomat noted  that several of them--like representatives of other foreign  countries--commit various types of offenses in their commercial  activity. Joint, civilized, methods are needed to resolve this  matter, based on legislation.    Moscow welcomes the "open doors" policy conducted by the  Vietnamese leaders, and it is no coincidence that priority at  the upcoming talks is being given to trade and economic issues.    The Russian diplomat noted that the stances taken by Russia  and Vietnam coincide on the overwhelming majority of issues. It  is expected that the parties will devote most attention this  time to cooperation in the Asiatic-Pacific Ocean region, taking  into account the increasing role Vietnam is playing in southeast  Asia. Russia understands the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's  desire to join ASEAN --with which Russia is also entering into  more active political dialogue.</p>

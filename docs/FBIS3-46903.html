It  was attended by representatives from the military, Interior,  Foreign, Finance, and Commerce Ministries, the governor of the  Bank of Thailand, and director of the National Intelligence  Agency. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai presided over the meeting.    General Charan Kunlawanit, secretary general of the National  Security Council [NSC], said in an interview at Government House  after the meeting that there was a review of the country's  security from the political, economic, scientific, and  environmental points of view, both domestically and externally.  The meeting studied guidelines on improving intelligence  gathering and making the organization more effective in serving  national interests.    The NSC secretary general said the situation around the  country is not a security threat at present. Anyway, fighting  along the border near Burma and Cambodia could affect the safety  of the people there. On Cambodia, he said the continued  fighting there showed that efforts by several countries to help  Cambodia achieve peace did not work, and that there were still  conflicts between factions in Cambodia. He said it is necessary  to try to achieve a sense of unity for the Cambodian people. He  believed the fighting would go on until the two Cambodian  factions realize that the fighting does not contribute to the  nation. Then, the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge  would agree to compromise over a fair share of benefits for the  sake of national development.</p>

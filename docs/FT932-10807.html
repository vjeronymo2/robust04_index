			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Clinton appoints Gore aide to crack whip in the White House PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named Mr Roy Neel, a veteran aide to Vice-President Al Gore, as a new deputy White House chief of staff, with the mission to concentrate on immediate political priorities. The White House yesterday also partly confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that it was considering a delay in its health care reform package until the middle of next month, so as not to overload the legislative agenda. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, said Mr Neel will focus on day-to-day operations while Mr Mark Gearan, the other deputy to Mr Thomas 'Mack' McLarty, the chief of staff, will engage more in long-term planning. This suggests that Mr Neel, aged 47 and an aide to Mr Gore while the latter was a senator, is meant to bring discipline to an enthusiastic White House staff that lacks some political experience. Mr McLarty himself is new to Washington. This week, Mr Clinton had admitted that his administration needed to get its priorities straight and probably had lost some focus as it presented initiative after initiative to the Congress and to the public. It has also proved hard for the president to concentrate on domestic issues as foreign exigencies - first, aid to Russia, and now the Bosnian problem - have commanded more and more of his time. The elevation of Mr Neel, well regarded in Washington, is seen in some quarters as a setback for Mr McLarty, an Arkansas businessman long close to the Clintons. However, he seems to retain their confidence and is popular with the staff. Mr Clinton said this week that he simply needed some extra experienced help. The health care proposals might now be delayed until mid-June in the hope that, by then, Congress will have made substantial progress on the critical budget process. This was the advice tendered by Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, in an interview last week, and it has been urged on the White House by Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, whose ways and means committee is considering the budget bill. Health care reform was to have been announced by May 1, but this deadline was deferred partly because Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, chairman of the task force, had spent several weeks in Arkansas with her dying father. Even now, there is no guarantee that Congress will have completed most of the work on the budget bill by the middle of next month. Several of its tax proposals, including those on energy and investments, are under heavy fire. If they go down, the administration will need to find deeper spending cuts in order to meet its ambitious deficit reduction goals. Indeed, if the budget process is turning out badly, with a series of setbacks for Mr Clinton, then sweeping health care reforms, already controversial in so far as they are known, are likely to be given a dusty reception. In general, the administration seems now more willing to compromise with Congress. This week, it has scaled back its plans for the mass vaccination of children, now to be confined mostly to the poor. There have been further delays and probable modification to its proposals for reform of electoral campaign finance, reflecting stiff opposition from the majority Democratic party. Mr Neel is expected to be pivotal in deciding what to send to Congress, and in what form.</p>

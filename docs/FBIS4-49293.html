			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report": "Shenzhen Strengthens Management Over </F> Military Vehicles"]    [Text] Shenzhen, 12 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- Some days ago,  the Shenzhen Garrison issued a "Circular on Strengthening  Management Over Military Vehicles in the Shenzhen Area" in order  to straighten out the operational order of military vehicles in  Shenzhen and to curb the illegal manufacture, selling, and use  of military vehicle certificates by lawbreakers.    The purpose of the circular is to implement the relevant  instructions of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangdong  Provincial Military District. The circular demands that all  military institutions stationed in Shenzhen should check their  military vehicles before the end of April; those holding  certificates at or above the division level should obtain a  "military vehicle registration form" from the garrison and  submit the filled-out form for verification. After verification  that the military vehicle's license plate number conforms with  the driving license number, the garrison will issue a "military  vehicle registration certificate." On discovery, individuals  using military vehicles in Shenzhen without registration  certificates will be given severe punishments according to the  relevant regulations.    Unqualified localities, units, or individuals illegally  obtaining military vehicle certificates must stop using these  certificates immediately, return them to the original users, or  submit them to the garrison. Those who continue to use these  certificates will be held responsible and will receive severe  punishments according to the relevant regulations.    The circular points out that counterfeiting military vehicle  certificates, and selling or using false certificates are  illegal. Individuals involved in these activities must confess  their offenses to the Shenzhen Garrison before 30 April to  receive lenient treatment. Otherwise, public security  departments will hold them responsible for the criminal offenses  they have committed.    The circular stipulates: Military vehicles are not allowed  to be used for production purposes, and buses with military  license plate numbers are not allowed to be used for business  purposes. Vehicles for construction and transportation use must  observe the local government's relevant regulations, and are not  allowed to operate in excess of their capacity or to pollute the  city's environment. Military vehicles without rear mudguards,  dirty vehicles, or vehicles in bad technical condition will not  be issued "military registration certificates"; these vehicles  are not allowed to operate.    The circular demands that military vehicle drivers strictly  observe traffic rules, foster good professional ethics and  driving habits, follow the instructions of traffic policemen,  and consciously safeguard the Army's reputation.</p>

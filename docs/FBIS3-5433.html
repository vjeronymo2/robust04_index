More than 7,000  men, including 3,000 policemen with military training are taking  part in the operations. The Royal Army is backed by tanks,  armored personnel carriers, vehicle-mounted rocket launchers,  Katyusha rockets and 130-mm artillery pieces.    The CAMBODIA TIMES has been informed by senior military  officers that the initial casualty report will be available  soon. Fierce fighting was believed to be taking place in many  areas as a result of the offensive which commenced last  Wednesday, 2 March.    The army has moved from positions in Pursat, Bavel district  and Samlot in a multi-prong attack.    Military sources said that the timing and positions of  attack  have been clearly planned and victory is expected to come before  the end of the week.</p>

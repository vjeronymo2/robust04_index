			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046) and Zheng Qingdong </F> (6774 1987 2639)]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- This morning, 15  National People's Congress [NPC] deputies from the "roof of the  world" proudly voiced the aspirations of more than 2 million  Tibetan people in front of hundreds of Chinese and foreign  correspondents in the Tibet room of the Great Hall of the People.    Over the years, Tibet has always been a region of great  public interest, and its deputies have always been the focus of  the news media during NPC sessions. At the request of Chinese  and foreign correspondents, Tibetan deputies to the Second  Session of the Eighth NPC were collectively interviewed by the  news media for the first time today.    Deputies, some in Western business suits and some in  traditional Tibetan costumes, answered each and every question  with ease and confidence in front of flashing cameras. Raidi, a  serf who became a senior leading cadre as deputy director of the  Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee and chairman of the  Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress Standing Committee,  first told the correspondents joyously: "Tibet currently enjoys  political stability, economic development, social progress,  national unity, and higher living standards. Its situation is  heartening and its prospects are bright."    Relations among various nationalities in Tibet were an issue  of general concern to the Chinese and foreign correspondents.  Deputy Raidi said: Tibet is an inalienable part of the sacred  motherland. The Tibetan nationality is a member of the Chinese  nation. In the 40-plus years since its peaceful liberation in  1951, Tibet has followed a glorious course along with other  nationalities in all parts of the country. In recent years,  splittist elements within and outside the national boundaries,  with the support and tacit encouragement of anti-Chinese forces  in the international community, have waged many activities aimed  at splitting the motherland, including those aimed at creating  disturbances and troubles in Lhasa. Nevertheless, people of all  nationalities across the country, including Tibetan compatriots,  have firmly opposed these splittist activities.    "Order leads to a country's ascendancy, whereas chaos leads  to its downfall." People of all nationalities in Tibet have  drawn this conclusion from the past and the present. Deputy  Raidi said: "Over the past several decades, the central  authorities have always shown great concern for Tibet's  construction and social development. Other localities have also  lent full support and assistance to Tibet. The central  authorities have implemented an array of preferential policies  and provided full financial and material support, thereby  rapidly developing the productive forces in chronically  underdeveloped Tibet. Compared to the pre-liberation period,  Tibet's entire social outlook has undergone tremendous historic  changes."    Raidi cited the follow statistics to substantiate his  statement: In 1993, Tibet's gross regional product amounted to  3.65 billion yuan, up 8.1 percent from the previous year;  agriculture registered a bumper harvest for the sixth year, with  the total grain output reaching 620,000 tonnes; per capita net  income of peasants and herdsmen was 521 yuan, an increase of 180  percent over 10 years ago; ..... [ellipses as received]    In recent years, some people of the international community  have shown an interest in the so-called state of human rights in  Tibet. When a foreign correspondent raised this question, Losang  -- a neighborhood committee chairman of Chengguan District of  Lhasa City who was a serf along with his father and grandfather  -- said promptly: "Whoever wants to discuss the state of human  rights in Tibet is ignorant of history. I am most qualified to  answer this question since I used to be a serf."    "Old Tibet was a society of serfdom combining religion and  politics," said Losang with deep emotion while taking off his  black Tibetan cap. He said loudly in Tibetan: "In old Tibet,  the vast number of people were bullied and oppressed as serfs  and had no rights whatsoever of which to speak. We had no  political rights, no economic equality, not even freedom of  marriage. We suffered beatings and hardships. At the slightest  displeasure of the owners, serfs were sent to prisons, or had  their heads and legs chopped off. Our right of survival was not  guaranteed, not to mention our rights as human beings."    Losong said: It was only after the democratic reform in  Tibet in 1959 that the vast number of Tibetans began to enjoy  true human rights and to feel the warmth of the big family of  nationalities. Especially since the implementation of the reform  and opening up policy, life is improving with each new day; and  the people are fully enjoying their rights as human beings and  citizens. Their lives today as compared to pre-liberation days  are as far apart as heaven and earth.    Speaking forcefully, Losong said: "Without knowing well the  historical background, it is hard to understand things now. We  people who experienced serfdom in old Tibet understand best what  human rights are. Any attempt to use the so-called human rights  issue to realize ulterior motives is doomed to fail, and is  ludicrous."    Answering a question on whether Han people have been  emigrating to Tibet in large numbers, Losang Toinzhub, vice  chairman of the Tibetan Regional People's Government and mayor  of Lhasa, said that assertion is a sheer nonsense. He said:  Among a population of 400,000 in Lhasa, Tibetans account for 87  percent and Han less than 12 percent. In recent years, many  people from inland areas have come to Tibet to do business.  They have helped enliven the market and contributed to economic  development. This is a result of the policy of reform and  opening up. They have, together with local people of all  nationalities, made great contributions to Tibet's economic  development.    Speaking of religious beliefs, Losang Gyaincain, vice  chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan Regional  People's Congress and president of the Tibetan Buddhist  Association, said: Tibet is home to more than 1,400 temples and  over 30,000 monks and nuns. Thanks to the implementation of the  party's policy on religion, people of all nationalities are  enjoying the right of freedom of religious belief. There are  people who believe in religion and those who do not in Tibet.  This facts represents an aspect of the freedom of religious  belief in Tibet.    Asked about whether there is any change in the Central  Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama, Deputy Raidi said:  Dalai has been living in exile since 1959, when he took part in  a rebellion and fled. He has since engaged in activities aimed  at separatism and sabotage of national unity. The central  government's policy toward the Dalai Lama has been very clear  all along: He is welcome to return home to contribute to the  country's construction if he abandons his stance on splitting  the motherland and sabotaging national unity.    Deputy Raidi told the Chinese and foreign correspondents  present: "Under the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress, the First Plenary Session of the Eighth NPC,  and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  people of all nationalities in Tibet -- amid the tidal waves of  reform, opening up, and developing a socialist market economy --  are determined to seize the favorable opportunity, work hard to  build a socialist market economic system, deepen reform, and  concentrate their energies to develop the economy." He said  that he is confident that Tibet will become more united,  prosperous, democratic, and civilized.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: GIFTS THAT KEEP ON BEING GIVEN  </P> <P> Klepto was sitting on his front stoop. "I'm waiting for the mailman," he told  me.  </P> <P> "You must be expecting an important letter."  </P> <P> "I'm actually on the lookout for Christmas packages. The more I get, the  happier I'll be."  </P> <P> "Most of us feel that way," I said.  </P> <P> "The gifts are not for myself -- they are for other people."  </P> <P> I looked confused.  </P> <P> He explained, "As you know, we're having a conservative holiday and are being  frugal. So Ruth and I came up with this idea. Instead of buying any new gifts,  we'll just pass along the ones that are sent to us, minus the card, of course."  </P> <P> "But if you give away everything you receive, you won't have anything for  Christmas."  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter. Most of the presents we get aren't anything to write home  about. Look at this Ratatouille Popcorn in a can. Many folks couldn't do  without it, but we can. Believe it or not, Ruth and I have spent eight or nine  Christmases without Ratatouille Popcorn."  </P> <P> "What will you do with it?"  </P> <P> "I'll send it to my brother-in-law, Toady. He mailed us a pound of goat's  cheese last year which, I am certain, his boss gave him. We've been very lucky  this December. The Rapps sent us a letter-opener, which we immediately passed  on to the Ludwigs after they mailed us a Christmas washcloth."  </P> <P> "Who got the washcloth?"  </P> <P> "We can't decide. We still haven't received a gift from the Lyons or the  Porters."  </P> <P> "The system is great as long as you don't get the presents mixed up," I said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "We did that last year. The Constantines gave us garden shears. By mistake we  sent the shears back with our card attached. Damned if we didn't get a rave  note from Fitzi Constantine saying that they were the most beautiful garden  shears she had ever seen."  </P> <P> "That must have made you feel good," I told him.  </P> <P> "Sending other people's gifts for Christmas isn't as cheap as you might think.  There is the cost of wrapping paper, ribbon and postage."  </P> <P> "Why can't you use the same wrapping paper that it came in?"  </P> <P> "That would be cheating," he said.  </P> <P> "Suppose you pass along a gift to someone, and that person doesn't send you  one?"  </P> <P> "You mean like you?"  </P> <P> "OK, like me."  </P> <P> "I don't keep score. You can still hold on to the cactus plant from Mary Ellen  Clarkin with no questions asked."  </P> <P> "If I mail something to you, Klepto, can I designate the person I want you to  send it to?"  </P> <P> "No, because you may not know what he or she likes -- and when it comes to  gift-passing, the most important thing is to do it with love."  </P> <P> "You certainly have taken the Grinch out of Christmas," I said.  </P> <P> "Someone has to support the economy."  </P></p>

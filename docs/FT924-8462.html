			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Move to ease fears over coal contracts THE government will try to ease the uncertainty over British Coal's new long-term coal contracts by stating whether it would be willing to see them concluded before the results of its energy policy review are known. The electricity industry is trying to pull together a five-year deal with British Coal, on which its future depends. But talks are stalled because several companies are unwilling to commit themselves to a deal while the review is in progress. Although British Coal is negotiating with the power generators, these need to secure long-term supply deals with the distribution companies in England and Wales before the whole package can be agreed. The government will make its view known in a Commons written answer from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, in the next few days. The answer will take account of the fact that talks on the contracts must progress so that new terms can be in place by next April when the current ones expire. But they must leave room to accommodate extra coal deliveries if this is the effect of the new policy, which will not become known until the new year. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, estimated yesterday that the 12 regional electricity companies are equally divided between those which are ready to sign new contracts, those which are not, and those which are awaiting guidance. He said National Power was looking into the possibility of signing long-term deals with individual companies rather than waiting for an industry-wide agreement. But it is likely the companies will be wary of committing themselves if their competitors do not because they may forfeit competitive advantage.</p>

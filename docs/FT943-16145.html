			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Poor sampling blamed for failure of polls An exhaustive inquiry into the failure of opinion polls to predict accurately the outcome of the 1992 general election yesterday put most of the blame on the sampling techniques used by pollsters. An independent report commissioned by the Market Research Society says a swing from Labour to Conservatives in the last days of the election campaign accounted for only between a fifth and a third of the error. Introducing the report, Mr David Butler, a psephologist from Nuffield College, Oxford, said the failure of eve-of-election polls to predict Mr John Major's victory was the 'most spectacular in the history of British election surveys'. A team chaired by Mr Butler and including representatives of two of the main polling organisations - MORI and ICM - singled out two crucial flaws in the way the opinion polls were collated. The quota and weighting systems used to select samples did not reflect with sufficient accuracy the social profile of the electorate. The systems, which take into account such factors as age, sex, social class and occupation, were not fully representative of the distribution of political support across the electorate. The opinion polls, which were 4 percentage points away from the actual outcome for both the Conservative and Labour parties, also suffered from the refusal of many voters to reveal their loyalties. More Conservative than Labour voters declined to state their preference and the polls were not adjusted to take account of this. The report says the final important factor was the late swing in support towards the Conservatives and the fact that Tory supporters proved more likely to register their votes on election day. Minor influences included the choice of constituencies for polling and interviews with people not on the electoral register. The main polling companies said yesterday that they had already implemented the main recommendations of the inquiry in part or in full. These include better techniques for selecting quota samples and weightings and new approaches to limit the number of 'refusals'. But the report stresses that there is no single framework available to ensure that the mistakes are not repeated and companies should continually develop their research techniques.

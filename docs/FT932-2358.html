			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (8): Protest groups lose support - How the Swiss dealt with the Schweizerhalle disaster ANY CONVERSATION in Basle about the chemical industry and the environment inevitably revolves around November 1 1986. That Saturday, in the early morning, Baslers were awoken by the sounds of sirens and an acrid stench that would last for several days. A fire had broken out at a chemicals warehouse at Schweizerhalle, a suburb of Basle on the Rhine, owned by Sandoz, one of four major chemical companies based in the city. The smell was bad enough, but it soon became apparent that an environmental disaster of much greater proportions was occurring. As firemen pumped water onto the fire in the warehouse, it mixed with the chemicals and some 30 tonnes of dangerous agricultural chemicals, including 200kg of mercury, were washed into the Rhine. A great deal of marine life, especially eels, was killed. Although no human life was lost, the fire could have led to widespread deaths through a release of phosgene. Today, nearly seven years later, the repercussions of Schweizerhalle can still be felt, although, perhaps surprisingly, they are much more of a social and psychological nature than environmental. Sandoz contributed SFr10m towards an exhaustive series of studies of the Rhine ecosystem, and at a concluding symposium last year, the general conclusion was that no lasting damage had been caused by the accident. And, on the basis of exhaustive on-site investigations, Sandoz and the other chemical and pharmaceutical companies in the area still insist that the company had not been guilty of negligence or of low safety or environmental standards. Rather, the disaster showed an unquestionable need for containment tanks around chemical warehouses, something that no one until that time had recognised. Since Schweizerhalle, chemical companies throughout the world have invested heavily in containment systems and a new standard has been established. It also revealed a general ignorance about techniques for removing toxic chemicals from contaminated earth. Sandoz, to its credit, has developed a successful international line of business in this area. But by far the most important impacts of Schweizerhalle have been on the cultures of the companies themselves and their relationships with the people of their home city. At heart, Basle is still a genteel trading centre at one of the more important crossroads of western Europe. An uninformed visitor wandering through the elegant old city, or sitting on the leafy edges of the Rhine as it passes through the town centre, would have no idea that four huge chemical complexes are only a few hundred metres away. Officials of the four, Ciba, Roche and Lonza, as well as Sandoz, are at pains to say that they were investing heavily in safety and environmental protection long before the Schweizerhalle accident, and that is undoubtedly true. Sandoz claims its first safety officer was appointed in 1951. However, they willingly acknowledge that their attitudes toward their surrounding community prior to the accident were characterised mainly by patronising arrogance. The people of Basle were also at fault. Basking in the extraordinary prosperity produced by the companies - Basle is the second richest city in Switzerland - they were for the most part content to accept assurances that every precaution was being taken to protect them. All that came to an end on November 1 1986. In the weeks after the fire, the companies frequently made petulant and self-serving statements in an attempt to play down the significance of the disaster. Angry residents called the companies murderers and, on one occasion, threw dead fish from the Rhine at Sandoz officials. 'The over-reaction showed that something was wrong in the relationship,' a Roche official says. Gradually, the companies realised the need to change, and they now have exemplary programmes for involving the public in their activities. All of them, for example, encourage visits from local residents to their plants. 'Every week we have groups of teachers, students, politicians, journalists and schoolchildren. Before we showed them pill-pressing - now it's high-temperature incinerators and waste treatment plants,' says Dr Hans Kunzi, director of corporate safety and environmental protection at Roche. Neighbourhood meetings are frequent, and residents are invited to comment on company plans and projects. At Ciba, for example, a planned refurbishment of the Klybeckhof office building was substantially modified two years ago because of residents' concerns about traffic flow and noise from ventilators. There are still significant differences in the companies' disclosure policies, reflecting the differing cultures. Ciba is the most open, providing a vast array of statistics on its emissions. Plant managers are encouraged to carry an 'Oekogenda', containing many of these statistics and indicating targets to be achieved. Sandoz, on the other hand, is wary about publishing statistics wholesale, preferring to release them in seminars so it can explain the context. 'We feel that publishing statistical data does not really help in the communications process. Naked figures are hard to understand,' Mr Jurgen Muller, head of Sandoz Technology, says. But all the companies have the same aim. As Mr Kunzi puts it: 'You can only work in an environment where you are considered to be a neighbour. We want to be a better and decent neighbour. The alternative is to move somewhere else. 'Having a good image is also important for personnel marketing - if your name is ugly and smelly, you are going to have difficulty recruiting young people,' he adds. Have these programmes worked? The consensus in the city is that there is still a high level of scepticism among the public, but that is seen as not necessarily a bad thing. 'The relationship is more mature. Today, everyone knows this is a dangerous industry, but they also know that the companies are doing everything they can to minimise the dangers,' says Mr Stefan Cornaz, a director of the Basle Chamber of Commerce responsible for environmental issues. Mr Cornaz and others point out that at the last city elections in early 1992, candidates who were less hostile to the industry than their predecessors were successful. Environmental protest groups admit that they now have less support than they did in the aftermath of Schweizerhalle. Two years ago, Ms Florianne Koechlin successfully led a campaign to block Ciba's application for planning permission for a genetic engineering research facility. Today, she says, it would be more difficult. 'The problem now is recession and a more industry-friendly government.' And, she admits, 'the industry is more effective.'</p>

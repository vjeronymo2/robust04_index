			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / People: Benson opts to help fund the opt-outs Sir Christopher Benson is moving from his job distributing government grants to housing associations as chairman of the Housing Corporation to the potentially hotter seat of distributing grants to grant-maintained or 'opted-out' schools. He takes up his post formally next April, when the Funding Agency for Schools, created by this year's Education Act, starts its work. His first task is to work with John Patten, the education secretary, in appointing a chief executive for the fledgling organisation which, like the recently deceased National Curriculum Council, will be based in York. The job is likely to be tough, as the government is strongly committed to promoting grant-maintained schools as part of its campaign to weaken the hold of local education authorities, some of which, according to Patten, are led by 'nutters'. Sir Christopher, whose former experience in the education sector came as a governor of Marlborough College, is taking his new brief diplomatically: 'I'm coming to a new job with an open mind. I'm going to do my best to implement government policy, and to smooth transitions. That will require a close liaison with local education authorities.' A surveyor by training, Sir Christopher also holds the chairmanships of Boots, Sun Alliance and Costain.</p>

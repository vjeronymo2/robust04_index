			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Oxford college to honour cornflake Rewley House at Oxford University, which offers courses to mature and part-time students, plans to re-name itself Kellogg College in recognition of bequests totalling Pounds 9m over the past decade from the Kellogg Foundation. The philanthropic foundation was established by WK Kellogg, who founded the American food company. Rewley House became the university's 36th college four years ago, although it has still to receive its royal charter. The name change is expected to be approved today.</p>

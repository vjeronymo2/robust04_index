			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / HSBC makes further provision for Concord HSBC Holdings, the parent of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Midland Bank, has taken a further provision of Dollars 61.4m (Pounds 40.6m) against Concord Leasing, its troubled US equipment leasing business. This comes just two months after it announced the resignation of Concord's senior management, together with a Dollars 100m cash injection and Dollars 75m provision. The latest write-down followed a review of Concord's entire asset portfolio. HSBC said it had established general provisions sufficient to support Concord's continuing business activities, in addition to taking 'specific provisions for all identified weaknesses in Concord's asset portfolio.' The initial Dollars 75m write-down taken in September was against Concord's ageing shipping portfolio, and raised concerns over insufficient management control from the parent company. Concord had assets of Dollars 2.17bn in December 1991, and analysts had considered further provisions to be inevitable. The latest charge was taken in the quarter ended September 1992. HSBC has appointed Mr Matthew Colasanti as president and chief executive for Concord. However, Mr David Budd, a senior HSBC executive from Hong Kong, has been appointed chief operating officer. HSBC said that Concord planned to remain active in the leasing business, despite the impact of the US recession. Since HSBC's successful takeover of Midland in June it has also taken a Dollars 187.5m provision against its exposure to Olympia &amp; York. The banking group made total provisions of HKDollars 4.48bn (Pounds 381m) against bad and doubtful debts at the interim stage.</p>

The agreement was signed following talks between Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Crimean Vice-Premier  Yevgeniy Saburov. This is a framework agreement laying a  foundation to the restoration of close trade and economic  cooperation between Russian and Crimean enterprises and  partners. The agreement was sighed by the Vice-Premier of the  Russian Government Sergey Shakhray and his Crimean counterpart,  Yevgeniy Saburov.    "We are considerably falling behind Ukraine which has  already  established trade and economic cooperation with a number of  subjects of the Russian Federation and signed the necessary  documents," Shakhray told journalists upon completion of the  signing ceremony. The agreement, drawn in strict conformity with  Ukrainian laws, will make it clear both to residents of Russia  and Ukraine that their governments have embarked upon the course  of close cooperation, shakhray said.    For his part, Saburov said that the signed document lifts  the  problem of mutual payments and many other unjustified barriers  which existed for Russian and Crimean trade and economic  partners and those wishing to have a rest in the former Soviet  resort region.    As for holiday makers, the Crimean Government reached an  oral  agreement with Kiev on considerably facilitating a customs  inspection procedure for those arriving in the Crimea. The  Crimean vice-premier pointed out that it is too early yet to  speak about the Crimea joining the rouble zone. However, he  invited all those wishing to have a rest in the Crimea to visit  Crimean resorts, adding that they will feel comfortable there  with "Russian roubles."</p>

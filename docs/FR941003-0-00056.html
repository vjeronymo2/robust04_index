			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 73. One comment suggested revising proposed &sect;314.107(c) to state that the 180-day exclusivity period does not apply to delay the effective date of approval of licensees to the NDA holder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, FDA does not believe that an ANDA applicant who has made a paragraph IV certification and obtained a patent license should be able to circumvent a 180-day exclusivity period. Consequently, the agency declines to amend the provision as requested by the comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 74. Two comments would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to extend the 45-day period in which patent owners have to file suit against an ANDA applicant. The proposal referred to the statutory 45-day period in which a patent owner would have to file suit against an ANDA applicant. The comments would extend the 45-day period upon request or when the ANDA applicant and the patent owner agree to an extension.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to accept the comments' suggestion. The 45-day period for filing a lawsuit against an ANDA applicant is fully consistent with section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act, and the agency finds that there are sound policy reasons that outweigh extensions of the 45-day period. For example, if an ANDA applicant has provided notice to a patent owner stating that the ANDA applicant believes that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed (a paragraph IV certification), the patent owner may elect to bring suit against the ANDA applicant for patent infringement. If the suit is brought within 45 days from the date the ANDA applicant provided the notice, section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act precludes the agency from granting a final approval of the ANDA. If suit is not brought within 45 days, FDA could grant a final approval of the ANDA upon expiration of this time period, assuming that the ANDA met all applicable requirements for approval. Thus, amending the rule to provide the patent owner an extension to file suit beyond the 45-day period would not prevent the agency from approving ANDA's during the extension (because the statutory restriction against making an approval effective would no longer apply), even if the patent owner later decided to bring suit against the ANDA applicant and prevailed in that lawsuit. Such a result would waste agency and industry resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also notes that, in situations where an ANDA applicant has amended its notification to the patent owner and approved NDA holder to make it more complete, the agency may, under &sect;314.95(f), consider the 45-day period to begin on the day after the date of receipt of the amended notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c) to begin the 180-day exclusivity period ``on the first day that a court would allow non-infringing marketing (unless that decision were stayed)'' or ``30 months from receipt of notice.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency declines to revise the rule as suggested. The rule, which paraphrases the statutory language at section 505(j)(4)(B)(iv) of the act, better reflects the plain meaning of the act. Revising the rule as requested by the comment would begin the 180-day exclusivity period at the end of the 30-month period without regard to whether the applicant had commenced marketing on that date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 76. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would provide 180-day exclusivity to the first ANDA applicant to submit a complete ANDA with a paragraph IV patent certification and ``to be sued within 45 days of the patent owner's receipt of notice.'' One comment said the rule, as drafted, created an incentive for frivolous claims of patent invalidity or noninfringement because it would give ANDA applicants exclusivity even if the applicant was unsuccessful in defending against the patent owner's lawsuit. The comment would replace the phrase ``to be sued within 45 days'' with ``and to successfully defend a suit brought within 45 days.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA agrees and has amended &sect;314.107(c) accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 77. FDA received several comments regarding proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii). These provisions concerned the start of the 180-day exclusivity period. Proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(i) would begin the 180-day exclusivity period on the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug product by the first ANDA applicant who submitted a substantially complete ANDA containing a certification that the patent was invalid or not infringed and who was sued for patent infringement within 45 days after providing notice to the patent owner. Alternatively, proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) would begin the 180-day exclusivity period on the ``date a decision of the court holding the relevant patent invalid or not infringed'' if that date was earlier than the date of the first commercial marketing. One comment would revise proposed &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) to include a cross-reference to the language in &sect;314.107(b)(3) on patent litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to adopt the suggested revision. The agency believes that the meaning of &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is sufficiently clear so that the court referred to in &sect;314.107(c)(1)(ii) is the court deciding the patent infringement suit. However, for reasons stated elsewhere in this document, the agency has amended this provision to include a reference to unenforceable patents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 78. One comment would amend &sect;314.107(c), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(1)(ii) to permit an ANDA applicant to decide whether to start the 180-day exclusivity period on the date it notifies the agency that the applicant has begun commercial marketing of the drug product or to wait to see whether the court decision is appealed. If an appeal did result, the comment would permit the ANDA applicant to have the 180-day period begin when a court issues a decision on the appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

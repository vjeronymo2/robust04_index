			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Backbench concerns on sell-off eased: Post Office green paper sets out compromise option - Labour threatens summer offensive Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary yesterday appeased the doubts of Tory backbenchers with his green paper on the future of the Post Office. His campaign to privatise the Royal Mail has been dogged by the fears of Conservative MPs over the past two years. It seems, however, that the government can now confidently push ahead with the privatisation legislation in the next session of parliament. In recent months, Mr Heseltine has met backbenchers to convince them of the merits of privatising the Post Office. Yesterday's green paper reflects a compromise between his approach and the anxieties of MPs not to undermine a cherished institution. He has achieved his minimal goal of getting the government to propose a 51 per cent share flotation of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce, leaving the remainder in state hands. At the same time Tory backbenchers are satisfied with the safeguards that the government has proposed. These include statutory guarantees for the continuation of nationwide deliveries and a single national tariff. Tory MPs were also satisfied yesterday that parliament would have to pass special legislation before any sales of the government's minority shareholding could take place. Some had feared that the Treasury might push for a 100 per cent sell-off at a time when it needs to acquire additional funds to offset public borrowing. Acording to the green paper, 'preparatory work' for legislation has already begun. Some ministers have argued that it would be politically dangerous to introduce the legislation in 1996, when a general election is likely, adding to the pressure to implement changes as quickly as possible. One minister said yesterday: 'The prospects for the bill look very good indeed. A few rebels may come up out of the woodwork but nobody will vote against the principle of privatisation.' Nevertheless some uncertain voices could still be heard. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said: 'The great danger is that privatisation is a way of getting a lot of money at a time when the government badly needs it.' Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, also served notice of a 'summer offensive' against the plans. He said: 'We will make the future of the Post Office Labour's top campaign priority. Labour will turn up the summer heat on Tory MPs by taking our campaign into the rural shires who have most to lose from privatisation of the Post Office.' Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said that a privatised Post Office 'will lack proper accountability'. He added: 'How can a commercial company remain responsible to the whole nation's needs?'</p>

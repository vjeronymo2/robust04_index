			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / US imposes fines for Libya links THE US has fined six companies a total of Dollars 550,000 (Pounds 312,500) for violating sanctions against Libya imposed in 1986 for alleged Libyan terrorism in Europe. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), announcing the fines, said this was a 'warning to companies throughout the world that they may not do business with Libya from or through the United States.' OFAC also said the measures underscored the US administration's 'determination in dealing with the terrorist regime of Muammer Gadaffi.' Among companies named by OFAC were Fina Exploration Libya, a subsidiary of Petrofina; Security Pacific International Bank; Vitol SA Inc, a Houston company; Energoprojekt, based in Yugoslavia; Generale Bank in New York, and Jogobanka of Yugoslavia. The latest OFAC listings coincide with steps at the United Nations to impose limited sanctions against Libya over its refusal to hand over to the US or Britain two Libyans allegedly involved in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. US companies have been banned from doing business with some 60 commercial enterprises and two dozen individuals regarded as Libyan or Libyan-controlled. Malta has not and will not offer to host a trial of Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am airliner, an official government statement said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cairo. 'The position of the government of Malta is that it has made no offer to host any trial. Nor has it any intention to make such an offer,' said the government statement. It was clarifying remarks by Maltese foreign minister Guido de Marco, who Malta would consider a Libyan proposal to allow the two suspects to be tried on the island 'if the parties involved agreed'.</p>

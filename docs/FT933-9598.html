			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: M25 measure puts Britain en route to recovery Sir, The Confederation of British Industry, the retail trade and many others use sophisticated methods for measuring the state of Britain's economy, but we suggest the M25 motorway is a simpler test. I, and others in this company, use the M25 regularly and there was an obvious decrease in commercial traffic as the recession tightened its grip. However, in the last few months we have all commented on the way the volume of traffic is building again. Add to that the fact that, as suppliers of industrial water-filtering equipment, we are seeing a definite spurt in orders from customers with diverse interests, and we reckon the future is looking good. It would be interesting to know if others have off-beat methods of reading the economy. Ray J Beazley, managing director, Atkins Fulford, Edgworth Road, Sudbury, Suffolk CO10 6TG</p>

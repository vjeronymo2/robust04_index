			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> THEY KNOCKED HIS KNEES, BUT COLT HAS PROVED CRITICS WRONG SO FAR  </P> <P> The 2-year-old colt Takin On The Cash will take the next step on what has been  a very rich journey tonight in the trials for the $300,000 Dash For Cash  Futurity.  </P> <P> Owned by Felipe Tiscareno and trained by Caesar Dominguez, Takin On The Cash  has emerged as the dominant 2-year-old on the West Coast after winning the  Grade I Bay Meadows Futurity and the Grade I Kindergarten and nearly $185,000.  </P> <P> The 10 fastest qualifiers from tonight's trials will earn a spot in the Dash  For Cash Futurity finals June 30.  </P> <P> Takin On The Cash was purchased by Tiscareno for $52,000 as a yearling. It was  Dominguez who picked out Takin On The Cash at the Ruidoso Super Select Sale  despite the colt's knees, which might have scared off a few potential bidders.  </P> <P> "This colt is buck-kneed," Dominguez said. 'His knees are just a bit crooked. I  was thinking we may have to go up to $100,000 to buy him, but when I saw his  knees, I knew we could get him for less. That made me want him even more.'  </P> <P> The worry with many trainers with buck-kneed horses, especially young horses,  is keeping them sound during the rigors of a 2-year-old racing campaign.  </P> <P> Dominguez, however, did not share those worries about Takin On The Cash.  </P> <P> "When I first started out training all I had was cheap horses and when you have  cheap horses, you have bad-legged horses," said Dominguez, who is in a close  race with Blane Schvaneveldt for the Los Alamitos summer training title.  </P> <P> "I had plenty of buck-kneed horses and they always seemed to stay sound. I've  had perfect looking horses who couldn't run a jump. You can't go looking for  the perfect horse, they just aren't there."  </P> <P> Takin On The Cash has drawn the inside post position in tonight's second  division of the Dash For Cash Futurity trials. This second of three trials has  come up easily the toughest of the night with Kindergarten third-place finisher  Miss Strikin Jet joining Takin On The Cash in the 400-yard race.  </P> <P> A winner of the Leo Handicap earlier this summer, Miss Strikin Jet was  supplemented late into the Dash For Cash trials at a cost of $15,250 to owners  Mike and Mack Hastings.  </P> <P> Miss Strikin Jet was one of two horses to be supplemented into the trials. The  other was A One Man Band, who will run in the second trial.  </P> <P> The first Sunday afternoon racing program will take place this week, featuring  the $111,000 Dash For Cash Derby.  </P> <P> The Grade I race was originally scheduled for Saturday night, but rescheduled  when track officials obtained permission for the afternoon program.  </P> <P> The favorite probably will be the stakes-winning gelding Ourautograph. His  trainer, Bob Baffert, isn't worried about racing in the afternoon.  </P> <P> "It will be hotter in the afternoon, but that shouldn't bother anyone," Baffert  said.  </P> <P> "It really won't make much difference, but I may use it as an excuse if I get  beat."  </P> <P> A winner of $204,000, Ourautograph is unbeaten in two starts this year,  including a 21.63-second victory in his 440-yard Dash For Cash Derby trial,  fastest in the trials.  </P> <P> There is good news and bad news about the Los Alamitos program Saturday night.  </P> <P> The good news, if you happen to be a music lover, is that there will be another  prerace concert.  </P> <P> The bad news, if you happen to live next door, is that there is going to be  another prerace concert.  </P> <P> Los Alamitos' management has turned to prerace concerts in an effort to boost  attendance at the track. Two earlier concerts featuring Michael Martin Murphy  and Juice Newton were well attended, but they have caused protests by several  residents of a nearby housing tract.  </P> <P> These residents have met with track officials to express their opposition to  the live concerts, and when the Desert Rose Band performs Saturday night, there  will be more than music fans listening.  </P> <P> "We're going to have a company that reports on noise levels posted in the  housing tract," said Don Galloway, executive vice president of the track.  </P> <P> "We want to see how high these levels are so we can do something to satisfy our  neighbors. We love our neighbors, but we also love these concerts."  </P> <P> The concert is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m.  </P></p>

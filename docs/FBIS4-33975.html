			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Resendez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] At Los Pinos presidential residence, President  Salinas has announced that 80,000 Mexican teachers will be  guaranteed access to credits to purchase homes in the coming two  years. President Salinas affirmed the signing of the agreement  to finance a housing program for teachers.    [Begin Salinas recording] As I have said here, 80,000 loans,  which will be financed with some 3.900 billion new pesos, will  be granted to teachers in the coming 24 months. The federal  government, the state governments, and the national banking  system will grant these funds. [end recording]    This credit agreement came into force on 8 June and was  signed by Elba Ester Gordillo, secretary general of the National  Coordinating Board of Education Workers; Jose Madariaga Lomeli,  vice president of the Mexican Banking Association; and Jose  Angel Pescador Osuna, education secretary. Pescador noted that  the CEPA [expansion unknown] contributed 72 million new pesos to  the program. Later, in the Avila Camacho Hall, President  Salinas announced reductions in the prices of agricultural tools  and tractors of up to a 160 horsepower. These reductions seek  to strengthen the capitalization of the Mexican agricultural  sector.    [Begin Salinas recording] Reductions in the price of these  basic agricultural tools range from a minimum of 33 percent to  discounts of more than 40 percent. [end recording]    President Salinas said these discounts entered into effect  on  8 June, and announced that credit packages are available to  enable farmers to buy the equipment promptly. President Salinas  also noted the production results for the Fall-Winter period:  over 4 million tons of corn, over 3.5 million tons of wheat, and  over 350,000 tons of beans. These figures, he added, surpass  previous averages.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic </F> "exclusively for Dnevnik 2" by Dusko Petrovic on 16 June; place  not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Petrovic] Today the new government is exactly 90  days old. How would you briefly assess its work?    [Marjanovic] After 90 days, there is a stable dinar, stable  prices, a consolidated balance without a deficit on 24 July  [date as heard], increased wages, and an increase in real  consumption, as well as a standard of living that has more or  less risen. That is everything that was included in the program.    It has to be said here that I expect this to continue. I  also expect systemic laws to be implemented in the spirit of the  further realization of the program.    [Petrovic] The Serbian Government endorsed the proposed  package of taxation laws yesterday. In the speech you made  today [at the Economists' Conference in Budva], you assessed  that package as a system that is close to the taxation systems  in most developed market economies in Europe. Do you expect the  Assembly to adopt the package and to completely agree to it?    [Marjanovic] I do. These are expert issues, so I do not  believe there will be any differences if the decision is made on  the basis of expertise and of what has been presented in the  program.    There could only be some bickering among the parties.  Otherwise, I think that the draft laws in this sphere have been  drawn up well and to a professional level. After all, I saw  this confirmed by economists, our scientists today. Therefore,  I expect any debate (?in the assembly) to be like this, at  expert level, and this should be the case, so I do not think  there will be any particular resistance to it.    [Petrovic] Mr. Prime Minister, you are absolutely convinced  that the program will be fully successful. Six months have  passed and its results have contradicted the doubting Thomases.    [Marjanovic] Yes, I am convinced and I see that many of our  scientists today are optimists. I am more of an optimist, as  they have nevertheless expressed some skepticism about the  future, pointing in particular to the problem of property  transformation. However, in my opinion, many things were omitted  in the debate and we nevertheless have many chances of  succeeding, regardless of whether sanctions will be lifted or  not.    [Petrovic] Thank you very much.    [Marjanovic] Not at all.</p>

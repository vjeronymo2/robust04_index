			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Workers' benefits at risk, says union Thousands of building industry workers face losing personal pension tax benefits as a result of an Inland Revenue ruling, the GMB general union said yesterday. It has asked the Revenue to drop its insistence that one aspect of a scheme set up to enable itinerant construction workers to secure paid holidays amounts to a pension scheme. The Revenue stance means that personal pensions contracts taken out by members of the holiday scheme are invalid. This is because the holidays scheme also makes a small lump sum payment on retirement. Last year 8,200 retiring workers received Pounds 1,637 each. The Revenue is classifying these payments as primary occupational pensions. One member, Mr Thomas Healey, had his personal pension plan with Legal and General cancelled and his contributions returned with no accumulated interest and a tax demand for Pounds 1,637. He had paid Pounds 4,500 into the L&amp;G plan since taking it out in 1988. Mr Paul Kenny, the GMB's London regional secretary, said: 'Thousands of people are blissfully unaware that they are caught in this trap.' Mr Reg Steer, the scheme company secretary, said it had informed employers of the position, most recently in July after a number of people had run into problems. He said: 'We do ask the employers to pass on the information to the employees and as far as I'm aware nearly all of them do but there must be some that don't' Legal and General said last night that it would investigate Mr Healey's case. The Inland Revenue said that there had been no sudden ruling on the matter. 'The people that were running the scheme have always known the position we take on the payment,' it said.</p>

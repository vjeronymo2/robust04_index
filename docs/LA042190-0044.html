			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EID-UL-FITR  </P> <P> Eid-ul-Fitr, the Islamic festival that ends the fasting month of Ramadan, will  begin either Thursday or Friday, depending traditionally on the sighting of the  new moon's slim crescent the night before. Using calculations of the lunar  month, the Islamic Center of Southern California has announced that it will  mark the start of Eid-ul-Fitr on Thursday morning.  </P> <P> TRADITION: Very early in the history of Islam, Muslims began observing daytime  fasting during the month of Ramadan. Eid-ul-Fitr, or the "festival of breaking  the fast," celebrates the conclusion of the introspective period.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: Mosques and Islamic centers will hold prayers early on the first  morning of the festival. The family oriented celebration lasts for several  days. In Los Angeles, a now-annual Eid Carnival will be held Sunday, April 29,  at Marshall High School in the Los Feliz area.  </P></p>

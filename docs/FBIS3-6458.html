Pol Col [Police Colonel] Sanit  Miphan, of the Tourist Police, said the terrorists, most of them  Palestinians, usually arrive in Thailand through the southern  provinces by way of Malaysia. "Once they arrive in the four  southern provinces they destroy their fake Indian or Pakistani  passports and live among the local Muslims, waiting for new sets  of fake travel document," Sanit said.    Many of them specialize in the making of bombs and accept  commissions to carry out acts of terror and sabotage.  "Afterwards, they usually flee the country through the southern  provinces into Malaysia, and onto a third country using fake  passports," he said.    Sanit said several suspected terrorists were known to have  taken refuge at some time or other in Bangkok's tourist district  of Soi Nana Nua frequented by visitors from the Middle East, as  well as various mosques in Bang Rak and Phra Khanong areas. He  said police also kept a dossier on Middle Eastern gangsters  active in Soi Nana and Bang Rak areas.    A close watch was being kept on areas frequented by Middle  Eastern visitors as part of the investigation into the discovery  of a truckload of explosives yesterday. Sanit called on foreign  tourists to report to police any foreigners they suspected of  involvement in crime, and not to panic because of yesterday's  discovery.    Shortly after the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New  York City in February last year, there was speculation that some  of the terrorists involved had slipped into Thailand and taken  refuge for a time before leaving for a third country. The  officer said there was insufficient evidence to establish a link  between yesterday's discovery and the World Trade Centre tragedy.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Kingfisher moves into UK office stationery KINGFISHER, the retail conglomerate, is moving into the UK office stationery and equipment market though a joint venture with Staples Inc, the fast growing US chain. The partnership plans to open four stores in the UK next year, with each side investing up Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) initially to test the market. The stores will be based on the format Staples has developed in the US, under the name Staples The Office Superstores. In the US the stores are mainly sited out of town and sell everything from drawing pins to personal computers, aiming to combine a wide range with 'everyday low prices'. The stores also produce a catalogue and deliver orders made over the telephone, which represent under 10 per cent of its sales. Staples says that businesses with fewer than 100 employees find it 'cumbersome to shop our retail stores'. The UK office supply market is worth about Pounds 12bn but the venture is aiming at a sector worth Pounds 1.5bn a year. The market is fragmented and many of the wholesalers supplying the market make good margins. WH Smith, the high street stationers and newspaper and magazine wholesaler, has already identified the market as providing a growth opportunity. Smith has acquired a number of stationery wholesalers and recently launched a new brand in the market called Niceday. Kingfisher, which runs the Woolworth, Comet, Superdrug and B&amp;Q chains, said it had been approached by Staples, which is keen to expand outside the US. Kingfisher decided it was better to take a successful format rather than attempt to develop its own. Staples has joint ventures in Canada and Germany. Mr Thomas Stemberg, Staples chairman and chief executive, said that Kingfisher's knowledge of the UK retail market combined with Staples' expertise in office superstores 'create a sound opportunity for joint growth and expansion'. Staples opened its first superstore in 1986 and now has 168, based in the north-east, southern California and central Florida. Sales have risen from Dollars 39.7m in 1988 to Dollars 547.1m in the year to February 1. Net losses of Dollars 7.7m incurred in 1988 have turned to income of Dollars 7.9m before extraordinary credits, in 1991-92. Lex, Page 20</p>

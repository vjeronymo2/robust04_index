			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> EXHIBIT OF HO-HUM;  </P> <P> 'CALIFORNIA IMPRESSIONISM' NEVER MADE THE BIG TIME, AND A LOOK AT ITS ARTISTS'  WORKS DEMONSTRATES WHY.  </P> <P> There have been moments in history when agroup of creative visionaries have put  their hometown on the cultural map. More commonly, provincial art styles  beloved by the locals never make the big time, and for good reason. So-called  "California Impressionism" is one of those styles, a timidly conservative  attempt to capture the look of a coastal Shangri-La using techniques pioneered  by artists in France more than a generation earlier.  </P> <P> Granting the continuing public popularity of these paintings, a critic  nevertheless groans at the prospect of yet another show devoted to uninspired  images of breezy shores, rugged mountains and dreamily idle women. The  "masters" of this genre hardly seem worth differentiating from each other, and  they scarcely suffer from underexposure.  </P> <P> So why is the Laguna Art Museum bringing us "California Light: 1900-1930," an  array of 75 works by nine of these artists?  </P> <P> Well, initially it seemed as though the exhibit (on view through Jan. 6, 1991)  was going to offer a fresh, broadly sociological look at the connection between  the art and the sun-dazzled land that rapidly was filling up with newcomers  lured by tourist brochures. Even ho-hum art can be wonderfully informative  about the habits and beliefs of people living at a particular time.  </P> <P> The catalogue essays by 10 authors with expertise in a variety of fields do  cover a good deal of ground, from the phenomenon of migration to Southern  California to the way certain artists glorified a vision of passive femininity.  Yet guest curator Patricia Trenton seems to be bringing us the same old show,  livened up with a few informational tidbits about the unique whiteness of  California light.  </P> <P> Strolling through the exhibit, you don't feel you're in the midst of a  revisionist effort, or even a concerted effort to relate art to life.  Conventional documentation of the careers of the artists -- most of whom also  worked abroad and back East -- tends to cloud the issue of how the art  responded to the social and cultural climate of California. There are no  contemporary photographs to give a sense of context, no relevant wall-text  discussions of, say, the emphasis on light and color in what passed for  critical writing on art in Southern California, or the amount of leisure time  enjoyed by upper-class women of the period.  </P> <P> The paintings -- by Franz Bischoff, Maurice Braun, Alson Clark, Joseph  Kleitsch, Edgar Payne, Granville Redmond, Guy Rose, Donna Schuster and William  Wendt -- are grouped for the most part by artist. A separate gallery is set  aside for works painted in Europe by Rose, Clark and Payne, presumably to  indicate the different kinds of light they found in Madrid, Paris, Switzerland  and Giverny, where aging Impressionist Claude Monet held court.  </P> <P> Although California Impressionism marked the last hurrah of plein-air painting  -- done out-of-doors to capture instantaneous effects at the source -- the  Californians went their own independent ways, frequently distorting or  modifying the working habits and theories of their French artistic forebears.  </P> <P> Edgar Payne, for example, really was an academic painter in Impressionist's  clothing. He stayed indoors to paint detailed models of fishing boats in  Impressionist-style broken brushwork, and carefully recomposed his outdoor  sketches of mountains into idealized visions instead of trying to capture the  fleeting quality of optical sensations.  </P> <P> Actually, quite a few of the works on view are scenes of light held at bay by  parasols and porticoes, or filtered into indoor settings. Based on the evidence  in these canvases, the only people who took shelter under a roof in California  were women. With a few exceptions -- like Kleitsch's portrait of self-possessed  "Miss Ketchum" -- these lasses were a droopy lot, given to vague reveries in  pretty gowns amid the tasteful furnishings of a prosperous home.  </P> <P> Frequently, as in Clark's "Reflections" -- a semi-nude image of a young thing  staring smugly at her manicure -- the woman poses near a mirror but doesn't  look into it. The mirror, like the woman, is really there for the spectator's  pleasure in sensual accouterments.  </P> <P> As Bram Dijkstra, professor of American literature and cultural history at UC  San Diego, discusses at length in a catalogue essay, in turn-of-the-century  painting a woman was "a clever optical illusion . . . lit only by the reflected  light of the masculine sun . . . a mere echo of creativity." Such insights and  turns of phrase rescue the exhibit from the doldrums; if only the same could be  said of the paintings themselves.  </P> <P>  "California Light: 1900-1930" continues through Jan. 6, 1991, at the Laguna  Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive in Laguna Beach. Gallery hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Tuesdays through Sundays. Admission: $2 general, $1 seniors and students, free  for children under 12. Information: (714) 494-6531.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CONTROL OVER DREXEL BURNHAM UNIQUE ON WALL ST.  </P> <P> In its settlement of civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission,  the Drexel Burnham Lambert investment firm has opened the door to government  control of its operations that is unprecedented on Wall Street, and that has  rarely been seen anywhere in U.S. business, many securities experts believe.  </P> <P> Indeed, some say the government's role -- as a sort of ever-vigilant probation  officer -- more suggests the casino industry than the rules that the regulated  investment world usually faces.  </P> <P> "In their aggregate weight, these restrictions are much greater than those of  any similar settlement," said Sam S. Miller, a New York securities lawyer who  also acts as ethics ombudsman at the Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm.  "Is it too much? A lot of sophisticated people on Wall Street are wondering  about that question right now."  </P> <P> Capping the most sweeping investigation ever, the SEC and Drexel on Thursday  agreed to a settlement that, among other things, puts the firm on  administrative probation for three years, requires it to appoint senior  officials acceptable to the agency and requires Drexel to cooperate with the  government's continuing investigation.  </P> <P> If approved by a federal judge, the deal settles a 7-month-old civil action in  which the SEC accused the firm of a catalogue of securities violations in  takeover deals between 1984 and 1986.  </P> <P> The SEC has worked out big civil settlements with a number of Wall Street firms  in the past decade, including Jefferies &amp; Co., Kidder Peabody, E. F.  Hutton, First Boston Corp. and Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. But asked which  was closest to the Drexel deal in scope, John Sturc, the SEC's No. 2  enforcement official, could provide no answer.  </P> <P> "There isn't any comparison," he said.  </P> <P> The Kidder settlement illustrates the typical features of such deals. To settle  charges that it profited from trading on inside information, Kidder in 1987  hired a consultant to study how it could improve compliance with securities  laws. The firm also agreed to formulate new rules to help it reach that goal.  </P> <P> As part of its settlement, Drexel is hiring the Philadelphia-based law firm of  Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius to examine the functioning of its departments and  to propose ways to improve compliance with the rules. But in an unprecedented  twist, it is also hiring an accounting firm that will help the SEC and  prosecutors investigate the firm's past and future trading activities.  </P> <P> "To have the accounting firm in an investigative role has never been done,"  Sturc said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free Access  </P> <P> Also unprecedented, he said, was Drexel's obligation under the agreement to  provide free access of government investigators to all employees and documents.  Usually, such information can only be obtained through subpoena, he said.  </P> <P> He said no previous settlements have put firms on "administrative probation,"  to subject them to added scrutiny; nor have previous settlements limited the  ability of some employees to invest in their own firm's securities.  </P> <P> Also unusual in the SEC settlement is the appointment of an ombudsman, whose  job will be to listen to employees' concerns about possible violations and  independently investigate the accusations.  </P> <P> Some securities experts say they have seen versions of these clauses that make  Drexel's less than totally novel. But many agree that when the features are  combined with others, including the creation of an oversight committee of  outside directors, the effect is unparalleled.  </P> <P> Some aren't sure they like it.  </P> <P> Ira Lee Sorkin, a securities defense lawyer who was formerly the SEC's regional  administrator in New York, said it is not outlandish to compare such  arrangements with the aggressive regulation of the casino business that goes on  in New Jersey, for example.  </P> <P> State regulators there constantly check not only the job performance of casino  managers but also a range of miscellaneous factors, such as their contacts with  persons who have criminal ties.  </P> <P> "This sets precedent, and it may be a very dangerous one," said Sorkin.  "There's a fine line between imposing restriction and supervision and telling a  firm how to run its business."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Without a Hearing  </P> <P> He asserted that Drexel employees who ran afoul of the government could be  dismissed without even the hearing they would get if they worked for a casino.  Securities lawyer Miller said he hadn't made up his mind whether the rules were  a good idea but wondered whether the firm's employees would find the extra red  tape they required frustratingly slow. "Will some investment bankers decide  that life is just easier at the firm across the street? I don't know," he said.  </P> <P> Drexel officials have said they believe the terms will not be burdensome.  </P> <P> Another securities lawyer familiar with the deal said that despite the seeming  complexity of the terms, the settlement "probably won't be as draconian as it  looks." Depending on their inclinations, "these investigators and watchdogs  could get in everybody's way all the time, or they could be invisible, despite  all the complicated terminology here," he said.  </P></p>

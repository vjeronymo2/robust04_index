			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / World Trade News: BAA to share in design contract for HK airport HONG KONG'S Provisional Airport Authority yesterday said it had awarded a contract to Mott Connell, a local engineering group, Sir Norman Foster, the architect, and BAA, the UK's main airport operator, for detailed design of the passenger terminal and concourse complex of the colony's new HKDollars 46bn (Pounds 3.2bn) airport. The HKDollars 536m contract is a two-year fixed price, lump sum order. The predominantly UK group competed against seven other contenders. The cost of the new airport led to debate in political circles yesterday. One local politician claimed the PAA's decision to increase the distance between the airport's two runways from 900 metres to 1,525m would cost an extra HKDollars 10bn. Mr Richard Allen, the authority's chief executive officer, said the distance was the minimum between two runways to enable their independent operation. Savings would be made on building costs because the island being created for the airport would be 1,248 hectares in area, not 1,275 hectares as previously planned. Costs would be kept under constant review. If there were any overruns, the consortium was contractually bound to redesign at its own expense to bring them back into line. The award of the contract coincided with the release of a master plan for the new airport covering development up to 1997, 2010 and 2040. By 1997, the airport should consist of one runway and two terminals and handle 35m passengers a year. Later phases of development include another runway and two more airport terminals. Under the plan, by 2040 the airport will be able to handle 87m passengers a year.</p>

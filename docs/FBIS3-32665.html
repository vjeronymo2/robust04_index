			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The investigation into the arrest of 32 people in  Tuxtla Gutierrez for crimes committed during the armed conflict  continues. On this and other information, Reporter Susan Soils  talks to us from the Chiapas capital.    [Begin Solis recording] Although a reply is expected today  on  the possible release of the 32 people arrested during the armed  conflict, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for the  Federal Amnesty Process continue investigating the cases.  Meanwhile, Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary of the  Commission for Federal Amnesty Process, announced a reply will  be issued on their release soon; no date was given however.    The Indian State Council will also request the release of  2,800 inmates, detained in various Chiapas jails, among them 191  Indians, accused of common crimes, although these have no links  to the armed conflict.    Meanwhile, the State Congress decided to audit 16  municipalities in Chiapas. They acknowledge that six  municipalities currently have problems with municipal  headquarters take-over and sit-down strikes. The municipalities  in conflict are Huehuetan, Tuzantlan, Pueblo Nuevo, [name  indistinct], Copainala, (?Yopisca), and Mapastepec. The problems  have been resolved in Cacahuatan, while a sit-down strike  continues at the Civic Plaza of Tuxtla Gutierrez.    After state police dispersed members of the Citizens Civic  Front in Mapastepec, who were maintaining blockades on the  coastal road headling to the Guatemalan border, the protesters  burned the municipal palace in Mapastepec. The protesters are  demanding the current municipal council, appointed a few days  ago by the State Congress after Mayor Lucho (?Puon) Aguilar was  discharged, be dismissed.    At 1430, state police dislodged the demonstrators, who were  maintaining blockades on the Chiapas coastal road, with tear  gas. Virgilio Sanchez Roa, leader of the Party of the Democratic  Revolution in Mapastepec, reported that a person who was  attempting to flee was run over by a trailer, which then also  tried to flee.    At 1800, some members of the Civic Front moved to the  municipal palace, which had been occupied for several days, and  set fire to the building, thereby destroying all the furniture,  equipment, and archives. In Matastepec, the situations remains  tense and uncertain, given events that are taking place. Up to  now, five people have been arrested as part of the operation to  clear the road.    The demonstrators oppose the appointment of Luz Maria Cruz  Ibarra as president of the Municipal Council. Cruz Ibarra  assumed the post, replacing Lucho Puon Aguilar. [end recording]</p>

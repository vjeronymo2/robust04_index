			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disgruntled franchisees consider action Disgruntled franchisees have met to consider what action they can take after Mr Howard Hodgson, the former chairman of funeral parlour group, PFG Hodgson Kenyon International, called the receivers into his latest business venture. Receivers were appointed early last week to Prontac, a year old franchise operation, which provides a computerised book-keeping and management accounts service to small businesses through a network of 85 franchised outlets. Subsequently, Mr Hodgson called the receivers into Hodgson Securities, a holding company, after months of difficulties with trading companies in the group including Prontac. The franchisees, who paid between Pounds 12,000 and Pounds 17,000 for a franchise package and then claim they spent many thousands of pounds more trying to secure a client base, were angry that they had been kept in the dark about the company's problems. Over half of them met on Thursday to consider what action they should take. They claim that Mr Hodgson and his fellow directors failed to provide them with the marketing expertise, a computerised accounting package that worked, and the necessary support of a network of qualified accountants which they had been promised.</p>

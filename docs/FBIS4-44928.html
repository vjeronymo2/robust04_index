			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Bahr al-'Alum, member of the Executive </F> Committee of the Iraqi National Congress: "The Need for  Deploying International Observers in Iraq"]    [Text] Engulfed in crisis, the Iraqi people found a unique  champion in the person of Max van der Stoel, the UN Human Rights  Commissioner in Iraq, who took its cause to the highest  international forums and preached a message of conciliation  among nations that was missing from the international arena  since the dictatorship assumed power 25 years ago.    Since his first report three years ago, van der Stoel  reiterates the same call month after month and the more he  repeats it the wider and longer becomes the list of crimes  against individuals and groups in Iraq and the more the Special  Commissioner bumps against international unwillingness to  challenge tyranny. This unwillingness is exhibited by the same  countries that turned their backs on the Iraqi people during the  popular uprising of 1991 and whose technological weapons broke  the backs of our heroes in the Iraqi north and south.    Van der Stoel is a supporter of our great people, who will  remember him and other friends of the Iraqi people like him for  centuries to come for the positions they took. We need to  implement his recommendations today for the sake of fairness in  the world and justice in Iraq.    We have called repeatedly, and shall continue to do so, for  a  secure region in the whole of Iraq, or in any part of it that  would allow freedom to grow, as it grows and prospers today in  the north of Iraq thanks to the international protection it  enjoys.    Today, we are called upon to support and implement the  recommendations of the Special Commissioner. By calling for the  deployment of international observers to safeguard human rights  throughout Iraq, he is in effect calling for a secure zone that  would encompass all Iraqi lands--a zone where human rights are  inviolate and where the Iraqi people are not targeted for  genocide. We realize that the power and determination to do so  are lacking today, but we insist on that just demand, hoping  that we will have an opportunity in the near future to prove to  the world that human rights and freedom in Iraq are of the  essence for the stability of the region, just as oppression over  a quarter century was at the core of deterioration and wars in  and out of Iraq.    We remain hopeful today for the establishment of such a  secure zone and for deploying international observers in all of  Iraq, in our bloodied south, in our burnt regions, and in our  abused Baghdad. Today we call against standing hand-tied before  the crisis and for being diligent in seeking some means to  realize the people's aspirations for freedom and for crippling  the hand of dictatorship and staying it from oppressing and  terrorizing the Iraqis.    We have a request in this connection that only takes a  political resolution by the United Nations: deploy international  human rights observers throughout our liberated northern Iraq  and give them the official task of recording the facts and  investigating conditions in Iraq from within Iraq.    Such an assignment would derive its legality from  authorizing  the observers to guarantee that everyone respects human rights  in our Iraqi north and guarantee respect for those human rights  and the cessation of terrorist practices by the regime there.  Other assignments for the observers would be to monitor and  investigate instances of human rights violations by the regime  in regions that still suffer under it, thereby fulfilling the  commissioner's task; and to prepare for the direct coverage of  human rights monitoring in the regions and towns that achieve  liberation from dictatorship.    Such a direct implementation of the special commissioner's  recommendations will not be sufficient and will not achieve its  purpose for the time being, but it would represent a qualitative  change that would put the regime on the defensive, for the first  time since the Gulf war, about an operation linked to a  fundamental issue that has to do with the people directly. That  would restrain the regime's terrorism and atrocities and would  lend efficacy to the pragmatic deployment of observers. It would  be an accomplishment in that we would be relegating to the  international community responsibility for the people's tragedy.    As we call for deploying international human rights  observers  in Iraq, we urge the leaders of the Arab and Muslim worlds and  the UN secretary general to abandon their silence and stop  ignoring our life and death issues. Are they going to let  strangers to Arabdom and Islam, like van der Stoel, Emma  Nicholson, and others, show more concern for and interest in our  causes?</p>

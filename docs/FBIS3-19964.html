The RAF is seeking to replace the Hercules -- the workhorse  for the British forces in Bosnia -- with the C130J aircraft  bought "off-the-shelf" from America in a multi-million pound  contract.    But the Government is under pressure from the aerospace  industry to support an eight-nation consortium which wants  British backing for the Future Large Aircraft (FLA) project that  it claims would provide 10,000 British jobs over the next 10  years.    The Commons Select Committee on Defence is expected to throw  its weight behind the FLA with a report on 30 March calling for  the RAF Hercules fleet to be refurbished and the FLA consortium,  known as Euroflag, to be given government backing.    Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence, threatened  to resign if Britain pulled out of the European Fighter Aircraft  [EFA] project, but he has told colleagues he will not resign  over the FLA project.    He is ready to support the RAF. He does not believe a  replacement for the Hercules has the strategic importance of the  EFA, a high-technology project, capable of defending Britain  into the next century. However, buying from the United States  could upset trade and industry ministers, and open the  Government to attack from the aerospace industry that it would  threaten thousands of jobs. Defence ministers are braced for a  Cabinet row later this year, when a feasibility study is  completed.    British Aerospace, which forms the British part of the FLA  consortium, is lobbying hard, warning it could damage British  participation in civil aircraft projects, such as the future  generation of the Airbus.</p>

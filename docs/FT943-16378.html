			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Full Employment Debate: Hunt for broader role sparks dissent Today's conference is not just a debate about unemployment. It is also an important moment in the politics of the Trades Union Congress, David Goodhart writes. The idea for the conference - and the plan to invite business leaders and a cabinet minister - was floated when Mr John Monks took over as TUC general secretary last year. It appeared then to be part of a widely supported plan for the TUC to reach across the political spectrum to promote social partnership at work. But a demonstration outside Congress House, and the absence of several senior trade union leaders from the conference, shows that the TUC's attempt to establish a more pluralistic trade unionism is facing teething trouble. The plan to streamline the TUC's internal organisation has been implemented  -at the price of some turmoil. But the invitation to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, to the conference has been the last straw for many unions. The disapproval of a left-led union such as the TGWU general union may not be that surprising, nor an alternative event at Conway Hall organised by the Camden Trades Council. Leftwing trade unionists will, in any case, find little to cheer in the cautious background papers at the official conference. There are no instant plans for full employment and there is a great deal of orthodox economics. But even the GMB general union has objected to the invitation to Mr Hunt, and Mr John Edmonds, its moderate general secretary, has other business today. Unison, the public-service union, has also expressed its disapproval. This may be no more than an irritation to Mr Monks. After all, Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, spoke at the 1992 TUC congress and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, appeared at a TUC conference earlier this year. But it does appear to show that some of the big Labour-affiliated unions do not acknowledge that their enthusiasm for Continental-style social partnership requires a less partisan attitude.</p>

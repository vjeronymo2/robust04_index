Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SLAYING SUSPECT ARRESTED IN N.Y.  </P> <P> An Israeli sought for the December drug-related slaying of a Tarzana man has  been arrested in New York City, where he was attempting to obtain a visa to  return to his native country, police said today.  </P> <P> David Hagag, 29, apparently used a small piece of plastic to try to slash his  wrists Saturday when he learned from Israeli consul officials in Manhattan that  instead of giving him a visa, they were going to hold him for police, Los  Angeles Police Detective Rick Swanston said.  </P> <P> Hagag was not seriously hurt in the apparent suicide attempt and was jailed at  Rikers Island prison pending extradition proceedings. Hagag has been charged  with the Dec. 27 slaying of Simon Sarkissian, a Tarzana man who police say was  involved in drug dealing.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "J.I.": "Armed Forces Staff Creates Aircraft </F> and Helicopter Squadrons for Special Actions"]    [Text] A number of aircraft and helicopter crews are  currently undergoing training with a view to working for the  Special Operations Command (COS) placed under the command of the  Armed Forces chief of staff. The mission of the COS, which is  similar to that of similar units in the United States and Great  Britain, will be to carry out raids deep into enemy lines. This  was announced by COS "chief" General Maurice LePage in a  communique sent to LES CAHIERS DE MARS, a magazine published by  "Mars," an association of former higher military students.    This is the first time the head of COS has spoken on the  structure of the new unit, the need for which was felt after  France proved unable to surreptitiously go into Iraqi territory  to destroy Scud missile batteries, as was done by special U.S.  and British commandos.    Basically, in addition to its general staff, the COS  consists  of several types of special units, including the whole of the  1st Regiment of Marine Paratroopers based in Bayonne (four  companies); five marine commando units (including one unit of  naval frogmen); and one recently created unit, the 10th Air  Force Paracommando Unit (CPA 10).    These various units are qualified for missions such as air  searches, special actions into enemy lines (in forested or urban  areas), attacks against vessels at sea, reconnaissance of  beaches, naval counterterrorism, guiding aircrafts or  helicopters in hostile areas, attacking airports, or recovering  personnel lost in enemy territory.    General Le Page indicates that, if necessary, COS units can  be reinforced by commandos from the 11th Division of  Paratroopers (DP) as well as search and communication teams from  the 13th Regiment of Dragons Paratroopers (RDP), or specialists  from the 9th Marine Division (DIMA) and the 27th Alpine Division  (DA). Worth noting is the fact that the 11th Regiment of Shock  Paratroopers (RPC) and the "clandestine" civilians belonging to  the "Action" service of the DGSE [General Directorate for  External Security] remain under the latter's control and do not  belong to the COS.    A first squadron will use Puma helicopters fitted with  special equipment for all-weather missions. It could be  stationed in Evreux (Eure). A second squadron will use Transall  [transport] aircraft for all-weather, deep penetration purposes.  It could be assigned to the Poitou Wing, based in Orleans-Bricy  (Loiret), which is part of the Military Air Transport Command  (COTAM). Last, a third squadron belonging to the Alpilles Wing  based in Aix-les-Milles (Bouches-du-Rhone) will use helicopters  to recover personnel lost far behind enemy lines.</p>

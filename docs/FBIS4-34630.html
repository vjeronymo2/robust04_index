			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with former President Julio Maria </F> Sanguinetti, the leading presidential contender, by unidentified  reporter; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [BUSQUEDA] You recently signed an agreement with  the PGP [Party of the Government by the People]. Why did you  pursue such an agreement?    [Sanguinetti] First, we felt the country may have become  entrapped in an ironclad option between an already obsolete  neo-conservative concept and a populist concept of the  collective type which could push the country backwards. We felt  the pressing need to propose another option, an option that in  Uruguay has traditionally been called Battlism and in other  countries social democracy or social liberalism. The only way to  save the country from having to decide between those dangerous  options -- and when I say dangerous I am not talking about  people but about the consequences of their ideas -- was to offer  the country the option Uruguayans really want, that is, a market  economy as free as possible with the state orientating and  compensating. We felt the PGP was very close to these ideas.    Second, we felt our two movements were merely returning to  our common roots. I entered the political field in 1953, when I  was 17, together with Selmar Michelini and Manuel Flores Mora  [reference unknown]. Batlla was already in politics at that  time.    Third, we considered it essential to try to put together a  coalition capable of governing. That decision meant we needed to  unite with other groups. We went out looking for our old friends  and possible associates to embark together in this beautiful  enterprise of forming a new government to welcome the beginning  of the new century.    Fourth, we felt then -- just as we feel today -- that the  election is not yet decided in Uruguay, or in Brazil, because  the idea of the demise of world Marxism has yet to percolate  down to the local parties that follow that ideology. They are  against history, but they are a reality nonetheless.    Fifth, we considered it essential to show to the country  that  we had the capacity to unite, to agree. We wanted to stop the  endless political stories of divisions, splits, or attacks. We  want change. We want to face the challenge of involving most  Uruguayans in the belief that it is possible to improve our  standards of living and our democratic coexistence day by day,  without haste, without pause, and without hypocritical or  destructive urgency. [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] What are, in your opinion, our national  priorities?    [Sanguinetti] Without defining which points are more  important than others, we think it is essential to implement an  education reform to review the content of our education and to  prepare our youngsters for life in a more technical world.  Uruguay's future competitiveness depends on what we do now in  that field. It is also very important to recover our exporting  capacity in order to sustain genuine growth. Improvements in  this area depend on improved competitiveness. We must propose a  scheme of harmonious development and avoid having to choose  between the false options of either production or services. I  recall in the past, we were confronted with the false dilemma  between agricultural or industrial development. It the area of  social development it is essential to implement integration  policies aimed at reducing inequalities and marginalization. We  must reform the social security system with the double purpose  of assuring pensioners who live in continuous insecurity and  creating a more just and lest expensive system. These four  priorities are conditioned to the insertion of the country into  the international and regional markets.    [BUSQUEDA] How do you see the issue of social security  reform?    [Sanguinetti] For some years demographic trends have shown  that today we are living longer and better, which is excellent  and welcomed. But this, naturally, affects the social security  system, which has become a real burden on our economy. During my  administration we had two unsuccessful reform bills. During this  administration, one reform attempt failed and another was  partially successful and was included in the 1992 budget. There  were other efforts to modify the Constitution to include the  indexation concept, which was financed with the fiscal  adjustment for which we all voted. But we cannot continue to  discuss the issue forever. Pensioners deserve tranquility. We  must be able to tell them the debate has ended because the  system's future has been consolidated. Workers should have the  option of joining public or private systems, as in other  countries. The state cannot just look the other way. We will not  advance by believing the problem will be solved by adjusting  collection rates and reducing evasion. These are important  factors but they are not enough. We can continue the very unfair  system of ceilings. Naturally, a reform of this type requires  political and social maturity, a serene discussion, without  verbal terrorism, and without populist complexes.    [BUSQUEDA] Is this part of the social pact that you propose?    [Sanguinetti] It could be a very significant part of it. I,  however, think a social pact should go beyond this topic. We  must avoid sterile and tiring confrontations among workers,  managers, and the state. We must agree and progress past the  points that have been agreed everywhere else in the world.    [BUSQUEDA] What for instance?    [Sanguinetti] On increased productivity, for example, which  is essential if we are to continue to maintain our companies and  the country's competitiveness. Without it, we would be risking  jobs, not just our salaries. This does not mean we will  condition everything to productivity, but we cannot ignore the  concept.    [BUSQUEDA] Broad Front candidate Tavare Vazquez dismissed  your proposal of a "social pact" as an attempt to silence the  workers. What is you opinion on the matter?    [Sanguinetti] We regret it. He says it is time to confront,  respectfully, but confront nonetheless. He insists that we  should not have state policies. I really regret that. I do not  know if Vazquez made this statement during a discussion with his  fellow party member Danilo Astori, who proposed something  similar, or if he is arguing with us. The conclusion, however,  is the same and it is very discouraging. The culture of  confrontation has only produced problems for the country and  losses for the workers. The workers can improve their situation  with prosperity, and prosperity requires peace and investments.    [BUSQUEDA] It is said -- inside and outside the government  -- that the trade deficit is not important, that what counts is  the surplus in the balance of payments. What is your opinion of  this?    [Sanguinetti] During the previous administration exports  grew  by more than 70 percent, since when levels have remained  unchanged. The previous administration pursued an  outward-looking model, whereas this administration follows an  inward-looking policy. A country may have a trade deficit for a  few years, but it is impossible to sustain this situation  forever. A country must export to maintain its capacity to  import. To believe we can continue to import indefinitely  without increasing our exports would lead us to a most risky  situation. We already saw this during the times of the "Exchange  Rate Table" in Uruguay and Argentina back in 1981 and 1982. We  therefore have experience of this. I consider the following  essential: Does anyone believe the ability to import is not  linked to the ability to export? We want an open system that  promotes imports, but this in turn means fostering exports. If  not it will be unsustainable over time.    [BUSQUEDA] Do you believe this situation will end in a major  devaluation like it did in 1982?    [Sanguinetti] One must be very mindful of verbal terrorism.  Yet those who placed the country in jeopardy should provide you  with the answer. These are the same experts who categorically  denied there was an exchange lag last year and now they talk  about it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. They  say, of course, that it is unimportant. In the past, it was  nonexistent and now it is unimportant. This is a totally  arbitrary answer because they contend that it can be sustained  indefinitely without proving how. To explain why reserves are  high is a logical contradiction, it is tantamount to begging the  question. We already know reserves are plentiful, the important  thing is to prevent them from disappearing if the government  loses credibility.    [BUSQUEDA] The thing is that for the time being there is no  pressure on the dollar....    [Sanguinetti] ...Thank God....    [BUSQUEDA] ...and another fact is that the trade balance  only  measures goods rather than other exports like tourism. Do you  take this fact into account?    [Sanguinetti] Of course, but those have always been taken  into account. That is nothing new. The main thing is that the  balance of payments, as a whole, is already registering  problems. It is common knowledge that the inflow of foreign  capital, which was prompted by the decline in interest rates in  the United States, has been checked following their upturn. This  is the very fundamental difference between the balance of trade  and the balance of payments. Goods cannot be created overnight.  Businesses require time and organization. Capital can be  invested and withdrawn from financial placements in a matter of  seconds; it is very volatile. The wind changes direction and it  is gone. It is not I who says so -- I am not an expert --  Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has brought attention  to this issue with great concern. [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] What do you intend to do to come to grips with  the  "exchange lag" about which exporters complain? Will you devalue  the peso, increase tariffs, or implement tax refunds?    [Sanguinetti] One cannot view the issue in black and white;  either a "major devaluation" or "no devaluation at all." The  exchange rate policy, the tariff policy, and the policy on tax  refunds are three elements; there are others that can be  combined with them. The most important thing is to try to  recover competitiveness. This is my overriding concern for the  future. How will this be achieved? This is what we will have to  see at the appropriate time. Here the presence of experts is  fundamental. One cannot address the issue of the recovery of our  competitiveness by implementing an isolated measure -- not even  a major devaluation will achieve this objective if it sparks a  spiral of rising wages and prices.    [BUSQUEDA] In short, what will your exchange rate policy be  like?    [Sanguinetti] It will be basically realistic. This will be  the fundamental parameter. The exchange rate cannot be used to  excess for political reasons. Every time we did that over the  last 40 or 50 years the result was not positive.    [BUSQUEDA] If you governed now, would you devalue the peso?    [Sanguinetti] That is a question that should be exclusively  and strictly put to he who steers the economic policy.    [BUSQUEDA] And how about March 1995?    [Sanguinetti] Nobody can in all seriousness speak about that  nine months in advance. That decision depends on fundamental  international factors, interest rates, neighboring countries,  many things. Nobody can in all seriousness anticipate what will  happen.The terrible thing is that the colossal inflation in  dollars that we have has caused everybody to talk about this  issue. This reveals a very important shortcoming in the current  policy.    [BUSQUEDA] Your economic team includes, among others,  well-known members of the economic team of your presidency:  Ricardo Zerbino, Ariel Davrieux, Ricardo Pascale, and Luis  Mosca, for example. If you win the elections, will you use that  same team as of 1995?    [Sanguinetti] In the council, without a doubt, because they  have been advising the party on these important matters without  interruption since 1993. The disposition of the teams will  depend on the circumstances at that time. Younger people who  have emerged must also be heard. People from the PGP, for  example, are very valuable and will surely have interesting  contributions. [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] You have said the Broad Front is your adversary,  which provoked a rebuke from the National Party because it seems  you will exclude them from the election confrontation. What can  you say about this?    [Sanguinetti] Regrettably this is the sum of incomplete  information plus inexact interpretations. We respect everyone  equally and insist that the election has not yet been defined.  For about two years now the Broad Front has led the polls  without interruption in Montevideo, with the Colorado Party  closing every day and the National Party continuing to drop  behind. In other words, fair or not, the Colorado Party is the  only party in a position to defeat the Broad Front. Things may  change tomorrow, but this is how matters are, and have been for  some time now. At the national level matters are not the same,  but nobody can dispute the fact that the Colorado Party is the  only organization with a chance of defeating the Broad Front.  This is a dispassionate and measurable fact. [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] It seems you are making Tabare Vazquez, the Broad  Front candidate, out as "dangerous." Is that so?    [Sanguinetti] In no way.I really respect him. He had not  occupied an important public post and yet he won the Montevideo  mayoral elections and maintains his popularity. He is an  extraordinary man. He merits all my respect as a veteran  politician who knows how difficult it can be. I disagree with  many of his ideas and I disagree with the Broad Front as a  political party. But that is normal in the democratic debate. I  greatly respect and have a lot of affection for [Broad Front  Leader] General Liber Seregni, but this does not mean that I  cannot continue to disagree with the Broad Front.    [BUSQUEDA] But you gave more importance to the confrontation  with Mayor Vazquez: When he spoke of establishing a  "collectivist" society, you criticized him very harshly....    [Sanguinetti] ...it is generally said that all ideas are  respectable, but this is not so. Individuals rather than ideas  should be respected. There are loathsome ideas like racism,  which must be combated. There are despicable ideas like  collectivism, which advocates the abolition of private property.  Thus my considered opinion is that one must fight against it.    [BUSQUEDA] You have one dispute with the Broad Front and  another with the current administration, which cropped up  recently, during the election campaign. Government officials  have compared the economic results under your administration  with the present economic achievements and conclude that they  fared better than you. What do you have to say about that?    [Sanguinetti] I neither encouraged that comparison nor think  it is relevant because the important thing is the future. Yet if  one wants to look at objective economic indicators--as  government officials claim to do--we have a clear conscience.  During the four years 1985 to 1989, the GDP grew by 20.7 percent  whereas during four years under a Blanco Party administration  the GDP grew by 13 percent. While this is not bad, it is much  less than under our administration. Exports in dollar and volume  terms rose by 73 percent during my administration while now they  are stagnant. This is a most serious situation because it has  led to an all-time record defcit of $700 million annually. This  proves the driving force behind the country's economic growth,  namely the modern sector that exports and purchases technology,  has ground to a halt. Salaries -- something basic -- increased  by 30 percent in real terms under the previous administration. I  repeat -- in real terms. I am not speaking in dollar terms as is  done now. We are all aware that this is misleading when there is  a 20-percent annual dollar inflation. During President Luis  Alberto Lacalle's tenure, salaries have risen by just 3 percent  in real terms. This is a very significant difference, which  shows the fundamental contrast between adjustment with growth --  as done during the previous administration -- and a merely  financial adjustment as is done now. I think that these are  overwhelming figures, which by the way are all official.  [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas  has said that you are telling "lies," that you are engaged in  "cheap demagogy." Have you any comments on that?    [Sanguinetti] I would like to believe that it was just said  in a fit of temper. [passage omitted]    [BUSQUEDA] Another subject that led to estrangement between  you and the current administration is the policy on the Armed  Forces. President Lacalle has hinted that not "everybody" helped  when he faced problems in this area, obviously alluding to you.  What is your opinion of it?    [Sanguinetti] I acknowledge, much to my sorrow, that we had  a  difference of opinion on that issue. This should never have  happened. Unfortunately, our differences began during the period  between the two administrations when the president wanted to  appoint a Navy commander in chief who did not have the rank of  rear admiral, but was a ship-of-the-line captain. He completely  overlooked the four rear admirals on active service. I am not  crazy about the criterion of appointing the most senior in  military matters. He could have chosen the first, the second, or  the fourth, but he should not have outflanked them all,  especially when it was obvious he was trying to nominate  somebody very close him politically. That was the starting-point  of our differences. We never wanted to make them public until  they went beyond what was reasonable. As a result of the  interpellation proposed by United Batlleism Senator Carlos  Cigliutti, the Defense Minister Mariano Brito fell as he  acknowledged that a general had engaged in telephone espionage  in a case involving his colleagues. These events did not entail  a confrontation between the military and civilian powers, but  rather infighting within the Armed Forces sparked by those whom  this administration favored with a post within the government.  Moreover, the one responsible for this espionage, General Mario  Aguerrondo, presently enjoys a remunerative job -- paid in  dollars -- abroad. This has caused great damage to the general  climate within the Army. It is really most regrettable and I  hope we will be able to overcome it.    [BUSQUEDA] Do you not believe the situation improved with  the  appointment of [Army] Commander in Chief Daniel Garcia?    [Sanguinetti] I take his good intention and honest purposes  for granted. Unfortunately, his methods have sometimes led to  internal debates and questioning. This is not good because the  Armed Forces need unity and we should all help to promote this  unity. We will never build anything by fanning the flames of  controversy. The reason for our success in the transition period  was to a large extent that we always strived for unity and  professionalism.    [BUSQUEDA] The Batllist Forum has said that during this  administration the Armed Forces have been "stripped of their  professionalism" and "made to become partisan." If you won the  elections what would you do to revert this situation?    [Sanguinetti] Our administration is a good example of how it  ought to be done. The first general I had to promote was General  [Juan M.] Rebollo, the son of a Blanco Party minister, and one  of the last was Lieutenant General Garcia, when nobody expected  this promotion. We decided on it simply by rigorously analyzing  his professional merits. Any government that seeks to preserve  the Army's unity will act the same way.    [BUSQUEDA] Do you feel hostility towards the president?    [Sanguinetti] By no means. Dr. Lacalle is the president of  the Republic and I have no right to feel hostility toward him.  We may have some differences of opinion, but I have had -- and  will always have -- the greatest of respect for him both as a  person and on account of the high post he holds.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Arts: Pretty, but misjudged - Max Loppert reviews WNO's new production of Eugene Onegin IN ONEGIN, in events shaped by an exact blending of accident, whim and fatal misjudgment, the youthful hopes and dreams of all its leading characters are shown to be crushed. The pessimism of Tchaikovsky's conclusion is pitiless, the more so for having been reached by a dramatic process of illusion-stripping leavened by the aura of country ease and familial affection in which the early scenes are bathed. This is one of the most deeply affecting of all operas. Or, rather, it can be - when a just mixture of economy, tact, emotional depth and precise characterisation is seen and heard to guide the direction of its staging and score. In the new Welsh National Opera production it proves, alas, largely un-affecting. The reason is not hard to find: a production hardly more than a concatenation of arty effects, drenched in icing-sugar prettiness and, in the finale, in over-the-top melodrama. Howard Davies, a noted 'straight'-theatre director, was in charge of the WNO's similarly arty Idomeneo last season; the difference, however, is that he seems to have made a much bigger, indeed a monumental hash of Onegin. In the Royal National Theatre's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof not long ago, he showed himself a masterly judge of time, place, atmosphere and style. One of those minor mysteries that dog the performing arts is how those same properties could so comprehensively have been misjudged here. Davies obviously wanted to make this the Chekhov opera that Tchaikovsky failed to write (the collaboration between composer and playwright being, of course, one of operatic history's most tantalising might-have-beens). To achieve it he moves forward the period of Onegin to that of The Three Sisters. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that; but from the railway line surreally angled through the permanent set (by Bob Crowley) for the first two acts, one senses that this has fuelled an ill-argued attempt at Social Comment - crudely fulfilled in the third act, with its fin de siecle ball full of social-malaise doings risible in themselves and constantly contradicted by the music. Worse than this is the Hollywood-and-water romanticism imposed on the early scenes - all fluttering curtains artfully opened and closed (a lot of that, and deeply significant every time) and peasant girls twirling balletically across the stage and people sinking to the floor amidst trails of leaves and snow. The main characters - Onegin and Tatyana above all - are allotted stage actions which end up by robbing them of plausible motivation. Often, brand-new motivation of mind-boggling stupidity is supplied. Drink, if you please, drives Onegin to behave badly at the Larin party; Gremin's aria is addressed, mirabile dictu, to Tatyana as well as Onegin. To play the title part as an unshaven lout with a violent temper simply diminishes the emotional drama. Again and again one feels the dramatic momentum ebbing away, the heartfelt involvement of principals and chorus undermined, as fancy stage pictures are created. Ah well - it does look pretty. Carlo Rizzi is not, at this stage, a conductor able to restore balance through the musical delivery. This is his first Onegin, and it shows - while shapely, warm-toned orchestral playing betrays the presence in the pit of a lively musician, his whippings-up of crypto-Puccinian excitement in moments of passion denied Thursday's performance that very quality of tender expansiveness through which Tchaikovsky's musical secrets are most completely revealed. A fair amount of the David Lloyd-Jones translation got covered. The pity is that the cast, made up mostly of newcomers to the opera, could have been encouraged to deliver a great deal more: above all the greatly gifted Jason Howard (vocally a strong but unexpectedly dull Onegin), but hardly less so Peter Rose (a loud, coarse Gremin). The Larin family - mother (Penelope Walker) and daughters (Janice Watson and Yvonne Burnett) - display a pleasing similarity in vocal vibrato, and form altogether an unusually credible family unit. Miss Watson's Tatyana, her lyric soprano cool but with lovely promise of lustre and even lushness to come, is already the nearest thing WNO possesses to a 'real' Onegin performer. One international element has been added: the American Neil Rosenshein as Lensky, a role he undertook at Covent Garden seven years ago. Since then, much heavier roles have been taken into his repertory - at a price. Though Mr Rosenshein remains a touchingly communicative actor, the dryness and wobble of his louder singing were painful to hear. Welsh National Opera at New Theatre Cardiff, until 5 June, then in Bristol, Southampton, Birmingham, Oxford and Plymouth; production sponsored by Friends of WNO</p>

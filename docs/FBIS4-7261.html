			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tom Burton: "Keating: A Head of Steam and Full </F> Steam Ahead"]    [Text] There are many in Canberra who would sympathise  with Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Do Muoi. From all  accounts, the aging political leader caught Paul Keating in full  flight when they met on Tuesday in Ho Chi Minh city.    As many a Canberra minister and bureaucrat knows, Keating  fired up, arguing about an issue he has strong views about, is  an awesomely persuasive and believable figure.    With Do Muoi, it was Keating's fast-developing ideas about  the future of the West Pacific region which made the Prime  Minister passionate.    There is a veneer of poverty and deprivation in Vietnam  caused by decades of war. But Vietnamese society is highly  intellectual and sophisticated, and as one Australian official  observed, you don't get to be General-Secretary of the ruling  party in Vietnam without having considerable intelligence.    You also don't get to be party leader in a one-party State  that has been through the cathartic experiences of Vietnam,  without substantial political steel and authority.    Keating can be a diffident and socially awkward person, but  engages quickly with anyone who brings power and intellect to  their arguments and it was this meeting of minds which caused  seasoned foreign affairs officials from both sides - to claim  they had never seen anything like it.    According to witnesses, Do Muoi soon realised he was dealing  with a very unorthodox political leader and, dropping the usual  protocol-driven rules which suffocate so many  government-to-government meetings in Asia, engaged Keating in a  blunt and frank 90-minute discussion.    From all accounts it was an extraordinary meeting -- the  young assertive Western leader of a multi-party developed  capitalist State, describing a contemporary economic and  strategic vision for the region; the 77-year-old communist chief  sharing the wisdom and lessons of decades of political struggle  and war.    The meeting was extended as Do Muoi and Keating spoke on  topics as diverse as the need to reform the United Nations, the  necessity for a strong US presence in the region to placate  historical tensions, Cambodia, APEC and the advantages of  privatised infrastructure development.    Despite his anger with the media over his self-inflicted  brewing domestic controversy surrounding the acknowledgement of  Australia's war effort in Vietnam, Keating was elated with the  meeting and the genuine understandings that emerged.    In the past 12 months Keating has met all the major Asian  region leaders at least once -- and in several cases a number of  times - as part of what is undoubtedly now his major policy and  intellectual obsession: Australia's engagement with Asia.    Adopting the highly personal style that worked so  successfully with Do Muoi, Keating has embarked on a mission to  develop a series of significant diplomatic relationships with  the influential leaders of the region.    In Bangkok he had a not-dissimilar meeting with Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai and several key Thai ministers, with  Chuan inviting Keating to talk to him whenever he wanted to  raise any issues.    Thailand and Vietnam are the two most influential countries  in Indochina and Keating gave an insight to his thinking and  regional policy strategy when on Tuesday he said he wanted to  emulate with them the type of relationship he had been able to  develop with Indonesia over the past two years.    Keating's successful personal courting of Indonesia's  President Suharto -- together with the strong links foreign  ministers Gareth Evans and Ali Alatas have developed -- has  changed the entire atmospherics of Australia's previously  fractious relationship with the archipelago.    Early on, Keating recognised the political and strategic  weight of Indonesia in the region and consciously sought to  build a strong personal relationship with Suharto, even using a  meeting with US President Bill Clinton to impress on Clinton  Suharto's influence.    Similarly he sees Thailand and Vietnam as the two other key  major players in Southeast Asia and with his unique, high-energy  diplomatic style, he used his trips to the region to focus on  the key leaders in both countries -- which, unlike Indonesia,  are not concentrated on one man.    While issues such as Mabo, the republic and the long-term  unemployed remain of strong interest, it is clear that building  a complex and highly integrated relationship with the Western  Pacific region to ensure Australia's rightful place in the  region is now Keating's major intellectual obsession.    And just as he made economic reform Canberra's preoccupation  of the 1980s, Keating is making the development of economic and  strategic links with Asia the government's major focus of the  l990s.    Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke also sought to build  personal  relationships --but they were mostly with the US and China --  especially understandable in a decade where superpower rivalry  still permeated foreign policy thinking.    And while Keating is bringing enormous attention to the  region, it was Hawke who laid the groundwork through his  interest in China and initiation of APEC and the Garnaut report  on North-East Asia.    But Keating's huge policy strength is his ability to place  issues in a co-ordinated framework. It is why neo-classical  economics appealed to him so much and it is why he is now so  preoccupied by the challenge of foreign policy -- integrating  the often contradictory political, economic, strategic and  social elements into a cohesive strategy for the region.    And just as he was self-taught in economics, Keating is  using  his intense focus on the region to build from the ground up his  understanding of the area and its often complex histories and  rivalries.    Less than a year ago when visiting Korea, he was almost  surprised to be getting questions on strategic issues and his  response reflected his lack of exposure to these concerns.    Ten months later and Keating was this week lecturing the  Vietnamese on why the challenge was to keep the US economically  engaged in the region so as to keep its strategic focus on --  and with it, stability in -- the Western Pacific zone.    The key element of Keating's new regionalism is the  development of a broadbased relationship with the region as  possible through strong personal links with the leaders, backed  by ministerial councils and visits and highly active diplomatic  support.    It is unashamedly targeted at building Australia's trade and  investment prospects, with the main targets those countries  considered to have the most medium-to long-term economic upside  such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia where growth is likely  to be strongest.    This also reflects a strategic view that these countries,  via  their population size and profile, are likely to be the  significant military powers. At the same time more aid money is  being used to profile Australian proficiency and to give better  leverage on human rights, such as was the case in Vietnam.    But while human rights abuses and labour infringements are  complained about, they are pushed as part of a broader package  of what the diplomats call "constructive engagement"-- which  avoids the difficulties the US is facing now over the granting  of trade concessions in return for improvements in human rights.    Nor does Keating allow himself to get fussed if he is  dealing  with a one-party autocracy -- "you deal with them as they come,"  he said during his Indo-China visit.    This pragmatism and balance gives the policy a robustness  which to date appears to be doing the trick.    Fortunately Keating is blessed with a foreign policy  bureaucracy that as long ago as when Bill Hayden was Foreign  Minister decided to cross the line and support Vietnam and has  built an enviable reputation for activism and professionalism in  the region.    However, Keating's style is not to adopt the official brief  as if he is a lawyer for the bureaucratic establishment. When  discussing issues with officials ahead of events on the most  recent trip, he constantly asked questions, testing his  hypothesis in a socratic style of analysis.    Which means that the final position is intimately Keating's,  a position which one senior official this week described as  having "deep roots".    It is this intensity of his purpose and the passion of  Keating's mission to build Australia into the commercial and  political forums and structures of the region, which makes it  plain silly to characterise his "new regionalism" as just  another leader getting his kicks from playing international  statesman.    Indeed, the aim is to develop a situation whereby so  familiar  are the relations at both leader, ministerial and official level  that visits can be classed as working visits, with far less  formality, such as occurred with Suharto when Keating returned  from CHOGM [Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] in spring  last year.    All he has to do is keep his ever-acerbic tongue under  control.</p>

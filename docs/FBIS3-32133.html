Alejandro Pillar Borja, delegate of the Social Development  Secretariat in Chiapas, explained that the new resources will be  channeled for the exclusive support of the two sectors.    Approached by NOTIMEX after delivering a report on  priorities  to Manuel Camacho Soils, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, Pillar Borja explained that the  support does not include luxury projects.    On 1 January, groups of armed Indians seized four towns in  Chiapas State in southeast Mexico, thus prompting military  intervention and a quick conciliatory action by the government  to restore peace.    In a general way, the Indians are calling for attention to  their urgent economic, political, and social needs.    Pillar Borja stressed that "only the peasants and the  Indians  will present projects to be carried out in their places of  origin (...) to lay the groundwork for better development in  Chiapas."    The regional committees of the National Solidarity Program  (Pronasol) will be responsible for delivering and supervising  the funds.    In view of the problems caused by the conflict, Pronasol  sped  up its working plan to meet the most urgent demands of the poor  people, the official explained.</p>

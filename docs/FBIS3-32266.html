			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Denis Garcia Salinas] </F>   [Text] Granada -- The government stated clearly on 28  January it will not tolerate chaos being intensified in Managua  by a group of transporters who, that same day, called for acts  of civil disobedience and declined to attend the meeting that  ended on the morning of 29 January with an agreement that  reduces and freezes the price of fuel and diesel.    After a tour through Granada, which included visits and  meetings at private enterprises and the inauguration of a  municipal office of the Social Action Ministry, Presidency  Minister Antonio Lacayo said the government will not allow small  groups to turn the country into a state of outrageous chaos.    "Civil disobedience means chaos, and in chaos very few  people  win anything. I do not believe we can solve Nicaragua's  problems that way," the high-ranking official stated.    "I hope that is nothing more than a pressure tactic from  them  (Sandinist Labor Union) to make the negotiations advance," he  said, adding the government "has been negotiating since last  week."    Five transportation commissions--minus the pro-Sandinist CNT  [National Transportation Commission]--reached an agreement this  morning with the government for the reduction and freezing of  the price of gasoline and diesel until 31 May and 30 April  respectively.    Lacayo insisted dialogue must continue to be the "weapon"  Nicaraguans have in "this new stage." "He who resorts to another  method has been left behind in the past, and the Nicaraguan  people will withdraw their support for him."    Regarding a question about the negotiations between the  government and the International Monetary Fund, Lacayo reported  that last year the IMF, known for its harsh adjustment policies,  had recommended an "exaggerated" amount of saving that the  people could not bear.    He explained, however, that the intention is to have the  state, not the people, control its spending so that the  government will spend less, operating from the taxes it  collects, he said.    The intention is for the government to have a surplus so  that  part of the investments may come from revenues from the people,  because "we suspect foreign aid will decrease gradually, and we  Nicaraguans must be sure that we will be able to stand on our  own feet through our own effort," he added. "Therefore, we have  to start, as they say, becoming disciplined in order to live off  our own effort, and that is what it is all about," he said.    The IMF has told the government it has to save more this  year  in order to allot more funds to production so that it will take  off faster.    In principle, the government agrees with the idea of saving  but disagrees with the extremely high amounts the IMF is trying  to impose, he said.    Nevertheless, the government and IMF have been negotiating  since April and September and have agreed on a "more moderate  amount," Lacayo said, adding that "even this way, it is costing  us very much."    "We believe, however, we already have different plans,  including the privatization of part of Telcor [Nicaraguan  Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute], which will  help us achieve this goal this year."</p>

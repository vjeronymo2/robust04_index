			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Food: Small eats, China's delicious treats - Street Food / Ken Hom samples the delights of Dim Sum and market stalls, and eats better in the alleys of Beijing than in the tourist restaurants ON MY travels in China, some of my favourite 'commercial' foods (that is, not prepared at home) have been those served in snack shops, street food stalls, and roadside food carts. Many Chinese I spoke with seemed to agree that the most satisfying foods outside their homes were found in places offering xiao chi - that is, 'small eats,' or snacks. The streets and alleyways of China's cities and villages are filled with mouth-watering aromas drifting from the many food vendors who line the streets and roadside. Many of the markets are filled with these vendors. Some shoppers eat their snacks while shopping, or simply buy them to supplement their meals, perhaps to keep the children quiet while a meal is being prepared. Throughout China, soup noodles, prosaic but satisfying, constitute one of the most popular snacks. These are easy for the food vendor to prepare and there is never a lack of customers. But there are many other popular snack dishes. One of the most cherished 'small eats' throughout China is jiaozi dumplings, those wonderful boiled, fried or - less often - steamed pastries filled with meats, vegetables, garlic, scallions; each with regional touches and variations. I have eaten more of these dumplings - really a well-balanced light meal - than I care to count, and enjoyed them all. In a market in Hangzhou I have eaten thick noodles in rich soup; light, satiny rice noodle pastries in a street stall in Guangzhou; spicy noodles from a tiny food cart in Chengdu: all quickly and simply prepared, and delicious. Cooking techniques range from stir-frying to steaming. Variations also exist in what I thought were purely southern-style Chinese foods. For example, I enjoyed a rice porridge with fresh corn, with a topping of chili sauce, at several market villages in Sichuan. Wontons, dumplings wrapped in a thin noodle wrapping, are found in numerous regional forms. I have even had blanched noodles with wontons stuffed with minced pork in a hearty broth; and the famous 'congee' rice porridge - so popular in southern China - on many street corners of China. Perhaps this habitual and sustaining snacking started because for so many centuries officials and workers in the cities kept such long hours that restaurants stayed open and vendors hawked their goods until late at night, even until dawn. Much of China's legacy of street foods and vendors remained intact until the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, when it was decreed that such private entrepreneurial initiatives were too 'bourgeois,' individualistic (running against the collective efforts of the time) or otherwise retrograde to be allowed to continue. Food stalls, vendors, hawkers and even most restaurants disappeared, their employees directed into other occupations or forced to migrate. The recent policy reforms of the last decade have allowed and even encouraged the re-emergence of these venerable institutions; already, many have recovered their previous levels of culinary skill and service, as I was lucky enough to experience. In Western China, walking around the so-called 'night markets,' where delicious smoked pork treats are sold, open until the wee hours of the morning to serve night shift workers and hungry people in general, I could see that almost every identifiable part of the pig was available. Wine shops sold bowls of what is called 'white wine' - a strong potion, actually more like a vodka, brewed from a type of millet. I watched with fascination as the local people strolled into the shops for a quick drink, while others entered with jars and bottles to have these filled for home consumption. It was evident that everyone appreciated the convenience of these night markets. In Beijing, long famous for its 'small eats,' night markets and street stalls have sprouted like mushrooms since the government has allowed them back in business. I was struck by the carnival atmosphere of the street scenes, crowded with people sampling the assortments of local and regional favourites on offer to them. It is said (and I concur) that one may eat better at the sidewalk food stalls in Beijing than at most of the fancy restaurants to which tourists are shunted. Freshly-made pulled noodles are boiled and served, as are homemade jiaozi dumplings, Beijing sausage, Sichuan cold noodles, Tianjin turnovers, Lanzhou noodles, Wenzhou fishball soup and Xinjiang mutton barbecues. I sampled all of these at the Wangfujing street market in Beijing. Far away from Beijing, in Chengdu, Sichuan, a different sort of 'small eats' are consumed. A local Sichuanese friend took me to a place which specialises in typical Sichuan snacks such as Dan Dan Mian - spicy noodles tossed with chili and minced pork - which I consumed in two minutes amid the street traffic; 'pearl balls,' a sweet glutinous rice pastry; and the famous Chengdu Huntuns - dumplings known in the West as wontons, but tossed here in a marvellously spicy sauce with a good sprinkling of roasted ground Sichuan peppercorns. I also sampled a light egg crepe filled with meats, and steamed pork dumplings - all of these in the most appropriately named snack restaurant, Lona Chao Shou ('The Dragon's Eating Place'), home of fiery and assertive snacks. The best and most famous of snacks hail from the south of China, in the Guangzhou (Canton) region. This is the home of dim sum (meaning 'heart's delight' or 'to touch the heart'). It has been carried round the world by Cantonese emigrants. Guangzhou is also the home of the tea house, the ultimate in 'small eating,' specialising in snacks only - and in teas. The balmy subtropical climate of the region, with its long summery days and calm nights, creates an atmosphere of sociability in a situation of relative abundance: the Cantonese, with reason, believe that their cuisine is the best in China. They make the most of it as often as they can, and these shops are always busy. Dim sum snacks are available from early morning until the late afternoon, with the busiest times in mid-morning and mid-afternoon. Substantial breakfasts of fancy rice porridge with peanuts, meat, fish and sauces are served in this region. Noodle soups are to be had here, as elsewhere in China. But in this part of China meat is almost always included along with noodles, and dumplings in soups are common. The portions are as large as the equivalent of a light meal. Foreign foods, especially Western-style baked breads, rolls, and pastries, have been added to the selections. In the Canton region, these so-called snacks are really more than that: they comprise a very substantial late breakfast or heavy lunch. Elsewhere in China, however, dim sum remains 'small eats.' The number and variety of the Cantonese regional snacks defy description. In one tea house, more than 2,000 dim sum dishes are offered on a rotation basis. Such exquisite savoury dishes include steamed dumplings with minced pork and prawns; chicken soup with dumplings, steamed rice flour filled with assorted meats; deep-fried beancurd filled with pork and shrimp; steamed minced meat balls; and sliced beef liver with steamed shrimp dumpling. The equally impressive menu of sweet dishes includes such items as crisp and sticky sweet cake topped with almonds, bean-filled cakes, sesame balls in sweet syrup, custard tarts, and sweet red bean paste soup. In northern China these types of snacks are known as dian xin, the name referring more to sweet dessert snacks than to the savoury ones in the south; a mandarin form of dim sum. For much of China's culinary history, snacks and street foods have played a key role in Chinese social life. These places are, perhaps, akin to cafes and bars in the western world. During the Cultural Revolution there were justified fears that this feature of Chinese life would be wiped out. But more prosperous times, combined with economic reforms, have restored some part of China's food culture. And today, street food stalls and their unique brand of snacks continue their contribution to Chinese social life.</p>

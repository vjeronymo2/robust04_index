			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ELEPHANT MEMORIES THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEPHANT  FAMILY BY CYNTHIA MOSS(FAWCETT COLUMBINE: $10.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Moss offers a scholarly but highly readable account of the complex social  behavior of the elephants in Kenya's Amboseli Park.  </P> <P> In the most intriguing chapters, Moss presents evidence that these intelligent  animals have a concept of death. They bury their dead and, unlike other  animals, recognize skeletons of their own species. When elephants encounter  another's bones, they caress them with their trunks, paying special attention  to the skulls of relatives.  </P> <P> African elephants are finding those remains with alarming frequency: 80,000  elephants -- almost 10% of the total population in Africa -- are slaughtered  each year for their ivory. As elephants produce one calf every three to five  years, the species obviously can't sustain this decimation.  </P> <P> But Moss concludes that competition for space with a burgeoning human  population may pose an even greater threat. The population of Kenya is expected  to double by the end of the century, and much of the arable land in the country  is prime elephant habitat. Although Moss argues eloquently for their  protection, the extinction of the African elephant appears imminent.  </P></p>

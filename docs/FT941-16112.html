			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Damages for girl injured in car fire A seven-year-old girl who was badly burned when fire suddenly engulfed the family car, was awarded a six-figure sum in compensation yesterday in a deal agreed by lawyers. The settlement ended a civil suit in the High Court in Belfast which was brought on behalf of Melanie Grimsley against her parents and two garages after insurance companies denied liability for the incident in April 1988. Melanie's two-year-old sister Amanda died when the parked carcaught fire. The amount paid to Melanie, of Kesh, Fermanagh, was kept secret as a condition of the settlement.</p>

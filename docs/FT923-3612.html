			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Maastricht bewilders the Vosges - David Buchan visits the home town of leading No campaigner Philippe Seguin GUFFAWS break out in the Bar de La Poste, as the news is read out from the local paper that the city hall has acquired a new table. 'I didn't know the mayor was so hard pressed for furniture,' mocks one of the bar-proppers. The mayor in question is Mr Philippe Seguin, better known to millions of French since last week as the man who took on President Francois Mitterrand in single televised combat over the treaty of Maastricht. The table in question is the small round one over which the two men debated in the grand amphitheatre of the Sorbonne and which Mr Seguin has now brought to Epinal as a souvenir of his historic encounter. In fact, most of the denizens of the Bar de La Poste say they will vote Mr Seguin's way - No - in the September 20 referendum. Not because they necessarily agree with the way the neo-Gaullist RPR leader articulated his objections to the pact on European union but, mainly, because they can't make head or tail of it. 'I read it three times, and still don't really understand what it's on about,' says Mr Laurent Grosdemange, son of the bar's proprietor. He says he would like to vote Yes to portions of the treaty and No to others, and so in 10 days' time he may end up posting a blank ballot. One of his customers, a young trainee mechanic, says he may also adopt the same tactic. Why vote at all, then? 'At city hall, they keep a record of whether you have voted, and if you want something from them later on, it's better to have voted something - even blank - than nothing at all,' he says. This attitude helps explain why the level of abstentions/don't knows/won't says is still so high, nearly a third in most opinion surveys, frustrating predictions of the outcome. Clearly, then, the Mitterrand-Seguin debate was not one of those moments of heroic clarity in French history, such as used to be recorded in the 18th-19th century prints known aptly as 'les images d'Epinal', produced in the city. But, locally, if Mr Seguin has not charmed his anti-Maastricht supporters by his stand, neither has he appalled the pro-Maastricht camp in his Vosges constituency. 'I think he has taken the position for purely internal political reasons,' says Mr Gilles Bragard, a textile company head and president of the Vosges employers' federation. Mr Bragard denies that any Vosges opposition to the treaty reflects local economic difficulty and timidity in the region about opening up to international competition. 'We are beautifully placed in the Vosges to take advantage of Europe. I myself am within two hours' drive of my German, Swiss and Belgian subsidiaries,' he says. He concedes that the Vosges textile sector has lost jobs, shrinking from 20,000 to 14,000 in the past decade. If he has any reproach of EC textiles policy, it is that Brussels has not helped employers like him foot the bill  -large in France - of shedding labour and so improving competitiveness. But the Vosges shows little of the fear that 'the Germans are coming' which seems to fuel the anti-Maastricht vote elsewhere in France. This is, in a way, ironic. The fact that the region has a textile sector at all is historically due to German aggression, which after 1870 pushed many industrialists out of Alsace and into the Vosges, bringing their money and technology with them. Indeed there is some relief now that, as Mr Jacques Minier, who presides over the Vosges' economic development committee, puts it, 'the Germans are coming back'. Immediately the Berlin wall fell in 1989, German investors stopped prospecting in the Vosges. Now, he says, they are back, knowing they can find in the Vosges the sort of skilled and dedicated workforce they have realised will take a generation to produce in eastern Germany.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Alexander &amp; Alexander Alexander &amp; Alexander's shareholders must hope that the involvement of a well-informed investor like AIG marks the turn. The insurance brokers' shares are trading lower than at any time since the late 1970s. AIG's Dollars 200m investment in convertible stock should allow A&amp;A to buy reinsurance to limit its underwriting losses. Financial flexibility should also help attract a credible chief executive. But the performance of the shares thereafter depends on mangement's ability to get to grips with operational problems. Willis Coroon's last results were a reminder that conditions in US retail brokerage are unhelpful. Unlike AIG, ordinary shareholders do not have the benefit of a preferential 8 per cent yield for comfort.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Over 40 overseas  insurance companies had opened representative offices in China  by the end of February this year, according to a spokesman for  the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC).    He added that a U.S. company has been given permission to  open a hard-currency insurance business in China.    Addressing the annual conference on overseas insurance  business, which opened here this week, the deputy general  manager of the picc's international department said his company  made 732 million U.S. dollars-worth of premiums last year, an  increase of 29.8 percent over the previous year, and paid out  356 million U.S. dollars-worth in compensation, accounting for  48.76 percent of the total premiums.    He told the conference that the PICC's overseas business now  ranges from general insurance to some high-risk areas such as  aeronautics, oil exploitation and construction of nuclear power  stations.    He said all the fields available in the international market  are covered by the PICC, among which property insurance for  foreign-funded enterprises and insurance for short-term credit  and the buyer's contract responsibility are the most popular.    So far, the PICC has established two regional companies in  Hong Kong and Europe, respectively, and over 70 branches and  offices worldwide.</p>

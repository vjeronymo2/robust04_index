			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Joint venture to bid for coalfield Competition for ownership of the coal industry intensified yesterday when Wimpey, the construction group, and Powell Duffryn, the engineering and distribution company, said they plan to bid for British Coal's south Wales operations. They are to form a joint venture to combine their wholly owned coal operations employing 820 people. They said they had not ruled out an interest in other regional companies, which are predominantly opencast operations. It is understood that the venture is still considering its options for the north-east area, but has ruled out bids for the other regions - Scotland, and central north and central south in England. The venture will seek to prequalify as bidders for south Wales and the north-east by tomorrow, the closing date for applications under the privatisation process. In Wales the venture is facing competition from a management buyout team, from Ryan Group, the coal company, and possibly from others. Wimpey has contracts to operate eight opencast sites in Britain including three in south Wales accounting for about half the region's output. Powell Duffryn's coal business generated about 6 per cent of the company's Pounds 28.6m pre-tax profit in the year to March 31 1993. The company sells about 500,000 tonnes of coal a year as well as operating washing, screening and grading facilities under contract to British Coal. It operates three out of six process plants in south Wales taking coal from four opencast sites. RJB Mining, the coal company, yesterday concluded negotiations to open its third former British Coal mine under licence. Calverton is the company's second deep mine in Nottinghamshire, the other being Clipstone. RJB also operates Rossington colliery, near Doncaster. British Coal has now completed negotiations with the private sector for the re-opening of seven pits closed during the last 18 months and talks on another two are continuing. Another six mines which closed this year are being offered for sale to the private sector.</p>

According to the  statistics of the Czech Republic Police, the growth of economic  crime surpassed even the so-far most widespread property-related  crime, which rose 15.4 percent last year in comparison with  1992, and violent crime, with its increase of 6.7 percent.  Policemen specializing in this field, the number of whom  remained virtually unchanged last year, managed to solve 77.1  percent of the offenses in the sphere of economic crime (it was  83 percent in 1992).    The almost 18,500 economic offenses resulted in damages in  excess of 4.2 billion korunas [Kc] last year. Because the police  statistics cover only proven cases, the police staff  specializing in this area estimate the actual extent of the  damages to be far higher. The volume of ascertained economic  crimes will apparently continue to grow in the years to come  because many so-far-undetected cases may be discovered by the  control activity of the financial authorities. Economic crime  currently comprises primarily embezzlement and fraud, but there  is also a high percentage of larceny (including the theft of  shipments), bribery, unauthorized enterprise, smuggling, illegal  currency trading, transgression of economic discipline,  unauthorized use of vehicles that do not belong to the user, etc.    On a long-term basis, property-related crime (particularly  burglary and simple theft) dominates among its individual forms.  With its more than 327,000 cases, it represents about 82 percent  of all crimes. The total damage caused by property-related  crimes surpassed Kc9.6 billion, and only 21 percent of them have  been solved.</p>

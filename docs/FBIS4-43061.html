			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Cavaco Silva, prime minister and Social </F> Democratic Party leader, at Democratic Party Headquarters --  live]    [Excerpts] The objective of the Social Democratic Party  [PSD] in these elections was to maintain the same support when  compared with the last elections for the European Parliament in  1989. According to the latest figures available, the PSD has  gone up when compared with the last elections and according to  the latest results, the PSD has practically the same number of  votes as the Socialist Party. [passage omitted]    This good PSD result is due mainly to the excellent campaign  carried out by the PSD candidates. I would like to say here a  word of very high praise for Engineer Eurico de Melo who  campaigned with great dignity and seriousness without attacking  or insulting anyone. [passage omitted]    I am not here to say that the PSD had a great victory in  these elections. It is important to note that all parties lost  votes when compared with the last European elections. As in  other European countries, the abstention rate was extremely  high: 64.5 percent.    Contrary to what the opposition tried to achieve, the  Portuguese people did not accept that these elections have any  other significance other than the choice of MEP's [Members of  the European Parliament]. [passage omitted]    The high abstention rate reflects a certain distancing of  the  Portuguese from European matters, but it also reflects the  stability of Portuguese political life. Voters believed that it  was not a question of major national choices and that therefore  they could run the risk of not voting.    I want to congratulate all the deputies who have been  elected  to the European Parliament from the other parties. I hope that  all those elected will work together with the government to  defend Portugal's interests. Here in Portugal we can have  different stances, but abroad we must all row in the same  direction. The Portuguese Government will do its utmost to  support the Portuguese Members of European Parliament.    Last, I would like to say that tonight the Austrians have,  with a big majority, chosen to join the EC. According to the  figures available the backing for a yes vote was enormous. I  congratulate the Austrian people. They are very, very welcome  in the European Union.</p>

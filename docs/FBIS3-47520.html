			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The Agency for National  Security Planning (NSP), once a secretive intelligence  organization, is trying to readjust its role and function to  keep abreast of the country's efforts for openness and  internationalization.    The immediate reason for the change is a recent revision of  the law governing the Agency, curtailing its right to  investigate cases involving anti-communist activities and  establishing a watchdog committee in the National Assembly.    But the Agency appears to have realized that it has reached  the point where it has to switch from the practice of  supervising domestic politics to boosting the nation's  competitive power by gathering information overseas.    In other words, the Agency has to internationalize itself if  it is to serve the nation in the world arena.    Director Kim Tok set the goal for the Agency in his New  Year's message: "Let's become an international intelligence  organization in tune with the general trend for  internationalization."    Accordingly, the Agency is now in the middle of the  processes  to strengthen the functions of collecting information,  especially on business in foreign countries, after abolishing  the department that was in charge of political affairs.    Kim Tok specifically prohibited NSP agents from meddling in  domestic politics.    The Agency is also training its officials to specialize in  various fields while stepping up foreign language education for  its agents. It has already began sending NSP officials abroad  for one- year study of language and political and social  backgrounds of a country they are to be assigned to later.    The NSP is also encouraging officials to develop  associations  with Korean businessmen and intelligence agents of their  assigned countries, sources say.    Moreover, the Agency made the use of computers a requirement  for all agents and the ability to use a computer is a must for  promotion.    In addition, the NSP is working out measures to handle the  "enormous amount" of information being collected by vast  networks of Korean big businesses operating overseas and to  prevent foreigners from siphoning off Korea's own economic  information for foreign interests.    The Agency is also faced with the necessity of strengthening  its department in charge of affairs related to the National  Assembly since it no longer is be able to take advantage of the  confidentiality of Agency work under the revised law on the NSP.    What irks the Agency more than anything else in the passage  of the revised law is the abolition of the Agency's right to  investigate persons accused of not informing the authorities of  communist activities despite their knowledge or those who praise  the North Korean political system.    Initially, there was "some opposition" in the agency when  those rights were abolished, but most NSP officials have now  accepted the revision as part of "unavoidable" action on the  part of the civilian government of President Kim Yong-sam,  sources say.    Under the revised law, the Agency is barred from auditing  the  security matters of every government agency. It has also lost  the right to "coordinate business" of other governmental  agencies. As a result, it is faced with shifting some personnel  in charge of those affairs elsewhere.</p>

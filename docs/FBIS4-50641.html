			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "China Resolutely Opposes Hegemony, Power </F> Politics"]    [Text] The question of whether or not the United States  will extend the most-favored-nation trade status to China is at  a crucial moment at present. U.S. President Clinton sent a  special envoy to China to exchange views with the Chinese side a  few days ago. It is believed that this is helpful for China and  the United States to understand better each other's stances and  for the solution of the issue.    The most-favored-nation statue was originally only a common  practice in international trade and was not related to politics.  The United States has given the most-favored-nation status to  many countries on the basis of mutual benefit. Some of these  countries have a political system quite different from that of  the United States, and their concepts of culture and values are  also entirely different from those of the United States. In  some of these countries, for example, the women still have no  right to vote even today. The legal procedures of some of these  countries are also different from those of the West. However,  the United States has never linked these questions with the  most-favored-nation status of these countries. It can thus be  seen that the United States has linked the issue of human rights  or the Tibet issue with China's most-favored-status entirely out  of the political need of exerting pressure on China. This is an  expression of hegemony and power politics, and this has  naturally met with China's resolute opposition.    Chinese Premier Li Peng told visiting Brzezinski, former  U.S.  National Security Advisor, a few days ago, that China does not  seek a sphere of influence in the world and does not practice  hegemony, and China resolutely opposes other countries  practicing hegemony and power politics toward China; China does  not export its ideology or value concepts to other countries,  nor does it allow other countries to impose their ideology and  value concepts on China; and China respects the internal affairs  of other countries and does not agree to practices of other  countries of interfering in China's internal affairs or their  attempts to change the course of development of China.    These remarks by Premier Li Peng have explicitly expressed  the stance of the Chinese Government. The U.S. Government  should seriously study their meaning, proceed from the overall  situation of peace and development of the world, and properly  handle U.S.-Chinese relations.    The "Shanghai Communique" signed between China and the  United  States in 1972 put forward in an international diplomatic  document for the first time the idea of opposing hegemony, and  it has a far-reaching significance. Opposing hegemony is an  important principle of China's diplomacy. China does not seek  hegemony and also opposes other countries seeking it. A country  which keeps talking about human rights should first of all not  practice hegemony in international affairs. Hegemony is the  most serious infringement on human rights. The United States,  for example, involved itself in the war in Vietnam in the past  and brought great hardships to the Vietnamese. The American  people also suffered a great deal. Other examples were the  invasions by the USSR of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan in the  past. They were denounced by the whole world. This kind of  large-scale hegemonic acts of aggression seriously hampered the  normal social and economic life of the invaded countries and  encroached upon the national dignity of other countries. The  cold war is over, but hegemony has not disappeared from the  scene. It has been expressed in different ways, particularly in  the field of economy and trade.    In his talks with Brzezinski, Li Peng put forward a  viewpoint  that the fact that China takes economic construction as the  center and pursues an independent foreign policy of peace should  be the basic starting point for foreign observers to understand  China. China has a population of 1.2 billion people, and the  governing of such a big country should naturally be based on the  interests and desires of the overwhelming majority of the  people. Only in a stable social environment will China be able  to concentrate its attention on economic construction, and this  is China's greatest contribution to the world's development and  peace. If the views of an individual personality are taken at  every turn as the basis for observing China, the view of the  important will be overshadowed by the trivial and an erroneous  conclusion will be made. Since Clinton assumed office, his  policy toward China has appeared to be more realistic than at  the time of the election. Last year, he again held a summit  meeting with China, which has created conditions for seeking  common ground, while reserving differences, and for developing  relations between the United States and China. At a meeting with  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua not long ago, Clinton expressed the hope  of seeing a strong, stable, and prosperous China. More and more  people in U.S. political and commercial circles demand that the  authorities unhook the human rights issue from trade and give  China long-term most-favored-nation trade status. The Chinese  Government has also stated clearly that the channels for  exchanges between China and the United States are open, and the  two countries also often exchange views on various issues. So  long as the U.S. side gives up hegemony and power politics,  Sino-U.S. relations will improve and develop and this conforms  to the interests of the international community.</p>

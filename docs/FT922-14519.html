			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine charm glosses over contradictions THERE has been only one other Conservative in recent memory who has fought a general election campaign with such blinding self-belief. But then Mr Michael Heseltine always had much more in common with Mrs Margaret Thatcher than either cared to admit. To spend a day with Mr Heseltine on the campaign trail is to return from Mr John Major's Conservative consensualism to the implacable certainties of the Thatcher years. It is also to watch a political maestro rewrite history. Picture a market square in a small town at the centre of one of the Midlands marginals which will decide the outcome on April 9. Mr Heseltine sweeps along the nondescript high street with the energy of a politician half his 59 years - pumping hands, sprinkling the air with jibes against Mr Neil Kinnock and warning repeatedly that only Mr Major can pull Britain out of the worldwide slump. A group of hecklers has gathered on the edge of the square to admonish the environment secretary for the poll tax, rising unemployment and the Conservatives' careless custodianship of the welfare state. They shout and jeer. It takes Mr Heseltine, as brilliant a public speaker on the street corner as he is before the Tory faithful, all of 10 seconds to seize his chance. Here was what he has been warning about throughout the campaign: the 'mindless mob' who would again rule if Mr Kinnock grabbed power. There would be riots on the streets - look what was happening in socialist France - the economy would be brought to its knees, the ladder of Tory opportunity would be kicked away. The 'mob', a scruffy but less than threatening huddle of youths, look bemused. They pause. By the time they have caught their breath, he is settled in the front of a white Jaguar heading to yet another market square in another marginal to inject the Heseltine 'magic' into a flagging Conservative campaign. If the Conservatives lose on Thursday nobody must be allowed to say that Mr Heseltine did not campaign for victory. He has fought this election as if he, rather than Mr Major, had inherited the party leadership after the toppling of Mrs Thatcher. He has fought it as if he had been no more than an innocent by-stander in the fall of the leader who had won her party three successive general election victories. He has fought it as if he believes still that his own destiny lies in 10 Downing Street. On television and at the Central Office press conferences designed to set the agenda for each day's campaigning, Mr Heseltine has been the most visible - and consistently optimistic - of Mr Major's senior ministers. As he has led the attack on Labour's tax policies, party strategists have taken to referring to him as the Conservative shadow chancellor. Nobody has poured so much unapologetic and colourful scorn on Mr Kinnock's fitness for office. The Conservative campaign has stumbled from the outset because it has failed to build a firm enough bridge between its past and its future. Too many cabinet ministers, Mr Major among them, have agonised too openly over whether to defend the Conservative record or to promote a different future. Mr Heseltine has no such dilemma. He promotes Mr Major's vision and defends Mrs Thatcher's past with equal vigour. The two are joined seamlessly by an uncompromising political rhetoric which refuses to admit the contradictions. Back to one of those Midlands marginals. A local radio reporter has the temerity to ask whether the environment secretary has any regrets about the poll tax. He had, after all, always opposed it; and it had also laid the foundations for his challenge to Mrs Thatcher. From his reply, Mr Heseltine might have been the architect not the demolisher of the tax. 'I think people are appalled at the Labour surcharge on the poll tax. The surcharge is there because Labour members of parliament and Labour councillors have told people to break the law and refuse to pay.' A few hours later he is proclaiming the virtues of the council tax. For a moment you are persuaded that the poll tax must have been another dreadful mistake of the last Labour government rather than Mrs Thatcher's flagship. But by the time reality dawns, Mr Heseltine has long moved on to proclaim the triumphs of 13 Conservative years. The economy is stronger than it has ever been - look how Germany has been hit by the world recession. Enterprise, choice and opportunity are flourishing. The health service has tens of thousands more doctors, dentists, nurses. The number of students at polytechnics has jumped tenfold. As the environment secretary gets into his stride at an evening rally, party workers are whisked into a classless society where the 'airline workers own the airlines, ity and gas industries, bus conductors own the bus companies'. A year ago Mr Heseltine was the traitor who stabbed the leader they adored. Now he is in the vanguard of the fight to preserve her legacy. It is hard to believe that the voters are being won back by such flights from reality. The recession, NHS waiting lists and the poll tax cannot be shrugged aside so easily on the doorstep. But then the voters choose only the prime minister. If they opt for Mr Kinnock on Thursday, it may be that the Conservative party faithful will be looking for a new leader.</p>

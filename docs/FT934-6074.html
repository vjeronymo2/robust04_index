			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp market tested and offers jobs in high unemployment area Sir, You have just published a series of long and detailed letters about Thorp (November 23). If this proposal proceeds it will create in the order of 5,000 jobs in West Cumbria, which is an area of high unemployment. Not one word was devoted to the economic and employment consequences of this proposal for my constituents. I do think that any debate about Thorp must include a recognition of the economic importance of this project for those in the locality. Clearly, human and environmental safety is the paramount consideration, but simply to overlook and ignore the economic and employment implications on the west coast of Cumbria is to omit a very important and legitimate aspect of the debate. Those who do so debase their own arguments. Inglewood, MEP, Cumbria and Lancashire North, Hutton-in-the-Forest, Penrith, Cumbria CA11 9TH</p>

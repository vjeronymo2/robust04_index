			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Patten offers schools cash for technology An ambitious package of subsidies, linked to contributions from businesses, for schools which specialise in technology was announced by the education department yesterday in an attempt to encourage extra investment by industry in education. Twelve schools have raised the necessary threshold of Pounds 100,000 from about 40 local businesses and qualify for additional government funding. All business donations will be matched pound-for-pound by the government. Schools will also receive an extra Pounds 100 per pupil per year for seven years from the government - Pounds 80,000 for a typical secondary school - in return for drawing up seven-year business plans. Some plans include formal 'output' targets for improved examination results, while other schools have undertaken to increase the length of the school day and to increase the proportion of students taking science GCSEs. Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced that new technology colleges would be a 'pilot' for the scheme, which he hoped would be extended to schools specialising in business and languages, sports, art and music. The schools are expected to use the extra funding to invest in extra capital resources used for teaching science and technology. Mr Patten predicted that more than 100 other schools would apply for funding by the same route in the next two years, with further announcements expected within weeks. However, the Confederation of British Industry voiced reservations about concentrating resources for technology in specialist schools. Ms Margaret Murray, CBI education director, said: 'We want all schools to be strong in technology. We think it's as important as mathematics, science and English. Can you imagine a situation where you had a 'mathematics college' whose funding was vulnerable and dependent on business input?' She said the CBI did not believe that funding compulsory education was a business responsibility. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities attacked the government's decision to limit the new funds to voluntary-aided schools and grant-maintained schools which had opted out of local authority control. It said it was considering a legal challenge. The response from companies appears to have been much more buoyant than for the previous City Technology College initiative, in which companies were asked to fund the building of new schools on greenfield sites. That scheme was launched in 1988 and only 15 have been completed. The Garfield Weston Foundation is making Pounds 50,000 donations to 10 schools. Several companies which make technology equipment for schools are also involved. Corporate sponsors include GEC Marconi Avionics, Data Collections Systems, Motorola, Apricot Computers, Pearl Assurance, Thomas Cook, Midland Bank, ADT, Research Machines, Acorn Computers, Tandberg (UK) and Lucas Aerospace. The 12 schools, only one of which is selective, are in Basildon and Saffron Walden in Essex; Bromley in London; Camberley and Epsom in Surrey; Carlisle; Chatham in Kent; Gloucester; Nottingham; Peterborough; Sleaford in Lincolnshire; and Wolverhampton.</p>

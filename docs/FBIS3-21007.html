In late November, Carl Zeiss Jena will have delivered  the one-meter mirror telescope to be used for this purpose at  the ground station situated on the Tenerife volcanic massif.    In three years, when the ESA's ARTEMIS research satellite,  equipped with the necessary transceiver module, has been put  into a geostationary orbit, one of the most promising projects  of European space research of this decade, designated Silex  (Semiconductor Intersatellite Link Experiment) will get  underway. For the first time in the civilian domain data will be  transmitted directly via laser pulses between the French  Earth-surveillance satellite Spot 4 and ARTEMIS. On board each  satellite will be a 25-cm receiving mirror and laser operating  in the 820-nm light wavelength band. In addition, using the same  system, ARTEMIS will also be able to transmit the signals  received further on to the ground station in the Canary Islands.  From the Canaries, the data can then be transmitted by light  waveguide, copper cable, or radio, whichever method is  preferred, to subscribers worldwide.    German companies, too, especially Carl Zeiss Jena, which is  responsible for the optical elements in Silex, have received  important contracts through Dara (German Space Agency) for this  project that will, providing the general tests with ARTEMIS are  successful, be continued from late 1998 with the first  commercial communications satellites. On the occasion of the  delivery to Dara of the telescope, Dr. Elk Zittow, business  manager, stated frankly: "This has been an enormously important  contract for our astronomical instrumentation branch, which is  currently being rebuilt." The instrument, which cost roughly 2  million German marks [DM], is one of 14 contracts that the  company is presently working on for the space program. It had  been originally destined for an astronomical observatory in  Kazakhstan. Since the original customer was no longer able to  pay, Zeiss Jena modified the telescope for its new use. Anthony  Dickinson, associated with ESA's technology center, sees many  advantages in the use of laser light, which has already found  many applications on the Earth. If free transmission is  successful in orbit, not only would a reduction in energy use  become possible through the better beaming of light but a  greater degree of resistance to interference as well will be  achieved. Moreover, the limitations on the available radio  frequencies and their limited transmission capacity have  compelled the search for such new approaches.    Dr. Fritz Merkle, Carl Zeiss business manager, expressed it  this way: "An enormously important contract for our company,  whose astronomy technology department, now being built up and  directed in Jena, possesses technological know-how from both the  West's and the East's space programs."    This participation in the European Silex Project is also a  helpful contribution to the ongoing debate concerning Germany's  competitiveness as a desirable industrial site. As Prof. Ralf  Joachim, deputy business at Dara, put it: "In recent years there  has been a double digit growth rate in the electronic satellite  communications field internationally. Regrettably it has passed  Germany by." Joachim continued: "We have to break away from our  present `sub-critical' presence in the ESA; the successful  engagement in Silex provides grounds for careful optimism."    Space research and technology, which is sometimes criticized  and repeatedly threatened by funding cut-backs, truly advanced  economic developments, especially in telecommunications. In  Prof. Joachim's opinion, satellite-based data transmission plays  "a key role in maintaining and expanding the competitiveness of  our service and technological industries." A study prepared by  the Euroconsult Company estimates that the world-wide market  volume for civilian satellite communications systems will reach  US$79 billion dollars in the coming decade, of which $55 billion  alone will be for on-board systems. Of the approximately 144 new  satellites to be built in this time frame, about 36 will  originate in Europe.    It is Dara's conviction that German industry has--through  its  own efforts and with some outside funding--produced some  outstanding achievements, such as Kopernikus, TV-Sat, and  Symphonie, although, it must be admitted, with less satisfactory  commercial spin-offs than hoped for. However, the competition  remains very uneven because the United States and other  countries can help support their space programs through high  military development outlays and government technological  programs. Consequently, German companies have to be especially  innovative and advance new technologies. Optical communications  represents one shining example of just such a new technology.    The ARTEMIS scenario, which ESA believes will become the  reality after the successful conclusion of the test phase in  late 1998, should bring urgently needed advantages for  low-flying Earth reconnaissance satellites and for manned space  flights as well. The ARTEMIS relay station will not only receive  signals and transmit them in the conventional microwave manner  to Earth, but will also ascertain whether the laser system will  prove to be the preferred technique for reliable and rapid  contacts and which frequencies are best. Finally, it is also  conceivable that at some future point a laser optical system  will also find use in distant missions. "We still do not know  the practical limitations of this technology, but I'm convinced  we will hear a lot more about it in the fullness of time," Dr.  Fritz Merkle of Zeiss asserted. It is now quite clear that the  laser system, by virtue of its lower power requirements, will  permit the weight of communications equipment to be  significantly reduced. This alone will open up completely new  opportunities.    Closer at hand, of course, are the tests planned for late  1995, when the Tenerife ground station is equipped with the  Zeiss telescope. The instrument, as Mario Lopriore of the Estec  space technology center pointed out to ESA, will most probably  also be used to search for space junk. An accessory CCD camera,  using the optical system of the telescope, reportedly will be  able to detect remnant objects from older satellite or rocket  engines from the centimeter range.</p>

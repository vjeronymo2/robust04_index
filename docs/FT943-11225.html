			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Anxious wait for City on rates The Bank of England's money market operations will have an unusually large audience today as the City waits anxiously to see whether interest rates will be raised, Philip Gawith writes. Markets closed on Friday amid a frenzy of speculation after the Bank accepted bids for Treasury bills - short-term government debt - at rates of up to 5.75 per cent, half a percentage point above the level of base rates. The move was interpreted by some traders as a sign that base rates will shortly rise. The picture was confused, however, by the Bank dealing at unchanged rates in its daily operations before and after the auction. The daily activities are the customary method of indicating rate changes. Although most weekend comment seemed to favour rates staying unchanged, analysts said the picture was too confusing to make predictions. A decision to raise rates would have considerable impact, affecting a range of prices across the economy and probably having a negative impact on financial markets. While some recent economic data have hinted that inflationary pressures might be developing in the economy, justifying higher rates, many economists argue that the level of economic activity is not sufficient for a tightening of policy. Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets, described Friday's events as a chaotic situation 'which will have done the City's reputation no end of harm'. If rates are left unchanged, sterling could come under pressure. The UK currency rose quite sharply on Friday, in anticipation of higher rates, and may be vulnerable to a downward correction.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "More Arm-Twisting?"] </F>   [Text] It is easy, and tempting if one happens to be a  critic of the Congress, to attribute almost all actions of the  Narasimha Raa government to US arm-twisting. Even the Prime  Minister's acceptance of May 19 as the date of his meeting with  President Clinton is being interpreted as a meek nod to the  Americans' dictates. The government has only itself to blame if  this impression gains ground in the context of the two-day  meeting between Indian and US representatives at London.  Despite the loud denials by the Minister of State for External  Affairs, Mr R. L. Bhatia, two things are clear. The London  meeting was a suggestion from the US carrying the force of an  unrejectable proposal and the agenda of the meeting did pertain  to the US insistence on India accepting a multilateral process  for disarmament and regional security in South Asia. The May 19  summit is quite obviously designed to announce India's  concurrence with the launching of the multi-lateral process,  also known as the 5 + 2 + 2 Conference, without Mr Narasimha Rao  giving the appearance of having been forced into it by deviating  from India's declared nuclear policy of the past two decades.  The camouflaging and sugarcoating may have been worked out in  London where the Indian and American teams are giving shape and  structure to the concept. India has refused to consider earlier  proposals for regional security and de-nuclearisation of South  Asia and has so far not accepted the 5 + 2 + 2--five permanent  members of the UN Security Council, Germany and Japan and India  and Pakistan--on the ground that nuclear disarmament is not a  regional issue but a global problem.    To be fair to the Government, Mr Narasimha Rao has so far  yielded less ground on the nuclear policy front than on the  economic front. In both, the options for India are not too many.  Yet again, accepting to meet in a third country to chalk out a  bilateral summit agenda defies logic, whatever the logistical  advantages the authorities may have conjured up. India can duck  the issues but cannot dare defy the superpower initiative. As  far as domestic political fall out is concerned, Mr Narasimha  Rao's negotiating skills are to be sharpened to successfully  duck the issues. It can be done in two ways. First, India can  ask for an enlarged conference on the problems of global arms  control and rope in Russia, North Korea, Iran and a lot else  into the proposed multi- lateral process. There is no dearth of  Indian expertise and knowledge for this line of action. The  second option, possibly less objectionable to the opposition at  home, is to avoid any kind of specific commitments -- there are  any number of technical details to be sorted out -- on the NPT  and regional security proposals. The second option is not only  available but also exercisable.</p>

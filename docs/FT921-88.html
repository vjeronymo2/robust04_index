			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher gets out the clubs at the 19th hole MRS Margaret Thatcher rounded off her part in the election campaign in Essex yesterday, urging voters to elect a majority Conservative government but leaving listeners in no doubt of her less-than-wholehearted endorsement of her successors' appetite for borrowing. In a vintage but slow-starting speech at a packed Chelmsford golf club, she appealed directly to voters' pockets, arguing that 'the best hope' for lower interest rates was 'a good, sound Conservative majority'. The only alternative, she warned, was 'a socialist Labour government consisting of the Labour party and the Liberals which would be socialist. It is socialism that is falling the world over . . . just when it is falling the world over, we don't want it back here in any of its guises - full-blooded or wet.' In an address which at times took one back 10 years, the former prime minister, dressed in Tory blue, splashed vitriol on the EC social charter 'from socialist Delors and a totally non-elected non-accountable commission', and defended her National Health Service record. The charter's European advocates wanted to 'saddle' British employers with costs similar to those which they had to bear, she argued, in order to remain competitive. Family credit was a better way of supplementing the incomes of the low-paid than Labour's proposed minimum wage because it did not add to industrial costs. 'We have different ways of doing things,' she said. As in her previous campaign speeches, however, Mrs Thatcher's main theme was the necessity of 'sound finance' in government. Without it, she said, the Falklands campaign of 1982 could not have been financed from the government's contingency reserve. Her government 'did not have to borrow a penny-piece for four years in order to meet our outgoings'. In an especially pointed rejection of the Keynesian economic theories that appear to be regaining currency, she recalled that her first government had been 'very very tough' about not raising public spending 'although when you have a recession expenditure rises and income doesn't'. She said: 'To coin a phrase, you have to say no, no, no. And to coin a double phrase, you have to go on and on and on saying no, no, no.' Questioned later as to whether any of the three main parties currently espoused 'sound finance', she responded: 'We are in trouble if they don't' She added as an afterthought: 'I think we are the only one which does.' What developed into an ebullient and punchy address had got off slowly with Mrs Thatcher having to coax the first of several rounds of applause from her well-heeled and well-behaved audience. 'Come on, clap] aren't you pleased with me?' she asked. The roar which followed gave her the answer she required.</p>

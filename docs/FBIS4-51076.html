			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by reporter Li Chun (2621 2504): </F> "Beijing Encourages Foreign Firms To Invest in Large and Medium  State Enterprises But Does Not Favor Acquisition or Share  Purchases for the Time Being"]    [Text] A considerable number of state-owned enterprises in  mainland China are in dire straits. An economic and trade  official has pointed out in Hong Kong: Foreign firms are  encouraged to invest in large and medium state-owned enterprises  to conduct technological transformation, but, as the conditions  are not yet ripe, foreign investment cannot be made in the form  of share purchases.    Meng Xiangang, director of the Department of Foreign  Economic  Cooperation and Trade of the State Economic and Trade  Commission, said here yesterday that the mainland government is  studying and formulating relevant policies, and foreign firms  are encouraged to invest in large and medium enterprises for  technological transformation. The mainland government will  follow the key orientation of unequivocally encouraging foreign  investment in technological transformation in light of state  industrial policies, while drawing up corresponding measures of  encouragement in several areas, such as credit, taxation, use of  foreign exchange, and import and export administration.    Citing the example of over 5,000 new large and medium  enterprises in the 12 provinces in the northeast and the north,  Meng Xiangang said that one-third of them urgently need to  undergo technological transformation.    However, he stressed that improving the state-owned  enterprises' technological standards and helping their products  more easily respond to market needs by integrating with foreign  investment was a form of transforming the mechanism of  state-owned enterprises, which is different from allowing  foreign firms to buy up state-owned enterprises.</p>

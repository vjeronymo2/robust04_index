			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Agribusiness and finance losses put brake on Foster's FOSTER'S Brewing, Australia's dominant brewer, has ridden through continuing difficulties in its shrinking agribusiness and finance operations to record almost static earnings for the first half to December. The company yesterday announced net earnings of ADollars 183.5m (USDollars 137.9m) for the half, against a restated previous figure of ADollars 185.6m. Total revenue eased to ADollars 5.25bn from ADollars 5.46bn. The company, however, continued to record large extraordinary losses on its agribusiness and finance operations. An after-tax extraordinary loss of ADollars 106.6m, against a ADollars 80.1m loss previously, cut earnings available to shareholders to ADollars 76.9m from ADollars 105.5m. Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive, said the company would still raise the interim dividend to 3 cents a share, from 2.5 cents, taking almost 87 per cent of bottom-line earnings. The increase will doubtless be welcomed by the company's deposed chief, Mr John Elliott, whose private vehicle, International Brewing Holdings, remains Foster's main shareholder. Late last year, Mr Elliott staged a heavily-publicised attempt to reassert control over the group. He was rebuffed by the board, but not until performance targets were agreed. The Foster's result was held together by the performance of the company's overseas brewing interests: Courage in Britain and Molson in North America. Although brewing earnings jumped to ADollars 332.8m from ADollars 250.6m, the contribution from Australian brewing fell to ADollars 111.5m from ADollars 131m. The earnings star was Courage, lifting its contribution to ADollars 147.4m from ADollars 78.1m, while Molson rose to ADollars 73.9m from ADollars 41.5m. Mr Bartels described the brewing performance as 'excellent in the face of severe economic conditions'. He said the result clearly demonstrated the benefits of global spread. 'The recession in Australia, the UK and Canada has had the most severe impact on beer industry volumes for decades,' Mr Bartels said. 'To improve profitability in these conditions is a significant achievement, although the pressure will still be on for at least the next half year.' Mr Bartels said cost-cutting had helped ease the impact of the Australian recession. The Courage result was an encouraging early sign of benefits from the acquisition of GrandMet's breweries and the restructuring of the UK pub estate. 'As the UK comes out of recession and the trend to larger packaged beer volumes continues, Courage should be in a position to better exploit its good range of brands,' he said. Foster's reduced net interest payments to ADollars 85.8m from ADollars 112.3m, but depreciation provision was up to ADollars 66.8m from ADollars 47.4m. Tax took ADollars 29.4m compared with ADollars 17.7m previously.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Low poll on Guatemala reform Fewer than one Guatemalan in five voted in a referendum on constitutional reforms on Sunday, failing to provide President Ramiro de Leon with the vote of confidence he was seeking to boost his lacklustre presidency. About four-fifths of those who did vote supported the reforms sponsored by the president - to bring forward congressional elections, decentralise government spending and combat corruption - but more than 80 per cent of voters stayed at home, according to early results. Even so, Mr de Leon, who negotiated the reforms with congress in November after he had failed to purge corrupt congress members, is claiming a renewed mandate. Congressional elections will now be brought forward to this year, and a new and expanded supreme court will be chosen. But there is nothing to prevent corrupt deputies or supreme court judges being re-elected or re-nominated. Opponents from unions and popular organisations who called for Guatemalans to abstain, arguing that the reforms were merely cosmetic, said the result was a political failure for the president. 'The referendum was postponing the necessary restructuring of the state,' said Mr Byron Morales, a union leader.</p>

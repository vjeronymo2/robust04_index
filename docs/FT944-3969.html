			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pity the Norwegians, still out in the cold Sir, As an ex-Norwegian, dismayed and frustrated by my compatriots' capacity to make the same mistake twice at intervals of only 20 years, I would like to clarify some of the misconceptions expressed by our neighbour (Letters: December 6). As for the bloated bureaucracy, the total number of officials, taking all the EU institutions together, is rather less than half of the number of employees of the commune of Oslo. To take another example, the staff of the European Commission is roughly the same as that of the UK Department of Transport. For Norwegians, paying CAP prices for their food would indeed be a privilege. One of the issues during the recent referendum campaign was the wish of many Norwegians (on the No side) to continue to provide price support for the agricultural commodities produced in Norway far exceeding the levels paid by the CAP, resulting in even higher food prices than those to which EU citizens are accustomed. As for the economic blight produced by a fixed exchange rate, the catastrophic collapse of Norway's banking and insurance sector, in which Norway's leading commercial banks had to be bailed out by the government, is surely an argument for more, rather than less, external financial discipline. Finally, as a result of the referendum and, consequently, of Norway's continued membership of the rump European Economic Area (it is hard to imagine what interests are shared by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), crucial decisions relating to the Norwegian economy will now be taken by bodies in Brussels, Strasbourg and Frankfurt, in which its voice will not be heard and over whose implementation it will have not the slightest influence.

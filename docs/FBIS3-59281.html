Thus,  the bureau receives double results from changing the  enterprise's image and expanding the transport capacity. The  Shenyang railway bureau bears one-fourth of the nation's  railroad travellers departures and arrivals, and one-seventh of  the cargo's departures and arrivals. Owing to this year's  continuous increases in arrivals and departures of customers and  cargo, the conflicts between transportation capacity and  transportation quantity have become more and more serious, and  corrupt practices more and more striking. This railway bureau  holds that inadequate transport capacity and corrupt practices  are mainly reflected in "hot" lines, directions, trains and  tickets. The high demand of these "four hots" not only causes  the noted intensity in transport, but also provides a convenient  opportunity for people to engage in corrupt practices. The  corrupt practices of increasing prices and charging additional  money at will, and making profits with trains and tickets ruins  the reputation of the bureau, and at the same time blocks and  fragments transport capacity. Based on this consideration,  Shenyang bureau has closely integrated rectifying corrupt  practices with realizing transport potential. The bureau and its  sub-stations constantly send more than 230 transport and corrupt  practices working groups to important transport sections and  local bureaus of the entire system to guide and help in better  managing transport production and rectifying corrupt practices.    First, this bureau recognizes model organizational behavior  as an important aspect for rectifying corrupt practices and  accordingly builds cadre teams. The bureaus' director, Lui  Zhijun [0491 1807 6511], party committee secretary Ma Zengqing  [7456 1073 3237], and the party committee directors of the nine  sub-bureaus together signed a reward and punishment agreement  titled "Deeply Rectifying Corrupt Practices and Taking Full  Responsibility" which clearly states the two-stage goals of the  bureaus to rectify corrupt practices initially by 1 October and  finally by the end of the year. This agreement enables combining  the rectification of corrupt practices with different levels of  cadres' personal benefits. Increasing the profile of passenger  and cargo transport, improving society's supervision, and  publicly and reasonably arranging the transport capacity are  Shenyang bureau's other methods for rectifying corrupt practices  and improving transport capacity. At the beginning of September,  Shenyang bureau published an announcement in newspapers in  Liaoning and Jilin provinces stating that it will provide  information concerning transport capacity and the number of  trains to the public; on 15 September all windows of the whole  bureau's customer and cargo service sections adopted the habit  of wearing badges while working, clearly marking prices, and  publishing telephone reporting hot-line numbers in order to  accept the supervision of the entire society. Lui Zhijun, the  bureau director, said that "We should want to `accept the  people's authority,' and receive the entire society's  recognition." At the same time this bureau's main directors also  came to Liaoning and Jilin provinces, the Shenyang Military  District, and the party leadership organizations in eleven  cities (alliances and prefectures) to introduce this situation,  ask for opinions, and ensure support of production and transport  methods for the 47 state-owned "double assurance" enterprises.  Taking Liaoning province as an example, it can be seen that the  Shenyang railway bureau's modified transport capacity for the  "national team" resulted in a reduction of funds on the order of  250 million yuan. Shenyang bureau has received clear successes  in combining rectifying corrupt practices and realizing  potential transport capacity. In the first four months of this  year, the quantity of Shenyang bureau's transported goods not  only was lower than that planned by the department, but also was  more than 1.9 million tons less than that in the same period of  last year. However, starting in May, the bureaus' daily loading  and unloading records continuously improved, and entered a new  stage of increased transport capacity and income. At present,  Shenyang bureau has completely paid off its debts according to  the annual plan. The quantity of cargo transported and the  number of customers served, are all above the established annual  progress plan. A positive change from corrupt practices has made  the limited transport capacity truly realize its efficient  contribution to society, and fully attain its railway transport  potential.</p>

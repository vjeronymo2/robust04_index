			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GKN sells Australian scaffolding operation GKN, the UK engineering and automotive components group, yesterday announced it had sold its scaffolding business in Australia for ADollars 45m (Pounds 20.5m) after an unsolicited approach from a locally quoted group. The UK group has also swapped some of its loss-making Australian plant rentals branches for mobile lift equipment with Kennards Rentals of Australia, in a deal involving no cash. 'We have taken two useful steps to improve the prospects in the Australian construction market,' GKN said. The construction market was 'in dire straits' and there were few signs of improvement. GKN Kwikform, the Australian subsidiary, would still be losing money after the reorganisation. Waco International, the buyer which is already in the scaffolding business, will pay GKN ADollars 33m immediately and the balance over five years. GKN's scaffolding division had sales of ADollars 35 in 1991 and suffered a small trading loss. GKN Kwikform will be left with three divisions; the slimmed-down plant rentals business; light access equipment; and temporary accommodation units.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Pierced by disenchanted Democrats: Front-runner Clinton still dogged tenaciously by Jerry Brown THE MOST important message out of the Connecticut primary on Tuesday is an old one: Americans are fed up, disenchanted, underwhelmed, unimpressed, both with the state of their lives and with the choices offered to them by this year's crop of politicians. Thus the Democratic voters of the nutmeg state marginally preferred a man who has almost no chance of becoming president over one generally conceded at least to be in there with a shout. No matter what gloss his spin doctors put on Connecticut - and there is plenty that can be imparted - Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas, lost most by succumbing to Jerry Brown, ex-governor of California, in Connecticut. The burgeoning aura of invincibility about his candidacy has been thoroughly punctured, before much larger audiences in rough-and-tumble New York and frequently fickle Wisconsin can pass judgment two weeks hence. The ruthlessness of Mr Brown's campaign against Mr Clinton, focusing heavily on questions over the front-runner's character, paid dividends. Nearly half Connecticut's Democrats, the highest percentage in a primary so far, said they did not trust Mr Clinton, who has argued that, the more voters get to know him, the less these doubts matter. There were particular factors in Connecticut. Mr Paul Tsongas from neighbouring Massachusetts, though he pulled out of the race last week, scored 20 per cent of the vote. Had he stayed in, according to exit polls, he would have won. His disappointed supporters seem to have taken it out on Mr Clinton. The Clinton camp also makes the point that little scrutiny has been devoted to what Mr Brown is actually proposing, but a lot to what and whom he is condemning. So it promises to take him and his sketchy policies head on, in New York and Wisconsin, rather than begin to lift its sights to the ultimate battle with President George Bush. This will not be easy. New York is a political minefield, replete with the sort of religious, ethnic and social divisions and underclasses that Mr Brown is adept at exploiting. Mr Clinton's relationship with Governor Mario Cuomo of New York also leaves a lot to be desired. Already the New York media, particularly the tabloid press, have the knives out for Mr Clinton and his wife, considering him some out-of-town hick unworthy of the big league. Mr Brown is in his element as leader of 'us' against 'them', which he portrays as a shady, corrupt political hierarchy that thinks it knows best. He is beginning successfully to paint Mr Clinton as the candidate of that establishment. What Mr Clinton probably has to do is to drive home to Democrats that Mr Brown simply cannot win in November. He might use in evidence, for example, an excellent new book by two professorial brothers, Earl Black of the University of South Carolina, and Merle Black, from Emory University in Georgia. They point out that, in five out of the six post-Great Society campaigns, the Democratic candidate has done so poorly in the south that unattainable majorities of between three-fifths and two-thirds in the north were needed to win the presidency. The exception was 1976, when the candidate, Jimmy Carter, was a southerner, as is Mr Clinton. The Super Tuesday primaries in the south this month showed no regional interest in Mr Brown. This argument undoubtedly appeals to party leaders, who may now rally round Mr Clinton more publicly than they have so far or, more privately, begin to contemplate alternatives. But New York and Wisconsin are certainly not southern and are capable of thumbing their noses at the party establishment. These are, therefore, tricky times for Bill Clinton. One very prominent Washington Democrat described him this week as a man with six javelins already embedded in his flesh. The seventh might kill him, he said, or prove he has developed an immune system.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      CONNECTICUT PRIMARY RESULTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Jerry    Bill    Paul*      Pat     George                              Brown  Clinton  Tsongas  Buchanan    Bush Connecticut                   37%      36%     20%       22%       67% Delegates won Tuesday         21       22      10         0        35 Delegates won to date        150      987     439        46       750                                              *Has                                            withdrawn                                            from race  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Democratic delegates 4,288     Total Republican delegates 2,209  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

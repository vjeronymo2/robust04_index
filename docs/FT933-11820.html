			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Rome retreats on steel debts ITALY has bowed to pressure from the European Commission and withdrawn plans to write off Ecu4bn (Pounds 3bn) of debts incurred by Ilva, the state steel-maker. The Italian government's retreat offers a reprieve for the Commission's ambitious plans to restructure the tottering European steel industry. The Ilva case remains central to the EC-wide rescue plan. Earlier this month, the Commission invoked rarely used powers to order Ilva to suspend its planned write-off of past debt.</p>

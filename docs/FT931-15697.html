			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Trade News: No headway in tariff accord TARIFF negotiators from some 20 countries involved in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks met yesterday to take stock of progress towards a tariff accord, following inconclusive talks over the weekend between the US and European Community, writes Frances Williams. 'It's hard to be optimistic - we just don't seem to be making progress,' said an EC official after the meeting in Geneva which reviewed the electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and textiles sectors. The Community claims that the US offer to cut high tariffs on textiles, a critical area for many developing countries as well as for the Community, is 'absolutely minimal'. Among its demands, Washington wants Brussels to agree to eliminate tariffs on electronics goods, which it has so far refused to do. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was due to meet senior negotiators from a few key countries last night to assess prospects for a rapid conclusion of the round.</p>

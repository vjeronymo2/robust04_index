			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "AIDS Infects One Person per Day"] </F>   [Text] One person per day is being infected with the AIDS  virus in the Federal District. That figure comes from the  Hospital Foundation, which has now counted 1,070 people in the  public network's hospitals and health centers who are carriers  of the virus and 492 who have developed the disease. If that  pace continues, AIDS will be the fifth-ranking cause of death in  the Federal District within five years, in the opinion of Luiz  Bezerra, medical officer in the Department of Public Health. The  disease occupies 15th place among the chief causes of death in  the city.    Rosely Cerqueira, coordinator of the AIDS Program and  director of the Department of Public Health, believes that the  number of victims in the capital is larger than that recorded  because the AIDS Program is unaware of cases reported to private  hospitals and independent physicians. Although she considers the  situation "worrying," Rosely points out that the picture was  even worse two years ago.    Figures by the Hospital Foundation's AIDS Program show that  unlike the situation in previous years, the disease has been  spreading faster among heterosexuals and intravenous drug users  -- in the latter case because of the practice of sharing  syringes.    "AIDS is not a disease that attacks only specific groups  such  as homosexuals," Rosely Cerqueira warns. Through September 1993,  19 cases had been reported among homosexuals, compared to 36  among heterosexuals and 35 among intravenous drug users.    The capital's young and productive population is the major  victim of the disease, which is spreading among people over 15  years of age. Women have come to constitute an important segment  of the group in question. In the 1980's, there were 20 infected  men for every infected woman. For every three men carrying the  virus in the capital today, there is one infected woman.    Campaigns--The lack of information is pointed to as one of  the main reasons why the disease is spreading. "People feel that  they will never become infected with the AIDS virus," says  Marcelo Idalga, president of GAPA (AIDS Support and Prevention  Group).    To alert the public to AIDS, about 15 members of the group,  including students, government employees, and members of the  liberal professions, meet regularly to organize debates and  enlightenment campaigns. The group has also set up an AIDS hot  line (349-8000) to help AIDS victims and inform the public about  the disease.    One example cited by GAPA to illustrate the misinformation  about the disease that is heard on the hot line concerned a  woman who was desperate because she worked in the same room as a  carrier of the virus. Marcelo Idalgo [spelling variation as  published] recalls: "She believed that she could be infected  through the air."    Another recorded case was that of a man who had asked the  janitor to keep a few kegs of milk in his house and then  panicked when he learned that the man had AIDS. The rumor then  spread through the neighborhood that the milk might be  contaminated. People did not calm down until it was explained  over the AIDS hot line that the virus would never survive inside  a keg.</p>

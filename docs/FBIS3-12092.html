The satellite will be carried by a rocket of  the "Ariane" project design from the British company "Surrey  Satellite Technology" of Surrey University.    The satellite is called "Fasat-1" and is being developed by  a  group of Chilean and British aeronautic engineers. It weighs 50  kg and has four 80-centimeter sides. Initially, it will be  placed in a low polar orbit 800 km from earth. It has a useful  life span of six years.    The satellite may be launched from platforms in French  Guyana, Baykonur in Russia, or PRC platforms in Jiuquan or  Jichank.    According to the agreement signed with the British company  --  which already has launched five similar satellites and  manufactured two other ones for the ROK and one for Portugal --  two models will be manufactured. One will be put into orbit and  the other will be a prototype to check on the flight design,  develop the software, and then correct possible mistakes.    This microsatellite, as it is defined in accordance with its  international rank, will carry four experiments: communication  with remote meteorological sites, aeronautic link with planes  flying distant routes such as the Santiago-Easter Island route,  permanent monitoring of emergency signals from planes and ships  involved in accidents, and experiments with the detection of  atmospheric ozone.    The government plans to decisively incorporate space  technology into the national community and create a national  consciousness about the importance of this area as a logical  prospect for future FACH action.    This is why the government plans to stimulate educational  and  research organizations to analyze new ways of entering this  advanced field. Currently, 15 FACH officers who are taking  postgraduate courses in space sciences are working in this  program. Three of them are taking a master's course on the  subject.    As a result of the agreement with the British company, the  program has the two following stages. Immediately after the  first satellite, "Fasat-2" will be launched. It is a  constellation comprised of three microsatellites to be put into  different orbits and will be manufactured in Chile. Finally, the  "Geosat" will be launched in no more than 15 years.    The "Geosat" will ensure a national telecommunications  service based on two satellites placed in a geostationary orbit  36,000 km above the earth.    To make this initiative available nationwide later on, the  beginning of the FACH experimental conquest of space will be  explained at the Technology Pavilion of Fidae '94 [International  Aerospace Fair), which begins 20 March.</p>

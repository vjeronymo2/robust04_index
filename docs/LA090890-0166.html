			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> UNSUNG DEFENDERS COVER FOR RAMONA AS IT STOPS LINCOLN  </P> <P> The Ramona Bulldogs' monstrous offensive line was expected to dominate  Lincoln's small, but quick defensive line. But holes were hard to come by for  Ramona running backs Sarn Salmon and Tom Smith.  </P> <P> Instead, Ramona's unheralded defensive front seven took it upon themselves to  cover for their offensive line. Except for two big plays, they kept Lincoln's  wide-open offense cooped up and set up two touchdowns to give fifth-ranked  Ramona a 22-13 victory Friday night.  </P> <P> "It wasn't very pretty," Ramona Coach Mel Galli said, "but it's a starting  point. I feel very fortunate to win."  </P> <P> Lincoln Coach Vic Player, whose team lost its first game by more than 30  points, said he felt fortunate to play a respectable game.  </P> <P> "We looked like a football team for the first time this year," he said. "This  gave us a great ray of hope."  </P> <P> Despite rushing for only 20 yards in the first half, Ramona did put together a  70-yard drive capped by quarterback John Cappasola's touchdown pass to tight  end Ryan Simpson for 13 yards.  </P> <P> Ramona then took advantage of a botched Lincoln punt to get the ball on  Lincoln's three. Salmon scored on the next play, taking it in off right tackle  to make it 14-0.  </P> <P> After falling behind, 14-0, at the half, Lincoln actually had its chances to  win. Hornet wide receiver Scott Hammond broke loose to score two long  touchdowns on short out passes from quarterback Mike Temple to cut the lead to  14-13, in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Only an incomplete halfback option pass kept Lincoln (0-2) from taking the  lead.  </P> <P> After being stifled most of the game, Salmon, who finished with 110 yards in 26  carries, ran through a huge hole in the left side of the line at the Lincoln 35  for a touchdown to make it 22-13.

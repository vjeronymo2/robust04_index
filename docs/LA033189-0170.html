			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TAKESHITA AIDED BY FIRM IN SCANDAL;  </P> <P> JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER ADMITS $151,000 CAMPAIGN GIFT  </P> <P> In a revelation that could topple his government, Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita acknowledged today that the company at the center of a stock-trading  scandal bought $151,000 worth of tickets for a fund-raising party for him two  years ago.  </P> <P> Takeshita's statement that he received what amounts to sizable political  donations from the Recruit Co. is certain to increase pressure on him and his  Cabinet to step down.  </P> <P> "I have confirmed there was a purchase of tickets for the fund-raising party,"  Takeshita said in response to questions in an Upper House budget committee  session.  </P> <P> Takeshita acknowledged the amount of money Recruit Co. paid for tickets to the  May, 1987, party was "slightly excessive," but he refused to elaborate.  </P> <P> Such fund-raising parties are common among politicians and are a way of  sidestepping legal restrictions on political donations.  </P> <P> Corporations often buy a large number of tickets to show their support for  politicians. But it is "quite unusual for one company to buy 20 million yen  ($151,000) worth of tickets at once," Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro  Koizumi told reporters.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear if Recruit's ticket purchases would be considered  outright political donations and thus subject to restrictions.  </P> <P> An official of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which regulates political  donations, said the purchases would be legal "as long as the price of each  ticket is within the range of common sense and the number of tickets purchased  is within a reasonable limit that a company can possibly use."  </P> <P> Recruit, an information conglomerate, sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary at  bargain prices in late 1986 to about 150 influential politicians, bureaucrats  and businessmen, allowing them to profit handsomely when public trading began  and the shares soared in price.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ALL-RODRIGO CONCERT OPENS LA JOLLA SEASON  </P> <P> Thomas Nee and his La Jolla Civic-University Orchestra inaugurated the fall  season with a curious all-Rodrigo program Saturday night at UC San Diego's  Mandeville Auditorium. Although most local music organizations don't get in  gear until mid-October -- some are even waiting to begin after the Soviet arts  festival does its damage -- the La Jollans bravely set the pace.  </P> <P> An entire concert devoted to Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo, whose aversion  to dissonance is nearly equal to that of the typical orchestra board member, is  hardly typical of Nee's programming. Over the years, music director Nee has  favored unjustly neglected large-scale works and avant-garde orphans only a  composer could love. After some 20 years on the La Jolla podium, Nee evidently  is not willing to be bound to any pat formula.  </P> <P> For this program, the orchestra was appropriately scaled down to a generous  40-piece ensemble. After a respectable reading of the opening "Soleriana," a  sugar-coated orchestral dance suite, the evening devolved into a series of star  turns for various guest performers. Soprano Laurie Romero gave the four  orchestral songs, "Quatro Madrigali Amatorios," a rousing, stylish  interpretation that made the audience wish to hear much more of this brilliant  young singer. With impassioned declamation and sympathetic phrasing, Romero  made these Andalusian folk melodies shimmer. And her bright, full voice with  its slightly dramatic edge flaunted the fioritura of the final song "De los  alamos" with coquettish abandon.  </P> <P> Randy Pile and Alexander Dunn, two promising local guitarists, interpreted  Rodrigo's signature works, the "Concierto de Aranjuez" and the "Fantasia para  un gentilhombre" with more equivocal results. Pile projected a confident,  brightly articulated approach to the "Concierto de Aranjuez," and the orchestra  gave a solid accompaniment to this staple of the classical radio airwaves.  While Pile gracefully negotiated the intricate traceries of the lyrical middle  movement, he lost some of his momentum in the finale. This did not prevent him,  however, from playing a Rodrigo work for solo guitar as an encore.  </P> <P> In the "Fantasia," Dunn was too cautious, too reserved to make his own case for  the familiar concerto. He displayed a supple technique, but he appeared lost in  his own musical thoughts, too frequently ignoring the orchestral accompaniment.  Since it was the orchestra's poorest showing of the evening, he might be  partially forgiven for such retreats, but it contributed to a fragmented,  inconclusive performance.  </P></p>

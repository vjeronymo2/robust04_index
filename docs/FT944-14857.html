			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / IMF chief in Budapest talks Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, flew into Budapest yesterday for talks with Hungary's new Socialist-led government. The three-month-old government is drafting its 1995 budget and a three-year economic reform plan which it hopes will form the basis of a stand-by agreement with the IMF. The Fund is urging Hungary to make radical reforms in welfare spending and in fiscal policy and to cut domestic consumption in order to reduce its large budget and current account deficits and prevent the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt from rising further. When it took office the government promised swift and tough measures to tackle the country's poor economic situation. However, it has retroactively raised pensions across the board by 8 per cent from January and deferred increases in value added tax and energy prices, planned for this month, until next year.</p>

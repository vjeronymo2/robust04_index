			<p>BFN     [Text] Lisbon, May 24 (XINHUA) -- President of the  Portuguese Assembly Barbosa De Melo said here today that the  rapid development of China was of great significance not only to  China itself but also to the whole world.    He made the remarks at a meeting with a visiting Chinese  delegation headed by vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress (NPC) Wang Guangying.    De Melo spoke highly of the great progress China has made in  recent years in the economic field, particularly in agriculture.    Both sides expressed satisfaction with bilateral relations  and with their cooperation concerning Macao.    Macao is now enjoying a period of smooth transition thanks  to  the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on Macao, and people are  confident about its future, said De Melo.    The cooperation between China and Portugal on Macao should  be  viewed as an example in solving outstanding problems through  cooperation between countries, said Wang.    At a separate meeting the same day, the Chinese delegation  held talks with the economic, financial and planning committee  of the Portuguese assembly on strengthening cooperation between  the two parliaments.    The Chinese delegation arrived here on Monday.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Softer short dates SHORT DATED rates in the sterling cash market softened yesterday after the Bank of England explained how it would be rolling over the special credit facilities offered to leading institutions after its massive purchase of sterling on the foreign exchanges last week. In the afternoon, rates firmed again after dealers took most of the day to remove the Pounds 900m shortage forecast by the Bank. The overnight rate came below the base rate figure of 9 per cent after the Bank announced the terms on which it will offer credit to the major banks. The Bank's purchase of more than Pounds 10bn to support sterling on the foreign exchanges last Wednesday created a massive shortage in the money market. If the Bank had tried to remove this through its daily interventions alone, market rates would have moved to damagingly high levels. The rates offered yesterday were 9 7/32 per cent for 1 week, 9 5/16 per cent for 1 month and 9 1/4 per cent for the whole two months that the facility is offered. These roughly reflect the current market rate for cash. However, there was a lingering reluctance among traders to offer bills to the Bank at such a volatile time, and the Bank had to provide late assistance of Pounds 570m at the end of its daily intervention. The overnight rate firmed up to 11 per cent in the afternoon, while 3-month money again closed at 9 1/4 per cent on the offered side. Sterling's three pfennig fall against the D-Mark had little impact on the cash market but caused a ten basis point fall in the December short sterling contract. For the moment, dealers remain uncertain of how the currency's fluctuations affect the government's policy on rates, although several dealers said that they would only start to pay close attention to the currency if it fell below DM2.50. The December contract closed at 91.72 after closing the previous night at 91.81. The Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. Later the Bank purchased Pounds 5m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 25m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.05bn, and the Bank purchased Pounds 273m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 23m of Band 2 bank bills.</p>

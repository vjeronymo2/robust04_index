			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Without Confirmation" column by Alfonso Baella] </F>   [Text] Mr. Kim Pyong-sik has been in Lima since 20  February. He is visiting from the DPRK. Mr. Kim Pyong-sik  introduced himself as the chairman of the North Korean Social  Democratic Party's Central Committee, although this party in  reality depends on the communist Korean Workers' Party  supporting Kim Il-song's dictatorship. In fact, the strange  visitor has also been one of the DPRK vice presidents since his  election to this post on 11 December 1993.    During his visit to Lima, Kim Pyong-sik, who arrived with a  four-man entourage, met various personalities. His mission in  Lima is not exactly known, but it has been leaked that he would  afterwards tour Latin America, visiting Ecuador, Uruguay, and  eventually Paraguay and Venezuela.</p>

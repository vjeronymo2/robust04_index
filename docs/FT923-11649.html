			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Martins' recall Nice to see another old Martins Bank man being parachuted into a difficult situation. Yorkshire-born Harry Taylor, who has been put on the board of troubled Union Discount, won his wings at Liverpool's Martins Bank, as did Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive. But whereas Pearse struggled on after Barclays took over Martins, Taylor joined the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and nearly made it to the top of America's fourth biggest bank. He is not in the same class as J P Morgan chairman Dennis Weatherstone, but for many years Taylor was regarded as the most successful British banker in the US. While younger readers may never have heard of Martins Bank, it was a super little regional outfit. Barclays lost a great name when it decided to merge it into its own business.</p>

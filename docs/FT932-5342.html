			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Names barred from suing in US LLOYD'S of London yesterday claimed victory in an important legal case brought against it by dissatisfied American Names - individuals whose assets back the insurance market's business. Reaffirming a lower court decision by Judge Morris Lasker on August 18, the US Court of Appeals for the second circuit ruled that US Names should settle their disputes with Lloyd's in the English courts under English law. Approximately 120 US names had argued that the agreements they signed on joining Lloyd's contravened US securities laws. In his original verdict Judge Lasker ruled that the truly international character of membership of Lloyd's and the adequacy of remedies afforded to US Names under English law justified enforcement of the members' agreements with Lloyd's to have any Lloyd's related litigation or arbitration heard in England. The appeals court also reaffirmed the obligations of Names to arbitrate their disputes with their agents in England. The failure of the US Names' case has strengthened the resolve of Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, to hold an extraordinary meeting calling for the liquidation of Lloyd's. Mr Astor said he was halfway towards collecting the 100 Names' signatures necessary to force the meeting. Mr Astor's parents and brother have both suffered large losses at Lloyd's. 'The motivation for this is pure anger. They have all been conned,' Mr Astor said. Mr Roger Pascall, of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Lloyd's Names, said his organisation would not support the extraordinary meeting. Lloyd's said insurers had won an appeal in an important US pollution case. On Wednesday the US Court of Appeals for the third circuit upheld a lower court ruling that insurers were not liable for clean-up of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on property owned by the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation. Potential insurance claims involved are Dollars 750m (Pounds 487m), of which some Dollars 450m would have hit the London market. Since 1958 the corporation has operated a 10,000 mile-long pipeline delivering natural gas from the Gulf of Mexico to the north east of the United States. The PCBs were used as a lubricant. The corporation was ordered to clean up these sites and filed a suit against its insurers in December 1987 to show that policies issued to it between 1958 and 1987 covered clean-up costs.</p>

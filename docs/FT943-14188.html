			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chrysler profit tops expectations Chrysler yesterday provided the latest evidence of the robust recovery in the US automobile industry when it announced record profits for the second consecutive quarter. The results were at the top end of Wall Street forecasts and cheered investors, who bid the group's stock up Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Later in the session, however, the share price slid back to Dollars 49 3/8 for a net loss of Dollars  1/2 on the day. Chrysler's strong second quarter took the group's first half profits to Dollars 1.89bn, up from Dollars 1.22bn a year ago. It said it earned Dollars 956m, or Dollars 2.61 a share, in the second quarter, up from Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.55 a share, a year ago. The results beat the previous record of Dollars 938m, or Dollars 2.55 a share, achieved in the first three months of this year. Sales and revenues jumped 19 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 26.3bn, due primarily to strong US demand. Sales between April and June totalled 709,158, up from 625,295 in the previous three months. Chrysler is the first of Detroit's 'Big Three' automobile manufacturers to report its second-quarter results. Industry analysts expect Ford and General Motors to post similarly strong earnings. They point to rising sales in the healthy North American market and the recovery in Europe. Carmakers are also benefiting from cost-cutting measures. The impact of Chrysler's cost-reduction efforts is evident in the improvement over the past year in the group's measure of profit-per-vehicle, which jumped from Dollars 810 in the second three months of 1993 to Dollars 1,300 in the latest quarter. The domestic market has been so strong that Chrysler has struggled to meet demand for its most popular vehicles. Ford and GM have also struggled to supply dealers. Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman, said yesterday the group was 'carefully adding increased capacity' over the next three years. The group's share of the North American car and truck market was 15.4 per cent, unchanged from a year ago. Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services arm, reported second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 44m, unchanged from a year ago. The group also announced yesterday it had contributed another Dollars 600m to its pension fund, and was on target to wipe out its unfunded pension liability - for long a restraint on its stock and credit rating - by the end of this year.</p>

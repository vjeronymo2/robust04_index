			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muwaffaq al-Madani from Beirut: "U.S. </F> Specialists Arrive in Beirut for Investigation; Lebanese and  Palestinians Smuggle Most Dangerous Explosive Material in the  World to Lebanon"]    [Excerpt] Information has recently leaked from Beirut to  the effect that some specialized Lebanese elements have produced  gold, having acquired the red mercury substance that goes into  the production of gold when it is mixed with copper.    Available information indicates that Lebanese, Palestinians,  and four other people in one of the largest southern cities in  Lebanon, who graduated from Russian universities, have managed  to transport the red mercury substance and sell it in Lebanon.  This substance is one of the most dangerous kinds used in the  production of nuclear bombs. Western scientists say only Russia  has this substance and knows how to manufacture it in various  sizes. Its size could equal that of a hand grenade or a little  smaller.    U.S. security men, internationally specialized in tracking  down this substance, have arrived in Lebanon to keep under close  surveillance several members of the group that smuggled the  substance. A quantity of three kg of red mercury has been  seized.    As a result of expanding trade, a senior Russian Army  officer  has offered to market three kg of red mercury for $30,000.    Thus, this substance was exported to one of the ports of the  large southern Lebanese cities as part of trade commodities in a  truck.    Information indicates there have been many attempts to  market  and sell this substance on the Lebanese market, and even in the  Middle East. However, the dearth of information about this  substance and the lack of ideas about its importance and how to  use it prevented its marketing and trading. Search is now under  way in more than one Arab and foreign capital, as reported by  Russian security agencies, especially a high-level official who  arrived in the Middle East and revealed the smuggling of the red  mercury from Russia to Lebanon. The search is aimed at finding  out whether this quantity is the only amount that leaked from  Russia through this officer to Lebanese and Palestinian people  and whether there are other people in other countries who have  acquired this substance and what happened to the substance. The  nature and shape of the substance do not particularly attract  the attention of scientists and laboratory owners, since it is a  white substance that looks like fine sugar and its importance  and effectiveness have so far not been publicized.

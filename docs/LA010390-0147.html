			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'TALK TO YOURSELF' AUTHOR SELF-HELP STAR OF '90S  </P> <P> FIFTEEN MILLION copies of Dale Carnegie's "How To Make Friends and Influence  People" have been printed since it was first published in the early 1940s. It  has been called the world's most popular self-help book. Now, Shad Helmstetter,  author of the best-selling "What to Say When You Talk to Yourself" and his  current "Choices," is being groomed as the new self-help superstar.  Helmstetter's publishers, Pocket Books, feel he's got the golden Dale Carnegie  touch. They have just signed the author to a juicy four book contract, assuring  that he will indeed be "the Dale Carnegie of the '90s."  </P> <P> BRUCE WILLIS certainly isn't letting any grass grow under his feet -- only  money. After filming "Die Hard II," the sequel to the smash hit which made him  a multimillion-dollar movie star, Bruce pairs with Isabella Rossellini in  Europe for a movie. It will be a thriller entitled "Hudson Hawk."  </P> <P> SO YOU think movie people can't see any further than the end of a camera lens?  Then consider this. Actor John Malkovich, director Bernardo Bertolucci and  Bertolucci's wife, Claire Peploe, flew from the set of "Sheltering Sky" in  Morocco, to Prague, just to witness a little bit of history as Vaclav Havel was  installed as president.  </P> <P> THE ROYAL Shakespeare Company's artistic director, Terry Hands, has been asked  to consider adapting the great MGM musical "An American in Paris" for the  stage. "An American in Paris" won the Best Picture Oscar in 1951 and is  considered the apex of MGM's musical genre and of Gene Kelly's career.  </P> <P> SPEAKING OF Americans in Paris, can you guess who the biggest celebrity is in  The City of Light right now? It's the enduring Raymond Burr, over there to  shoot a new Perry Mason TV movie for NBC. All the Parisians know him, and  shouts of "Perreee!!" follow him everywhere. And this was a guy who started out  back in 1946 playing unsavory types in B movies like "San Quentin" and "Gorilla  at Large."  </P> <P> ON MARCH 25, one of the most eagerly awaited theatrical events of the season,  of the year, perhaps, will happen. That is the opening night for Peter  Shaffer's "Lettice and Lovage" which will return the incomparable Maggie Smith  to Broadway after an absence of 10 years. The two-time Oscar winner will  re-create her highly praised London performance as Lettice Douffet. Her  co-star, Margaret Tyzack, also comes from the acclaimed British run. Maggie  Smith, by the way, was recently knighted, and so is now, officially, a great  Dame.  </P> <P> DON'T CRY for Ed Koch, the former mayor of New York. Koch's canny attorney,  Allen G. Schwartz, has negotiated contracts for Ed that will guarantee him a  minimum income of more than $1 million a year for several years to come. This  includes revenues from radio, TV, newspaper columns, lectures and appearances  in TV commercials. But now wait, before you all get nasty, Ed Koch will NOT  receive any income from his forthcoming book of arguments from Simon &amp;  Schuster. Since he wrote it on city time, he has contributed the $100,000  advance and all royalties to New York City.  </P> <P> TYRONE POWER, the great movie star and matinee idol of Hollywood's golden era,  has been dead 31 years. But his fan club, founded in 1947, still functions.  Many of the members are from the original group of teen-age bobby soxers who  started it all. So, Elvis Presley's fans still have a way to go matching this  devotion!  </P></p>

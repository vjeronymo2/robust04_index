			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taxation - an anachronistic argument and a proposed reform Sir, John Plender's article is a characteristically thoughtful and interesting outline of Britain's fiscal crisis. However, among potential solutions to that crisis, Mr Plender omitted to mention a reform that was widely canvassed by Michal Kalecki during the late 1930s and early 1940s, while he was working with Keynes at Cambridge and subsequently at Oxford. In brief, he proposed a tax on the capital of companies, with generous allowances for fixed capital investment. This has two important advantages over the present system of corporate taxation, which taxes profits, with allowances for investment. First of all, the present system destabilises government finances because corporate tax revenue falls, with profits, in a recession when unemployment-related government expenditure rises. By contrast, a capital tax with investment allowances would increase government revenue in a recession because of the decline in investment at such times. Second, a capital tax with investment allowances would give companies a strong incentive to invest in a recession. This encourages a sounder, investment-led recovery. In the long term, it would tend to place the economy on a more stable growth path than the existing stop-go policies.

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Cartel Office in mergers warning GERMANY'S Cartel Office yesterday announced a record number of mergers since unification, but warned they were often hindering competition in eastern Germany. During 1991 and 1992, 3,750 mergers were registered at the office, 800 more than in the previous two years. More than 1,300 enterprises or companies in the east were merged with western companies, partly to rationalise in response to the recession, but also sometimes to stem competition in the five new states. The Cartel Office, whose powers are confined to judging the validity of a merger, had managed, however, to challenge 133 takeover or merger cases under European Community regulations. The most notable cases questioned by the office, and rejected by the European Commission, included mergers between Varta, the battery company, and Bosch, the white goods manufacturer; Alcatel, the telecommunications group, with AEG Kabel, the electronics concern; Mannesmann with Hoesch; and Siemens with Philips.</p>

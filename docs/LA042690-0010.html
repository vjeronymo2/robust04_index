			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW LEGISLATION TO DEAL WITH HATE CRIMES IN UNITED STATES  </P> <P> Roche would have us believe that racism and ethnic and religious bigotry have  long since vanished from American society, evidenced by the fact that members  of various groups are represented among the wealthy and that "even the chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is black." Is Roche thereby suggesting that as a  result of the presence of blacks in high appointed offices and the acquisition  of material success by some minorities that crimes should no longer concern us?  </P> <P> Roche misinterprets the impetus for the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. Crimes  impelled by bias have a special emotional and psychological impact on the  victim and the victim's community. They can lead to the intimidation of others  in that community, causing them to feel isolated and unprotected by the law.  The damage done by bias crimes cannot be measured solely in terms of physical  injuries or by dollars.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, prejudice and hatred cannot be legislated or prosecuted out of  existence, but at the very least, the enactment of this kind of legislation  will demonstrate to the community that law enforcement officials have a genuine  interest in the problem of bias crimes and a stake in vigorously pursuing the  offenders.  </P> <P> BETSY R.

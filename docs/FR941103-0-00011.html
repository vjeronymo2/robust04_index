			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on these facts, we anticipate that competition between United States-produced dry-cured pork products and the proposed imported dry-cured pork products will be insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1990, the United States produced 9,652,933 metric tons of pork and pork products, valued at about $11.3 billion. Additionally, the United States imported about 232,253 metric tons of pork. Imports accounted for about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 percent of the pork available in the domestic market during 1990. Figures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 1990 indicate that approximately 429 metric tons of dry-cured pork products were imported under the current regulations. This compares with 349,119 metric tons of all pork products imported during 1990, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.0012 percent. Potential imports of dry-cured pork products would therefore account for less than 1 percent of total annual pork imports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

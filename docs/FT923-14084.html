			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Management (GEC at the Crossroads): Behind the Weinstock enigma - Part Four, Charles Leadbeater looks at the man whose idiosyncratic style has shaped the group In summer he usually works in braces, the top button of his shirt undone and his Hermes tie loosened around his neck. Nearly 68, his greying hair is always immaculately combed. His clothes are stylish but understated. Sharp eyes glint behind the tortoiseshell glasses, and his light frame, long legs and slender arms make him seem unsteady and vulnerable. Most people believe Lord Weinstock, the managing director of the General Electric Company, is a financial machine, ruthlessly seeking and greedily hoarding cash in his west London coffers. The reality is considerably more complicated. The shades of Lord Weinstock's character are reflected in his office. The desk is not fussily neat but carefully organised. Beyond a sloping reading desk, there is a telephone with 250 short dial codes that put him in direct contact with his managers throughout the company. He eschews the egotistical paraphernalia which fill the offices of many other businessmen. There are no framed awards or pictures of him clasping former US presidents around the shoulders. He does not revel in the trappings of power. The furniture is sparse, cheap, functional and slightly tatty. He is extremely analytical with a rare ability to convey complex situations in simple terms. He has a brilliant mind for numbers. His touch with people, however, is less sure. He can be extremely charming, teasing and humorous. But many people complain that he is impolite. Many of his managers find him distant and arid. He rarely shakes hands with guests, who can spend hours in his warm office while he sips sparkling water from a crystal glass and their mouths become parched. Although he has occupied one of the most powerful positions in British industry for 30 years there is not the slightest hint of pomposity about him. He hates ostentation. Executives at lesser companies are fond of reciting their achievements. Lord Weinstock never boasts about himself. He is ruthless. He relentlessly demands his managers improve their performance. Yet he is untouched by the self-congratulatory machismo which infected much of British management in the last decade. Lord Weinstock arrives at the office in the late morning, has a late lunch, usually in the company's sixth-floor dining rooms and enjoys a short afternoon before working into the early evening, often on his own. His hallmarks are pragmatism and flexibility, a peculiar mixture of rational analysis, naked opportunism and great caution. He detests systems and patterns which impose a false hierarchy and order upon things. Anyone hoping for a neat, business-school explanation of GEC's history will be at sea with the swirling narrative that Lord Weinstock delivers. He explains his big business decisions like a spider spinning a web, weaving together business and politics, chance contacts and considered strategy, anecdotes and jokes. Lord Weinstock provokes equal measures of pride and exasperation, loyalty and frustration among the managers who work with him. Mr David Fletcher, managing director of Marconi, GEC's defence subsidiary, describes his boss: 'He is a unique, fascinating, brilliant, infuriating, sometimes exasperating guy, who always comes up with something worth thinking about.' Mr Carey Nolan, managing director of GEC's Picker medical equipment division based in the US, recalls his visits to GEC's Stanhope Gate headquarters in London for annual budget meetings: 'His moods can range from gentle persuasion to table-thumping demands.' The idiosyncrasy of Lord Weinstock's character is central to GEC. It is a tremendously decentralised company. Responsibility for strategy, product development, investment and business planning is devolved to the managers who run the subsidiaries. There are about 70 staff at headquarters, running a business with a turnover of Pounds 9.4bn and 120,000 employees. As a result a lot of people in GEC know a lot about small bits of the business. Only a handful of executives know about all of the group. So Lord Weinstock is unrivalled in his knowledge and power at the company. That also leaves him very exposed. Any judgment of GEC's record is inescapably an assessment of his strengths and weaknesses. He has been the most enduring and the most controversial figure in British business in the last 30 years. Most of the industrial barons of the 1960s, such as the late Lord Kearton, the former chairman of Courtaulds, saw their expansionist dreams turn sour as their empires were dismembered in the 1980s. Most of the famous names of British engineering - GKN and TI for instance - underwent painful and radical surgery in the last decade. Some such as Hawker Siddeley have disappeared. Lord Weinstock has kept GEC virtually intact. Most of the management stars of the Thatcher years - the likes of Sir Michael Edwardes at British Leyland and Lord King, chairman of British Airways - were products of the time, the political climate, and the boom in the British economy. Lord Weinstock may well outlast them all. He has adapted to a wide range of political regimes, from industrial interventionism by the Labour party in the 1960s to free-market Thatcherism in the 1980s. He has survived through nine changes of government, six prime ministers and five recessions. Yet despite his power Lord Weinstock remains an enigma. That is partly out of choice, a senior GEC manager in the US suggests. 'He makes himself enigmatic to protect himself and keep his distance from people.' Indeed his intense shyness is one of the least understood aspects of his character. Apart from a brief period in the late 1960s when he crusaded against the complacent inefficiency of British management, he has not taken to the pulpit. He keeps himself to himself, closeted in that darkened office where messengers deliver reports of events in the outside world. He rarely visits customers, even if they have spent big sums with GEC over many years. A former senior official at the Ministry of Defence recalls: 'He would come over if you specially asked him to, but he would not come to see you of his own volition very often.' In spite of his power he still sees himself partly as an outsider, someone who believes society is run by cliques which he cannot join. This is a reflection of his background. Arnold Weinstock was the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father worked as a tailor in central London. He studied statistics at the London School of Economics before going into business with his father-in-law, the then Mr Michael Sobell, making television sets at Radio and Allied Industries. Thirty years at the top of business have not hardened his skin to public criticism. He remains highly sensitive and often feels his motives and achievements are almost wilfully misunderstood. This combination of power and reticence has created a gap in public knowledge which has been filled by a series of crude caricatures. The main one runs like this: Lord Weinstock is a financial automaton who turns everything into numbers. He is driven by short-term profit to put financial considerations above all else, whether that be long-term investment, research on fledgling technologies or his employees' jobs. On this view, he has gripped his company with a dead hand, unwilling to take the risks which could have pushed GEC into exciting fields in consumer electronics or computing. Lord Weinstock, the critics allege, had the chance to turn GEC into a company which could have matched the power of Matsushita of Japan, Siemens of Germany or Philips of Holland. But he never really tried, they say, because he was content to be in the second division of the world league as long as he enjoyed a dominant position in domestic markets. Indeed they allege his obsessive caution is responsible for much of the failure of British manufacturing since the 1960s. That widespread caricature is outdated, inaccurate and shortsighted. Some of the charges of holding industry back are groundless: for instance his record in the heavy electrical industry is difficult to fault. Others are one-sided: the financial prudence which critics complain of has lent the company a stability many of his competitors would envy. But Lord Weinstock is far more complicated than the caricaturists allege. He does not merely reduce things to numbers, he uses numbers more like a language to interpret business. His hatred of waste is not the product of greed for short-term profit, but a much more deep-seated utilitarian ethic. Lord Weinstock's style was forged by his family route into business. He recreates a family atmosphere in his offices, working with a tightly knit group of highly trusted colleagues. Like a family, relations among the small team in the fifth-floor offices in the company's headquarters are open, usually relaxed, sometimes fractious, occasionally heated and completely informal. They live in one another's pockets. As a result they can take decisions with enormous speed. However, outside these intensely close relations with his immediate colleagues, Lord Weinstock seems distant and cold. He finds self-publicity distasteful. It is as if at an early age someone advised him not to draw too much attention to himself. This shyness has had a profound impact on the business. He is not an adventurous marketeer like Mr Alan Sugar of Amstrad. He is wary of the risk of trying to create a market that does not already exist. Some senior executives within GEC want to break out of the constraints of the Weinstock style. Mr Fletcher says: 'There is a growing awareness of the need to connect to the outside world. We have undersold and under represented ourselves. It is in the nature of GEC to keep a low profile, to do a good job and let that speak for itself. Like a lot of Lord Weinstock's sayings it has a lot of common sense but sometimes you have got to do more to sell yourself.' The family beginnings of Lord Weinstock's career also shaped his attitude towards money. A senior Stanhope Gate executive says: 'He spends GEC's money as if it is his own.' While some - most recently Robert Maxwell the publisher - have abused the kind of power Lord Weinstock enjoys at GEC, he is strictly abstemious. There are no grey areas where GEC's money and the family's private interests are blurred. The Pounds 1m a year he spends on his racehorses comes from his own pocket, not from the pockets of GEC shareholders. He deplores waste with a vengeance so fierce that many who work with accuse him of going too far. 'He is downright mean about salaries,' remarks one senior Marconi executive who has spent 30 minutes on the telephone arguing with his boss over whether to pay a young recruit a slightly higher salary than normal. One of Stanhope Gate's most highly regarded executives is an energy-saving specialist who tours the world, turning up at GEC factories late at night to find out how many lights they have left on. However, it is not just profit but old-fashioned cash that drives Lord Weinstock. One of the company's largest institutional shareholders comments: 'He sits on top of the till, watching the cash come in and go out.' This belief in the virtues of money helped to steer GEC clear of the troubled financial waters which claimed so many apparently robust companies in the past few years. He deeply distrusts even audited figures for profits and asset values, unless they are backed up by something more concrete - money. Lord Weinstock remarks: 'If you think you make a profit it is reassuring to see it in the form of money. When people are making a profit but not making money then we have learned to become suspicious.' He retains a deeply cautious approach to borrowing, still proud that he has always had enough cash and liquid assets to cover any overdraft with the bank. The other side of the coin of this financial prudence, however, is Lord Weinstock's very cautious approach to risk. It was not always that way. He launched himself into the British business world as a huge gambler. In the late 1950s he was selling and making televisions and radios in west London. A decade later he was running most of the British electrical industry. He recalls: 'We had no option and we had nothing to lose. In the mid-1950s it was all risk. My father-in-law was being boycotted by the radio trade, we had little money, an old factory and no way to sell our products in a heavily overpopulated industry. The risk of failure was enormous. But we turned out to be the only survivors of the more than 20 companies who were around at the time.' It was during the rationalisation when AEI and English Electric were merged into GEC that Lord Weinstock gained his reputation for ruthlessness. Trade-union critics alleged it bordered upon savagery in 1969 when he closed a single plant, the old English Electric telecommunications factory at Woolwich, with thousands of job losses. A colleague who has worked with him for 28 years says Lord Weinstock has changed markedly: 'In 1968 he was full of vigour, a real tiger. Now he is an old man, his attention span is short, his eyesight is terrible and he is a hypochondriac. His whole approach to life is much more cautious.' Others who have worked closely with him allege that after all the upheavals of the late 1960s he went to sleep in the 1970s. As the cash mounted from the merged group, he sat back rather than taking a bold initiative which could have pushed the GEC forward into growth areas of electronics. It was in the 1970s that much of British industry decisively lost its competitive edge. During this period the GEC giant, in which so much hope had been invested, slumbered. Lord Weinstock's own explanation is not entirely convincing. He says: 'The radar was scanning the whole time but sometimes there is no traffic. There was nothing to do, so we did nothing. People wanted me to make things which have lost a lot of money for those that did make them.' He argues that he is not abnormally averse to risks. Yet It is just that he sees risk everywhere he looks. He likes reducing uncertainty to a minimum before taking a decision. He deals in reason and evidence rather than visions and faith. He believes that rational thought is the basis for good business, rather than the drive of greed. And his belief in this rational thought is the source of his political and social tolerance. 'Prejudice pollutes the way people think,' he remarks. His distrust of zealots and dislike of fashion meant he had an uncomfortable time with the rightwing idolatry of Thatcherism. A former Conservative trade and industry secretary acknowledges: 'He had a very rough time in the 1980s. But over the long run I think history will judge him rather well.' From the mid-1980s, government policy moved against GEC in several areas. For instance, defence contracting was opened to competitive fixed-price tendering. Lord Weinstock was, however, not impressed by convictions based on faith rather than evidence, and an economic boom based on debt rather than cash. He knew too much about the reality of British industry to join the chorus which claimed that a spirit of enterprise had transformed manufacturing. He is intensely and annoyingly sceptical. He likes argument almost as much as he adores opera, often to the frustration of his colleagues. Mr Murray Easton, the chief executive of Yarrow, GEC's naval shipyard, describes how best to deal with his boss. 'He is always testing you. The best thing is to stand up for yourself. The line sometimes goes silent but the best thing is to stand your ground. If you do not he will never trust you.' Lord Weinstock says of himself: 'I am not diplomatic, I am fairly blunt. I am not malicious and I do not harbour any hostile feelings towards anyone. I like to have an argument about an issue, say openly and in complete frankness what I think, and then once we have decided the best way ahead I accept it and I expect others to do the same.' This belief in logical argument is combined with an appetite for detailed evidence which is so insatiable that it is simply staggering. His obsessive attention to the very smallest detail is one of the hallmarks of his style. The extent of Lord Weinstock's involvement in the minutiae of GEC companies would stun chief executives who believe their role is to decide grand strategy. Mr Fletcher says: 'If we do not have several calls in a day from him or his staff then we think the telephone is broken.' Mr Pierre Bilger, chief executive of GEC-Alsthom concurs: 'We expect to get a phone call every two days inquiring about anything from big strategic issues to the performance of a particular contract.' Anecdotes about his hunger for detail abound. A manager at GPT, the telecommunications division, displays the four pages of his monthly financial report, which have been pored over with a fine-toothed comb even though the business only has an annual turnover of just Pounds 20m. On the back page is a headmasterly warning: 'Most unsatisfactory. Please see comments.' At a recent budget meeting a managing director had just explained his plans for his main seven fixed costs. Lord Weinstock then demanded that he justify in detail the 24 items which made up the small residual 'others' category in planned fixed costs. It took about an hour to mollify him. Hotpoint, the consumer appliances group which GEC runs jointly with General Electric of the US, is reorganising its after-sales service centres after Lord Weinstock, posing as a disgruntled customer, got a less-than-satisfactory reply to a telephone inquiry. Some chief executives decide strategy and then work out the detail of how to implement it. Lord Weinstock works the other way around. He believes that if the details of a business are looked after, the rest will fall into place. But it is when he moves from figures to people that the combination of rationality and shyness puts him at his weakest. Although he believes the business should be financially driven he does not motivate his managers with financial incentives. He claims he mainly tries to persuade them by the force of argument: 'The first thing I have to do is inculcate a methodology based on logical processes. I do not believe in imposing things upon people. You cannot make people think something, you have to persuade people about what to do.' Mr Jim Cronin, GEC-Alsthom's finance director, says: 'He is an educator. He very rarely tells you what to do. He shows you how to do things rather than trying to do them for you.' This does not mean he is soft, because he has an equally strong commitment to personal responsibility. This was the basis of his attack on the old industrial establishment in the 1960s. The companies he took over were suffocating beneath hierarchies of management which meant that responsibility for most decisions were lost in a dense network of committees and procedures. He scythed through that by devolving responsibility to the managers who ran his businesses. That is why people like working for Lord Weinstock: he trusts them with great autonomy. It is quite common to find managers at GEC who have been with the company for between 20 and 30 years. If managers make a mistake, however, Lord Weinstock holds them personally responsible. Some are fired, more often they are moved sideways. Once a manager's copybook has been blotted it takes a long time for the stain to be removed from Lord Weinstock's memory. He expects other people to do their jobs without being told how to. He does not intervene in a subsidiary just to reinforce his authority. In this sense he is egalitarian, he deals with people as if they were equals. Nevertheless his faith in the power of argument has its drawbacks. 'He has not got a clue about the motivational side of man management,' says a GEC director. He seems to believe that action should flow like a logical consequence from a reasoned argument. Managers may revel in the devolution of power, but their egos are deprived of the oxygen of praise. There is a motivational austerity at GEC. Mr Kelvin Bray, a senior executive at GEC-Alsthom who has worked for GEC since the 1960s, says: 'Lord Weinstock focuses upon what does not work rather than what works well. If it is working well it does not need his attention. Silence is praise. When you hear from him it means something is not right.' Lord Weinstock believes praise is a currency which is easily devalued. He will praise people when he is inspired by an exceptional performance. But he believes praise is usually either empty rhetoric or an excuse to be patronising. 'Who am I to praise someone for doing his job well? That implies I am above them or that they are doing it to please me. The point is to do the job well, to help one another to do the job better. A well-done job speaks for itself.' He is also shy - a characteristic often mistaken for arrogance - and is far less emotionally robust than most people think. He is intensely vulnerable to being let down by people he trusts. He admits: 'My biggest disappointment is the failure of a few people to live up to the expectations I had of them. They did not turn out to be the guys I thought they were. Some of the swans turned out be geese.' To his many critics - in and outside the company - the Weinstock swan has turned out to be an obstinately slow-moving goose. But most critics misunderstand him or hardly know him. He is ruthless, yet he has an underlying cultural and social tolerance which leaves him open to debate and ideas. He also has an irrepressible sense of humour, which means he constantly tells jokes of widely varying quality. He has held tight to old-fashioned liberal beliefs in the value of education, reason, and learning when many others in the 1980s were attracted by the intellectual and business fashions of the time. Above all he has a mind of amazing agility and ceaseless energy, which produces a bewildering array of ideas, most of which are quickly embraced and swiftly dropped. On the other hand he has great weaknesses which are reflected in his company. He is not a marketeer; he does not revel in taking risks; he is fascinated by consumer markets but lacks the confidence to conquer them; his obsession with detail means his horizon is often too limited, while he seems at times both naive and unforgiving in his judgments of people. In the last 30 years he has been the custodian of a vast chunk of Britain's industrial inheritance. He has protected it better than virtually anyone else could have, but he has failed to build upon it as much as he might have done. Lord Weinstock is one of a stream of Jewish entrepreneurs of central European emigre descent - men such as Wolfson and Thorn, Sobell and Warburg  -who threw open the shutters of the musty world of British business. Arnold Weinstock is one of the last of that band whose roots lie in the upheavals which shook Europe in the early decades of the century. One of the last, and certainly one of the best. IN HIS OWN WORDS 1992: Weinstock on his office: 'The place must be sufficiently bright not to depress people.' 'I'm not interested in image. We are what we are.' 'Most of my life revolves around my job. It is what I am doing most of the time, wherever I am.' October 1990: On his son Simon succeeding him: 'Of course I would like it, but only on condition that it fulfilled his life and not that he did something to please me.' On the EFA radar project: 'The cat is not yet in the bag but it is rapidly moving towards it.' 1990: On whether GEC has missed opportunities for growth: 'If the number 73 bus goes down Park Lane and you're in Oxford Street, it is not a missed opportunity if you didn't get on it in Park Lane.' 1989: On the company's recent record: 'The stock market took the view that because something was not happening every day we were fast asleep. That was all absolutely rubbish.' 1989: 'The minimum scale for effective survival is always rising. A niche can easily become a tomb.' 1989: On the joint ventures: 'Everywhere in Europe companies are giving up sovereignty because of the costs involved in research and development. The extent and speed of technological changes are such that no one thinks he is capable of doing it all on his own.' 1969: 'One of the strategic decisions we have virtually made is whether to become one of the major world companies in micro-circuits. We really see no alternative.' 1969: On doing statistic at the LSE: 'I did not have enough background to do mathematics.' 1969: 'Some of us here have the feeling we are involved in a crusade.'

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ABUSED MASTERPIECE HUNG AGAIN  </P> <P> Rembrandt's "Night Watch" masterpiece will go back on display May 1, less than  one month after being sprayed with sulfuric acid by a man believed to be  mentally disturbed, officials said today. No extra security will be introduced  to protect the painting, despite the fact the April 6 attack was the third  against the Rembrandt this century, said a museum spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The 1642 painting will be returned to its customary center spot in the main  gallery. A protective veneer layer prevented any damage to the work of art. In  1975, a Dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission slashed the  painting with a knife. He was sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he  committed suicide. During World War I, a jobless shoemaker slashed the canvas  to protest his inability to find work.  </P></p>

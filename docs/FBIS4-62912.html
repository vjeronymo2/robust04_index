			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Latvia"]    [Text] In his comments on a televised statement by Prime  Minister Valdis Birkavs, Economic Reform Minister Ojar Kehris  said that no ministerial changes have been officially discussed  at the Latvian government.    The prime minister said in his statement on 15 May that the  removal of ministers suspected of cooperating with the KGB would  be the first step in reshuffling the Latvian Cabinet of  Ministers. Kehris, in turn, stressed that the situation can be  straightened out by the voluntary resignation of the ministers  themselves. Valdis Birkavs pointed out that he will not discuss  possible candidacies of new ministers as long as there is no  legal basis to do so. Kehris said, however, that this could  mean only a court ruling establishing the guilt of the suspected  ministers, something that could serve as a reason for firing one  minister and appointing another.    For the time being, Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs is on  vacation, and Edvin Inkens, minister for special assignments,  continues to go to work every day. (These two are "the main  suspects.") It is known that Inkens is ready to be temporarily  dismissed from office if Birkavs so requests.    The Cabinet of Ministers committee on economy and finances  has opted against supporting the proposal made by the Prenex  Anftalt firm for a second time to build a plan to incinerate  hazardous wastes in Latvia. It is well known that at the  beginning of March Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs signed a letter  turning down the proposal; he explained that the Latvian  government decided not to cooperate with the firm because  bringing hazardous wastes into the country from abroad would run  counter to the Latvian law banning hazardous wastes from  entering Latvia. Minister Ojar Kehris said at a briefing that  the committee on economy and finances recommended against  accepting the firm's proposal because there is no sufficient  information about the types of wastes Prenex Anftalt is going to  bring into Latvia. The firm did not respond to repeated  requests by the Environmental Protection Ministry that it  provide appropriate documents.    In addition, the Basel conference [as published], which  Latvia has also joined, specifies that as an exception a state  could ask another state to accept wastes, but a firm cannot make  such a request to another firm or a state. The project called  for three incineration facilities to be built outside Riga to  incinerate 300,000 tonnes of waste a year, including 210,000  tonnes to be brought from EC countries and 90,000 tonnes of  local wastes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F> RZECZPOSPOLITA; More Consent for Prime Minister Than for  President"]    [Text] The number of people who agree with the way Prime  Minister Pawlak is wielding power increased in April, while  popular support for the governing style of President Lech Walesa  decreased. Slowly but surely, the president has been losing  support since March; the prime minister lost in March but  regained popularity in April. These opinion polls are conducted  for us by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute.    Each time the respondents had to answer questions under  different circumstances:    In February, strikes were going on in Silesia; a huge  demonstration, deemed "five km of Solidarity" by the papers, was  staged in Warsaw; the coalition was just getting over the crisis  ensuing after the resignation of Marek Borowski, finance  minister and deputy prime minister. The president launched his  legislative initiative to enable 100,000 citizens to submit a  draft constitution, but the Sejm had not rejected it at the  time. The results: The president's style was approved by 25  percent of respondents, the prime minister's style by 36 percent.    In March, Pawlak left for Moscow on a visit that, according  to many observers, was ill prepared; the president was  ostentatiously taken aback by this visit. Dariusz Rosati had  only just emerged as a candidate for the new deputy prime  minister and finance minister, he was already accepted by the  prime minister; the president had not taken a stand on that yet.  The approval rating for the president 22 percent, for the prime  minister 33 percent.    In April, the dispute over Rosati had been going on for many  days; it was only unclear whether it was a conflict between the  president and the coalition or between the president and the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. In only a few days, Walesa was  supposed to meet with the SLD Parliamentary Club, as a  consequence of which we witnessed an "armistice." The president  had already vetoed the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage  increases] and the gminas [smallest administrative units]  councils electoral law; the budget was already signed. The  prime minister started suggesting to unionists that there might  be no new popiwek at all. In this situation, the way Walesa  wielded power was approved by 20 percent of respondents; in the  case of Pawlak, there was twice as much support.    The greatest support for the prime minister can be noted  among elderly people, including senior citizens and disabled  pensioners, those with elementary education, unskilled manual  workers, housewives, and especially peasants, voters for the  Polish Peasant Party and the Peasant Accord. Those who express  the least favorable opinions are young people, including school  and university students, educated people, well-to-do individuals  living in big towns and cities, voters who supported the  Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Democratic Union in the  September elections.    Walesa's style meets with considerable approval among people  over 60, election supporters of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of  Reforms, Solidarity, and the Fatherland coalition. Slightly  more-than-average approval is expressed by educated people  holding managerial posts, but mainly because, in this group,  there are seldom any problems with expressing an opinion.    The poll was conducted on 16 and 17 April on a sample of  1,071 adult inhabitants of the country; a comparison was made  with similar polls carried out in the middle of March and  February.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do you support the way power is wielded by President Lech Walesa?            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |No                       |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Feb 1994                 |59|29|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mar 1994                 |63|22|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Apr 1994                 |65|20|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do you support the way power is wielded by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak?   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |No                       |Yes                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Feb 1994                 |35|36|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Mar 1994                 |37|33|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Apr 1994                 |34|40|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

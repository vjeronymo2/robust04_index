			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Generator stocks wanted POWERGEN and National Power were the best performers in an otherwise demoralised Footsie index, with the former given a strong boost by US-sourced buying interest. Senior executives from PowerGen are currently visiting US investment institutions and analysts in New York. Hints relayed from these presentations suggest that, when the current deal between the power generators and British Coal ends in 1993, the UK generator companies will be allowed to sharply reduce their coal purchases and negotiate lower prices. PowerGen climbed 9 to 261p on heavy turnover of 7.1m shares, while National Power added 7 at 249p on 2.7m. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was believed to have been a heavy buyer of the generators, especially PowerGen. Offer worries The regional electricity stocks reversed Wednesday's gains yesterday amid suggestions that the Office of Electricity Regulation (Offer) is about to turn its attention to the pricing policies of the National Grid Company (Gridco). This is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies, who derive 10 per cent of their profits from their holdings. Stock market hints yesterday were that Offer may be about to restrict Gridco's future price rises to inflation minus 5 points and to threaten that, if Gridco resists, it will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The worst performer in the sector was Eastern, which dropped 19 to 275p, while falls of 17 were registered by Northern, 341p, Norweb, 351p, and Seeboard, 330p. The Electricity Package lost 145 to Pounds 3245. Glaxo struggles News of a joint agreement with a Japanese company and a recommendation from a US brokerage house were not enough to shield Glaxo from the general setback in Wall Street-influenced stocks yest-erday. Glaxo said it had agreed with Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical to jointly develop a treatment against osteoporosis, a condition which affects the bones, mostly of women aged over 55. Also, Merrill Lynch, in recommending the stock, said investors buying at the current weak level could expect a 15 per cent gain in the share price. Glaxo shares were marked up at the opening and reached 670p. However, the surprise early downturn by the Wall Street market sent the stock sharply into reverse to end a net 5 off at 653p after 5.1m shares traded. ICI still weak There was no respite for ICI, which fell a further 18 to 1170p, making a slide of 50 since the start of the week. The latest data on one of the chemical giants' high-earning drugs added further impetus to a sharp profits forecast cut by one securities house earlier this week. May prescription figures in the US for Tenormin, ICI's beta blocker for treating hypertension, were down by 42 per cent compared with the same period last year. The drug earned the company Pounds 1.18bn world-wide last year and Dollars 400m (Pounds 216.2m) in the US. However, the US patent ran out at the start of this year and sales have declined much faster than previously expected. ICI's tumble has prompted the market to indulge in what one analyst described as 'indiscriminate bashing' of the rest of the sector. BOC weakened 11 to 631p and Yorkshire Chemicals declined 12 to 320p. BT was one of the handful of Footsie stocks to close higher on the day, responding to its inclusion in County NatWest's prestigious County 30 list of best buys. The 'old' shares settled 1 1/2 up at 334 1/2 p and the partly-paid 2 1/2 firmer at 234p. County highlighted BT as a resilient, highly-rated stock with good dividend prospects. 'BT looks cheap as well as safe,' said County. British Gas overtook British Petroleum as the most heavily traded stock in the oil and gas sector. The former made strong progress early in the session and touched 254p, boosted by its joint deal with Italy's Agip to develop the Karachaganak oil and gas field in Kazakhstan. But a growing realisation that the development of the field would involve Gas in a capital expenditure programme in the region of Dollars 3bn took the shine off the share price, which ran back to close only a fraction ahead at 250p. Turnover in Gas topped 18m shares. In addition, Energy specialists said that if Offer adopted a stringent regime on Gridco, then it would strengthen the hand of Ofgas, the gas watchdog, to impose a low rate of return on Gas's pipeline system, in the event of a break-up of Gas's various interests. A volatile session in British Aerospace saw the shares move sharply ahead by 12 to 261p in early trading, on press reports that the company was discussing a regional aircraft joint venture with Taiwan. The positive sentiment, however, received a sharp knock after a widely predicted sell note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew finally landed on investors' desks. The stock came back to end just a penny up on balance at 249p after volume of 1.4m. T &amp; N firmed 6 to 142p after a US court dismissed a substantial asbestos claim against the company. Shares in TI Group, which last night held a presentation for investors at Kleinwort Benson, were in demand, adding 8 at 345p. US buying helped British Steel buck the market trend and firm 3 to 62 1/2 p in trade of 8.6m. Two big lines of stock in Owners Abroad left the holiday group's shares looking queasy, 1.9m being traded at 67p and 1.25m at 66 3/4 p. The stock retreated 5 to 69p. Rival Airtours tumbled 27 to 227p. The effect of a buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing earlier this week helped paper and packaging group Arjo Wiggins Appleton to firm 2 to 228p. Brewery and hotel group Bass wilted in the face of a broker's downgrade and renewed worries about the performance of its Holiday Inns chain in the US. Strauss Turnbull snipped its profits forecast for this year by Pounds 20m to between Pounds 545m and Pounds 550m. Analysts returned this week from a US presentation where Bass said it did not expect an 'acceptable return' from Holiday Inns until 1995-96. Bass shares ended 10 off at 548p. Elsewhere in the drinks sector, Scottish &amp; Newcastle firmed 6 to 454p ahead of results due on Monday, but Guinness tumbled 11 to 534p after BZW followed County NatWest in downgrading the group.

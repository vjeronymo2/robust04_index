			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED WAY TO FOCUS ON L.A. DEMOGRAPHIC 'MOSAIC'  </P> <P> The steady influx of foreign investments into Los Angeles County and a  population boom among the region's minorities is prompting the United Way of  Los Angeles to refocus the aims and tactics of its fund-raising programs, a  report by the charity showed Monday.  </P> <P> Findings in the report -- United Way's Environmental Scan 1990 -- show that 75%  of all births in the county are to minorities, an increase that will make  whites a minority in metropolitan Los Angeles in about three years. The report  also projected a county population increase from the 8.7 million recorded in  the 1980 census to 9.9 million by the year 2000.  </P> <P> "The United Way has to be more receptive to the changes in our community," said  Maurice J. DeWald, chairman of United Way's Strategic Planning Committee.  </P> <P> Members of the task force that wrote the report said the study will be  instrumental in shaping policies of the United Way, which raises more than $80  million annually for more than 350 health and social welfare agencies.  </P> <P> Among other things, they said, the findings will force United Way of Los  Angeles to improve fund-raising efforts among foreign-owned concerns and small  businesses. The report says 95% of all companies in the county have fewer than  50 employees.  </P> <P> Mark Pisano, chairman of the task force, said many foreign-owned companies do  not donate to United Way because "giving isn't necessarily part of those  companies."  </P> <P> "The study is an effort to understand the economic and social forces so that,  as the United Way plans and does work, they'll have a basis on which to plan,"  said Pisano.  </P> <P> He said the growing ethnic diversity in the region offers many advantages but  could create several problems for both government and the local United Way, the  second-largest United Way branch in the nation.  </P> <P> "We're a mosaic of people, and that's a strength," said Pisano, whose task  force -- made up of business, government and community leaders -- initiated the  study 18 months ago to formulate more effective relief and fund-raising  policies.  </P> <P> "But that strength could become a weakness. The community could grow apart.  Diversity could become divisiveness."  </P> <P> Glaring signs of division already are evident, the report found.  </P> <P> Figures in the study show that a declining need for low-skilled laborers now  threatens to permanently trap many of the county's 1.3 million poor in a cycle  of poverty and crime. "It means you have a maldistribution of income," said  Pisano.  </P> <P> He also noted that "it's more difficult for workers to climb up from  low-paying, low-skilled jobs. They cannot scale the corporate ladder."  </P> <P> Such findings parallel a recent report by UCLA which also shows a widening gap  between the rich and the poor.  </P> <P> In addition, the United Way study found that:  </P> <P> * The city's population is aging slower than in many other cities because of  the predominantly young ethnic residents.  </P> <P> * Two out of five households countywide have incomes of less than $20,000 a  year.  </P> <P> * Nearly 40% of all single-parent households in the county live below the  poverty level.  </P> <P> * Dropout levels at county high schools are lowest among Asian and white  students.  </P></p>

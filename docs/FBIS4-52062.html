			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Unpardonable Jargon of Japanese Justice Minister" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister  of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, when interviewed by  MAINICHI SHIMBUN on May 3, openly let out an ugly torrent of  words defending the Japanese imperialists' war of aggression in  the past.    Contending that "it is wrong to say the Pacific war" started  by the Japanese imperialists "was a war of aggression," he went  to the extent where he claimed without hesitation that the war  was "a war for the liberation of colonies" and "a just war which  may be tolerated." And he driveled that a notorious massacre by  the Japanese imperialists in Nanjing, China, was a hoax.    Nagano's shameless remarks are nonsensical outbursts for  bringing the spectre of Japanese militarism back to life.    Peoples of many Asian countries including Korea shed blood  and died tragic deaths and underwent immeasurable misfortunes  and sufferings due to the war of aggression provoked by the  Japanese imperialists. This is a hard fact recorded in history  and still vivid in the memory of people as bitter grievances.    The Japanese authorities must apologize and compensate for  the war crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against  Korean and Asian peoples in the past. It is a downright  challenge never to be condoned to defend and justify the war of  aggression by the Japanese imperialists, far from making apology  and compensation.    It is by no means accidental that Nagano's grave remarks  came  at a time when the Japanese reactionaries, in conspiracy with  the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, are driving  the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, while  the anti-DPRK campaign to stifle it is getting more open over  its fictitious "nuclear problem".    In justifying the past war crimes of the Japanese  imperialists the Japanese reactionaries are foolishly attempting  to justify their moves to stage a comeback to Korea and Asia for  the realization of the old dream of "the greater east Asia  coprosperity sphere". We cannot overlook the open remarks of a  high-placed official holding the post of justice minister  intended to make a clean sheet of and even justify the cursed  history of aggression of the Japanese imperialists.    The Japanese authorities must show a responsible attitude  and  a position of apology for this.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta said:  "Those responsible for kidnapping IBR [Agrarian Reform  Institute] technicians will be brought to trial to answer for  their crime. The government will not hesitate to resort to the  law." Thus, he referred to peasant leaders who held a group of  IBR technicians hostage in the settlement of General Resquin on  7 April.    The minister said: "Sometimes people are too intolerant, but  no one can take the law in their own hands. No one can impose  his own kind of justice," the minister warned. Podesta said we  are faced with "a public offense" and the government will act  accordingly.    The minister added it is the responsibility of Attorney  General Luis Escobar Faella to bring those responsible to trial.  Asked if the situation will interrupt the negotiations  currently underway between the government and peasants, Podesta  said: "The peasant leaders siting at the negotiating table with  the government cannot be held responsible for what other  peasants do on their own."    Asked about the announcement that peasants will again close  roads, the minister said: "The police will enforce the law. If  there is a court order, we will use force, without a doubt."    Returning to the issue of the General Resquin "kidnappers,"  Podesta said: "Those responsible have names and we will press  charges against them, without doubt."    Supreme Court Justice Jose Alberto Correa agreed with  Podesta. He said the incident is a public offense, adding that  the crime of kidnapping is clearly defined in the Penal Code.  Correa also said the attorney general may very well act on its  own to seek justice when laws are violated.</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TACTICS SWITCH MAY HAVE BOOSTED NAVY'S INVASION TOLL;  </P> <P> PANAMA: A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE INCREASED THE EXPOSURE OF COMMANDOS SENT TO  SABOTAGE NORIEGA'S PLANE. FOUR DIED IN THE ENSUING EXCHANGE WITH THE DICTATOR'S  LOYALISTS.  </P> <P> Pentagon officials assessing last month's Panama invasion believe that an  11th-hour change of orders could have contributed to the high casualty toll  suffered by a group of Navy SEALs in an attack on Punta Paitilla airport, The  Times has learned.  </P> <P> Only hours before the Panama invasion's "H-hour" on Dec. 20, three commando  platoons -- about 48 men -- were moving secretly toward the airport to destroy  Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega's specially equipped airplane to prevent  him from using it to escape.  </P> <P> But at the last minute, the units of the Navy's sea-air-land commando force  received new instructions: They were only to disable the plane by wrecking the  undercarriage so the plane could not take off, an assignment calling for  near-surgical precision.  </P> <P> That decision, apparently made by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander of the  Panama-based Southern Command, reflected a desire to minimize damage to the  populous residential area surrounding the airport, officials said.  </P> <P> But it required the SEALs to get much closer to the aircraft than the plan they  had rehearsed. It also required them to move more fully into the open, where  they were exposed to a small but heavily armed Panamanian force in the fierce  fire-fight that ensued.  </P> <P> Four SEALs were killed in the operation, and three were so badly wounded that  their return to the Navy's elite commando service is considered improbable.  </P> <P> The SEALs' tactical change apparently was compounded by flawed U.S.  intelligence that underestimated the type of protective force that the  Panamanians would have in place at the airport, officials said.  </P> <P> The revised orders and faulty intelligence are prompting some criticism among  military analysts, who contend that either a larger force should have been used  or the target should have been subdued first with artillery.  </P> <P> "It did expose them to more risk," said one defense official with a detailed  knowledge of the operation.  </P> <P> Had they known earlier about the larger threat and the new assignment, the  official said, "they would have fought a different battle. They would have  stood off and softened the place up (with mortar fire). They're not in the John  Wayne business."  </P> <P> "Someone made a bad decision," another official said. "The SEALs were doing  something they weren't trained to do. The mission they did is normally a (Army)  Ranger mission."  </P> <P> The unforeseen restriction on the use of heavy firepower and the unexpected  ferocity of the small band of trained Noriega forces have caused soul-searching  on the part of the SEALs' leadership and in the Pentagon office responsible for  the commandos' training and equipment.  </P> <P> "It was a mistake," said one knowledgeable source. "It looks like a few guys  bought it who didn't have to. It's fair to say that people are taking a look at  it."  </P> <P> The Pentagon review, he said, is intended to determine if such last-minute  changes can be avoided in future operations.  </P> <P> Complicating the SEALs' task, officials said, was the critical intelligence  failure. In briefings before the operation, the SEALs were told that the only  security at Paitilla airport would be untrained and lightly armed civilian  security police.  </P> <P> Described by one official as "rent-a-cops," the security police were considered  more likely to run than to stand and fight.  </P> <P> Instead, a small band of Gen. Noriega's elite special operations forces awaited  the SEALs, armed with automatic weapons -- including a Browning automatic  rifle, according to one on-scene report.  </P> <P> The Panamanians, tipped off to the arrival of the invading U.S. forces by waves  of arriving transport planes, had taken up positions in a spot with a panoramic  view of the airfield -- and an unobstructed line of fire on the SEALs advancing  toward Noriega's aircraft.  </P> <P> While no Panamanian leader made a move toward the aircraft, intelligence  analysts operating offshore warned the SEALs that armored personnel carriers  filled with Panamanian soldiers were approaching Paitilla, spreading fears that  the troops at the airport were being reinforced. But officials said that  contrary to earlier published reports, the armored personnel carriers bypassed  Paitilla and continued onward to defend Noriega's military headquarters.  </P> <P> As a platoon of SEALs advanced on Noriega's aircraft, they saw a Panamanian  gunman and opened fire. Besides the U.S. casualties, a Panamanian intelligence  officer who later surrendered to U.S. forces revealed that three Panamanian  commandos had perished in the attack and eight Panamanians were taken away in  ambulances.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Americans came under such intense fire that they were forced to  abandon hopes of disabling the airplane with minimal firepower. In the end, the  SEALs used "all they had," according to one source, destroying Noriega's plane  and at least two other aircraft, as well as Paitilla's hangar.  </P> <P> The wounded SEALs waited in some cases for hours for medical evacuation, a  problem that officials attributed partly to communications lapses.  </P> <P> These problems have prompted Navy officials, in "lessons-learned" reports  submitted to the Pentagon, to stress the SEALs' need for communications  channels and specially equipped helicopters of their own. The requested  choppers, a version of the Navy's LAMPS 3 anti-submarine helicopter, are being  built and delivered to the SEALs as early as this week.  </P> <P> The U.S. casualties made the Paitilla operation one of the bloodiest exchanges  of the entire Panama invasion, which left 23 Americans and more than 500  Panamanian soldiers and civilians dead. Officials said the Navy will recommend  that several of the commandos who participated in the Paitilla attack receive  awards for their valor.  </P> <P> Several SEALs dashed onto the Tarmac to drag the wounded to safety as Noriega's  gunmen raked the airfield with fire.  </P> <P> One of those killed, Lt. (j.g.) John P. Connors, was maneuvering with his squad  to reinforce a group of SEALs under fire, said one knowledgeable source. To  join the SEALs in Panama, Connors had left a hospital where he was being  treated for a skin disease contracted while training in Brazil.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Panama, Navy SEALs successfully sank escape boats and secured  critical facilities without serious casualties. In those areas, the SEALs  conducted more traditional missions: Moving in small teams of about 16 men,  they conducted sabotage missions and other operations, usually with enough  stealth to avoid engagements with Panamanian soldiers.  </P> <P> The SEALs' Paitilla mission was a somewhat unconventional assignment for them,  according to knowledgeable officials. Pentagon sources said that any further  bolstering of the force would have removed the elite service even further from  the missions it was intended and trained to conduct.  </P> <P> Said one knowledgeable source, "SEALs don't do missions where you have to  'soften up' the target in advance" with artillery.  </P> <P> "This was a large force for the SEALs," said another defense official. "But if  they'd gone in with that guidance from the beginning and known what was there,  they wouldn't have done it this way and maybe taken fewer casualties."  </P></p>

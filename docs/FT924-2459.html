			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Oil is shown as least 'green' fuel THE ENVIRONMENTAL costs of using oil are higher than those of any other type of energy, according to estimates from the Department of Trade and Industry. The provisional figures rank the damaging effects of oil above those of 'old' coal - used in conventional power stations without emission controls - and considerably ahead of those of 'new' coal. The present fierce debate over the UK's future energy sources has found it difficult to quantify the environmental and social costs of the options. The 300-page report, commissioned by the former Energy Department from the Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, draws on existing work to put money values on the non-market costs of a fuel. It uses a value of Pounds 2m per human life, based on people's willingness to pay to reduce risk. Corrosion and damage to buildings accounts for more than half of oil's estimated cost of 5.56p per kilowatt-hour of energy (/kWh). Damage to crops from pollution accounts for just under a fifth of the cost. Old coal is costed at 5p/kWh and new coal at 1.18p/kWh. The study emphasises that pollution levels of power stations vary widely. Modern nuclear pressurised-water reactors have an environmental cost of between 0.32p/kWh and 0.37p/kWh. That does not include figures for effects on plants and animals. Combined heat and power systems - mini power stations for industrial estates and housing blocks - have an estimated total cost of 0.45p/kWh. Solar, wind and hydroelectric have the lowest costs, at between 0.04p/kWh and 0.07p/kWh, but those figures omit the visual impact or the disruption of building dams. The Social Cost of Fuel Cycles.

The association  affiliated with the pro-Seoul Korean Residents Union in Japan  suggested in the report that the younger generation of Koreans  born in and living in Japan consider their permanent residency  here as a matter of course.    The results of the report were brought to the public's  attention as South Korean President Kim Yong-sam visits Tokyo,  stressing the importance of future-oriented relations between  the East Asian neighbors.    Many Korean youth living in Japan today are descendants of  Koreans forcibly brought to this country under its harsh  colonial policies before and during World War II to labor in  Japanese factories and mines. After the war, many retained  their Korean nationality and today an estimated 700,00 Koreans  are living throughout Japan as permanent residents.    The survey conducted between June and September last year  polled 800 Korean young men and women between the ages of 18 and  30 who were born in Japan but hold South Korean citizenship.  The results were released in February.    In addition to the more than 70 percent who said they felt a  sense of attachment to Japan, more than 50 percent of the survey  respondents also said they felt a sense of attachment to the  Korean community in Japan.    Roughly 40 percent said they felt attachment to South Korea,  while less than 10 percent had similar feelings of attachment  toward the Korea of old before it was divided following World  War II.    In response to a question about returning to Korea, just  short of 30 percent of the respondents said they wished to  return while another 30 percent said either Korea or Japan would  be fine. More than 40 percent of the respondents, however, said  they had no desire to return to Korea.    Of the young people surveyed who had visited South Korea,  more than 40 percent said they felt a sense of attachment to  their ancestral homeland while visiting, while 30 percent said  they had "mixed feelings" and 20 percent said they felt  indifferent.</p>

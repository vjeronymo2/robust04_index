			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: Rare Shostakovich - Opera in London Hard upon Tom Courtenay's heels in Moscow Stations comes Shostakovich's musical comedy, which is also concerned with a Moscow suburb. Not in Brezhnev's time, however, but in Krushchev's; and unlike Yerofeev's dream-village Petushki, Cheryomushki is a real-life brute of a suburb, a monstrous concrete estate. The mainspring of the comedy is that everybody is trying desperately to get a flat there, because there is almost nowhere else left around Moscow to go. Though Shostakovich's piece had a fair Moscow success in 1959, this Pimlico Opera production at the Lyric Hammersmith is its British premiere. I imagine that it does it justice, but one should recognise the sea-changes that Cheryomushki has undergone. It was designed for a standard Soviet theatre, which meant a large orchestra and an established company with its own comedians, etc.; it is delivered here by ten soloists (mostly young), an eager, hard-working chorus of seven and a 14-strong band, on a strictly limited budget. With the colourful resources of a Soviet theatre, the time that Cheryomushki takes might pass more quickly, but it would probably not be better. In fact the story is quite lean: while four couples sort out their personal difficulties, they are more passionately involved in hunting flats, or hanging on to them. Most of that is farce. By the end, the right people win and the others do not, especially not the corrupt bureaucrats. In Paul Andrews' austere sets, Lucy Bailey stages the action energetically. Shostakovich's music is the problem. Obviously his heart was not in it, for the mostly short numbers are relentlessly bright, brittle and banal. A little of that goes a long way; the whole of it goes on for three hours, with no characteristic touches from the composer but the odd small harmonic fracture. There are more and better tunes in his symphonies than in this 'musical'. What attracted him to the project was presumably the chance of registering a mild social protest for a popular audience, but it sounds as though he had the most pessimistic expectations of their ears. Still, for historical reasons it is interesting, and the keen Pimlico team do their collective nut to infuse it with some comic life. Sponsored by National Westminster Bank; performances to October 29.</p>

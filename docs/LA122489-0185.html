			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> JAY LENO  </P> <P> It took a long time for Johnny Carson and NBC to come up with a successor to  The Tonight Show chair. There was a real constituency to consider, one that  reached from the urban coasts to the heartland, to whom the show performed the  ritual function of smoothing out the tensions of the workaday world like  bedsheets. They needed someone sharp enough to put things in comedic  perspective and amiable enough to leave an audience comfortably on the  threshold of sleep. Jay Leno took to the job so well that he seemed the most  natural choice in the world.  </P> <P> Leno was so singleminded about his career in the mid-'70s that he was willing  to sleep on the steps behind the Comedy Store (occasionally a sympathetic cop  would buy him coffee and doughnuts). Nothing about the current ease and  apparent freshness of his act now reveals the dogged and meticulous years he  spent assembling the elements of comedy presentation.  </P> <P> The memory of hard times in an individual often goes a long way towards taking  the measure of current success, but it can work the other way too, making one  pig out on celebrity. Leno's topical skepticism is tonic, as is his coverage of  the ways in which we're manipulated and exploited by advertising, the media,  and some of the people we place in public trust. He has an eye for the  preposterous within the everyday. He uses language and imagery well. He works  clean.  </P> <P> Mostly, he has a realistic perspective on what it means to be an entertainer --  he knows the traps as well as the trappings of success. That's why he's out on  the road when he could just as well stay home poolside. He's one of the few  major comedians on the scene who hasn't had his work ethic retrofitted around a  world of show-biz values.  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Scottish TV under pressure Scottish Television was one of the main casualties in the London market, the shares falling 44 to 430p as the company warned that profits for the year would be around Pounds 9m against Pounds 13.1m last time because of limits on airtime sales. The warning came less than three weeks after Mirror Group acquired around 20 per cent of the company's shares at 520p a share. There were some mutterings in the City that the group, and the securities house which carried out the deal, might now be looking foolish and Mirror shares fell 3 to 128p. Mr Neill Junor of NatWest Securities, the house which carried out the initial agency crosses representing 14.9 per cent, said that there might have been a very short time available to the Mirror to acquire the stake and it would be able to offset the cost of the interest payable through equity accounting. Mr Robert Jolliffe of Hoare Govett argued that it was a long- term play and said: 'In time the strategic value of the deal should become clear.' Mr Junor held his 1995 forecast at Pounds 17m and Mr Jolliffe downgraded by Pounds 3m to Pounds 19m. Although it was suspected that the Scottish interim figures would be disappointing, they came only two days before Mr Stephen Dorrell, the national heritage secretary, is expected to make a key speech at the Tory party conference. There is speculation that he might announce plans to lift restrictions on cross-media ownership. If so, there could be a sharp impact on prices as the market looks for the next wave of takeover deals.</p>

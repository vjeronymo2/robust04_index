			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Noorzita Samad] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- Bank Negara [Central Bank]  Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don today announced the relaxation of a  monetary measure which was instituted to control the inflow of  speculative funds from abroad.    Effective May 16, foreigners will no longer be required to  pay a levy to commercial banks for holding their ringgit funds  -- a term referred to as "negative interest" in the banking  circle.    These funds held in vostro accounts (non-interest bearing  ringgit funds held by foreigners in local banks) will no longer  be subjected to statutory reserve and liquidity requirements.    To moderate the effect of the lifting of this negative  interest measure, Bank Negara will mop up additional liquidity  by raising the statutory reserve ratio (SRR) from 9.5 per cent  to 10.5 per cent effective Monday.    The SRR is the amount of funds based on a percentage of  eligible liabilities or reserve assets that commercial and  merchant banks and finance companies need to place with the  Central Bank.    These two measures will likely result in a return of foreign  funds into the local financial system and help shore up the  strength of the ringgit.    Ahmad said in a statement that these measures were  consistent  with the Central Bank's overall strategy of creating a conducive  environment for genuine investors as well as maintaining price  stability.    "Bank Negara will continue to monitor the situation and will  not hesitate to introduce measures as and when necessary to  achieve its objectives."    In line with this, commercial banks, nevertheless, are still  required to place their vostro balances with Bank Negara for it  "to continue sterilising the remaining inflows".    The negative interest rate measure introduced in February  had  been successful in reducing the amount of speculative funds  maintained in vostro accounts from a high of more than RM  [Ringgit Malaysia] 8 billion in January to RM2.6 billion  yesterday.    "Consequently, it is no longer necessary to continue with a  negative interest rate on the vostro balances held by foreign  banking institutions."    The newly appointed Bank Negara Governor also outlined the  importance he would place on fighting inflation, giving an  indication of how he would tackle the problem.    He said much of today's inflation was anticipatory, hence  psychological in nature.    "The objective of the policy is to affect inflationary  expectations so that they will not become self-fulfilling.    "In this, Bank Negara stands prepared to do whatever it  takes  to ensure that the inflationary psychology is not entrenched.    "We will act again, when act we must, in order to convince  investors, businesses and the public that the (Central) bank  will continue to give priority to this continuing battle against  inflation."    Ahmad said large inflows of speculative funds had prompted  the Central Bank to take drastic steps of late to re-establish  control over the monetary aggregates.    "Now that most of the speculators have unwound their  positions, the ringgit has strengthened in the markets.    "Before long, the positive impact of the bank's various  measures, including those announced today, will be reflected in  the financial markets in a way that should bring new confidence  in the bank's resolve to fight inflation."    The ringgit reacted positively today, closing higher at  2.6100/30 against the US dollar from 2.6180/90 yesterday.    Dealers attributed the active trading to buying interest in  the ringgit, fuelled by talks that Bank Negara is raising the  SRR and lifting the restriction on the vostro accounts.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Crackdown urged on fraudulent links Companies may be required to disclose details of all parties related to them by transactions, under tough proposals designed to crack down on fraud. Under Fred 8, the draft directive from the Accounting Standards Board, related parties will include individuals or companies connected with, influenced by or controlled by the company, its pension funds, its directors and managers and their immediate families. Fred 8 will make it more difficult to conceal many frauds associated with recently-collapsed companies. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'This is a fraud-prevention standard. We are asking companies to tell us what they would rather we did not know.' The discussion document calls for disclosure of all material related-party transactions, including the name of the controlling party, any ultimate controlling party, the amounts involved and any other information necessary to understand the financial statements. It requires disclosure of any transactions involving a material difference between the fair value of an asset, liability or service and the transacted amount. This would disclose practices such as the transfer of assets below real value, and movements of money to and from the company. The standard relies on auditors to insist on disclosure. The Auditing Practices Board is developing guidelines on the subject. Mr Tweedie said: 'If the auditors don't do their job, we are sunk.' Fred 8 significantly extends the existing requirements under company law to disclose related-party transactions, which need only be shown in accounts if they are judged by the directors to be outside the normal course of business activities. The board's new provisions include children of directors regardless of their age, and managers as well as board members. Comments on the standard are due by June 15. Fred 8.

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (3): Broadening transmissions - Cable television in the UK is growing fast DURING the recent Barcelona Olympics cable television subscribers to Videotron's London franchises were in a position to see more of the action than anyone else. The Canadian-owned company devoted four channels to the Games - in addition to live coverage, Eurosport broadcast viewers could also watch events that started four or eight hours previously so that they could choose sports in which they were most interested. There was also immediate access to the latest results on a scoreboard channel. The Videoway service attracted 90 per cent of cable viewers at some time over the Olympics and accounted for 40 per cent of viewing of Olympic events. 'Videoway adds value and vindicates our intention to introduce interactive television in the UK on a progressive basis starting towards the end of this year,' says Mr Louis Brunel, managing director of Videotron Corporation which holds franchises covering 1.2m homes in the UK. The company plans to introduce an interactive roulette game where the viewer will be able to play the game on the screen - at first just for chips but perhaps later for prizes. Soon after subscribers will be able to choose their own camera angles for sports such as ice hockey. The developments are a small indication of how cable television is gradually beginning to broaden from the days when there was little more than films, sports, general entertainment and news. Within the next few months some of the main London franchise holders will be connected for the first time. It will create new programming possibilities in the capital, help with marketing and selling advertising. A segment of arts programming - Performance - is to be carried by the London link and from December it will be used to deliver The Family Channel, a successful, wholesome cable channel in the US available in more than 60m homes. The company behind it, International Family Entertainment, recently launched a bid for TVS Entertainment, the south of England ITV company which has lost its franchise. UK Gold, a channel which can draw on the extensive programme libraries of the BBC and Thames Television, will be launched on November 1. There are also hopes in the cable industry that the Disney channel from the US after looking at the European market for some years will finally take the plunge. In addition, decisions are imminent on UK Today, a new cable channel which could require investment of Pounds 21m. The channel which would carry daytime and life-style programming and regional sport would be financed by the cable industry itself and managed by United Artists Programming, one of the main suppliers of channels that are exclusive to cable networks. The United Artists offering include The Children's Channel, Bravo, classic movies, Discovery, the factual channel, The Learning Channel and, since January this year, The Parliamentary Channel carrying uninterrupted, unedited live coverage of the House of Commons. The broadening of programmes from cable is an indication that the industry is on the move even though progress has often been slow and uneven. Every quarter the number of homes passed by the cable networks, and therefore able to subscribe, continues to grow as does the number who actually subscribe. On July 1, the number of homes connected to broadband - or modern multi-channel systems - rose to 330,630, a net increase of 39,000 or 13.5 per cent over the previous three months and of 139,000 or 72.5 per cent over the past year. The number of broadband homes passed totalled 1,567,559 giving a penetration rate - the proportion of those actually subscribing out of those who can - of 21.1 per cent, a figure that has been slowly sneaking up from 18.9 per cent a year ago. When upgraded relay systems, which used to carry the normal four broadcast channels, are included there was a total of 552,105 cable homes at the beginning of July. While acknowledging the progress, Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission, is still disappointed at the speed of development. In February, Mr Davey forecast that another 850,000 homes would be passed by cable this year. Now the total is more likely to be around 500,000. Apart from the effects of the recession and uncertainty among some of the big North American players earlier this year about the possible effects of a Labour Government, there was one serious blow to cable development: Pacific Telesis, one of the big US regional telephone companies that had been enthusiastic backers of cable in the UK, suddenly announced it was pulling out. Cable was a perfectly reasonable business but it had decided instead to expand in mobile communications. PacTel was one of the largest operators with stakes at the beginning of this year in franchises covering nearly 1.5m homes. Interest is being expressed in the various PacTel franchises but the sale has inevitable caused a hiatus. But other North American telephone companies such as Nynex, US West, Southwestern Bell and Bell Canada and cable companies such as Videotron, United Artists Cable, Comcast and CUC Cablevision are still pushing the industry ahead. A new player with ambitions has arrived in the shape of Singapore Telecom in the Cambridge franchise and there are unconfirmed rumours of further Far East interest. There are also signs that banks are becoming more willing to lend money to cable companies. Development so far has largely had to be through equity finance. Some in the industry now believe that with improving choice of programme channels and a second stream of revenue opening up from providing telephone services as well television, cable has at last reached a critical mass and will soon have to be taken seriously. 'I am encouraged but I would like to see it developing faster than it is,' commented the cautious Mr Davey.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     INDIVIDUAL CABLE FRANCHISES*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Franchise                          Homes      Homes       Penetration                                  connected    passed           %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Croydon                           25,968     107,164         24.2 Birmingham                        20,062      58,925         34.1 Swindon                           17,696      60,342         29.3 Windsor                           15,843      90,546         17.5 Aberdeen                          14,836      93,375         15.9 Greenwich &amp; Lewisham              14,551      52,122         27.9 South Liverpool                   14,184      53,773         26.4 Northampton                       13,985      18,722         74.7 Southampton                       13,341      73,700         18.1 Merton &amp; Sutton                   12,803      50,148         25.5 Ealing                            12,071      51,884         23.3 Bristol                           12,065      57,540         21.0 Westminster                       10,975      56,496         19.4 Coventry                           9,934     116,831          8.5 Central Lancs                      9,321      53,395         17.5 Newham &amp; Tower Hamlets             9,306      55,562         16.8 Dundee                             8,656      23,040         37.6 Kensington &amp; Chelsea               7,949      34,782         22.9 Lambeth &amp; Southwark                7,204      22,452         32.1 Camden                             6,967      25,324         27.5 Portsmouth                         5,403      30,530         17.7 Glasgow                            5,338      55,124          9.7 Leicester                          5,017      25,439         19.7 Cambridge                          4,371      17,484         25.0 East Lancashire                    4,170      39,100         10.7 Hammersmith                        3,930      18,442         21.3 Peterborough                       3,672      19,800         18.6 Bolton                             3,493      24,667         14.2 Enfield                            3,393       8,670         39.1 Black Country                      3,065      18,242         16.8 Thamesmead                         2,619       7,217         36.3 Haringey                           2,588       8,638         30.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Individual broadband franchises with more than 2,500 subscribers on July 1, 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Independent Television Commission  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

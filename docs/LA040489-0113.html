			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL HOUSING IS CITED BY CITY INSPECTORS  </P> <P> Miguel Torres showed off the illegal garage dwelling to Los Angeles building  inspectors Monday as if he were guiding a model home tour.  </P> <P> In order to rent out his home for $450 a month, he had converted his two-car  garage on 111th Street in South-Central Los Angeles into three rooms --  bathroom, bedroom and living room -- for his family of seven. Torres proudly  pointed out the bootlegged plumbing and electrical outlets -- work of his hands  done to convert a shelter for automobiles into a home for his family.  </P> <P> "I have nothing I want to hide," said Torres, 42, a gas station attendant.  "This is the best I can provide."  </P> <P> But his best is illegal and possibly dangerous, inspectors told him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action by the City  </P> <P> On Monday, Torres was among the first of about 60 property owners to be cited  in the city's first attempt in more than 20 years to crack down on building and  safety code violations in residential areas.  </P> <P> The pilot program in the 8th Council District, which is expected to take  several months, began quietly with four inspectors walking from house to house  in a two-block area, peering into back yards and scanning houses for building  defects.  </P> <P> Single-family houses -- mostly small, wood-framed stucco homes -- lined the  area surveyed Monday. About half passed muster. They were generally neatly  kept, adorned with flower gardens and trim lawns.  </P> <P> At the others, Supervising Building Inspector Heikes Powell and his four-man  crew found abandoned automobiles parked in the yards or out front on the  street. Several car engines were spotted in overgrown weeds on front lawns.  Some driveways and patios looked like junk yards, a violation of city laws that  prohibit open storage of debris.  </P> <P> One vacant lot had become a dumping ground for old appliances and damaged  furniture. Another lot served as grounds for a squatter in a trailer, a man who  told inspectors he didn't know who owned the land.  </P> <P> Sagging roofs, crumbling cement walkways and broken windows were noted by  inspectors.  </P> <P> At one point, Powell became intrigued by a two-story back yard structure in the  framing stages. When he looked in the back, he saw that the do-it-yourself home  builder had left exposed electrical wiring and the posts and beams were tilting  to one side. Each stair was about two feet high.  </P> <P> "It's good to catch these things early before this guy goes any further,"  Powell said.  </P> <P> Powell's crew also spotted four garages that had been illegally converted into  housing -- a violation city officials said will be the most difficult to solve.  </P> <P> In a city staggering under a shortage of affordable homes and waves of poor  immigrants, the garages, estimated at 42,000 in Los Angeles County, have become  the shelter of last resort. But they are illegal, usually dangerous and often  unfit for human habitation, authorities said.  </P> <P> As the inspectors made their way down 110th and 111th streets, many residents  and passers-by glared at them. But the handful of residents who were at home to  answer the inspector's knock appeared to be supportive.  </P> <P> "I understand what they are trying to do. There are quite a few houses around  here that need fixing," said Marvin Thompson, a homeowner with a ramshackle  garage that is weakened and leaning. "In a way it's cool, as long as they don't  force you to do it right away and give you a loan."  </P> <P> As the building inspectors wrote up a notice for Thompson, ordering him to fix  the garage, he said he had already applied for a $40,000 no-interest loan to  repair it as well as remodel his 40-year-old house.  </P> <P> Under the program, property owners will be sent letters detailing the  violations and ordering them to comply with the law. Property owners will be  offered low-interest or no-interest loans and ample time to do the repairs,  said Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell, who pushed for the pilot  program in his district.  </P> <P> If the violations are not corrected, property owners could face misdemeanor or  felony charges, depending on the magnitude of the hazardous conditions.  </P> <P> It is unclear what will happen to the illegally converted garages, however.  </P> <P> "I hope they can help me," garage dweller Torres said. "If the city tells us we  have to move out of the garage I don't know what we will do. I need to rent the  house to support my family."  </P></p>

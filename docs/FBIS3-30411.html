			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Helene Despic-Popovic: "Bhutto, Ciller Demand </F> Justice for Bosnian Moslems"]    [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Pakistani and Turkish  Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller Wednesday [2  February] called for lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and  urged the govermment to reject any "unjust" negotiated  settlement to the war.    In a joint declaration issued during their brief visit to  the  besieged Bosnian capital, the two Islamic heads of government  said that "rarely has a nation been subjected to such merciless  savagery in the full view of the world" as had Bosnia.    Stressing the humanitarian nature of their high-profile  mission, Bhutto and Ciller called for the immediate lifting of  the "unjust" international arms embargo, which "contravenes  (Bosnia's) inherent right to self-defence."    With all-party peace talks on the future of Bosnia set to  resume February 10 in Geneva amid signs of intensified military  build-ups by all three sides on the ground, the two leaders  denounced all attempts to impose a settlement on the  mainly-Moslem Bosnian side.    "Bosnia must not be forced to negotiate at gunpoint," the  statement said. "We will resist an imposed settlement which  rewards the aggressor." [passage omitted]    Both women -- the most senior politicians to visit Sarajevo  since French President Francois Mitterrand in June 1992 -- also  stressed they were opposed to a carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Bhutto and Ciller, who were given the red-carpet treatment  and a guard of honour on arrival at Sarajevo airport and for  whose visit the UN Protection Force imposed tight security  measures, called in their statement for an end to the siege of  the capital.    They also called for the immediate lifting of all obstacles  to the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the re-opening of Tuzla  airport, northern Bosnia, which has been shelled by Bosnian Serb  troops. [passage omitted]    The Bosnian premier was due to take the two leaders on a  tour  of the city's main Kosevo hospital. [passage omitted]    Izetbegovic said Tuesday his government would reject at  fresh  talks any settlement not offering the "just peace" which had so  far not been forthcoming. [passage omitted]</p>

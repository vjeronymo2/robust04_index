			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): Overtaken by events - Trade DOING BUSINESS IN SOUTH AFRICA edited by Jonathan Reuvid Kogan Page Pounds 25, 300 pages SELDOM CAN a publisher's blurb have been more revealing. 'This book is about South African business practice and opportunity - not politics.' The priggish note evokes the old South Africa, and the school of thought which held that apartheid, business and sport occupied different compartments. If you want a learned account of the rules governing business entities and their regulation in South Africa, or a discourse on financial reporting and auditing, this book may be helpful. But anyone planning to do business in the new South Africa, and seeking a hard-headed appraisal of risks and opportunities, will be disappointed. They will need to look elsewhere for advice - perhaps starting with the emerging breed of 'consultants' who exchange their political credentials and their contacts book for a seat on the board. The no-politics rule seems to have kept out, for example, any analysis of ANC economic policy other than complacent reassurance. 'Nationalisation is no longer on the ANC agenda,' we are told in the book's introduction. Certainly that is what Ready to Govern, the ANC policy document, says - but while hedging its bets. A future democratic South Africa, says the document, will consider: Increasing the public sector in strategic areas through, for example, nationalisation. Reducing the public sector in certain areas in ways that will enhance efficiency, advance affirmative action and empower the historically disadvantaged. The book's introduction also confidently asserts: 'Nor is the 'unbundling' of the interconnected conglomerates which dominate much of South African industry . . . seen any longer as a political priority.' Oops] Since that was written Gencor has unbundled. 'Now one of the capitalists has broken ranks,' commented the FT's correspondent in Johannesburg at the time, 'it is no longer possible to dismiss unbundling as an airy Marxist fancy. Indeed, it is likely that South Africa has only witnessed the dawn of an era of significant corporate restructuring.' And what of affirmative action to redress the apartheid legacy? The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce, the black business federation (not included in the book's mediocre contacts list), has demanded that all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have 30 per cent black board representation by 2000, that blacks hold 40 per cent of equity and 60 per cent of posts at all management levels. Unrealistic; but a sign of the times that a really useful guide to business in the new South Africa would have illuminated.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead dividend lifted 8% ABBOTT MEAD Vickers, the advertising agency whose biggest clients include Volvo and Comet, yesterday announced a near 8 per cent annual dividend increase despite a slight fall in pre-tax profits. Mr Peter Mead, chief executive, said: 'We're very, very pleased with this performance in a difficult year.' Existing client spending had fallen about 10 per cent, he said. AMV reported taxable profits down 4 per cent to Pounds 5.02m for the year to December 31. The fall was due to tighter margins and start-up costs on new business inherited from last March's acquisition of BBDO, the London agency of BBDO Worldwide. Interest income on AMV's Pounds 6.3m cash balances also fell slightly to Pounds 778,000 (Pounds 901,000). Turnover increased sharply to Pounds 158.9m (Pounds 129.7m), reflecting spending brought in with BBDO, whose clients include Pepsi, and Pounds 15.4m in new business. Stripping out income from BBDO, underlying income from AMV and sister agency Leagas Delaney fell by about 9 per cent. Only 30 of BBDO's 80 staff have been retained and Pounds 3m reorganisation costs were taken as goodwill. AMV has also frozen salaries throughout the group and no staff bonuses were paid last year. The group has won Pounds 9m in new business so far this year, including the Ciga hotel account transferred from BBDO. It is pitching for a further Pounds 27m in new billings. Earnings dipped to 22.09p (24.06p) per share. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 5.6p to make 8.4p (7.8p) for the year. The shares added 2p to 395p. COMMENT AMV has managed to merge with BBDO without losing clients or staff morale, no mean feat in the advertising world. The benefits of the takeover should come through this year, even if the advertising industry remains depressed. If AMV generates margins of 10 per cent on BBDO's Pounds 30m billings, compared to its 20 per cent target for existing business, that could mean an extra Pounds 500,000 profit this year. There should also be gains from BBDO Worldwide's clients looking to spend in London. The City is already expecting this, and possibly more. Forecast pre-tax profits of between Pounds 5.5m and Pounds 6m put the shares on a prospective multiple of more than 15, which is not cheap. The premium rating is partly due to AMV's conservative acquisition policy, and partly because of turmoil among other agencies. Omnicom's 26 per cent stake in AMV also provides speculative appeal. But after more than doubling in value in the last year, the shares look ready for some consolidation, especially if political worries prompt advertisers to delay campaigns until the autumn.</p>

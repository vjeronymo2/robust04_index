Experts from the government and the president's office worked  all night to be in time for Yeltsin's anniversary press  conference. The group issuing the president's documents did not  work as expeditiously: only four of the five edicts were  officially distributed yesterday. The edict on the banking  system did not appear outside the Kremlin.    Judging by the extensive list of documents being  prepared, yesterday's package will not be the last surge of  activity by the executive authority before the summer lull.  <H5>  The President Did not Promise Every Family an Apartment by </H5> the Year 2000    The presidential edicts issued yesterday provide every  reason  for the executive authority to substantially reduce the pace of  its work, if not leave on vacation. Package No. 2 filled the  niche, empty since May, of the authorities' attention to social  problems and relationships with foreign financial organizations.  <H5>  Edicts signed by Boris Yeltsin on 10 June: </H5>   --"On housing loans";    --"On the issuance and circulation of housing certificates";    --"On measures to finish incomplete housing construction";    --"On improving the work of the Russian Federation banking  system"; and    --"On protection of consumers."  <H5>  Edicts Being Prepared for Signing: </H5>   --"On increasing the responsibility of state enterprise  directors";    --"On protecting the rights of investors and citizens in the  securities market"; and    --"On the customs procedure for commodities for investment  projects."  <H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On the Issuance and </H5> Circulation of Housing Certificates":    --When houses are built, juridical persons with the rights  of  a buyer have the right to issue housing certificates;    --The volume of an emission of housing certificates  (expressed in units of overall living space) may not exceed the  total volume of housing being built by a buyer; and    --The minimum rated value of a housing certificate may not  be  less than 0.1 square meter.  <H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Housing Credits": </H5>   --Credit is extended for housing construction if the builder  is allotted a plot of land and has authorization to build  housing from the appropriate organs;    --There may be thre types of loans: a loan to purchase land,  a short-term loan to build housing, and a long-term loan to  purchase housing;    --The total amount of credit issued should not exceed 70  percent of the cost to build or purchase housing;    --The basic documents which determine the relationships  between the bank and the borrower in granting a loan are the  loan agreement and the security contract (on the mortgage); and    --A plot of land under construction, completed housing or  incomplete construction, and other forms of property and  property rights may be an item of security.    The reasons for issuance of the decrees "On housing  loans," "On the issuance and circulation of housing  certificates," and "On measures to finish incomplete housing  construction" are very logical and clear--the idea that it  is precisely the construction industry which will become the  "locomotive" of the Russian economy has been popular in the  government for a long time. Moreover, the edict on housing loans  legalizes the mortgage concept, which has been put into practice  quite extensively. The Supreme Soviet did not have time to  approve a corresponding draft law. The underlying social reason  for these decisions is obvious as well--there are few average  Russians who can gain a thorough understanding of the subtleties  of export allocation and licensing (the net result of Package  No. 1 was the idea of liberalizing Russian exports).    However, for those who authored the housing construction  edicts--the State Committee on Questions of Architecture and  Construction [Goskomarkhitektury]--there are reasons of a more  prosaic nature to advocate their quick approval. A package of  government decrees on measures to support the construction  complex--and not without budget participation, of course--should  be rushing to catch up with these edicts. Yefim Basin, chairman  of the Goskomarkhitektury, estimates the overall volume of unmet  demand for housing at 14 trillion rubles [R] and the area of  housing that has not been completed at 40 million square meters  (42 million square meters were built in 1993).  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  Basic Provisions of the Edict "On Protection of Consumers' </H5> Rights"    Upon its publication, the advertising of banks and  financial,  insurance, and investment companies must:    --specify the actual amounts of dividends paid for common  registered stocks over the past fiscal year;    --specify the date and registration number of the securities  issue being advertised; and    --not permit announcement of guarantees, promises, or  assumptions about the future effectiveness of their activity.    Yeltsin's edict "On protection of consumers" [sic] pursues  objectives that are even more populist. The aims of this  document were formulated by the president himself: it is  necessary "to put advertising activity in order and ensure that  a person has the right to reliable financial information." The  authorities' attempts to spare their fellow citizens from the  illusions that they can buy "a house in Paris" with the  dividends from securities are very much justified: in the event  that their commercial undertakings fail, Russian investors  prefer to appeal to the state, not the firm that deceived them.  According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY information, Russian banks,  concerned about the increase in competition from nonbanking  financial institutions in attracting the funds of private  investors, played an important role in pushing through the edict.  <H5>  Foreign Banks in Russia Have been Rehabilitated </H5>   The pendulum of the president's edicts concerning operations  by foreign banks in Russian territory with the funds of Russian  residents has once again been put into motion.    On 17 November 1993, this activity was frozen until 1  January 1996 by the edict "On activity by foreign banks and  joint banking ventures with the participation of nonresidents in  Russian Federation territory." The clause in the edict stating  that its restrictions are not extended to those foreign banks  which did not have time to begin serving Russian residents  before 15 November 1993 was good news for only two banks:  "Lionskiy Kredit," a subsidiary bank of Credit Lyonnais, and the  joint bank Dresdner Bank (FRG) and BNP (France). All the rest of  the 10 that were planning to begin operating in the Russian  market, which had already received licenses from the TsB  [Central Bank] of Russia, turned out to be "losers."    Now the president has given the green light to European  foreign banks in Russia. It is a reasonable question: what  prompted the president to rehabilitate the foreign banks ahead  of time? While in November the spirit of the president's edict  was directly contrary to his edict of 27 September "On improving  work with foreign investments," it was brought about chiefly by  election campaign considerations, not by calculations that  victory would be achieved by orientation toward a liberal-market  ideology with emphasis on priority support for the interests of  Russian business or a rejection of more prohibitive measures,  and it is more pragmatic in nature.    At least three circumstances attest to this. First of all,  it  is obvious that opening the Russian market to foreign banks is  one of the conditions for granting Russia deferments in paying  its foreign debt to the Paris Club. And creditors' patience has  evidently run short.    Secondly--and this is confirmed by the fact that European  banks are the ones that have been most active thus far in  penetrating the Russian financial market--opening the doors to  foreign banks is aimed at facilitating the talks that are  actively under way on Russia's partnership in the European  Community. In principle, it has not been ruled out that this  liberalization will be followed by reciprocal liberalization by  Russia's trading partners, and this may alleviate antidumping  sanctions from the EC. An answer to this question may be given  on 23 June at a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Jacques  Delors, where it is planned in particular to coordinate Russian  quotas for aluminum and uranium exports to the EC.    Thirdly--and this is perhaps what is most important, the  appearance of foreign banks in the Russian market should in  theory contribute to a solution of two extremely critical  problems in the Russian economy. Despite the rapid increase in  commercial banks, the credit development field in Russia  continues to be inadequate for the requirements of a market  economy. This is shown by comparing the structure of the money  supply in Russia and the United States. It follows from this  that Russia is significantly ahead of the United States in the  proportion of cash and funds accumulated in the accounts of  enterprises and in public savings, but on the other hand, it  lags behind in the amount of commercial credit that is extended.  In this sense, the chronic nonpayments are a form of  compensation for the lack of development in credit  relationships. The new opportunities being opened by the  presence of foreign banks in the Russian market may also  revitalize the moribund investment process. The epochal  formation of the Investment Finance Consortium, despite the  importance of the precedent of government interaction with the  banks and investment companies in stimulating private  investments, attests to the narrowness of investment supply. The  overall volume of state guarantees for securities of the  consortium amounts to R800 billion, and this year R8 billion  will be mobilized altogether. Foreign direct investments, the  need for which has finally been acknowledged in the Russian  Government, will come through these foreign banks; however, this  has not prevented it from breaking up the Russian Agency for  International Cooperation and Development--a federal organ  charged with implementing the policy of attracting foreign  investments.    As far as public reaction is concerned, it is absolutely  clear that the politicians, the bankers, and businessmen view  this change in different ways. Unexpected arguments are already  circulating: giving foreign banks access to Russian residents'  accounts will leave the CIA with nothing to do. It may be said  in response to this that the largest data bank on all Russian  enterprises is being held by the Goskomimushchestvo [State  Committee on the Administration of State Property], and  specialists of the World Bank and other Western financial  organizations providing Russia with technical assistance in  carrying out privatization have had legal access to the data for  a long time. Nevertheless, from the viewpoint of prospects for  development of the national economy, the pluses of the foreign  banks' arrival in Russia outweigh the minuses, all the same.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H8>  Reaction by Russian Bankers to the President's Edict </H8>   Andrey Tsimaylo, vice president of Most-Bank:  "There are specific differences between the banking system of  any state and other sectors of the economy. The banks are akin  to the militia and the army--both constitute elements of  national security. For this reason, the national banking system  should be the last to be integrated into the international  market (and hence, to permit full-fledged branches of foreign  banks on its territory). This should not take place before  Russian banks are standing on their feet, that is, when the  largest of them have enough of their own funds to put them among  the first thousand largest banks in the world. And for this it  is essential that a bank have a minimum of $125 million of its  own capital.    "And even in this case, it is not right to authorize foreign  banks to serve residents. In other states, the 'other' banks  take part in the capital market and the interbank market, but  the national banks serve their clients.    "By authorizing foreign banks to serve residents today, we  can forget about national security. Each bank knows the history,  the problems. and the financial capabilities and plans of each  client. Foreign banks will also have the same information on  resident clients in Russia. Not one of the world's intelligence  services even dreamed of this.    "They say that foreign banks will finally teach you how to  operate. On the contrary, it is more likely that we will be  teaching them how to operate in the Russian market--with the GKO  [expansion unknown] and with gold certificates. And Russian  bankers increase their skill this way--those same Western banks  organize the seminars at which Russian employees are trained.    "They say that foreign banks will bring new technologies  into  the Russian market. If this means equipment, many Russian banks  have equipment today that is no worse, and perhaps even better.  But if this refers to banking technologies, please tell us: who  needs 30-year bonds with 4-percent profitability?    "They say that foreign banks will teach us how to treat a  client. However, I am not convinced that they would extend  credit to clients who have no credit history.    "Finally, they say that foreign banks will bring foreign  investments with them. However, the lack of a foreign bank is  not an obstacle to penetration by foreign investments. If any  one of them wants to extend credit to AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive  Plant], it will do so even without a Russian 'branch.'"    Yakov Dubenetskiy, chairman of the board of the  Promstroybank [Industrial Construction Bank] of Russia: "I  think the presence of foreign banks in the Russian market meets  our national interests over the long term. There is no question  that foreign banks should be represented in Russia. However, it  is not possible for them to conduct their activity today under  the same conditions as the Russian banks."    Sergey Yegorov, president of the Association of Russian  Banks: The association's position on this matter has been  set forth on more than one occasion. We believe that the  presence of full-fledged branches of foreign banks in the  Russian market today will be disastrous for the Russian banking  system. The overwhelming majority of Russian commercial banks  canot be compared in size with even a comparatively small  foreign bank. Countries with a much stronger national banking  system do not allow foreign banks. But in Russia, the commercial  banks have just barely come to their feet, and time is needed  for them to be able to compete with foreign banks."    Boris Sergeyev,member of the board of "Tokobank":  "Based on principle, not self-interest, we support the idea of  liberalizing the conditions for activity by foreign banks. At  the same time, it is reasonable to set some restrictions, such  as limiting capital from Western banks to 12 percent of the  total amount."    Saida Petrova, head of a department of the Moscow  Export-Import Bank: "There is actually no banking system in  Russia at this stage. All Russian commercial banks are  essentially branches of the Central Bank--all banking turnover  without exception goes through the RKTs [presumably: currency  control center]. Western banks' transactions will bypass this  system. It will be impossible to monitor the influx of foreign  capital and its circulation in the country. As a result, we will  witness the collapse of Russia's banking system, which has not  been created yet."</p>

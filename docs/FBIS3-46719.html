The ministry, however, expected a trade surplus of 2 billion  dollars in terms of international payment.    Exports were 82.44 billion dollars (up 7.6 percent) and  imports 83.8 billion dollars (up 2.5 percent), slashing 3.78  billion dollars from the 1992 deficit.    Exports hit 8.15 billion dollars and imports 7.44 billion  dollars in December for a 712 million-dollar surplus, the fourth  monthly surplus in a row. It was the second largest surplus  after 887 million dollars in December 1991.    As of Dec. 25, letter-of-credit (L/C) arrivals reached 3.85  billion dollars and import approvals were 5.33 billion dollars.    In the first quarter, exports rose 7.1 percent from the same  period in 1992, but in may labor disputes and weak demand from  China hampered exports. In September, industrial peace came and  the Japanese yen's strength boosted exports and brought the  first monthly trade surplus in four years by international  payments.    For the whole year, electronic, electric, automobile and  machinery exports posted double-digit rises, while exports of  shoes, textiles and containers dropped by a large margin.    Exports to the United States, Japan and European Community  rose 0.8 percent, putting an end to their consecutive decline  since 1990. The three markets accounted for 47.5 percent of  total Korean exports, dropping below 50 percent for the first  time.    Exports to developing countries soared 16.7 percent,  compared  with 24.3 percent in 1992, and Asian countries accounted for  47.5 percent of total exports, compared with 42.9 percent in  1992.    The ministry predicted exports at 89.5 billion dollars, up  8.6 percent, and imports at 89.5 billion dollars, up 6.8  percent, for a trade balance this year.</p>

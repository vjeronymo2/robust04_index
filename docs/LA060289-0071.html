			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> VIET REFUGEES REFUSE TO EAT  </P> <P> About 2,000 Vietnamese "boat people" began a hunger strike in Hong Kong to  protest a policy that treats them as illegal immigrants subject to  repatriation. The refugees at a detention center in the Shatin district refused  to eat after officials began screening under a year-old policy that makes them  subject to deportation unless they can prove they fled political persecution.  Another 492 Vietnamese refugees sailed into Hong Kong waters and were towed to  Tai A Chau, an outlying island without any shelter. They joined 270 refugees  sent to the island earlier in the week.  </P></p>

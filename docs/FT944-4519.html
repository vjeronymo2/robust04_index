			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / EU finance bill completes final Commons' hurdle The bill that triggered the political storm engulfing Mr John Major's government last night completed its Commons stages with a convincing majority. The European Union finance bill, increasing Britain's payments to the EU budget, received its third reading early this morning - a day earlier than originally planned. With Labour abstaining, only 23 MPs voted against it, allowing the measure to pass by an overwhelming majority of 272. No Conservatives voted against but several did not vote. This is likely to clear more time in the parliamentary timetable for debating today's mini-Budget, caused by the enforced scrapping of the second stage of value added tax on domestic fuel. The bill's second reading last week led to the withdrawal of the Conservative whip from eight Tory Eurosceptics after they ignored Mr Major's decision to make the matter an issue of confidence and abstained. The bill now passes to the Lords, but peers will be unable to amend it because it is a finance measure. Meanwhile, it emerged during earlier exchanges that Mr Major had moved closer to an understanding with Eurosceptics by backing stronger measures to prevent EU money being used for fraud in Britain. Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford, revealed Mr Major's role in meeting Eurosceptic demands to combat fraudsters. Mr Major agreed that the Commons public accounts committee should be asked to examine the accounts of non-government agencies which have received EU funds. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, paymaster-general, stressed that ministers could not direct the committee - but confirmed that Mr Major wanted EU fraud to be a priority.</p>

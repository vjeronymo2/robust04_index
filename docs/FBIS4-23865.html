			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 16 SAPA -- The newly elected Volkstaat  Council Chairman Johan Wingard said in Pretoria on Thursday [16  June] the inauguration of the council was one of the most  important milestones in the history of the Afrikaner people. "A  statutory body has been constitutionally created by law to  reconcile the Afrikaner's quest for freedom and  self-determination with the realities of the social, economical  and political environment of southern Africa," he said in his  inauguration speech.    He told the 20-member council that the constitutional  development and democratisation of the sub-continent would not  be complete until the self-determination aspirations of the  Afrikaner people had been resolved in an acceptable manner.  "The council is not a divisive organisation aimed at upsetting  the relative peace and harmony that currently exists in the  country. On the contrary, its key function will be to remove  the uncertainties that exist with Afrikaners, political parties,  the state and...the local and international community," he said.    He said the council had no alternative but to fulfil its  task  in delivering meaningful recommendations for new legislation,  "so that internal peace would exist and the Afrikaner could  reach its full potential in Africa in the fields of defence,  agriculture, medical services, mining, engineering, law,  finance, education, and science.    Mr Wingard said the whole community would benefit by an  "acceptable political solution for the problem of the  Afrikaner's claim to self-determination".    The council -- which would be independent of party political  organisations -- requested all parties, societies, bodies and  individuals to make written or oral submissions to it. "The  process will be open and transparent," Mr Wingard said.</p>

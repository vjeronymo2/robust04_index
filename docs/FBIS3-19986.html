"Is it better for an investor to be a shareholder in a  profit-making regional airline or in a loss-making international  group?" Schisano replied to reporters who asked him about his  opinion on the ever growing merger trend in the airline industry.    Schisano, who was recruited to the ailing public airline  from  Texas Instruments on January 27, gave reporters an outline of  his own restructuring plan, after stating three weeks ago he was  willing to review a different plan drawn up by his predecessors  and rejected by the trade unions. Schisano said he wants to  bring Alitalia toward a balanced budget in one year and does not  want to think about alliances with other carriers until finances  are in the black. This is possible only by increasing  efficiency, cutting per unit production costs and building an  Alitalia terminal at Milan's international airport to combat  increasingly aggressive foreign competition.    "The review of the new plan will be completed by the end of  April, the plan will go into effect immediately and should show  its first results in one year," Schisano claimed.    But until then, he stressed, it is inappropriate to talk  about international alliances: "Where I come from," he said,  referring to Texas Instruments, "there were no sister companies,  only competitors, and competitors must be treated as such.  Partnerships can exist only if there are reciprocal interests  but Alitalia is in no condition to choose a partner."    Schisano also said he had no objections to the privatization  of Alitalia but he stressed the importance of increasing the  company's advantage at the Milan airport. "All of northern  Italy is a strategic market and for years now has been invaded  by tough European competitors. Because it does not have a  terminal in Lombardy, Alitalia has been losing two million  passengers a year in the country's most industrialized area.  That's three billion lire a day up in smoke, or one trillion  lire in revenues every year."    He invoked "political" decisions to get the terminal  project,  dubbed Malpensa 2000, moving again after a massive kickbacks  scandal virtually blocked development. The plan includes  transportation links between the airport and Milan. "I've been  hearing talk about this for the last thirty years and nothing's  been done yet," he added.    Schisano earlier this month promised to pay the wage  increases that were frozen by the former CEO [chief executive  officer], Giovanni Bisignani, and to review the controversial  restructuring plan. He also said Alitalia, which is owned by  the public group, IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction],  has "such severe internal problems" that it may not be able to  exploit chances of recovery. He told unions however that this  does not mean that the general guidelines of the first  restructuring plan will be overhauled, but rather that the  general climate of "demotivation" and "disarray" among personnel  must be changed.    The unions rejected the restructuring plan drawn up by the  previous company management and approved by the IRI board. But  new management, put in place in a major top-end reshuffle in  January, has claimed it does not want industrial relations to  degenerate further.    Alitalia is expected to post 400 billion lire (238 million  dollars) in losses and debts of two trillion lire (1.19 billion  dollars) for 1993, following first-half losses of 214 billion  lire (127.3 million dollars) reported in September.    Schisano has not replied to union requests to make company  shares available to employees and has not denied plans to cut  between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs. Alitalia wants to place some 800  workers into early retirement.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> BILLBOARD EXHIBIT LEAVES VIEWERS COMPLETELY FLAT  </P> <P> Talk about missed opportunities! On hearing the title of the current exhibition  at the Municipal Art Gallery in Barnsdall Park, "Inside Outdoor: The Art and  Technology of Outdoor Advertising," the mind does a cartwheel. Billboards, you  say? Burma Shave! The Coppertone kid being pants by her pup! The mechanized  Camel Cigarettes billboard that blew smoke rings! Sunset Boulevard's corridor  of glorious billboard excess that stretches from Crescent Heights to San  Vicente! The entire history of 20th-Century America as seen from the wheel of a  car!  </P> <P> But alas, rather than the colorful stroll down memory lane that this unsung  genre of folk art deserves, rather than shedding any light on the American  psyche as reflected in its relationship with the open road, we're given a  series of turgid and technical how-to photographs chronicling the creation of a  modern billboard -- just in case we're interested in doing a billboard at home  in our spare time. Touting itself as "an exhibition focusing on the  contributions of the billboard artist to the Los Angeles culture and  landscape," "Inside Outdoor" fails miserably on every score.  </P> <P> Sponsored by Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and the Patrick Media Group,  the show features as its centerpiece a billboard that will be completed over  the course of the show, which continues through March 5. So, if you want to see  someone actually painting a billboard, the show does offer that. It also offers  a very spotty pictorial history of billboards drawn from archival photographs,  documentation of three conceptualist billboards recently completed by L.A.  artists, explanations of computer-generated billboards and other modern  technologies, and a video montage of current billboards -- just in case you  want to see how they look on TV as opposed to on the street.  </P> <P> Other than that, the show leaves most questions unanswered. How, for instance,  do billboards differ regionally? What things are taken into consideration in  designing a billboard? How have they shaped the urban landscape? What makes  them an effective way to sell a product? Have billboards had a golden age, and  if so, when was it? The show fails to address any of these questions, nor does  it mention painter James Rosenquist, Pop art or Photo Realism, all of which  drew considerable inspiration from outdoor advertising.  </P> <P> Horribly installed, the show combines vast stretches of empty space with  monotonous sequences of tiny photographs and a few chunks of actual billboards.  This exhibit looks boring, turns out, on close examination, to be boring, and  communicates none of the wonderfully crass spectacle of the art form it seeks  to illuminate.  </P></p>

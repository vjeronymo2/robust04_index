			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / BSkyB plans 1,000 jobs in Scotland British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, is to locate its second subscriber management centre in Scotland, creating the equivalent of up to 1,000 full-time jobs by 2000. The Pounds 10m centre will be at Dunfermline, Fife, across the Forth estuary from the company's centre at Livingston, West Lothian. The two centres will handle the accounts of subscribers to BSkyB services. The Livingston centre, opened in 1990 with 150 staff, now has a permanent staff of 1,300 and engages another 500 at peak times. The choice of Scotland for the new BSkyB development is seen as a particular success for Locate in Scotland, the inward investment agency. The company had narrowed the choice to Dunfermline and Dublin, the Irish capital. BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, will build a 100,000 sq ft centre in two stages on an 8 1/2 -acre site at Dunfermline. The first stage will be ready for occupation next autumn. The new investment will help offset the effect on the Fife economy of the downgrading of the Rosyth naval base to a naval support establishment. A total of 700 civilian workers at the base are to lose their jobs in the next few years and the number of naval personnel stationed there is to be cut from 1,800 to 300. BSkyB expects to provide a substantial number of part-time jobs at Dunfermline, eventually reaching the equivalent of 1,000 full-time posts. It expects 60 per cent of the workforce to be women. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the project reinforced Scotland's position as 'one of the premier locations in Europe for call-centre projects'. He said Scotland was now the home of a number of telemarketing and back-office processing operations. Shinetsu Handotai, the Japanese maker of silicon wafers, is to invest a further Pounds 23m at its plant at Livingston. It plans to increase capacity from 130,000 wafers a month to 200,000 by January and to 330,000 by April 1996, bringing the company's investment in the Livingston plant to Pounds 53m, and raising employment from 250 to 350 people. The wafers are used to manufacture semiconductors.</p>

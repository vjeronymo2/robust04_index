			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra: "Lebanese Forces and </F> Hizballah Are Two Sides of the Same Coin"]    [Text] We do not speak the truth for devious purposes, as  the Lebanese Forces' information media organs and Commander  Samir Ja'ja' claim. It is true that there should be no double  standards in Lebanon, that all people are equal before the law,  and that no one is above the law. We are being true to  ourselves when we maintain that we support all the security  measures taken by the Lebanese authorities to pursue the  suspicious role played by the Lebanese Forces, primarily Ghidras  [headquarters of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Ja'ja']. The  government is not only doing the right thing but is also  dutybound to use its legal powers to arrest suspects, fugitives,  and defendants in operations against state security.    It is true that the Lebanese Forces' information media  unscrupulously threaten the homeland's unity, fan the fire, and  castigate the state and its institutions. These media fail to  blame the Zionist enemy, who strikes at the homeland, its unity,  and its Christians and Muslims. As a matter of fact, when the  media fails to adopt a responsible position they become  irresponsible and, consequently, the government is not to blame  for the way it deals with them. Despite their dangerous role  against Lebanon and its unity, no one has tried to harm these  media organs.    We support the security measures that the Lebanese legal  authorities have taken to preserve security. The government is  right when it says that security must cover all Lebanese  territory.    Therefore, we speak the truth and mean it when we denounce  the military parade staged by the Hizballah in Ba'labakk to mark  the Jerusalem Day anniversary. We are against this encroachment  on the state's rights in Ba'labakk, which recurs every month in  a desperate attempt to restore the atmosphere of the civil war,  which all Lebanese reject. All the Lebanese people reject the  civil war and those who seek to remind them of this war and even  try to endear its destruction to certain people within their own  ranks.    We are against this unilateral act that Hizballah performs  in  one Lebanese area after another in an attempt to show that it is  above the law. We are against Hizballah's attempts to create a  rift between the people and the state in certain areas, to  challenge the state's prestige, and to drive out or subjugate  its establishments.    We are against the timing that Hizballah chose to challenge  the state, first when it insisted on staging the military parade  in the streets of Ba'labakk at a time when Lebanese security  forces were doing their duty in chasing and hunting down  fugitives and wanted criminals on charges of bombings and  encroachment on the state establishments. It is unreasonable to  see Lebanese security forces doing their sacred national duty of  protecting the homeland and citizens' security in one area of  Lebanon while those in another area have to relinquish that same  duty and are forced to leave their positions because a military  force is organizing a military parade.    Since it is only natural for the security forces to arrest  those who carry unlicensed arms and threaten security in  Ghidras, it is unreasonable for groups to take to the streets in  Ba'labakk by the hundreds and perhaps by the thousands, flouting  the state's prestige, threatening national security and  citizens, defying the people's feelings, provoking the formula  of coexistence, and arousing hateful feelings that were buried  once and for all with the end of the civil war and the advent of  social peace.    As we support the security forces in hunting down fugitive  criminals -- who challenged the state's institutions, laws, and  organs -- and call for rewarding the security men who performed  their duty while aware of the dangers confronting them, we also  call for punishing those who relinquished their official posts  in the security departments in Ba'labakk and agreed to be  spectators of the military parade. Those who staged the  military parade in Ba'labakk sought to negate any state presence  in the city.    Yes, we will bear in mind the actions of Hizballah and  others  against the state and its military, political, informational,  educational, and cultural establishments. Yes, we will not  ignore its plan to bring down the government in favor of chaos  where its logic might prevail so that it may control the  homeland for reasons that have nothing to do with patriotism or  Islam. We view the parade in Ba'labakk as part of this  destructive plan under the banner of religion, Jerusalem,  struggle, and a march.    We believe that Hizballah's timing gave the residents of  Ghidras the opportunity to say something true for unholy  purposes. We tell the truth for the sake of the truth and for  selfless goals when we maintain that Hizballah is in harmony  with the Lebanese Forces in its constant endeavor to remain  outside the state. Both have a common interest in antagonizing  the state. Perhaps every move either party makes against the  state is used to serve the interests of the other party. Both  parties have become two sides of the same coin, generating chaos  and serving the interests of others at the expense of Lebanon,  namely, the state and its establishments.    We do not believe that the state is worthy of survival if it  fails to abide by its own logic that was manifest in two cases:  First when it did its duty in Ghidras and, second, when it  hunted down those who challenged the state in Ba'labakk. This  is the truth told for the sake of truth.</p>

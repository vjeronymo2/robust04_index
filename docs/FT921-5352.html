			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Nadir payments to Tories MR Asil Nadir secretly transferred at least Pounds 130,000 in donations to the Conservative Party during the 1980s from companies within his Polly Peck business empire, Andrew Jack writes. A team led by Mr Christopher Morris of accountants Touche Ross, one of the joint administrators of Polly Peck International, unearthed cheques drawn on companies within the Polly Peck group between 1985 and 1990. None of the donations was disclosed in the accounts for the years concerned. Mr Nadir, who was chairman of PPI, currently faces 66 charges of fraud and false accounting. It has been known for some time that Mr Nadir made donations to the Conservatives but it had previously been believed that these were made solely from his own money. Touche Ross confirmed last night that it had identified donations from Polly Peck companies soon after the group went into administration. Mr Morris has been advised that nothing can be done to recover the money. Company legislation requires that political and charitable contributions made by companies are disclosed in the annual report and accounts. However, the DTI was unable to confirm last night whether these disclosure requirements cover subsidiary companies or simply the parent.</p>

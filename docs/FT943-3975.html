			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Italy seeks greater influence in Brussels Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, will today launch Italy's attempt to increase its standing in Brussels during a meeting with Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming Commission president. Mr Berlusconi will show Mr Santer a list of heavyweight non-partisan candidates for the two Italian seats on the new European Commission, which takes office in January. But he will also try to convince Mr Santer to accept a delay in the formal nomination of commissioners, in the hope that Italy can win one of Brussels' top economic portfolios for its candidates. The new Italian government is keen to boost Italy's stature in the European Union to the same level as Britain, Germany and France, following decades in which it has lacked real influence. The recent proposals by Germany's Christian Democratic Union for a hard core of EU countries, excluding Italy, have underlined the problem. Politicians and ordinary Italians are angry that their country, a founder member of the Union, might be consigned to 'league division two', as the Italian headlines put it last week. The list of potential Italian candidates for commissioner is headed by Professor Mario Monti, a distinguished economist and head of Milan's private Bocconi University, Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former trade minister, and Mr Enrico Vinci, secretary general of the European Parliament. The list is deliberately non-partisan, ending fears that nominees might be drawn from the right-wing National Alliance. Alliance ministers have already faced protests from their European counterparts at EU meetings, because of the party's neo-fascist roots. But Italy wants some guarantee that Prof Monti will receive an economics portfolio in Brussels. Such a guarantee is difficult to give because it will not be clear whether Denmark intends to renominate Mr Henning Christophersen, the existing economics commissioner, until after the forthcoming Danish elections. Mr Ruggiero's availability is also unclear, because he is still in the running for head of the World Trade Organisation, the planned successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Even if Mr Christophersen does not remain at his post, other EU countries may object to an Italian overseeing the convergence of EU economies in the period up to European monetary union. Some EU members are not convinced of Italy's commitment to meeting the deficit and debt targets laid out in the Maastricht treaty. Prof Monti, a strong advocate of budget rigour, underlined his claim to the job with an article in Saturday's Corriere della Sera newspaper, in which he argued that the Italian government could and should bring its budget deficit within the Maastricht limits. In a speech on Saturday, Mr Berlusconi repeated his promise that a 'rigorous and committed' 1995 budget would be agreed by the government later this month. He is also likely to lay out Italy's objections to a 'two-speed Europe' at today's meeting with Mr Santer, who is beginning a tour of European capitals.</p>

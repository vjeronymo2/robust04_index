			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDDIE HART DIDN'T HAVE A LOCK ON GOLD MEDAL  </P> <P> Jim Murray's claim (Feb. 15) that Eddie Hart was a shoo-in for the 100-meter  dash gold medal at the 1972 Olympics was hardly based on facts.  </P> <P> Murray dismisses Valery Borzov of the Soviet Union as though he were a  second-rate sprinter, "with fast times at questionable places."  </P> <P> Borzov was ranked fifth in the world in 100 meters in 1969, second in 1970 and  first in 1971.  </P> <P> Eddie Hart was a fast but inconsistent sprinter. In 1972, he won two out of  seven races at 100 meters.  </P> <P> Borzov's Olympic victory over Robert Taylor marked the third year in a row he  defeated the U.S. champion. The experts had no trouble ranking him No. 1 in the  world for the second year in a row.  </P> <P> KEN MURRAY, West Covina  </P></p>

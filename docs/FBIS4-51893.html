			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Thuan Thanh: "Militancy and the Power of </F> Persuasion in the Current Ideological Work"]    [Text] Ours is a militant and revolutionary party.  Therefore, its ideological work must display high militancy and  great power of persuasion. At turning points -- especially when  the revolutionary cause enjoys new opportunities and also faces  great difficulties and challenges -- there is a greater need for  ideological work to meet high militancy requirements. Under  such circumstances, efforts must be made to point out the  advantages and difficulties; shed light on the profound and new  character of the problems encountered; adopt timely action to  get rid of all indications of subjectivism, pessimism,  oscillation, faltering faith, and erroneous concepts regarding  policies and lines; and take firm steps to lay bare and  effectively cope with sabotage by hostile forces on the  ideological front.    Since the sixth party congress, the national and  international situations have become very complicated and put  our party's ideological work through a very stringent test. A  socioeconomic crisis began in the late seventies and early  eighties and lasted for many consecutive years. The situation  became more precarious from 1986-1988 when inflation developed  at a galloping pace. Then 1991 witnessed the crumbling of the  former Soviet Union and a number of socialist countries. Our  country faced another dangerous challenge.    Nonetheless, our party has demonstrated its political  steadfastness and persisted along the socialist path. Thanks to  its spirit of independence, sovereignty, and creativeness, our  party has helped our people tide over great challenges, stand  firmly on their own feet, and begin to shift to a new  development stage.    The events of recent years have provided us with new  knowledge and experiences regarding militancy and the power of  persuasion in ideological work.    Nevertheless, our militancy and power of persuasion in  ideological work have not been upgraded in an even manner to  meet our high requirements. There are still instances in which  cadres, party members, and people fail to adopt a clear-cut  attitude, heighten vigilance, and fully realize the acts of  sabotage by hostile forces aimed at getting rid of the party and  socialist regime in our country. A number of cadres and party  members still look on with indifference in the face of the  enemy's erroneous concepts and attempts to instigate the people  and cause disturbances. Others oscillate when confronted with  the need to persist along the socialist path, or worse still,  want to follow a different path. Efforts have been made on the  ideological and theoretical fronts. Nonetheless, because our  efforts still do not meet the high militancy requirements, the  results obtained are not effective enough to provide timely and  eloquent solutions to problems arising from real life  situations. Many cadres and party members, including leading  cadres, are still too lazy to learn... Dissension still exerts a  very heavy impact in a number of party organizations.    Now that the revolution has reached a new turning point, the  militancy requirements of ideological work are reflected through  the following points:    -- It is necessary to safeguard the essential problems  concerning the revolutionary cause. They include the  "ideological and theoretical foundations, political goals and  lines, and the nature of party leadership..." As far as the  aforementioned problems are concerned, ideological work must  meet the high militancy requirements and must give top priority  to efforts to work out problem-solving methods.    -- It is important to uphold the high militancy in our  ideological work. The current situation requires theoretical  work to begin first so that orientations can be set. Because  the real life situations are too new to understand, though, many  problems need to be clarified. The militancy in the ideological  work must be reflected through one's assertiveness, ability to  make early predictions and be sensitive to new developments,  determination to make bold studies, and courage to deal with  unprecedented problems while at the same time taking precautions  against disorientation.    -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party lines and  resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly, display  single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation  measures. Efforts must be made to overcome weaknesses arising  from subjectivism and internal dissension that are likely to  develop at turning points. It is important to make sure that  words match deeds and yield effective results. Efforts must be  made to do away with poor work organization and skepticism,  because these drawbacks exert a negative impact on militant  activities.    -- Make sustained efforts to educate cadres and party  members  so they can grasp new opportunities while at the same time  helping to safeguard and develop the political stalwartness of  each cadre, party member, and individual citizen.    The militancy in ideological work covers concrete contents  based on the specific requirements and tasks of each of the  revolution's development stages. The aforementioned  requirements and tasks have already been clearly defined by the  midterm national party conference and the conference on  ideological and cultural work in early 1994.    Based on the aforementioned orientations, the militancy in  ideological work must be patterned after a number of key  ideological concepts. It is necessary to uphold the spirit of  independence, sovereignty, and self-sufficiency and self-help.  At the same time, it is important to criticize and help  overcome the bad practices of waiting for help from the outside  world or relying on subsidies from the state or upper echelons.  As far as ideological work is concerned, efforts must be made  to discover and encourage examples of success made possible by  the spirit of self-sufficiency and self-help in the framework of  the renovation cause of our party and people. It is necessary  to learn selectively from mankind's achievements and from other  countries' experiences and apply them to the actual situation in  Vietnam in a correct and creative manner. Timely measures must  be taken to check and overcome slavish imitation and dogmatism,  which always does more harm than good to the revolutionary  undertaking, no matter where it comes from. Here military  spirit is reflected through the will to act and free oneself  from poverty, dependence, and the danger of being left behind.    It is important to promote the sense of industry, thrift,  honesty, and righteousness. Practicing thrift to serve the  cause of national construction and defense is a major policy  designed by our party to mobilize and make effective use of all  available resources to develop the national industrialization  and modernization program a further step. We must carry out the  ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the  following: -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party  lines and resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly,  display single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation  measures.

We must carry out the  ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the  need to make persistent and meticulous efforts to turn our  ideological concept into a lifestyle for all members of society  to follow. As an immediate objective, it is necessary to  condemn resolutely the waste or loss of public funds and use of  budget allocations on extravagant spending sprees, lavish  parties, gifts, and unnecessary equipment. Measures must be  taken to put an end to the bad practice of spending beyond the  limits set by our economic growth rate.    Strategically speaking, it is very important to grasp  opportunities, eliminate dangers, and overcome challenges to  shift the country gradually to a new development stage and  accelerate the renovation undertaking, which is aimed at making  the people rich and the country powerful and at building an  equal and civilized society. Therefore, it is necessary to  understand this strategically important concept thoroughly and  apply it to the current situation to accelerate our country's  renovation undertaking.    This means that it is now possible for the militancy in  ideological work to shift from a defensive position to an  offensive position, take the upper hand, and move forward.    Ideological work must be carried out in a confident manner  and with new enthusiasm. Refresher training programs on the  party's concepts and lines must be held so that cadres and party  members can enhance their knowledge; be firm in the nation's  choice of the socialist path; study their appropriate adaptation  and development of Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought in  the new situation; and discover and resolutely rectify incorrect  conceptions, vague interpretation, and ideological deviation to  counter opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative  manifestations. It is necessary to discover early and fight  uncompromisingly against deviations in outlining lines and  policies and executing the party's lines and policies, which may  lead to aberrations in the socialist path. We have to criticize  and analyze incorrect conceptions and hostile allegations in  society quickly and correctly.    The heavy losses suffered by many ruling communist parties  in  the past provide us with a profound lesson in party building  tasks. It is a lesson about the danger of erroneous lines;  violations of the principles of the party's organization and  activity; mistakes in selecting and deploying cadres, especially  key cadres; and the practice of bureaucracy and staying aloof  from the public. It is also a lesson for us about enhancing the  party's intellect, logic, and political capacity; uniting in  ideology; and preserving the fine quality of party cadres and  party members.    In August 1989, the party Central Committee directly stated  that many party organs, leading cadres, and party members have  been lax in their ideological tasks. They lack a fighting  spirit against deviate ideas and conceptions and incorrect  actions and statements. They are showing poor responsibility in  the fight for the socialist ideology.    This situation has been corrected and overcome in one step.  The militancy in ideological work has been further restored and  enhanced. We need to clearly realize our shortcomings, though,  including very severe ones.    In many party installations, the education, control, and  management work of party members has been undermined by  irregular and poor party activities. The idealism of some party  members has faded. Their fighting power has decreased. Some  have plunged into the practice of individualism, opportunism,  and pragmatism. They take advantage of loopholes in party and  state policies and management structures to practice corruption  and get rich illegally. They have become depraved and  degenerated. Some cadres are preoccupied with sectionalism and  factionalism. They fight for higher positions and personal  interests, thus severely affecting the party unity.    Facing this situation, the ideological work of party  installations must not be evasive, yielding, or rightist. The  improvement of ideological and political quality starts with  strengthening the spirit of criticism and fighting based on the  party's conceptions and stands. The fighting spirit is badly  needed in the current activities of party installations.    At the moment, the fighting spirit also requires more study  efforts by the entire party as well as every party cadre and  party member. Our party is a vanguard party; at the moment,  more than any other time, party members must improve their  intelligence level. If a party member does not want to study  for his own advancement, he cannot improve his knowledge and  assume a leading role.    The militant character requires that control over the  implementation of the party's lines, policies, and statutes be  strengthened. We have to overcome situations where  implementation does not comply with resolutions, words do not  agree with actions, and the practice of many cadres who remain  silent in conferences but whose deeds are always at variance  with party resolutions. In the current situation, political  determination, loyalty to party ideals, and devotion to serving  the interests of laborers and people should be considered the  most essential characteristics of a party member. They are also  guiding concepts in the task of heightening the militant and  compelling characteristics of ideological work.    Ideological work implies the task of building trust. It  requires high motivational and persuasive abilities that can  work effectively on people's wills and emotions. A very  persuasive character leads to a strong, sharp, and effective  militant spirit. The militancy in ideological work, therefore,  requires self-education and self-criticism by every individual  in order to better their implementation. The struggle on the  ideological and theoretical fronts can only succeed if every  cadre seriously contemplates the essential issues in the party's  viewpoints and political lines, then draws the logical  conclusions and makes necessary and positive adjustment in  conception and viewpoint.    Nowadays, social democratization is expanding, people's  knowledge is increasing quickly, and public media and other  information sources have become very rich and diversified.  These changes update human thinking very rapidly, increase  cultural interaction enormously, and make social disparity  wider. Therefore, ideological work should not be carried out in  outdated ways and its militancy should not be conceived and  developed as before. Reality demands that the current  ideological work should be highly compelling; a characteristic  our struggle on the ideology front should strive to achieve  through persuasion, not coercion and pressure.    Our ideological work, therefore, should be renovated toward  widening democracy and increasing the volume of information in  practical and suitable forms for different types of target  groups. It should also allow more dialogue and open debate. The  innovative spirit should be developed among party members and  cadres. The tasks of criticizing and evaluating viewpoints  should be carried out properly, but not in a rough and coercive  manner that prevents independent thinking.    The militant and compelling character of ideological work  must be built through discussion and debate on contradicting  opinions and viewpoints in order to obtain eventual profound  agreement with the party's lines and viewpoints.  Democratization should be implemented along with careful  observation of party discipline and order, and with a high sense  of responsibility by party members. Distinctions should be made  between people who observe organizational discipline and order  but hold the wrong viewpoint because of their low level of  understanding and knowledge, and those who intentionally breach  party discipline and carry out evil deeds.    The methods and forms of political activities must be  diversified regularly. We should not only convey the contents  of resolutions, but also encourage the raising of issues and  provide all the necessary information and material. We should  compare the party's viewpoints and policies with reality, thus  helping people -- through thought and discussion in a frank and  democratic atmosphere -- solve for themselves any confusions in  their viewpoints.</p>

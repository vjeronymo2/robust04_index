			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Old spectres haunt the party:  Labour's past still threatens its future AS Labour's leadership election grinds on into its second month, the party appears ever more unable to avoid reminding the electorate just how fiercely conservative and anachronistic its basic instincts remain. A process that started with pledges that no stone would be unturned in the pursuit of modernisation and renewal this week saw the national executive, Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader, and all three candidates for the deputy leadership swear undying fealty to maintaining the party's historic union links. Meanwhile, newspaper readers have become reacquainted with the world of block votes and union-executive recommendations. Rather than spark debate, the leadership race has reinforced traditional positions as candidates have vied for the votes of the party faithful. On Wednesday the Fabian Society met in Westminster Central Hall - two appositely early-20th-century institutions - to hear the deputy leadership contenders stolidly oppose any tampering with Clause Four, the party's controversial commitment to public ownership. In consequence, Labour more and more resembles the political equivalent of the Church of England - an introverted minority cult whose ageing followers draw strength from an ancient litany of values, all but forgotten by the fast-moving world outside. Yet in spite of that, the internal power struggle might have a crucial bearing on the party's hopes of power. No one seriously doubts that Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, will win the leadership at a trot. The real struggle is for the deputy leadership - a largely symbolic post that, precisely for symbolic reasons, will carry important messages to the electorate as to what Labour represents. The choice before Labour's electoral college is between an establishment candidate, a self-styled radical reformer and a party traditionalist. Mr Margaret Beckett is known to be Mr Smith's preferred choice. A one-time leftwinger, a woman and English, her curriculum vitae meshes well with his - as does her proven ability as shadow chief secretary to grapple with the awkward political decisions involved in constructing a formula for democratic socialism on a limited budget. Many, though, find Mrs Beckett's candidature lacklustre, based above all on her gender and her promise not to rock Mr Smith's boat. Yesterday she tried to meet those criticisms by tabling a manifesto. It promised such items as a 'poverty census', a charter offering lifelong access to education and a Citizenship Commission to press for public funding for political parties. But the package smacked more of marketing strategies than of conviction. Such a charge could also be levelled at Mr Bryan Gould's headily ambitious offerings, such as Europe-wide initiatives for full employment. In reality, the environment spokesman's case rests not on his - widely disputed - credentials as a radical reformer but on his subtle combination of political guile and voter appeal that carries undoubted credibility in middle-class southern England. By contrast, Mr John Prescott's candidature has been described by one of his rivals as 'a cry of pain' from the increasingly marginalised traditional blue-collar Labour vote. Disarmingly aware of his public-relations limitations, the bluntly spoken transport spokesman has pitched for the deputy's job as an opportunity to shake up the party organisation. About 10 days ago, Westminster rumours suggested that the Smith camp was 'talking up' Mr Prescott's candidature to undermine Mr Gould and bolster a perceived flagging in the Beckett campaign. Now it appears that growing momentum behind Mr Prescott, particularly among some blue-collar unions, has thrown that strategy into reverse. Several 'modernisers' supporting the shadow chancellor are coming to the view that it would be far better to live with the creative tensions inevitable in a Smith-Gould leadership than to end up having to offer the voters Mr Smith and Mr Prescott - two essentially old-fashioned and possibly electorally catastrophic versions of Labour's image. Mr Gould's supporters believe that if he can get through to the second round of the ballot he can win a straight run-off against either of his rivals. Like Mr Prescott's team, they think there is strong union and constituency party resistance to the 'dream ticket' of Smith-Beckett. Mr Gould himself concedes that there is a real difficulty in persuading the electoral college - in which the unions have 40 per cent, MPs and MEPs 30 per cent and constituencies 30 per cent - to vote for him both for the leadership and the deputy posts. Ironically, if leftwing opponents of the party establishment opt for a Gould-Prescott protest vote, it may result in the shadow environment secretary losing out on both jobs and letting Mr Prescott through. One Gould campaigner said: 'Our problem is all in the first round.' As the Tories lick their lips at the prospect of a Smith-Prescott leadership, many neutral observers believe that only Mr Gould has the southern appeal and potential for imaginative leaps that the pragmatic, Scottish Mr Smith will need to broaden his appeal. With just over six weeks to go before balloting - and in spite of the crucial importance of the result - it looks equally clear that no one has the vaguest notion of what that outcome will be.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By William D. Grossman, director of the Hong Kong Office of </F> Quantum Financial Services, Inc.: "Futures Industry Needs Self-  Regulation"]    [Text] During the past two years, the futures industry in  China has grown faster than even the most ardent optimists could  have anticipated. Exchanges have sprung up in major commercial  centres, and brokerage firms, trading on both domestic and  international markets, have multiplied.    Along with this progress, however, has come concern. Most  notably, business has expanded far more quickly than regulation,  leaving a gap that has attracted the unwary and the unscrupulous.    In response, the central government is adopting  comprehensive  regulations governing the futures industry.    This is perhaps the right time to set up a futures industry  self- regulatory organization to enhance its enforcement  capabilities.    The situation in China's futures industry is similar to that  of the U.S. in the 1970's. At that time, this sector of the  U.S. economy was loosely regulated by the Commodity Exchange  Authority (CEA), an office within the Department of Agriculture.  The CEA concentrated on domestic agricultural futures, while  products such as coffee, sugar and metals were unregulated.    In addition, there was no formal, well-enforced registration  process for persons handling customers' funds and orders. This  provided a breeding ground for sharp operators who took  advantage of unsuspecting customers. Not surprisingly, scandals  began to emerge.    As a result, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the  Commodity Exchanges Act in 1974, which, among other things,  created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).    The CFTC was set up as an independent federal regulatory  agency. It was given responsibility for registering industry  professionals; approving rules, regulations, and new contracts  of futures exchanges; establishing minimum financial standards  and adopting trading standards for futures brokers; and creating  a dispute procedure. Equally important, the CFTC was assigned  the responsibility of enforcing the rules it adopted.    Initially, the CFTC had only 200 employees. Today it has  about 700. But with such a small staff and limited resources,  it was apparent that enforcement of the strict new provisions of  the Commodity Exchange Act would be difficult.    So the CFTC adopted regulations requiring each exchange to  set up its own rules, subject to CFTC approval, and to enforce  these rules on all the exchange's members.    The CFTC had two reasons for requiring the exchanges to  conduct self-regulation. First, it wanted to economize on its  own resources which are funded by tax-payers' money. Second, by  delegating auditing and enforcement responsibilities to the  exchanges, the CFTC intended to take advantage of the fact that  the exchanges would be in the best position to monitor the daily  activities of their members and obtain relevant market  information.    Exchange self-regulation was successful in promoting fair  markets and building confidence on the part of both domestic and  international customers.    However, there was a problem, not every futures broker was a  member of a futures exchange. And because of the CFTC's limited  resources, these brokers were able to avoid strict government  scrutiny of their activities.    In response, the CFTC-approved National Futures Association  was set up on October 1, 1982, to audit and monitor non-exchange  members.    The industry endorsed the concept of self-regulation for  three reasons.    First, it could promote high standards of professional  conduct and financial responsibility.    Second, the industry believed that a private sector self-  regulatory organization could operate with a high degree of  efficiency and expertise.    Third, it was anticipated that a private sector  self-regulatory organization could operate more economically  than the CFTC. In this regard, the NFA's funding, which comes  from customer transaction fees of $0.20 per round turn for each  futures contract and $0.12 per side for each option contract,  are generally accepted to be less than the "user fees" the CFTC  probably would have assessed to conduct similar activities.    In the past 12 years, the combination of self-regulation by  the exchanges and the NFA has provided a very efficient and  cost- effective supplement to government regulation.    At this critical period in the development of China's  futures  industry and futures regulatory system, it may be appropriate to  consider setting up China's own futures industry self-regulatory  organization.</p>

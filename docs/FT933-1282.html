			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: United Air, Emirates in alliance UNITED Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers, has reached a marketing alliance with Emirates, the fast-growing Dubai airline, in a further move to expand its international network. United is also close to finalising a wide-ranging commercial agreement with Lufthansa of Germany, which hinges on the outcome of negotiations in Bonn this week on a new bilateral aviation agreement between Germany and the US. The marketing partnership with Emirates will include code-sharing services from the US to Dubai via London's Heathrow airport. Code-sharing allows the airlines to use each other's flight identification code to book passengers in computer reservation systems. This will enable United to link its flights to Emirates' extensive network to and from the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and Asia, with United's trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific services and its domestic US route system. Emirates is launching a second daily service from Heathrow to Dubai next month, timed to connect with United's trans-Atlantic services. The proposed partnership between United and Lufthansa would also involve a code-sharing agreement, giving Lufthansa greater access into the US market and boosting United's reach into the European market. Lufthansa has been seeking a strong US partner to strengthen its competitive position on the North Atlantic. British Airways has already forged a partnership with USAir, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines with Northwest, and Air France reached a commercial agreement with Continental Airlines this summer. The deal, however, has been blocked by the failure so far of the US and German governments to agree a new aviation deal. Negotiations have been blocked by German demands for a three-year capacity freeze on North Atlantic services to and from Germany, and US demands to allow Northwest the right to extend its North Atlantic services to Amsterdam on to Germany.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Tory chief strives to deflect row over contract Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, yesterday committed the government to 'the highest possible standards in public life' as senior ministers sought to deflect allegations of impropriety in arms sales to the Middle East. Amid a welter of allegations about the involvement of Mr Mark Thatcher in the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah deal with Saudi Arabia, Mr Hanley said that no evidence of any financial impropriety had been produced. Seeking to distance the government from the administration led by Baroness Thatcher, who negotiated the Al Yamamah deal in 1985, Mr Hanley said ministers were not answerable for the activities of individuals such as Mr Thatcher. 'The government is led by a prime minister who is highly honourable and honest in his dealings, and the government has a record of which we are proud,' he said on the eve of the party conference in Bournemouth. 'This conference is about the record of this government, and we what are going to do over the next two-and-a-half years.' Mr John Major, who will meet Lady Thatcher when she arrives in Bournemouth today, is understood to be deeply angered by the reports, which divert attention from efforts to steer the government away from Labour taunts about 'sleaze'. However, ministers appeared unable to escape the jibes, which were given fresh currency by a Daily Telegraph opinion poll suggesting that the government is widely associated in the public mind with 'sleaze'. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in Brussels that the findings were a 'sad comment' on the public perception of British politics. 'The fact is British politics is probably still the most honest in the world,' he said on BBC Radio. 'It is a bit of a joke to claim that any political party in Britain has standards that can really be described as 'sleaze'. 'I think in the knockabout of party political exchange some people use language which is extremely unfortunate and some of the Labour spokesmen who go completely over the top ought to reflect on the damage they are doing to public confidence in politics.' Labour MPs showed no signs of easing their campaign against alleged 'sleaze'. Mr Kim Howells, a Labour member of the Commons public accounts committee, said it was 'extraordinary' that most committee members had been prevented from seeing a report on the Al Yamamah deal. 'There were rumours flying around left, right and centre . . .'</p>

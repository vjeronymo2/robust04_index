			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Golubov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- Great significance is being  attached to the Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino's  forthcoming Moscow visit, which begins on April 25, in both  Russia and that Latin American country, the Russian Foreign  Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said at a briefing today.    According to the Foreign Ministry spokesman, a number of  bilateral documents are expected to be signed during Jose Raul  Mulino's visit. They will form a legal basis for cooperation  and give a much needed impulse to Russian-Panamanian interaction  in different spheres, he said.    When ITAR-TASS asked whether recent frequent visits to  Moscow  by representativies of Latin American countires are coincidental  or testify to the activization of Russia's Latin American  foreign policy, Demurin noted that the Russian Foreign Ministry  strives to be equally active and dynamical in all directions.  "Being a great power, we cannot put on the brakes or step on the  gas or dash off to one or the other region," he emphasised.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): M3 data take Frankfurt off day's high GERMAN equities came off the day's highs after disappointing money supply data for May, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT gave up early gains to end unchanged; worse-than-expected M3 money supply figures for May, showing an annualised increase of 9.0 per cent, cast a shadow over trade, but dealers said that their impact was muted. The DAX index ended just 0.50 higher at 1,771.14 after a pre-bourse high of about 1,782, and the FAZ gained 0.75 to 704.87. Turnover rose from DM4.4bn to DM4.7bn. There was some action in second-line stocks, where AEG ended DM4.40 up at DM191.50 after forecasting that 1992 sales will rise by more than 10 per cent, and agreeing a white goods pact with Sweden's Electrolux. The fashion group Escada, under heavy pressure recently, recovered DM19.50 to DM292. In steels, Hoesch went ex dividend and fell a net DM5.50 to DM277.50; Interest moved to Klockner-Werke, DM2.40 higher at DM121.50, and Thyssen, DM3.20 better at DM239.20. PARIS was quietly firmer on the final day of the trading account, as the CAC 40 index added 10.03 to 1,895.80 in turnover of FFr2.4bn. Among blue chips, Total slipped FFr3.90 to FFr232.10 while Alacatel added FFr7 to FFr629 and Michelin put on FFr5.20 to FFr196.70. Lyonnaise-Dumez, which denied a report that it was in talks with Fiat about the possible purchase of Fiat's Cogefar Impresit construction subsidiary, slipped FFr8 to FFr514. MILAN drifted as yet another fault in the screen-based trading system put it out of operation for the first 1 1/2 hours of trading, causing some confusion among dealers regarding opening prices. Continued upward pressure on interest rates and the wait for the new government to be announced also kept investors on the sidelines. The Comit index fell 1.88 to 472.69 in turnover estimated at L80bn after L72.7bn. Fiat was about the only big stock to attract interest but it failed to break above L5,500. The stock added L28 to L5,480. ZURICH was mostly flat but Sandoz, the pharmaceuticals, chemicals and niche nutrition stock, rose SFr80 to SFr2,950 as the SMI index gained a mere 0.2 to 1,847.1. On Monday, Sandoz's arguments for its DHE-45 headache pain injection left Glaxo, with an expensive competing product, at a new 1992 low in the London market. Mr Jonathan Spink of Williams de Broe said that the Swiss company was still benefitting from a meeting with UK fund managers and analysts earlier this month, at which it said it would review its accounting procedures and cut its depreciation charges. OSLO finally broke a run of 15 lower closes in a row, the all-share index rising 7.49, or 1.8 per cent to 416.85. Shipping and industrial stocks recorded the biggest gains, Norsk Hydro and Bergesen A each ending NKr1.5 higher, at NKr160.5 and NKr95 respectively. Oslo has been gloomy about weak corporate earnings, doubts about Norway's future ties to the European Community and high domestic interest rates. STOCKHOLM saw late buying lift prices off midday lows, the Affarsvarlden general index rising 1.7 to 926.4 in turnover of SKr436m after SKr836m. Astra A and B shares both dropped SKr7 to SKr536 and SKr516 respectively while the banking and financial sector index surged 3.1 per cent. Handelsbanken jumped SKr2 to SKr54 while SE Banken eased SKr0.5 to SKr33.0. COPENHAGEN featured Baltica, writes Hilary Barnes, up DKr15 to DKr473 on a forecast staff reduction of 10 per cent over the next two years. Danisco, which fell DKr25 on Tuesday, jumped DKr31 to DKr764 when it was announced that the group is negotiating to take over the sugar production facilities of Sweden's Procordia. The All Share Index closed 0.34 down at 316.58. HELSINKI bounced off Monday's low for the year, helped by gains in Repola which reported better-than-expected results for the first four months of 1992. The Hex index closed 10.3, or 1.4 per cent higher at 768.9. Repola's restricted shares rose FM2 to FM42 after a return to profit, and the bank and finance house index, which fell sharply last week, rose by 3.4 per cent. BRUSSELS gained slightly on the first day of the new account. The Bel-20 index edged up 1.03 to 1,173.48 in turnover of BFr626m. Delhaize rose BFr20 to BFr1,680 with 43,600 shares traded. VIENNA's ATX index fell 2.86 to 956.63 with Vienna Airport shares gaining Sch13 to Sch399. MADRID's general index lost 2.71 to 243.70.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1149.50  1148.75  1148.99  1148.63  1148.78  1149.15  1148.98  1148.49  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1150.62            Day's Low  1148.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Jun 22        Jun 19       Jun 18        Jun 17         Jun 16      1149.77       1154.66      1145.88*      1158.46        1165.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). * Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

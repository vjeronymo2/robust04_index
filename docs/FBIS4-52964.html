			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- It is  evident that the United Nations obstructed any action to be  taken against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that Malaysia  has expressed dissatisfaction with the situation, Prime Minister  Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said here Friday.    It seems like there is an attempt to force the Muslims in  Bosnia to accept whatever decision the UN adopts, he said.    When we question NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation),  it refers us to the UN ... When we ask the UN, it says NATO has  to make the decision.    Dr. Mahathir spoke to reporters at the airport on his return  from an overseas trip which had taken him to Zimbabwe, South  Africa, France, the United States, and China.    He made the comments after extending condolences to the  family of Major Ariffin Zakaria, the Malaysian soldier who was  killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday. The 33-year-old  soldier was killed when United Nations peacekeepers came under  fire from the Serbs near Sarajevo.    The decisions of the UN favour the assumption that the Serbs  have control over Bosnian territory and this is what saddens me,  he said.    On statements by several countries in support of Malaysia's  call for the resignation of UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, Dr. Mahathir said the UN representative in Bosnia,  Yashushi Akashi, should also be removed.    He said he felt that Akashi seemed to be obstructing any  action to be taken against the Serbs.    Dr. Mahathir also said that Western countries were now  beginning to criticize Butrus-Ghali and Akashi.    Maj. Ariffin was the second Malaysian soldier killed in the  conflict. Last month, Maj. Ramli Shaari was killed after he  stepped on a mine in Croatia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 31 Jan (EFE) -- Several student groups and  riot police clashed today, 31 January, in several areas of Quito  during the fourth day of protests over the increase of up to  71.2 percent in the price of gasoline.    President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced the price increase on  28 January, but the disturbances had begun a day earlier when  the media reported the measure.    At least four policemen and an unspecified number of young  people were wounded in skirmishes from 27 to 29 January, and  more than 20 students were arrested. Leaders of trade unions  and other groups announced today they will promote a nationwide  strike and demonstrations on specified days this week to protest  the increase in the price of gasoline.    "The government must understand the people cannot bear any  more adjustments," Edgar Ponce, president of the United Workers  Front (FUT), the country's largest union, said.    Ponce predicted the government's economic policy will cause  "social outbursts" as the ones that took place recently in  Chiapas (Mexico) and Santiago de Estero (Argentina). The price  of many staple products began to rise in public markets as a  result of the gasoline increase, local television stations  reported.    The government ordered a 71.2-percent increase in the price  of the most widely used gasoline and stated it was forced to do  so to ease the drop in the international price of oil, which is  the source of half of its revenues.    Cesar Robalino, finance and public credit minister,  announced  one gallon (3.8 liters) of "extra" gasoline--which, despite its  name, is the most common and most widely used--would rise on 29  January from 1.46 sucres to 2.50 sucres (from $0.70 to $1.20).    A gallon of higher quality "super" gasoline rose 25 percent,  from 2.40 sucres to 3.00 sucres (from $1.14 to $1.43), and a  gallon of "eco" gasoline, which has fewer pollutants, rose by 47  percent, from 1.90 sucres to 2.80 sucres (from $0.90 to $1.33).    Robalino also announced "drastic" cuts in government  spending, the suspension of investment programs, dismissal of  tens of public employees, and a 15-percent ceiling on state  employee pay increases in 1994.</p>

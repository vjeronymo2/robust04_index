			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom wins India contract MR John Major, the British prime minister, ended his four-day tour of India last night by announcing that a Pounds 140m electricity interconnector contract had been won by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo- French engineering group. Mr Major said in Bombay that other Anglo-Indian deals were 'in the pipeline'. He urged the Indian government to continue its economic reforms so further contracts could be agreed. The prime minister called for the opening up of trade, particularly in consumer goods; for a smaller role for India's public sector; and for the reform of the country's labour laws to encourage job creation 'rather than giving an illusion of job security to a privileged few'. The GEC Alsthom contract is the biggest Mr Major has been able to announce after leading a delegation of senior UK businessmen to India. It will be partly funded by Pounds 63m of British aid. Mr Brian Baldock, deputy chairman of Guinness, who travelled with the prime minister, announced that the group's spirits division is to form a joint venture with United Breweries of India to blend and bottle Scotch whisky in the country. However, the project depends on the Indian government removing a 1947 ban on importing alcohol. There is no sign of its early relaxation. GEC Alsthom is to supply the Power Grid Corp of India with a high-voltage direct current convertor station to link the western and southern regions of the country's electricity network. It will use power conversion equipment developed at its Stafford plant. Mr Major has been disappointed by the slow progress on a deal British Aerospace hopes to agree with the Indian Air Force for the supply of Hawk trainer aircraft. The contract is expected to be worth about Dollars 500m (Pounds 329m). Major sees upturn, Page 8</p>

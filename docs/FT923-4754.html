			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Western Mining tumbles into the red WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian mining group, yesterday blamed lower metals prices and an abnormal loss of ADollars 200m for a consolidated net loss of ADollars 8.5m (USDollars 6.07m) in the year to end-June. Last time the group turned in a profit of ADollars 276m. Sales were down 6.8 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. The board cut the final dividend to five cents, fully franked, compared with 11 cents in the second half of the previous year. This made a total for the year of 11 cents, fully franked, against 24 cents. The result was towards the top end of market expectations, and the shares gained four cents to close at ADollars 5.02. WMC said consolidated operating profit was down 30 per cent to ADollars 205m, mainly because of lower prices for nickel and oil, and lower earnings from gold because of lower production. Equity-accounted net profit, which includes the group's interests in associated companies, fell to ADollars 161m from ADollars 362m in the previous year, mainly due to a decline in the contribution from Alcoa to ADollars 141m from ADollars 278m. The group said Alcoa was performing well in a difficult market. Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group, has defied recession in its main markets, registering a 29 per cent increase in consolidated net profit to ADollars 223m (USDollars 160.3m) in the year to end-June. Turnover rose 23 per cent to ADollars 4.1bn. The board declared a final dividend of 15 cents a share, franked to 95 per cent. The interim dividend was 14 cents, franked to 64 per cent. The total of 29 cents compares with 27 cents in the previous year.</p>

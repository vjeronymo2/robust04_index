			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners argue that the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) mandate does not supersede RSPA's delegated authority to designate as hazardous materials only those materials that ``in a particular amount and form may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property.'' 49 U.S.C. 5103. Petitioners are correct that RSPA's designation of a hazardous material under &sect;5103 must rest on a finding that the material may pose the type and degree of risk stated. The authority to make that finding carries with it a range of discretion, so that ordinarily a rulemaking to designate a hazardous material under &sect;5103 requires public notice and an opportunity for comment. Section 9656(a) of CERCLA, however, does not compel RSPA to designate hazardous substances as hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5103. Rather, it imposes an independent, direct rulemaking mandate. Under a section 9656(a) rulemaking, RSPA need not, and indeed may not, inquire as to whether a particular hazardous substance, in a particular amount and form, ``may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property.'' Section 9656(a) already has decided the substance's status as a hazardous material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated above, RSPA does have the authority under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) to modify the set of HMR requirements applicable to hazardous substances as a class. In a rulemaking to consider modifying the HMR, RSPA would examine both the statutory purposes of the hazardous material designation under section 9656(a) (e.g., providing a means for motor vehicle and train operators to know that potentially they are subject to CERCLA reporting requirements) and the costs and benefits of regulatory alternatives. These options are not within the scope of this rulemaking and, to the extent petitioners seek to avoid the hazardous material designation entirely, would not provide petitioners the relief they seek.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners do not document their claims as to the safe transportation history of copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates; the limited public health and environmental risk of those concentrates; or the consequences of the June 20, 1994 rule for, and significance of the costs to, the mining industry. Further, it is not at all clear that the bulk of petitioners' alleged costs, attributable to the voluntary business decisions of private port operators, are cognizable in an agency's consideration of the costs and benefits of its rules. Regardless, because RSPA does not have the discretion to consider the factual basis for petitioners' request, the lack of documentation and the question of the status of petitioners' costs are not material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Procedural Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners object to RSPA's failure to provide public notice and an opportunity for comment before issuing the final rule. Specifically, they challenge RSPA's finding, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), that public notice and comment were not required because notice and comment would have been impractical and unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners assert that because the rule was issued nearly a year after the EPA rulemaking establishing the reduced lead sulfide RQ, allowing for notice and comment would not have been impractical. Section 9656(a) mandates that the RSPA final rule designating a hazardous substance as a hazardous material be issued ``at the time'' that the EPA publishes the hazardous substance designation. It can be argued that this language establishes the impracticality of public notice and comment as a matter of law. Nevertheless, petitioners' argument that an opportunity for public comment could have been provided  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in this case  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> certainly is correct. Regardless, public notice and an opportunity for comment were not required because they were unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As elaborated above, RSPA, contrary to petitioners' argument, does not have the authority in this rulemaking to decide, on the basis of health and environmental effects, what quantities and forms of lead sulfide should be designated as hazardous materials. Public comment was unnecessary because it could not have changed the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Extension of Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners indicate that it may be necessary to adjust shipping arrangements for copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates that as a result of the rule will be designated as hazardous materials. The effective date of that part of the rule that reduces the lead sulfide RQ from 5,000 to 10 pounds is changed from August 29, 1994 to November 29, 1994, to allow petitioners sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements and otherwise to prepare to comply with the rule. No other regulated party has indicated that the August 29, 1994 effective date poses a problem. Therefore, except with respect to the RQ reduction for lead sulfide, the effective date of the rule remains August 29, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> D.

			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAPROOT;  </P> <P> ABBOTT HELPS KIDS EXPLORE POTENTIAL OF INNER STRENGTH  </P> <P> Remember, our handicaps are only problems in the eyes of others.  </P> <P>  -- JIM ABBOTT, in a letter to Laura Small  </P> <P> Born without a right hand, he proved the naysayers wrong and has already won  nine games as a major league pitcher in his rookie season.  </P> <P> Mauled by a mountain lion near San Juan Capistrano when she was 5, she is still  struggling to overcome the partial paralysis and facial scarring that resulted  from the 1987 attack and hopes someday to become an eye doctor.  </P> <P> As far apart as they now stand in their aspirations, Angel pitcher Jim Abbott  and El Toro schoolgirl Laura Small share several traits: A gritty determination  to conquer what others term disabilities and an intense desire not to be  considered special.  </P> <P> It was this bond of understanding that brought the two together through  correspondence in June, when Laura, 8, sent a handwritten note to her baseball  hero, and he quickly reciprocated.  </P> <P> "When I was 5, I got attacked by a mountain lion here in Orange conty," Laura  wrote in large, printed letters to the man who had displaced Wally Joyner as  her favorite ballplayer. "I can't use my right hand and most of my right side  is paralyzed.  </P> <P> "So, I think you're a great baseball Player. My brother David is 12 and is in  love with baseball. He will turn green if you write back. I want to become a  doctor, and seeing you makes me think I can be what I want to be."  </P> <P> The response came only days later.  </P> <P> "I remember hearing about your terrible accident from my home in Michigan,"  Abbott wrote. "I can also recall hearing some tremendous stories of how you  have handled things since.  </P> <P> "Believe me when I say it's a tremendous privilege having someone look up to  you at such a young age. You said in your letter you'd like to become a doctor.  If you believe that now and work on it in the years to come, there's no reason  you can't.  </P> <P> "I wanted to play baseball when I was growing up. The only people who may have  doubted that possibility were those who couldn't accept that my handicap was  not a hindrance. Remember, our handicaps are only problems in the eyes of  others."  </P> <P> When Abbott earned a spot on the Angels' pitching staff this year, he was  thrust into the national spotlight, in large part because of his physical  condition. But he has shunned that attention, seeking fame only for his  pitching abilities.  </P> <P> Quietly, Abbott has met and corresponded with handicapped children across the  country who look to him for inspiration in breaking through what can appear to  be insurmountable limits. It is a part of his life that he prefers not to  discuss publicly.  </P> <P> Tim Mead, the Angels' director of public relations, said: "It's incredible the  number of letters he gets from handicapped kids; easily over a hundred (this  season). And he's met with probably 45 or so of them when the team's on the  road.  </P> <P> "But he really wants to downplay it. He's not doing it for the publicity. He's  doing it to help these kids."  </P> <P> As eager as she is to meet Abbott, Laura said the words of his letter alone  were enough to boost her occasionally sagging spirits.  </P> <P> "I think we have a lot in common," she said at her El Toro home.  </P> <P> Laura said she felt bad for Abbott because of all the attention given in sports  pages across the country to his physical condition and the unique way in which  he throws the ball with his left hand, then quickly prepares to field by  slipping his fingers into a glove tucked under his right arm.  </P> <P> "I really understood," Laura said of the publicity.  </P> <P> As difficult as some of the challenges ahead appear, Laura and her family said  it is her continual identification as "the little girl attacked by the mountain  lion" that can be most frustrating for her.  </P> <P> Having undergone 13 operations in the last three years, Laura has made a  remarkably speedy recovery since the attack, her parents said. Undergoing  regular physical therapy, she now takes ballet classes, participates almost  fully in physical education at school and sports a potent, one-handed swing at  wiffleball.  </P> <P> However, Laura said some schoolchildren tease her about her condition. Comments  from well-meaning people drawing attention to the attack can upset her.  </P> <P> And she was vehemently opposed at first to the idea of talking to a reporter  for yet another account of her story.  </P> <P> "I'm so tired of being special!" she screamed at her mother. "I just want to be  ordinary!  </P> <P> And she said later: "It's like Jim said. You're not really handicapped, but  other people think you are."  </P></p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Ashdown underlines terms for a post-election pact MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, underlined yesterday that the price of his party's support for a minority government after the next general election would be a commitment to proportional representation. His comments came as senior ministers acknowledged that Mr John Major, the prime minister, would welcome the endorsement of Dr David Owen - the leader of the erstwhile SDP - during the election. The ministers dismissed as 'ludicrous', however, weekend reports that such an endorsement could win Dr Owen a place in Mr Major's cabinet. News of discussions between the prime minister and Dr Owen prompted a senior Labour party official to comment that it was further evidence of Mr Major's indecisiveness. 'When the ditherer is so desperate that he consults the Doctor it is clear that even the Tories have begun to recognise that their condition is terminal,' the official said. Mr Ashdown, interviewed on BBC Radio, said that his party was not seeking a 'hung' parliament as a result of the election. Instead, it was intent on maximising its own support for a radical strategy that marked it out clearly from the Conservatives and Labour. But if neither of those parties won an overall majority, the Liberal Democrats would respond. The 'bottom line' was that he would not be prepared even to begin talks with Labour or the Conservatives unless there was agreement to legislate to end the present first-past-the-post electoral system. Mr Ashdown said his message to Mr Major and to Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, was straightforward: 'Don't even pick up the phone unless you are prepared to talk about a fair voting system for Britain.' He denied that the competition between the two main parties to reoccupy the centre ground of British politics was squeezing the Liberal Democrat vote. He insisted that radical policies in areas such as education and the environment marked it out clearly as the party which was prepared to take tough decisions. Senior Conservatives confirmed that Dr Owen had discussed the political outlook with Mr Major at a recent dinner which was attended by other leading Tory party figures. It was said that the prime minister and the leader of the defunct SDP 'got on well'. But there was no question of a deal to ensure that Dr Owen kept his Plymouth parliamentary seat or secured a place in the government.</p>

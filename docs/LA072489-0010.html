			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIBETAN MONKS TO PERFORM ANCIENT RITUAL DANCES IN S.D.  </P> <P> While the world watched in horror as Chinese troops crushed the fledgling  student democratic movement in Tien An Men square, Tibetans could take small  comfort in knowing that they were observing an all-too-familiar pattern of  harsh repression.  </P> <P> Since the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, Tibetans have watched their  protests brutally suppressed. But 12 Tibetan monks from the Dalai Lama's  Namgyal Monastery won't give up. Through public performances on their first  American tour, the monks are demonstrating here by performing an ancient ritual  dance that depicts the destruction of forces threatening Tibetan Buddhism.  </P> <P> The local performance, a free outdoor event sponsored by San Diego's Center for  World Music and Related Arts, will take place at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday in the  Balboa Park Organ Pavilion.  </P> <P> Among the rituals being performed on the tour is the "Black Hat Dance," a  traditional reenactment of a 10th-Century event -- the assassination of the  oppressor-king Lang-Dar-Mar. But it assumes new relevance after nearly 40 years  of Chinese occupation of Tibet and the recent brutal crackdowns on nationalist  feeling within the Himalayan country.  </P> <P> "What is going on in Beijing is absolutely nothing compared to what has been  going on for years in Tibet and the hinterlands," said actor Richard Gere,  chairman of the New York-based Tibet House, which is sponsoring the monks'  tour. "I have been talking about this for years."  </P> <P> Gere, who has studied with the Dalai Lama, describes himself as "a student of  Buddhism" for 15 years. He was one of the founders of Tibet House, a nonprofit  organization established in 1987 in New York "to save the culture of Tibet."  </P> <P> The monks -- exiles and children of exiles living in India -- say that their  art represents a bulwark against cultural genocide.  </P> <P> "Genocide? Definitely, that is what's happening," said Lobsang Samten, 37, one  of the monks, speaking through an interpreter.  </P> <P> "The Chinese are wiping out the whole culture. This is a time when Tibet and  what it represents could be lost to the whole world, the world community.  </P> <P> "What's also important is not only Tibetan culture, but any culture that is  actually part of the universal culture. It's important that that not be allowed  to degenerate or be destroyed or lost."  </P> <P> The monks see their U.S. tour as a way of preserving the culture and countering  government propaganda.  </P> <P> "The reason we're doing this tour of ritual dances is for the purpose of  sharing with the rest of the world Tibetan culture and religion and the Tibetan  situation, and because there are many people who have not heard anything except  for propaganda that the Communist Chinese have sent," said Samten.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the tour will help house, clothe, feed and educate the refugees  who continue to flee the Chinese occupation and arrive daily at the Namgyal  Monastery, where the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of Tibet,  took refuge in 1959.  </P> <P> The Dalai Lama is regarded by his 6 million followers in Tibet and about  100,000 emigrant Tibetans as the 14th reincarnation of a Buddhist deity.  (Although he is the supreme leader only of the followers of the Tibetan sect,  the Dalai Lama commands wide respect from the estimated 300,000 Buddhists in  Southern California.)  </P> <P> How serious is the situation in Tibet?  </P> <P> Gere said that 1 1/2 million Tibetans have been killed. "That's one-sixth of  the population. Now there are 7 1/2 million Chinese in Tibet (through the  government's civilian population transfer policy), which makes the Tibetans a  minority in their own country. . . .  </P> <P> "When you consider how quickly this was done to such an extraordinarily  developed culture, it's really heartbreaking."  </P> <P> Further horrors were catalogued in testimony delivered to the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee on Sept. 17, 1987, by John F. Avedon, author of "In Exile  From the Land of Snows: the First Full Account of the Dalai Lama and Tibet  Since the Chinese Conquest":  </P> <P> "In sum, a 2,100-year-old civilization was essentially destroyed in a mere 20  years."  </P> <P> The Tibetan religion is complex. The ritual dances, although performed in  brightly colored brocade robes and various striking masks and headpieces, are  not mere entertainment, either for the spectators or the dancers.  </P> <P> "The most important reason for performing these ritual dances . . . is to be  able to eliminate or annihilate the disturbing emotions or mental afflictions,"  said Samten.  </P> <P> That effort is directed on two levels.  </P> <P> "One is for people to see," he said. "In Tibet, the people had great faith in  the lamas or the teachers. Because they saw directly these costumes and these  dancers, they had a feeling that they were seeing the Buddhas and very holy  beings, which created happiness in their minds. That's one level.  </P> <P> "On another level, performing the dances helped to increase the Tantric level  meditations that the monks were doing. Based on that, it's believed that the  audience receives a blessing by coming to see dances that represent enlightened  beings -- a blessing that invokes, for the purpose of peace, a more peaceful  state of mind."  </P> <P> The dances will be authentic in costume and choreography but will be greatly  shortened from the originals. The "Black Hat Dance," for instance, takes three  days when done at the Year End Ceremony. Explanatory commentary will be  provided before each dance.  </P> <P> Although the steps may look simple, behind each dance is a complex symbolism  and philosophy. The purpose of the "Lords of the Cemetery" dance, performed by  four men in red skeleton costumes and grinning masks, for instance, is "to  re-create the memory of impermanence," Samten said.  </P> <P> "For the audience to remember impermanence and for each of the dancers to think  about impermanence while they're doing the dance.  </P> <P> "Some ritual dances can be learned very easily and very quickly within a couple  of months," he said. Others, because of the complexity of the movement,  learning of the chants and understanding the symbolism, "are much more  complicated and require several years of training."  </P> <P> An example is the Offering Dance within the Kalachakra Initiation. "I've been a  monk for 18 years and I've been studying it during that time," said Samten.  "But still I don't consider myself to have really learned it well."  </P> <P> Does he ever expect to perform it in Tibet?  </P> <P> "Always we have the great wish to return to Tibet," he said, citing three  reasons for the hope. "One is that the political situation of the whole world  is constantly changing, and, two, the political situation in China, as we can  see, also is constantly changing.  </P> <P> "And the third and most important reason is that everyone in the world wants to  be happy and wants peace. And because everyone respects peace, everyone wants  peace, they will support peaceful movements."  </P></p>

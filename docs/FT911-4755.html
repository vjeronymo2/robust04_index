			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Safety of tap water questioned DRINKING water in some areas might pose 'a significant risk to health' because the government has secretly allowed privatised water companies to relax standards, Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's shadow minister for environmental protection, alleged yester-day. She claimed some companies had been allowed 'blanket relaxations of toxic and microbiological standards'. Mr David Trippier, minister of state for the environment, denied the claim and accused Mrs Taylor of 'the worst sort of scaremongering'. He said: 'All drinking water supplied in this country is safe to drink.' The Water Services Association, which represents the privatised water companies, said: 'None of the water supplied breaches safe limits as determined by the government's independent medical advisers.' The association said a few unsatisfactory water supplies had been identified and undertakings to put them right had been made public in 1989. Work was being carried out to the timetable agreed, it added. Labour intends to bring the matter to the attention of the European Commission to check whether the water companies are in breach of the EC water directive.</p>

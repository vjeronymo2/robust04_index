			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow is concerned about the course of the  fulfillment of the agreement between the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea. This was stated at a  briefing today by Gregory Karasin, director of the Department of  Information and Press of the Russian Foreign Ministry. In  particular, he called attention to a statement by Pyongyang that  puts in doubt the constant inspection by the IAEA of North  Korean nuclear installations and threatens to leave the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Russian diplomat stressed that  North Korea should remain a participant in the treaty and fully  implement its obligations. Grigory Karasin spoke in favor of  bilateral and multilateral talks aimed at removing tension  around this question.</p>

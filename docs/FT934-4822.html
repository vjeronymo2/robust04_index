			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Patten backs Flowers recommendation for longer academic year The government yesterday endorsed plans to lengthen the academic year, while lecturers suggested that the Budget's drastic measures to curb expansion in student numbers rendered it irrelevant. An independent committee headed by Lord Flowers, the former vice-chancellor of London University, recommended that universities should switch to an academic year of three 15-week semesters with each student studying for only two of them each year. This would allow a rise of 50 per cent in student numbers. Even if student numbers did not expand, the committee would still recommend the longer year because the reduction in the time spent at universities by students would save money. The first semester would start early in September. While Lord Flowers said A-level results would be needed only two or three days earlier than they are produced now, lecturers' unions said that three or four weeks was more realistic. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said: 'The report builds on current trends in higher education by responding to the needs of its customers for more flexible patterns of teaching and learning. By outlining a new structure for the academic year it offers welcome new flexibility for students and staff, as well as increases in the numbers who can be taught while maintaining high quality.' Education department sources made clear that any question of raising extra funds from students through 'graduate taxes' or income-tax-related loans had been abandoned for at least three years. Means-tested grants will be cut by 10 per cent a year with loans from the government-funded Student Loans Company increased to compensate. Expansion in numbers would cease for three years, with the government predicting a fall of 3.5 per cent next year. Dr Ken Edwards, chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, attacked Budget clause which cut the tuition fees universities receive for each applicant recruited. He said: 'These plans do nothing to satisfy the enormous and growing demand for higher education and run counter to the government's philosophy of responding to market forces.' He said the government should aim to provide 40 per cent of the population with higher education (up from the current 32 per cent). Individual institutions must now decide whether to adopt the new year. A statement by the Natfhe and AUT lecturers' unions said: 'This government has yet again pulled the rug out from under the feet of those trying - however misguidedly - to plan for the sector.'

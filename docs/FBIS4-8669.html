			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] Commenting on the proposed amendments to the Small  Constitution which would limit his powers, President Lech Walesa  said that he would have to ask for greater control over what  Sejm deputies are doing.    Lech Walesa, who is in Litomysl, said that he does not  believe that the coalition has serious thoughts about limiting  presidential rights, but if it makes such an attempt then it  will bear the consequences.    Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski stated that if  amendments to the Constitution were passed in the Sejm, the  president would then have to defend the Constitution.    A group of Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Democratic Left  Alliance [SLD] deputies who tabled the bill with these  amendments want the Sejm to have the power to appoint  ministerial candidates put forward by the prime minister, should  the president refuse to sign such a nomination. According to  the bill, the dissolved Sejm would end its term of office only  on the day of the first sitting of a newly elected parliament.  The coalition needs a two-thirds majority in the Sejm to pass  the amendments to the Constitution. To achieve such a majority,  the SLD and PSL deputies require a dozen or so votes more.</p>

One Thai who was released from the prison  last week, Anonglak Khambunruang, 23, told reporters that Thais  jailed there face cruelty and misery. They have lost contact  with their families for a long time.    "It's hell. Some people have been crippled in their hands  and legs. The Laotian officers treat us as if we were animals.  We are waiting for the help of the Thai Government."    About one hundred Thais from Si Sa Ket, Bangkok, Ubon  Ratchathani, and Chumphon are allegedly being held in Pak Se  prison. The prison is a one-storey building with four rooms,  each holding up to 60 Thai prisoners, he said, adding that many  of them have been held for at least eight months without knowing  when they will be released.    The only way they will be discharged is if relatives file a  guarantee and post bail with Laotian authorities. Some will  never get out unless the Government helps them because they have  lost contact with their families.    Mr Anonglak accused the Laotians of chaining Thai prisoners  by their feet to a rack two feet above the floor. They are also  not allowed to talk. Those who violate rules are handcuffed by  their hands and feet to a beam for three days he claimed.    Mr Anonglak said they were fed twice a day with sticky rice,  salt, seasoning powder and chili, which is left over from the  meals of Laotian prisoners.    Thai prisoners are held in contempt, he said. When one dies,  their bodies are left in chains. Sometimes, Laotian officers  put four bodies of Thai prisoners in a sack and trample on it,  he claimed. He and four friends from Ban Woen Buk, Ubon  Ratchathani Province, were arrested on January 2 while they were  celebrating New Year's at the house of friends in Ban Don Ko,  Tambon Sa Pai in Laos, which is opposite their village. He said  he went to Laos at his friends' invitation.    For the trip to the police station in Ban Sa Pai, he and his  friends were shackled by their hands and feet and had weapons  pointed at their heads, he said.    After being transferred to Se Labam, they were starved for  three days and forced to lie on the backs with their hands and  feet chained to the bars of a cell. They were moved to Pak Se  prison where more than 100 Thai prisoners were earlier detained,  he said.    Mr Anonglak was released from prison after his relatives  posted bail with Laotian officials on January 21.</p>

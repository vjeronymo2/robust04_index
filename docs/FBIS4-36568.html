			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified spokesman on 8 June; place not </F> given]    [Text] In response to a query on the focus of the prime  minister's visit to the Russian Federation and India-Russian  ties, the spokesman stated that the focus of the visit would be  on lifting of the existing level of relationship to  qualitatively higher levels and to new stages. The talks in  Moscow would concentrate on the future in terms of bilateral  cooperation regarding our attitudes towards international issues  and what the two countries can do together in Asia and in the  world. At the summit level the leaders will naturally not  discuss minor matters of detail.    Elaborating further, he said that it was very clear even  before the actual break up of the erstwhile Soviet Union that  our relationship with Russia would be qualitatively different.  One of the major tasks of our diplomatic efforts accordingly  was to establish friendly and cooperative relations with the  Russian Government. Since the emergence of the Russian  Federation and our recognition that it was a successor state of  the erstwhile USSR, bilateral ties were undergoing a process of  consolidation and adjustment to the new realities. In this  phase, right upto the visit of President Boris Yeltsin to New  Delhi, various political and economic issues and parameters of  trade and commerce were defined. The next logical phase is to  raise the relationship to a qualitatively new level.</p>

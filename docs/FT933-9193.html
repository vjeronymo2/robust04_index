			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Labour readies poll army LABOUR is to create a powerful new class of area organisers in an attempt to improve its chances of winning Conservative-held marginal seats at the next general election. The move is being financed from savings in head office expenses following a review of the party's structure and finances led by Mr John Evans, MP for St Helens North. Labour officials say the expansion will have no effect on the party's hopes of breaking even by next year. Its overdraft has fallen to Pounds 1.7m this year from Pounds 2.7m after the 1992 general election. By contrast, the Conservative party has lost 20 per cent of its constituency agents since the election, and is struggling with a Pounds 19m overdraft. Most of Labour's new organisers will be in the midlands and northern England, where Labour is keen to improve on its performance last year. In particular, it is targeting Conservative-held marginal seats in the north - especially Yorkshire. Four of the new posts will be in the south, where Labour is fighting off a strong challenge from the Liberal Democrats to be the Tories' main rival.</p>

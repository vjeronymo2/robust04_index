			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Retail monarchs in search of global empires: What a Kingfisher-Darty merger may hold MERGER talks between Kingfisher of the UK and Darty of France, revealed yesterday, add weight to theories of the increasingly global future for retailing. The industry was once seen as a purely domestic one, pandering to national tastes and habits which might seem odd in others' eyes. Attempts by successful retailers in one country to translate their formula to another have often failed. But there are notable successes, such as the Ikea furniture chain and the Benetton fashion retailer. Now more retailers are trying to break through national boundaries. Many continental European retailers have already crossed borders, although UK groups have taken longer to leap the Channel. Just before Christmas Tesco, the UK food retailer, paid Pounds 175.6m for Catteau, a supermarket chain in northern France. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, made it plain last September that Kingfisher was keen to expand in Europe, and he clearly believes he can succeed where other UK retailers have failed. Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said yesterday that 'the object of this deal is to gain a major profile in the single market'. The plan is simple. Darty is the leading French electrical retailer, with 130 stores and 12 per cent of the market for white and brown goods. Since the group's creation in 1957 by the three Darty brothers - Bernard, Nathan and Claude - the stores, with their distinctive red and black signs and warehouse-style interiors, have come to dominate the sector. Darty wants to expand in France and the rest of Europe, but it has been held back by heavy debt from its 1988 management buy-out. It is battling with new competitors in electrical retailing, notably the powerful hypermarket groups such as Carrefour and Promodes. Like the rest of the French retail sector, Darty has for the past year also been struggling against the economic slowdown. If anything, the electrical sector has been harder hit as depressed consumer confidence affected sales of big-ticket items. In its last financial year Darty's sales and profits slipped in spite of opening seven new stores, and at last week's annual general meeting Darty warned that it would 'find it difficult' to maintain profits this year. This might make Darty look an unattractive target for Kingfisher. But it has its problems too. Its failed bid for Dixons in 1990 must have been a warning to Kingfisher that it was reaching its limit in the UK. Its talks with various European retailers - its name has been linked with Castorama, the French do-it-yourself group, and Woolworth in Germany, among others - have so far come to nothing. If the purchase of Darty goes through it would open up new horizons for Kingfisher. Its financial muscle could give Darty the power to expand, while extending the Kingfisher empire. A tie-up would also give the enlarged group a much better bargaining position with the suppliers, which are increasingly multinationals such as Philips-Whirlpool and Bosch-Siemens. Meanwhile Darty's management skills might be welcome at Comet, Kingfisher's UK chain and the smallest profit contributor in the group. Darty's margins are, Mr Whittaker believes, the best of any electrial retailer in Europe or the US. This all looks rosy. So is Kingfisher likely to be tempted into overpaying for Darty? It would not be in Sir Geoffrey's nature to become carried away by any deal, especially one which has been under discussion in one form or another over four years. Further, Kingfisher has clearly done its homework on Darty and is aware of some bargaining points in its favour. Darty's need to free itself from its management-buy-out debt is pushing it either to a merger or a flotation on a stock market unlikely to give a warm welcome to a retailer. Kingfisher must also be fully aware of the problems the French retail sector is suffering, having experienced similar economic conditions in the UK. It can use forecasts of another sluggish year for the French retail sector in its bargaining. In addition, it can point to many other recent French mergers and acquisitions, such as moves in the hypermarket sector where Carrefour bought Euromarche and Montlaur, and Casino acquired Rallye. The department store sector has been shaken up by the takeover of Au Printemps by the Pinault industrial group. The fall in the pound against the French franc will also come into the bid equation. Although neither side will be drawn on the likely value of the deal, suggestions that Kingfisher would match Darty's stockmarket value of FFr7.9bn (Pounds 970m) plus its debt, have been implicitly denied. The figure now being touted is Pounds 1bn, including the debt, although currency movements and other details yet to be agreed could make a considerable variation either way. If the bid is agreed will Kingfisher join the list of successful international retailers? Mr Whittaker's arguments in favour are that Kingfisher would be buying a market leader, with growth prospects, and a management motivated by the terms of the deal to stay with the new owners. Perhaps most important, Kingfisher will not be trying to export a UK formula.  --------------------------------------------------- KEY DATES  --------------------------------------------------- Kingfisher 1982 Pounds 310m management buy-in of Woolworth 1984 buys Comet; 1987 buys Superdrug 1990 bid for Dixons blocked  --------------------------------------------------- Darty 1957 Founded by the Darty brothers 1976 Flotation on stock market 1988 Management buy-out from Darty family  ---------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------- How the retailers shape up  ----------------------------------------------------------------- KINGFISHER Chairman &amp; chief executive    Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Year to end       Sales        Pre-tax January        (Pounds bn)     profits                               (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- 1988/89            2.7           182.8 1989/90            2.9           207.4 1990/91            3.2           215.3 1991/92            3.4           207.1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------- * after restructuring costs of pounds 14.7m  ----------------------------------------------------------------- DARTY Chairman  Philippe Frances  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Year to end       Consolidated   Pre-tax August                sales      profits                     (FFr bn)    (FFr bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                  7.71        0.87 1990                  8.56        0.96 1991                  8.75        1.08 1992                  8.56        1.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Observer, Page 13; Lex, Page 14</p>

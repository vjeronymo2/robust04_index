			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / OECD Employment Outlook: Scepticism on jobs role of small business Job turnover in the OECD countries is higher than expected, with an average of one in five jobs being newly created or destroyed each year, according to a special chapter in the OECD employment outlook on job gains and job losses. The study finds little variation across countries and no correlation between job turnover levels and degree of labour market regulation. Indeed, the figures suggest that the highly regulated Nordic countries have some of the highest job turnover levels and the deregulated UK and US some of the lowest. The study suggests high job turnover cuts employer-employee commitment and skill training. It also expresses scepticism about the assumption that small enterprises will be the motor of job creation, pointing out that, in the late-1980s, employment growth was mainly due to expansion of existing enterprises. Across the OECD, job gains from new starts and the expansion of existing enterprises now average 10 per cent of total employment each year, while job losses from closures and contractions also average about 10 per cent. The UK and Germany, despite wide differences in the degree of labour market and business regulation, show similarly low job turnover between the mid-1980s and early-1990s. The spectrum on job gains ranged from 9 per cent of total employment in the UK and Germany to 16 per cent in Denmark, while the rate of job losses ranged from 7 per cent in the UK and Germany to 15 per cent in Sweden. Combining the percentage of jobs created and those destroyed yearly, the US turnover rate is 23.4 per cent, Canada 26.3 and the UK 15.3. The highest figure is New Zealand (35.5 per cent) followed by Denmark (29.8), Sweden (29.1) and France (27.1). In most countries about 80 per cent of job turnover is not related to the economic cycle, and most turnover is due to labour displacement within industries rather than across industries. There is quite a large variation within Europe in the extent to which job gains come from new enterprises or expanding existing ones. There is, however, relatively little difference between patterns of turnover in North America and Europe, particularly in manufacturing. The report says 'the manufacturing sector in North America is no more dynamic in terms of openings and closures of establishments than a sample of Nordic countries.' Looking at the overall birth and death rate of enterprises, the UK has the lowest 'birth rate' of the countries studied despite the increase in small companies and self-employment associated with the 'enterprise culture' of the Thatcher years. New enterprise creation as a proportion of all enterprises - between the mid-1980s and early 1990s - was highest in Canada (19.1 per cent), Sweden (16.8) and France (14.3). Of the nine countries studied the UK was last (9.2 per cent). But the UK also has the lowest rate of establishment closure at 8.5 per cent. The US is also at the bottom end for both openings (13.6 per cent) and closures (9.2 per cent). Only 10 per cent of those companies surviving at least six years created jobs in the first two years and only 11 per cent created jobs during the first four years. However, after six years, 34 per cent of the survivors had created jobs. On the reasons for enterprise survival, the report quotes a study which stresses the availability of advice from private or public experts and having partners such as an important and regular customer, supplier or banker. 'Other processes related to unemployment, personal wealth, a liberal political climate, or local spending or programmes of assistance had weak or mixed effects,' says the report. Large claims made for the job creation ability of small enterprises are often based on faulty statistics. 'A more correct statement is that small establishments are disproportionately responsible for both gross job gains and losses. The latter is partly due to the relatively high mortality rate of new, small establishments,' the report states. It also points out that it is not surprising that small enterprises (employing up to 100 people) should play an important role in job creation as they account for between 40 and 70 per cent of all jobs. Even so, the share of employment in small enterprises did rise in several OECD countries from the early-1970s. The employment share of small enterprises varies widely from a high of 71 per cent in Italy to a low of 43 per cent in the US. Britain is at the lower end with 49.1 per cent.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Exchange acts to curb price-sensitive leaks THE London Stock Exchange yesterday issued proposed guidance intended to curb selective leaking of price-sensitive information which could give rise to insider dealing. However, the guidance stops short of defining price-sensitive information or requiring quarterly financial reporting, measures sought by investor groups. Requirements for unaudited quarterly reporting were also supported by members of the exchange's own Large Companies Advisory Committee, particularly those which are quoted in the US and have coped with quarterly reporting there. The guidance is the result of an initiative launched in late summer, in conjunction with the 100 Group of Finance Directors as well as shareholder and analyst associations. That move followed the stock exchange's first ever censure of a traded company, LIG, the world's leading branded condom maker, for telling selected analysts of its financial condition, and concerns about insider dealing rules in the government's new criminal justice bill. Mr Martin Hall, director of policy at the stock exchange, said the committee rejected quarterly reporting because too many changes in accounting policy were pending. 'There is a feeling that requiring quarterly reporting would be the straw that broke the camel's back.' However, the guidance, which will be adopted formally early next year after consultation, does go some way towards helping companies decide when they need to make a public announcement and urges them to issue more of them. For instance, it encourages companies to issue unaudited quarterly reports or to make a statement about trading conditions immediately after the close of the reporting period. It also reminds companies that there is no such thing as a 'close period' immediately prior to publication of profits which prevents the dissemination of price-sensitive information. The close period merely limits the time in which directors may deal in their own company shares. The guidance also reminds directors they may not leak price-sensitive information to Sunday newspaper journalists - often used to lessen the impact on share prices of negative or controversial information. Exchange rules require that information must also be distributed simultaneously to two wire services and two national newspapers. Lex, Page 20</p>

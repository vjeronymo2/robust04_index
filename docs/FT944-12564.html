			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Steady Eddie vs Villains When will Britain next raise its interest rates? The financial markets were badly caught out by September's rise - so they will be watching tomorrow's meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and the Bank of England's Eddie George with more than usual interest. But City analysts might just as well look to football team Aston Villa's score sheet for guidance, judging by Eddie George's comments to a CBI dinner in Birmingham last week. The Bank's economists appear to have moved on from testing correlations between productivity in the Black Country and the performance of the region's premier football team. They are now concentrating on the influence of the Villains (as the team is known) on UK monetary policy. Three years ago, Eddie George's predecessor noted that he had reduced interest rates more times than Villa had won home games. Now George has hinted there will be no interest rate rise until Villa wins a home game. Assuming tonight's match (against Trabzonspor) does not count - because it is a non-league game - the next key date is Sunday, when Villa meets Manchester United. On past form that should mean little chance of any monetary tightening for at least a week. Then again, as Goldman Sachs' Gavyn Davies found to his cost seven weeks ago, sticking one's neck out on interest rates can be a foolish business when dealing with Steady Eddie.</p>

He even said that "it is contradictory  to say that the Joint Declaration indicates that Britain will  have no moral responsibility and interest toward Hong Kong  beyond 1997." This was the "grounds" Patten created when he  played the "international card" in Australia. Patten's remark  was in open disregard of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and  also thoroughly exposed the British colonial rulers' intention  to prolong their colonial rule and influence in Hong Kong.    The Joint Declaration explicitly specifies that Britain will  return Hong Kong to China on 1 July 1997. Before that, Britain  will be responsible for the administration of Hong Kong. It is  self-evident that after the transfer of government in 1997, the  Hong Kong issue will be purely China's internal affair and no  foreign countries will have the right to meddle in Hong Kong's  affairs. Britain is naturally no exception. The so-called  "moral responsibility" has no foundation in the Joint  Declaration.    Although Patten repeatedly stressed Hong Kong's  international  status and tried to turn Hong Kong into an "international  asset," this was just a trick played by the British in an  attempt to solicit the help of the international forces to  prolong the British colonial interests in Hong Kong. In fact,  before the signing of the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the  British did not allow other countries to have a hand in Hong  Kong affairs. Now, because the Hong Kong issue has been solved  and Britain will have to withdraw from Hong Kong and the Chinese  Government will resume exercising sovereignty over Hong Kong,  Britain finds it necessary to encourage other Western countries  to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and step up the process of  "internationalizing" Hong Kong politically. This fully shows  that the British side has no sincerity toward implementing the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and is still unwilling to  withdraw from the Chinese territory it forcefully seized more  than 100 years ago. Patten's emphasis on Britain's "moral  responsibility" to Hong Kong precisely reflects such a mentality.    The so-called "British moral responsibility toward Hong  Kong"  after 1997 has no legal foundation at all. Patten himself also  could not utter any tenable argument to justify this. As  everyone knows, Hong Kong was occupied by old British  colonialists in a predatory way. The signing and implementation  of the Joint Declaration should help Britain terminate its  shameful history and enable China and Britain to bring their old  grudge to an end so that the two countries may thus furhter  consolidate and develop their bilateral relations on a new  basis. However, as Hong Kong will soon be returned to its  motherland, the British have talked a lot about their "moral  responsibility" toward Hong Kong beyond 1997. This sounds like  a burglar continuing to claim "moral responsibility" after the  thing he stole has been taken back by its owner. How shameless  such people are! In the past, many places in North America,  Asia, and Africa, including the United States, were subject to  colonial rule by the British Empire. Would it not be ridiculous  if Britain now continued to claim "moral responsibility" toward  so many countries?    If they really want to talk about some "responsibility,"  then  Britain's "responsibility" exists before rather than after 1997.  That is, in the transitional period, Britain must honestly abide  by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and provide sincere  coopertion for China's resumption of its sovereignty over Hong  Kong. The British side bears unshirkable historical  "responsibility" for this. To put it more accurately, this is  not just "moral responsibility" but the British side's duty  which it must perform according to the norms of international  law and the Joint Declaration.    It is regrettable that the British side erroneously assessed  the situation, broke its own promise, and suddenly changed its  policy toward Hong Kong. In particular, Patten, on taking  office, undermined the foundation for Sino-British cooperation,  wantonly violated and trampled upon the Joint Declaration,  impeded China in reexercising sovereignty over Hong Kong, and  tried to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent  political entity so that Britain can continue to control Hong  Kong from behind the scenes and extend its colonial rule beyond  1997.    By analyzing the essence of the "political democratization"  program pursued by Patten, the so-called "Hong Kong freedom and  values" he advocated were only a synonym for Hong Kong's  "politial independence or semi-independence." Hong Kong has  never experienced such "independence or semi-independence" in  the past; still less is this allowed by the Joint Declaration  and the "one country, two systems" policy. This is just a  sinister plan which the British side is trying to impose on the  future special administrative region through changing Hong  Kong's existing political structure. Fundamentally, it goes  against the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and it  unfavorable to Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity.  Therefore, it is doomed to be short-lived.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Yielding to pressure A marked fall in the FT-SE 100 index while the FT-SE mid-250 remains unmoved should be treated with some caution. Market games are not beyond the manipulation of FT-SE 100 futures prices with a consequent overspill into blue chip stocks. At the end of a week, when the long-awaited recovery was confirmed, a little disappointment is understandable. Still, there are reasons to fear that UK equities have run out of steam. Large cash calls such as Zeneca and BT III are on the horizon. Base rates seem to have stopped falling, with the government happy to wait and watch sterling rise against continental currencies. That removes some momentum from the switch from cash into equities. Gilts may also fall back as the optimism over lower interest rates fades and the market has to trudge through the interminable supply of government debt. While not that expensive, equities are no longer cheap against gilts - and any rise in gilt yields may put pressure on the stock market. Perhaps the most worrying aspect is the fall in equity yields below 4 per cent. The last three occasions when this happened were 1987, 1973/4 and 1968/9. Those inclined to be generous may argue that a more benign inflation outlook permits lower yields than in the past. More nervous souls may regard the lull in inflation as a normal pause after devaluation. In 12 months' time, retail price inflation might not look so subdued. Low dividend cover and the limited capacity for growth in payments also cast a shadow over low yields. If inflation turns up, neither gilt nor equity returns will look that generous.</p>

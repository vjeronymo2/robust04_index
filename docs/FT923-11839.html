			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reuters plans global TV expansion Reuters said yesterday that its 10-year television partnership with NBC would allow it to explore new opportunities in global television with its US partner, writes Andrew Bolger. It will buy out minority stakes in Visnews, the international television news agency, held by NBC and the BBC and eventually aims to put together its conventional news agency operation with Visnews to form the world's largest reporting network. Visnews will continue to produce mainly raw news feeds to existing programmes and networks, although it already produces some complete programmes of its own. It has 454 staff worldwide while Reuters has 1,100 reporters and photographers.</p>

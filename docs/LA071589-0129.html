			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALLENDER'S LEGAL BATTLE WITH RAMADA CONTINUES;  </P> <P> PIE-CHAIN FOUNDER PERMITTED TO SELL HOLDINGS  </P> <P> Donald W. Callender, founder of the Marie Callender Pie Shops chain, can sell  his 2.5 million shares of Ramada Inc. stock, an Orange County Superior Court  judge has ruled.  </P> <P> But the preliminary order issued Thursday by Judge Eileen C. Moore does not end  Callender's legal skirmishes with Ramada.  </P> <P> And according to Robert Crockett, an attorney for Ramada, restrictions remain  on the number of shares Callender can sell each month without first getting  Ramada's approval.  </P> <P> The court order stems from a long-simmering dispute between Callender and  Ramada over the terms of a 1986 agreement in which the pie-and-sandwich chain's  founder sold the company to Ramada for nearly $57 million in cash and Ramada  stock.  </P> <P> Callender, in turn, agreed not to sell any of his Ramada shares until May,  1990, when he could sell 1 million shares. The remaining 1.5 million shares  could not be sold until May, 1991, under the agreement.  </P> <P> Since selling the chain, Callender has filed four lawsuits accusing Ramada, a  Phoenix-based hotel and casino company, of fraud and failing to live up to its  obligations under the 1986 sale contract. Ramada has denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ramada sold the Marie Callender chain to Wilshire Restaurant Group  Inc. for about $54.5 million in May. The transaction was part of a  restructuring by Ramada, in which the company's hotel and restaurant businesses  are being sold.  </P> <P> On April 17, Ramada agreed to sell its 800 hotels to New World Development Co.  Ltd. of Hong Kong for $540 million. A shareholder meeting to approve the  transaction is scheduled for July 31, and the sale is expected to be completed  within 60 days.  </P> <P> Callender sought court approval to sell his Ramada shares because he wanted to  be able to sell the stock before the hotels are sold. "Every other shareholder  can sell right now if (he or she) wants to," said Callender's lawyer, Robert  Waier of Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Don Callender "certainly doesn't intend at this point to cast all of his 2.5  million Ramada shares into the open market," Waier said.  </P> <P> Waier said he does not know how many shares of Ramada Callender actually plans  to sell.  </P> <P> What is certain, according to the attorney, is that the court order prevents  Ramada from trying to enforce any contractual restrictions that would prevent  Callender from selling his 6.3% stake in the company. With the court order,  "they can't withhold their consent," Waier said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> But Crockett, Ramada's lawyer, disagreed.  </P> <P> According to Crockett, a provision of the 1986 contract bars Callender from  selling more than 100,000 Ramada shares within a 30-day period without the  company's consent. With the court order, "he can now sell less than 100,000  shares" at a time on the open market.  </P> <P> Ramada's lawyer said the company "has no position" on whether it would allow  Callender to sell more than 100,000 shares per month. But he added that if  Callender asks Ramada for permission to sell more than that at a time, the  dispute could end up back in court.  </P> <P> The Orange County lawsuit, which actually is two consolidated cases, is  scheduled to begin trial on Nov. 27 to address other issues still in dispute.  </P> <P> A second trial is set to begin on Nov. 21 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles  concerning Callender's alleged failure to pay franchise fees on eight  restaurants. A class action suit by Callender also is pending in Orange County  Superior Court.  </P> <P> Marie Callender has about 150 restaurants in 17 states. Of those, 105 are in  California.  </P></p>

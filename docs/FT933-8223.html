			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Salomon stock rises as Warren Buffett lifts stake SHARES in Salomon, the US securities house and energy group, rose sharply yesterday on the news that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor who masterminded Salomon's recovery from the debilitating effects of the 1991 Treasury auction scandal, is raising his stake to at least 15 per cent. Although Mr Buffett would only be raising his stake by a small amount - he already owns 14.3 per cent of the company in the form of convertible preferred stock and he has a long-standing agreement not to raise that to more than 20 per cent until October 1994 - the notification that he plans to add to his holdings was seen as a vote of confidence in Salomon. The news prompted heavy buying of the company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange, and the price rose Dollars 2 1/4 to close at Dollars 48. Analysts said that the rise in Salomon's share price yesterday was a reflection of Mr Buffett's influence in the markets. Mr John Keefe, brokerage analyst with Keefe Worldwide Services, said that because Mr Buffett was known as a successful investor and because of his close links with Salomon, 'his actions will prompt others to buy the stock'. Mr Buffett, a member of Salomon's board, is not the only senior company figure to bet his own money on Salomon's future. Last week, Mr Deryck Maughan, chairman of the firm's brokerage unit Salomon Brothers, was reported to have spent Dollars 1m on 25,000 Salomon shares one week after the company reported record second-quarter profits of Dollars 433m (Pounds 290m). This was also seen as a sign that senior Salomon management believe the company has fully recovered from the 1991 scandal, which cost the company several top executives, heavy fines and government restrictions on its brokerage activities, plus the temporary loss of customers. Mr Buffett's plans for his stake in Salomon are closely followed on Wall Street because of the role he played at the company after the scandal. During his one-year stint as interim chairman, Mr Buffett helped restructure top management, changed internal policies, and reduced reliance on profits from speculative bond trading by emphasising its customer-related business.</p>

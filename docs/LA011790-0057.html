			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A downtown San Diego bank Tuesday morning became the eighth financial  institution within six weeks to be robbed by what police believe is the same  man.  </P> <P> The latest robbery was at Security Pacific Bank, 1200 3rd Ave., said Bill  Robinson, San Diego police spokesman.  </P> <P> The robber handed a teller a note demanding money, saying that he had a gun. He  made off with $1,120 in cash.  </P> <P> Police and FBI agents have dubbed the robberies "The Leave Note for FBI  Series," because the robber told tellers in the first and second heists to give  the notes to FBI agents.  </P> <P> Robinson said the series began Dec. 4 when the robber got $600 from a Bank of  America branch at 450 B St. It was followed by robberies at First Interstate  Bank, Union Bank, World Savings, Great American Bank and Coast Savings, all in  downtown San Diego.  </P> <P> The robber is described as a white male, about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with  dark brown, neck-length hair. He has a receding hairline, with a part on the  left side. The man is clean-shaven, has high cheekbones and is about 30 years  old.  </P></p>

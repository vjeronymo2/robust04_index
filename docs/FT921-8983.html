			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Hungarian investment by Alcoa THE ALUMINUM Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium company, is to spend about Dollars 50m to take a controlling interest in and upgrade facilities at Kofem, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the state-owned Hungarian Aluminium Industrial Corporation (Hungalu). Kofem, located at Szekesfehervar, 35 miles south-west of Budapest, employs 3,000 and produces 110,000 tonnes a year of flat-rolled aluminium products and 30,000 tonnes of aluminium extrusions for the building, construction, food and agricultural markets in Hungary, central and western Europe. The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding which enables Alcoa to look more closely at what needs to be done to upgrade at Kofem. Kofem now uses aluminium from Russian smelters and the issue of future supplies will be part of discussions before a final agreement is signed, probably in the middle of this year. Alcoa said its investment would be used to upgrade quality and safety at Kofem and that it would provide the management, technology, and systems needed to make the venture a successful competitor throughout Europe. However, it did not intend to expand capacity or to introduce can sheet production at Kofem.</p>

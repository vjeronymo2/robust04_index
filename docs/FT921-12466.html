			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / The European Market: Single market spells a re-think on logistics - Technical aspects of European business are more vital than ever ON two floors of a 300-metre-long building in a busy industrial district of Frankfurt, hundreds of workers shift thousands of items daily from racks to trolleys, from trolleys to a moving multi-decked box rack, and from boxes into parcels. The building is where Neckermann, one of Germany's big three mail-order companies, sorts out and packs the contents of 130,000 parcels a day. Large mail-order companies have been using similar methods for 30 years. But not for much longer, at least at Neckermann. A team from Miebach Logistics, one of Europe's largest logistics consultancies, has completed a feasibility study which could lead to the introduction of a new, faster item-picking process using modern computerised machinery. It is one example of how the dramatic changes in the European market are prompting an increased interest in logistics among manufacturers - Neckermann is a 'manufacturer' of parcels, every one of which is different. One of the most important driving forces is the single market, which is encouraging many companies to think for the first time not only about pan-European manufacturing and marketing, but also about more humdrum but equally essential issues such as warehousing, organisation and distribution. Alternatively, as in Neckermann's case, it is the reunification of Germany which has prompted a fresh look at many aspects of its logistics policy. As European industry moves into the later stages of its planning for the single market, the more technical aspects of pan-European business are assuming a new significance. Many of the companies that have decided they want or need to be pan-European players will already have made the key acquisitions and reorganised manufacturing accordingly, but that in turn requires nitty-gritty decisions on logistics. At the same time, the single market is prompting changes in transport methods throughout Europe, and the logistics consultancies stand ready to advise manufacturers of the possibilities. On the Continent, for example, third-party distribution is much less developed than in the UK. Companies such as Caterpillar Logistics Services, part of the US construction equipment group, are experiencing growing demand on the continent for a sophisticated service covering all a client's needs. At first glance it might seem odd that logistics consultancies should be thriving ahead of the single market. Companies which have spent heavily, and confidently, on acquisitions or greenfield site investments ought to be able to site and equip a warehouse and hire a truck fleet, one would have thought. Not so, says Mr Joachim Miebach, founder of the company that bears his name and one of the key figures in European logistics consultancy. Warehouse technology and robotics have been developing so fast that companies which may rarely be making big decisions on logistics need a helping hand. And as companies' European business expands in size and scope, the need for further investment in logistics technology increases accordingly. 'In logistics, there are no economies of scale; large companies are no faster than small businesses. They need technology to offset the complexity of their larger operations,' he says. Consequently, there is plenty of work around. The large broad-based consultancy companies are often used to advise on distribution network locations, while the German-dominated warehouse equipment industry also has consultancies. In between are a number, such as Miebach in Germany and Haden Technology in the UK, with differing approaches to technology and to clients' logistics strategy, but no axe to grind on equipment. Haden, based in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, has yet to see much benefit from the single market but has recently done design warehouse work for third-party distribution companies that need to keep an eye on 1992 and their clients' changing priorities. It is actively looking overseas from a UK base, and has formed a number of business associations in Europe. Miebach, meanwhile, has worked for years with large companies such as SKF, the Swedish bearings group, for which Europe was an important market long before the idea of the single market was born. Mr Miebach says most companies have had ideas about European distribution already, but these were usually restricted to existing national borders. As the single market approaches, companies have become aware that 'there must be something beyond this,' he says. As long as sales companies are organised on a national basis - a situation which could well continue in the single market because of language and legislative factors - logistics has never had an independent role to play. But this trend is now changing, albeit fairly slowly. A typical move was Duracell International's announcement on January 2 of a new battery parts distribution centre in Belgium, to replace existing national warehouse operations in the UK, Benelux, Germany and France. The key question for which consultants need an answer from clients is: 'How good does your logistics have to be to remain competitive in the single market?' From this, a total logistics strategy can be drawn up, leading to specific recommendations on transport, warehousing, stock management and production logistics. That might lead to the choice of a single warehousing site, but could equally involve more than one, or a combination of central and national locations, depending on the business and its priorities. Miebach was brought in at Benckiser, the acquisitive German detergents group which expanded into cosmetics, and into southern Europe, in the late 1980s as part of its pre-1992 strategy. The task was to establish whether it made sense for cosmetics and detergents to share the same distribution network. Eventually, the decision was taken to build two warehouses in Barcelona and Wiesbaden to serve the European cosmetics market. Naturally, the more ambitious logistics consultants such as Miebach are filling out their own pan-European networks to exploit the single market more effectively - as well as to take better advantage of German reunification. Logistics consultancies, too, have their own logistical challenges.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / TSB shows turnround in bad debts TSB GROUP yesterday announced a modest rise in pre-tax profits in the first half of its financial year, as recovery in the economy helped halve provisions for bad and doubtful debts from the second half of 1992. The bank's pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 80m in the six months to April 30, against Pounds 77m in the first half of 1992. The figure included a Pounds 44m restructuring charge as it reduced staff numbers by 1,100 and cut operating costs. The interim dividend was maintained at 3.15p in spite of a rise in earnings per share to 3.1p, against 2.8p in the first half. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said the board had delayed a decision on whether to raise the dividend until the full year. 'We have a recovery in the economy, but it is still somewhat fragile,' he said. He predicted 'a significant decline' in full-year provisions because the rise in the second half of last year was unlikely to recur. The sharp fall in bad debt provisions to Pounds 205m, compared with the Pounds 432m charged for the second half of 1992 indicates that UK banks are likely to start displaying a recovery from the burden of bad debts in the interim results declared over the next five weeks. TSB cut its ratio of costs to income to 65.3 per cent against 71 per cent, as operating costs fell 3 per cent to Pounds 635m (from Pounds 654m). Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said the bank was 'determined to keep the pressure on costs'. The bank said it was making progress in running down two loss-making arms: its Mortgage Express centralised mortgage business; and the loan administration unit which now holds a net Pounds 1.6bn of poor loans made in the late 1980s. A bad debt charge of Pounds 64m was made against loans in the loan administration unit, against Pounds 40m. This means that the unit's book is now 54 per cent provided against, with a written down value of Pounds 747m, against Pounds 917m. The Hill Samuel merchant bank, to which Pounds 500m of capital is allocated, contributed Pounds 53m to group profit, against Pounds 30m. Sir Nicholas said TSB would continue to improve the business but was 'fundamentally willing to accept' an offer to buy it. The group's ratio of core tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 8.1 per cent, against 8.8 per cent. Net assets per share fell to 109p, against 114p, and shares closed 3.5p down at 194p.

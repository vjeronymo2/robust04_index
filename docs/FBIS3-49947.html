			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic stated this evening that the two days of  negotiations have shown who is really in favor of peace and who  in favor of continuing the war. He pointed at the importance of  the normalization of Croatian-Yugoslav relations for stabilizing  the situation in the Balkans.    "The basic characteristic of the latest round of  negotiations  is the fact that it has shown who is really in favor of peace  and who in favor of continuing the war", Milosevic stressed in a  press statement in Geneva this evening.    "Despite the media war against Serbia, which has been  demonized and labeled an aggressor, it is completely clear now  what has actually happened.    A few weeks ago, in this building (Palais des Nations), we  had serious and, in my mind, responsible talks with 12 ministers  of the European Union. On that occasion they presented their  proposal on what was to be done to achieve peace. They put  forward very difficult conditions -- 33.3 percent (of the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina) for the Muslim side, UN  administration of Sarajevo, access to the river. This was, as  you already know well, a complete set of conditions for peace.  Sacrificing their own interests in the name of peace, the Serbs  decided to fulfill them, they accepted them and came to Geneva  to sign a peace agreement. What has happened? The Muslims have  rejected it. Even after the cochairmen had given their  additions to it, they rejected it. I am telling you that I know  well why they have done so. The Muslims do not wish to stop  their offensive in central Bosnia because they wish to overrun  the Croats, raze Vitez, Busovaca, and Novi Travnik to the  ground, conquer Mostar and force their way to the sea, through a  completely Croat territory.    I hope that this round will show what is really happening  and  will help to create a more balanced picture of the events in our  country and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular.    I believe that the conference will be resumed and I admit  that I am an optimist. We will have peace despite those who are  opposed to it, the Muslim leaders and those behind them who  advise them wrongly," Serbian President Milosevic said.    Asked if war would break out after the collapse of the  negotiations, Milosevic said: "I do not think so. The Serbs are  the stronger side and they do not want the war and the  resumption of clashes.    Asked if Croatia was in reality recognized within its  present  borders by the joint declaration, President Milosevic said:  "Please understand that your question is linked to a problem  existing between Krajina and Croatia. This problem can be  solved only by negotiations between their legitimate  representatives. As the Vance plan has been activated, it is  clear that they should implement it mutually.    I reiterate my personal standpoint on a very important issue  we are discussing now. I must say that all responsible Serb and  Croat politicians must work on normalizing Serb-Croat relations.  We will do our best to help the normalization of relations in  general and in detail because it is the main factor of stability  in the Balkans. Those who want the stability of their states and  the Balkans will seriously work on the normalization of  relations between the Serbs and the Croats and in the entire  region," President Milosevic said in Geneva.</p>

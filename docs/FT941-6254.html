			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Canada considers cutting oil holding Canada's Liberal government is considering a further cut in its 70 per cent stake in Petro-Canada, the integrated oil and gas producer set up in the mid-1970s to give Ottawa a window on the energy industry. Ms Anne McLellan, Natural Resources minister, said she and the secretary of state for finance were reviewing Petrocan's ownership. 'Everybody is saying that with share prices where they are, it may be time for the federal government to take a look at what it wants to do,' she said. Other, unspecified, options were also being considered. The previous Progressive Conservative government began privatising Petrocan in mid-1991, when it sold 42m shares to the public at CDollars 13 a share. The share price began sliding shortly afterwards, reaching a low of CDollars 7.38 last year. However, it has recovered sharply in recent months. The shares were trading at CDollars 13.50 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. A sweeping reorganisation, including asset disposals, and a jump in natural gas prices have contributed to a significant improvement in financial performance. Earnings totalled CDollars 162m (USDollars 120m) last year on sales of CDollars 4.6bn.</p>

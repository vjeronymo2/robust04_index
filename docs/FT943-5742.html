			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / People: Whiddett joins Threadneedle Investment Management Paul Manduca, who has been running Threadneedle Investment Management since the end of May, has brought in a smaller companies specialist from Hill Samuel Investment Management to improve the performance of a sector which he has identified as in need of attention. John Whiddett, 44, has spent the last decade at Hill Samuel, latterly managing equity portfolios for UK life companies. He had been keen to return to smaller companies. In the early 1980s, Manduca also had a spell at the merchant bank, specialising in smaller companies. Whiddett knows Threadneedle's investment director in charge of UK equities - Howard Maguire - even better, as Maguire had moved from an equivalent position at Hill Samuel just three years ago. Threadneedle has around Pounds 30bn under management, comprising the funds of both Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star insurance companies. Whiddett acknowledged that he was 'slightly apprehensive' as to how the newly formed Threadneedle - attempting to blend two such different cultures - would work out, but added he had 'great confidence' in Manduca. Manduca says inadequate expertise on the smaller companies side meant that neither Allied Dunbar or Eagle Star had captured the 'big recovery bounce' in the sector last year. He hopes Whiddett's arrival will increase the funds allocated to this sector to Pounds 500m or more.</p>

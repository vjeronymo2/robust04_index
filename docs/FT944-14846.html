			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Nigerian currency falls 12% in week The street value of the Nigerian naira has plunged 12 per cent against the dollar in the past week which has seen the sacking of Mr Kalu Kalu, the county's finance minister. Since Mr Kalu's dismissal last Monday night, the parallel rate of the naira has fallen to N90, the latest symptom of a deepening economic crisis. General Sani Abacha, who seized power last November, has reversed seven years of free market reforms backed by the IMF and the World Bank. Mr Kalu was a former World Bank economist and an architect of Nigeria's reforms. Bankers blame the devaluation on the erratic supply of foreign exchange on the official market. Since January the government has cut the budget for foreign exchange allocations at the official rate of N22 to the dollar from Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to Dollars 1.9bn. Junior foreign minister Anthony Ani assumed duties as acting finance minister yesterday and told the IMF to let Nigeria find its own solutions to its economic problems.</p>

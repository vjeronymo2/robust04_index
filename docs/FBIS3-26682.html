			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liang Guihe Liang Guihe (2733 6311 0735)] </F>   [Text] Paris, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Chinese Ambassador to  France Cai Fangbo gave a banquet on the evening of 2 February to  mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic  relations between China and France. Pierre Mehaignerie, justice  and keeper of the Seal of France; his wife; noted figures of  France's political, industrial, and commercial circles; and  high-ranking government officials numbering more than 50  attended.    In a warm and friendly atmosphere, Cai Fangbo and  Mehaignerie  proposed their toasts, respectively. Both sides agreed that the  historic decision, made with the foresight and sagacity of a  great politican 30 years ago by Chairman Mao and General de  Gaulle, to establish diplomatic relations between China and  France had not only laid the foundation for developing sincere  friendship between the two countries, but also had had a  far-reaching impact on international affairs.    After recalling the exchange of visits by leaders of the two  countries and the course traversed by the friendly and  cooperative relations between the two countries in the past 30  years since the establishment of diplomatic regions, Cai Fangbo  pointed out: After undergoing a period of difficulties and  setbacks, China and France issued a joint communique on the  improvement of relations, thus opening a new page in bilateral  relations. He said: Both China and France, as permanent  members of the Security Council, bear great responsibilities for  international affairs. Moreover, they share many identical or  similar views in many international issues. Both sides should  strengthen consultation and coordination. He said: "The  maintenance of stable relationship of friendship and cooperation  between China and France on a long-term basis not only conforms  to the fundamental interests of the two countries, but is an  important factor for maintaining balance and stability in the  world."    In his toast, Mehaignerie warmly lauded China's reform and  open policy and its vigorously growing economy. He also noted  that "France hopes to contribute to China's success in reform."  He noted: France and China should develop bilateral economic  cooperation, particularly cooperation in energy, transportation,  and telecommunications. French enterprises are ready to become  China's cooperation partners. He expressed the conviction that  the upcoming visit of French Premier Balladur to China will  certainly bring new and greater development of French-Chinese  relations.    Also attending the banquet were former French Premier  Delmas;  the wife of former French President Pompidou; (Peilefti) and  (Altsoke), government ministers of De Gaulle's era; Admiral  Philip de Gaulle, son of De Gaulle; and several former French  ambassadors to China.</p>

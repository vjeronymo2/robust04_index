			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA social problems department: </F> "The Runaway Decline Has Been Halted, But Somehow Life Has Not  Become Easier"]    [Text] Did we become richer or poorer over the past,  difficult and troubled, year of 1993? The usual answer to this  question is: "We are getting impoverished..." If we are to  believe official figures, however, our life is not all that  hopeless. And we obtained these figures from the most reliable  original source--the Russian Department of Labor, which kindly  made available to us the results of a study "On the Situation in  the Social and Labor Sphere." So, here is how we lived and  survived...    First and foremost, the study authors note, despite the  measures aimed at strengthening the social orientation of the  reforms adopted in 1993, the people's situation remains  difficult. The level of social guarantees has dropped, and  income indexation lags behind rises in consumer prices. Our  poverty had an impact on the demographic situation. Natural  population loss (number of deaths exceeding the number of  births) was registered in 68 regions in Russia. Life expectancy  measured 65.8 years as compared to 69.3 years in 1986.    Meanwhile, however, the population's monetary income, taking  into consideration those engaged in entrepreneurial activities,  increased 11-fold as compared to 1992. Taking into account the  consumer price index, income increased by 9 percent.    Society is being rapidly stratified into rich and poor. The  income of the 10 highest percent of the population exceeds the  income of the poorest by a factor of 11 (as compared to a factor  of eight in the end of 1992). And this is only according to  official data.    In 1993, 77 percent of the population had an income of less  than twice the size of the subsistence minimum, including 30  percent who had an income below the subsistence minimum. The  poorest (income not exceeding the cost of the minimum food  basket)--are families with many children, incomplete families,  and those with several dependents. Despite numerous indexations,  single pensioners and the disabled also ended up in this group.  At the same time, a group of "new poor" emerged in Russia in  1993. This is what official statistics call work-eligible  citizens whose income has fallen below the subsistence minimum.  This includes first and foremost the unemployed (of which there  are already more than 1 million), workers at unprofitable  enterprises sent on indefinite leave (more than 4 million  officially), and young people. More than 10 percent of high  school graduates could not find jobs in 1993, as well as more  than 70 percent of graduates of elementary vocational schools  (!), more than 60 percent of graduates of intermediate  vocational schools, and almost 50 percent of college graduates.    The highest level of unemployment currently exists in the  republics of Mari El, Dagestan, Chuvashia, Adygey, Mordvinia,  and Pskov, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo Oblasts, where there are very  few job vacancies. There are between 11 and 33 contenders for  each job here.    Meanwhile, far from all who have been laid off at  enterprises  or have left because of not being paid have registered at the  labor exchange. The number of those engaged in the nonstate  sector of the economy has grown sharply and now comprises 40  percent of the total employed. The number of jobs at state  enterprises, on the other hands, continues to shrink.    The average wage in 1993 increased 9.9-fold as compared to  1992, which more or less corresponds to the rise in consumer  prices. However, by December 1993 as compared to December 1992  it had increased only eightfold, while prices had increased  almost 10-fold.    There are wages and wages, however. It appears that  everybody  grasped this axiom in 1993. The past year produced the highest  divergence in the size of wages in the state and nonstate  sectors of the economy. The gap between high and low wages by  the end of the year was measured by a factor of 27. At the same  time, while high wages at private enterprises can at least be  explained somehow (they are their own masters, and besides, no  commercial structure maintains a huge staff), the gap of a  factor of 12-15 (!) between the salaries of top managers and  regular workers at state enterprises (without any regard to  whether they are flourishing or in distress) is harder to  explain. It appears that zealous directors direct all their  economic acumen to figuring out how to better line their own  pockets.    Meanwhile, wages are losing their main functions: to provide  for normal reproduction of labor force and provide incentives  for effective labor. Increases in them have lost any connection  with the final results of labor and depend only on price rises.    From these statistical data the Ministry of Labor draws  generally encouraging conclusions. The runaway decline in the  standard of living of the population, which began in 1992, was  halted in 1993. Economic reform is proceeding in an environment  of relatively low unemployment. At the same time, however, the  number of poor not only has not decreased but actually  increased, and the number of unemployed (both registered and  "hidden") has grown considerably. What to do about it is now  being discussed in thick reports by specialists of the ministry  of Labor and the Ministry of Social Protection. All we can do is  wait, or join those 40 percent who have chosen the nonstate  sector as their sphere of interests.</p>

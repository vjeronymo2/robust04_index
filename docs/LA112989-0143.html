			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CORONA DEL MAR;  </P> <P> GALA CHRISTMAS WALK TO BE HELD SUNDAY  </P> <P> The 13th annual Christmas Walk will be Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. along  Pacific Coast Highway and side streets.  </P> <P> Sponsored by the Corona del Mar Chamber of Commerce on the first Sunday of each  December, the free walk goes from Acacia Street to Poppy Street.  </P> <P> "The Christmas Walk is our gift to the community," said Chamber administrator  Ellen Buck. "This is not something done for a profit."  </P> <P> Last year about 5,000 residents and visitors, many bedecked in Christmas  finery, strolled through the shops and streets of downtown. This year's turnout  is expected to be larger, Buck said.  </P> <P> More than 200 entertainers will perform throughout the day, including 10  multicultural dance groups, four Big Bands, a jazz quartet, Coventry Carolers,  strolling musicians, mimes and a gospel choir.  </P> <P> Entertainment for children will include a magic show with Gum Drop the clown, a  puppet show at the Corona del Mar library, an Orange County Philharmonic Music  Mobil, a Be a Clown makeup table manned by Newport Theatre Arts Center  volunteers, a marionette show and pictures with Santa Claus.  </P> <P> Merchants will host free open houses and serve champagne, wine, cookies and  other refreshments.  </P> <P> "Stores and restaurants serve things like Chinese chicken salad, hot buttered  rum and Indian food," Buck said. "There's a lot of food."  </P> <P> At 4 p.m., drawings will be held for about 150 prizes, including a $1,000  shopping spree at Lorraine's Boutique.  </P> <P> Toys for Tots barrels will be manned by Marines and spotted throughout the  walk. New toys should be wrapped for distribution later to underprivileged  children. The packages should have labels telling the type of toy and whether  it is for a boy or a girl.  </P> <P> Christmas Walk headquarters will be outside the Studio Cafe at Marguerite  Avenue.

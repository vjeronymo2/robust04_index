			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / NFC suspends profit-share scheme Shares in NFC, the UK's largest transport and logistics group, fell 9 per cent yesterday after it revealed a fall in full-year operating profits, because of losses in European logistics, and a declining contribution from removal services. NFC also announced the first suspension of its employee profit-sharing scheme since it was privatised in 1982, a significant blow for a company which prides itself on its employee participation and ownership. NFC paid out Pounds 3.5m to staff in the previous year. In an effort to reassure institutional shareholders, however, NFC will lift its full-year dividend by 4 per cent from 6.72p to 7p. NFC launched a Pounds 263m rights issue and Pounds 45m restructuring last December, but its UK and European logistics businesses, and its global removal services all saw profits slide in the fourth quarter of 1994. Operations were adversely affected by the uncertainty following the sudden resignation of Mr Peter Sherlock as chief executive in August. A replacement has not been revealed, but is expected at the end of the year. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 104.9m to Pounds 105.6m for the year to October 1. Excluding exceptional items, the figure rose from Pounds 95.1m to Pounds 106.3m. Operating profits fell to Pounds 114.2m from Pounds 116.7m. UK logistics, which includes the Exel operations, remained NFC's largest profit maker reporting a slight increase in operating profits to Pounds 60.4m, from Pounds 60.1m. A large number of contracts came up for renewal during the year, and Exel had a success rate of close to 85 per cent, although it lost the Woolworths account. Increasing competition, however, resulted in a number of contracts being renewed at reduced rates. In Europe, the logistics business lost Pounds 4.6m against a Pounds 4.4m profit, despite investments during the year. NFC spent Pounds 10m on two acquisitions from Frigoscandia last May, reducing the German operations to an overall loss. The US business increased profits from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 23.3m, but at the expense of reduced margins. Moving services, including Allied Pickfords, was hit by weak European property markets, and profits fell from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 16m. However, Lynx, its parcel service, reduced losses from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 5.9m. Group turnover rose 7 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Mr James Watson, chairman, said: 'We are now focusing on areas where a change in the business will produce immediate cost reductions.' It is adding Pounds 5m to the Pounds 45m set aside for the restructuring and has indicated that restructuring is accelerating. NFC is paying a final dividend of 2.6p (2.5p), on earnings per share (before exceptional items) of 12p (12.6p). Its shares closed 15p lower at 147p. Lex, Page 22</p>

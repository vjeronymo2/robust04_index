			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vanya Manolova on departure of Lord Owen and </F> Thorvald Stoltenberg from Sofia on 4 January, including recorded  statement by Owen in response to a correspondent's question --  in English fading into Bulgarian translation]    [Text] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of  the international peace conference on the former Yugoslavia,  ended their visit to Bulgaria this morning.    In a brief statement prior to their departure, Lord Owen  stressed that it is too early to evaluate the results of their  tour before they complete their meetings in Tirana and Rome.  Lord Owen said that it was his general impression that the  voices of the neighbors of the former Yugoslavia, who are  suffering serious losses from the Yugoslav embargo, should be  heard more loudly and clearly.    Here is what Lord Owen said when asked by a correspondent  whether he would support the cancellation of the Yugoslav  sanctions:    [Owen] No, I do not favor lifting the sanctions. At this  stage, such a step would be premature. Anyway, it is not my job  to lift them; it is a matter for the UN Security Council.  However, the sanctions were imposed for a specific purpose, and  in the final analysis they should serve to achieve this aim. If  it becomes clear that there is no way that the sanctions will  bring about a settlement, then indeed it will be necessary to  raise the question of lifting them.</p>

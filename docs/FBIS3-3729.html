In 1993, the rate of various cases tried by law courts at  all  levels in Xinjiang through the judicial and supervision  procedures of first and second hearings rose by 21.74 percent  from that of 1992; among them, the rate of criminal cases closed  after the first hearing rose by 4.3 percent. Law courts closed  1,341 economic crime cases after the first hearing and handed  down fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death  sentence to 1,325 criminals in 1993, thereby effectively  cracking down on serious economic crimes and promoting the  anticorruption drive. While conducting their judicial work, law  courts at all levels took active part in comprehensive  management of public security. They held a total of 491 trials  and handed down sentences to 2,372 criminals, thereby deterring  criminals and encouraging the broad masses of the people.  Meanwhile, they closed 14,924 cases of economic disputes, which  involved a total amount of 900 million yuan plus, after the  first hearing. The figure of economic dispute cases showed an  increase of 66.82 percent from that of 1992. They paid close  attention to trying new types of cases, particularly those  closely related to the campaign launched by the state to  strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and to develop a  market economy; they handled these cases properly and achieved  marked social effect [she hui xiao guo 4357 2585 2400 2654].    Addressing the meeting, President Kurban Rozi of the  Regional  Higher People's Court said: In 1994, law courts at all levels  in Xinjiang should continue to crack down on  counterrevolutionary and serious criminal activities and on  economic crimes as well; to try big and important cases in a  down-to-earth manner; to vigorously regulate economic  relationships; to protect the legitimate rights and interests of  citizens, legal persons, and other organizations according to  laws; to enhance their judicial level; and to strictly enforce  laws so as to provide effective legal protection and services  for maintaining social stability, for promoting the building of  a clean and honest government, and for accelerating the  establishment of a socialist market economy.

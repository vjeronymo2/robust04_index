			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OBSTETRICIAN LOSES LICENSE OVER 4 INJURIES  </P> <P> State health officials have revoked the medical license of a longtime Long  Beach obstetrician who they say injured four infants by prematurely  administering anesthesia to mothers in labor, then using forceps improperly.  </P> <P> Dr. Archibald F. Forster, 67, was ordered by the state Board of Medical Quality  Assurance to surrender the medical license he was issued in 1954.  </P> <P> Investigators determined his actions were "so far below the accepted standard  of care" that they constituted "gross negligence and incompetence," according  to the decision made public this week.  </P> <P> The investigation centered on four babies delivered by Forster at Pacific  Hospital of Long Beach between October, 1984, and July, 1985.  </P> <P> Forster said he retired four years ago after Long Beach hospitals refused to  allow him on staff, and that he has not delivered a baby since. He said his  license expired last October.  </P></p>

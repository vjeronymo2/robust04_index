			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Keep a sharp eye on Spanish property contract, not the Sangria Sir, I read with great interest Gerald Cadogan's article on Spanish property (Mediterranean Property, August 13/14) and, in particular, his warning against the vendor including a clause in the contract of sale, under which the purchaser becomes responsible for all the debts and taxes of the property. Such a clause can, contrary to what the General Spanish Law otherwise provides, add quite substantially to the price. This underlines the need not only for professional legal advice to be taken at an early stage in any Spanish property purchase, but also the need to follow the common sense precept that one should not sign anything, especially in Spanish, which one has not read or understood, particularly after a jug or two of Sangria] Ian S Blackshaw, international counsel, De la Rosa &amp; Asociados, Ricardo Soriano 22, 29600 Marbella, Spain</p>

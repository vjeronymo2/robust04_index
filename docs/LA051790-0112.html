			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRITAIN;  </P> <P> OFFICIAL PROBE OF 747 BOMBING URGED  </P> <P> The opposition Labor Party issued a fresh call for an official British inquiry  into the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am 747 airliner over Scotland that killed 270.  The call, backed by families of British victims, follows a U.S. report that  suggested the bombing could have been prevented by better security. The British  government has said that an independent inquiry cannot take place until  criminal investigations are complete.  </P></p>

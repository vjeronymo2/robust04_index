			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Hell Awaits on the Other Side of 27 April"] </F>   [Text] The date of 27 April 1994 is an absolute date. The  plan is to elect a so-called democratic parliament over a  three-day period centered on 27 April. Have we given some  careful thought as to how that "parliament" is going to look if  it is ever elected? What follows here is a picture of what we  can expect in that regard.    Satanic worshippers, Hindus, Muslims, believers in  witch-doctors, atheists, and a bunch of people calling  themselves Christians will be sitting in the same benches. It is  alarming but not too far-fetched to call it a Satanic parliament.    That Satanic parliament, if it ever becomes a reality, will  be making laws for us Christians. The country will be governed  according to those laws. Those laws will regulate the education  of our children and prescribe the kind of education for them. Do  you think it is going to be a Christian national education?  Those who think so are thinking like children. Do you think that  that education is going to be given in your children's mother  tongue? Do you think their teacher is going to be someone from  the Boer-Afrikaner people? Do you think you are going to have  any say on the school board of your children's school? Do you  think that the neighborhoods are going to look any different  than Soweto? Do you think that you will be able to go about  outside of your fortified house or your squatter's hut after  dark or even during the day? Do you think you are still going to  have work and food for your family?    And furthermore: Do you think that you as a white person are  going to have any rights before the law? When your children are  assaulted and your spouses are treated in a manner that will  shock you, do you think that someone is going to listen to you?  Have you so quickly forgotten the outrages in the Belgian Congo?  Just ask those people. They are still living among us because  they fled here in their extreme humiliation and ruin. For you  there is no more opportunity to flee. The southernmost tip of  Africa is Cape Agulhas, and that is still a part of South Africa.    Just think carefully whether you want to participate in  the creation of this Satanic parliament.    There is something that we must remember well: We readily  call ourselves Christians. The Word expressly says that the  righteous may never pull together with the godless in  the same yoke. There is no way for us to evade this  prohibition--it stands fast. Any person who calls himself or  herself a Christian and participates in the Satanic parliament  commits high treason against Christianity. Those who take their  place in that parliament as well as those who even vote for it  are participating in it and will have to answer to the Creator  for that.    Those participants will just have to ponder whether a  position and a big salary are perhaps the 30 pieces of  silver.    We are proud to say that the blood of the French Huguenots  also flows in our veins. These are the people who fled from  France, their homeland, with only the clothes on their backs and  their precious Bible, baked in a loaf of bread. They left behind  family, friends, property--everything except their  faith in their Creator. That was more precious to them than  anything else. Do you think that they would have wanted a  position in a Satanic parliament for all the money in the world?    Perhaps many of our people who call themselves  Afrikaners or Christians should read the history of the  Huguenots again. Perhaps they will then return in time to things  that really matter rather than participating in a Satanic  parliament for temporal gain and the hypocritical appearance of  sacrifice.    We have pity in our hearts for these people. They were once  part of the Afrikaner-Boer people. They also have children who  should become part of our glorious people but whom they now want  to sacrifice to an alien conglomerate [sic]. What answers are  they going to give to those ruined, crushed little children when  they begin to ask questions? They will have to start looking  hard for answers right now. The time for finding answers is  extremely short. With open arms we invite our people to come  back.    Come back to your people who need you. Come, so that  together we can build a free republic of the people where we can  be ourselves, can govern ourselves, can serve our Creator in  freedom and can raise our children as Christian Boer-Afrikaners  for the next generation.    The time is short and the days until 27 April are few. The  sun is hanging low in the west. Soon darkness will descend upon  Azania while the light shall dawn over the republic of the  people.    We know, we believe, we shall be victorious, we do not  fight alone: While Azania fights in the darkness, we fight in  the light.</p>

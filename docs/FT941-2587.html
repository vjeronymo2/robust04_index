			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Voice of reason - Shepherd Associates / 8th in a series on fee-based advisers Few independent financial advisers have been more outspoken in their views on the commission system than Tony Shepherd, founder of Kent-based Shepherd Associates. Indeed, his criticisms became headline news four years ago. He marked his election as chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning with a speech that spelt out his vision of a fee-based financial planning profession that was independent of the need to sell anything except advice. The tied agents in his audience walked out and the lFP lost half its members. But many who are active in it today cite the speech as a watershed. It was after this, they say, that the lFP began to put down roots as the recognised professional body for qualified financial planners. Shepherd has been in the financial services industry since he left the navy more than 20 years ago and, 'in desperation,' accepted a job from Abbey Life. 'I was so naive I didn't even understand that they weren't going to pay me,' he says. A turbulent five years later, he had established his own insurance broking firm on the Isle of Skye, and was already vocal about the need for the life assurance industry to adopt a system of level commissions to combat the problem of mis-selling. In 1986, Shepherd was approached by accountant Ernst &amp; Whinney. A number of his clients were chartered accountants and E&amp;W wanted to use Shepherd Associates as a fulcrum for a new financial planning department, under his control. For Shepherd, the offer was a turning point. 'The big attraction was that I could get away from commissions overnight,' he says. But the move taught Shepherd that by no means all consumers of financial services shared his enthusiasm for a fee-based lFA business. He lost 90 per cent of his existing clients, and believes this was largely because of the change in business terms. By the time Ernst &amp; Whinney merged with Arthur Young in 1989, Shepherd had established a pensions consultancy and a multi-disciplined financial planning team. But the merger produced a clash of cultures and Shepherd decided to resurrect his own firm, this time basing himself in a village high on the Kentish downs. He was joined by Andrew Teasdale, a colleague from Ernst &amp; Whinney who had developed an investment planning system that concentrated on risk analysis. 'The primary thing is to get the asset allocation right,' says Teasdale. 'No client is exposed to short-term stock market risk. The most dangerous thing anyone can say is that equities are a long-term investment and that you will get your money back eventually.' Shepherd explains: 'What our clients get is not portfolio management: it is a financial plan concentrating on investment, usually for people who need to live off their capital. And we apply exactly the same principles to pensions. Everything is driven by clients' objectives.' Clients appear to like the approach. 'We haven't had to look for business,' says Shepherd. 'The problem has been coping with it. We specialise in retirement planning. It wasn't our intention; it just worked out that way. I don't say we wouldn't take on a 30-year old, but the people we are interested in are people approaching and at retirement age. So, we are rather different among financial planners. We concentrate on pensions and investment. We look at clients' estate planning and their insurance needs, but our new business on life policies averages about one a month.' Shepherd sees all new clients. 'I ask what their objectives are on retirement - for some reason, all solicitors tend to want to spend Pounds 20,000 on a camper van - and what assets they have to meet these objectives. Looking at that is the big exercise. It is usually four days' work on average, at a cost of around Pounds 2,000. But retirement is the major change we make in our life and it is worth doing properly.' Shepherd charges clients Pounds 95 an hour for time-based work (an estimate will be agreed in advance), while the annual management fee for asset management is percentage-based. There is no fee for initial consultations. The core of any financial plan produced by the firm will be the investment dispositions. Shepherd says: 'Andrew looks at the risk planning, the estate planning and making available money when it is needed. The same principle is involved with a 30-year-old looking for school fees.' Many clients will need to dip into capital. Teasdale says the firm's Plato portfolio planning system, which it has developed and which covers more than 2,500 funds, has a definition of risk 'that concerns itself with the effect of inflation, stock markets, and on the ability of the clients' assets to support their needs over their lifetime.' At present, 25 per cent of the UK exposure is in index-linked gilts. Shepherd Associates does not touch execution-only work and the investment emphasis is on unit trusts and investment trusts, never on a direct exposure to equities. Turnover on portfolios is low. Shepherd says: 'It costs money to move investments and that eats into performance. We have yet to be convinced that active management is effective.' Shepherd spent time polishing his French when he left Ernst &amp; Young, and he foresees an expansion of his business among UK residents who have retired across the Channel. But he is sceptical about the benefits of runaway growth. 'I am suspicious of any fee-based practice that is making money quickly,' he says. 'I think financial planning is a boutique business. And one lesson I have learnt is that it is done far better by small firms than by big ones.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             The INDEPENDENTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name:                                               Shepherd Associates Address of head office:                              Upper Hill Street,                                                       Elmsted, Ashford,                                                           Kent TN2S 5JT Date firm was established:                               September 1990 Regulator:                                                       FIMBRA Funds under management:                                      Pounds 10m Number of clients:                                                   75 Number of offices:                                                  One Minimum investment accepted:                  Effectively Pounds 50,000 Financial services offered:                      Comprehensive personal                                                     financial planning;                                          individual pensions management Fees:                                                Pounds 95 an hour.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

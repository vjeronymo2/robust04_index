			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Egypt to favour US wheat EGYPT WILL continue to import more than 70 per cent of its wheat from the US this year, despite its diminished reliance on US loans for grain imports, a senior official said Mr Samir al-Shakankiri, deputy head of the state supply corporation, said Egypt would import 4m tonnes of wheat from the US this year out of a total of 5.5m - roughly the same proportions as in 1992. Egypt, the world's third largest wheat importer, earlier this year signed for just Dollars 50m worth of US wheat import loans for this year, against Dollars 150m in 1992. The country's swelling hard currency reserves, now around Dollars 14.5bn, have enabled it to cut reliance on the loans and buy grain on spot markets for cash. It spends about Dollars 1bn annually on wheat, being able to produce domestically only 40 per cent of its yearly consumption. The cut in US loans under Washington's 'Food for Peace' programme, had led to speculation that Egypt might reduce its call on US grain, in particular taking advantage of European wheat.</p>

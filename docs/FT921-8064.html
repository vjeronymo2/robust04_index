			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Jobs: When to call for help from an HRC / A look at the international growth in numbers of the human resource consultant The international growth in the number of Human Resource Consultants (HRC) over the past decade has been meteoric, if not explosive. They go under a fairly large number of titles such as 'business psychologist', 'staff development professional' or 'organisational behaviour consultant'. There are many reasons why this American-originated occupation has grown so fast in Britain and Europe. HRCs come in many forms: the entrepreneurial don (usually from a business school); the one-man band (often a personnel officer given a golden handshake - or the sack); a small group of like-minded people running a specialised consultancy; or the large, usually international group, offering a wide range of consultancy services. But what do HRCs do? Why spend up to Pounds 2,000 a day having some outsider tell your organisation how to run it? HRCs offer a number of skills, many of which are surprisingly absent from most big organisations' personnel departments. This is mainly because the nature and function of 'personnel' has changed and training is frequently woefully inadequate. There are, I believe, four different and specific skills offered by HRCs. Diagnostics: HRCs can offer a 'second opinion'. They can bring objectivity but also the potential experience of having seen the problem before. Such HRCs may make their diagnostics in line with 'skill-solution'. In other words, having a number of expensive solutions available, they will force the diagnostics of the problem to fit their products. But one advantage of using experienced and insightful HRCs is that they can show the organisation to be fundamentally flawed in either its own diagnosis of the malady or the proposed solutions. Organisations like to believe that easy solutions are possible; they are also frequently unable to distinguish between explicit and implicit messages from clients, customers or their own staff. For instance, managers' complaints about the number of staff they have in their department to complete work-loads could have as much to do with problems in organisational structure, or a particular manager's ambitions, as they do about staffing. HRCs will tell you that diagnosis is more difficult and important than cure and that therefore getting it right easily merits the 'modest' fee. Measurement: Many personnel managers are not highly trained in measuring human performance, abilities, needs or personal preferences. After gullible, but enthusiastic and peer-pressured purchases of flashy, but not valid tests, personnel managers often set about measuring line-managers personality or the board's team-role preference. When the only tool you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as it if were a nail. Hence organisations measure what they can, more frequently than they need to. And this is where the well-trained HRC can bring to bear a formidable array of well tested measures. Over 100,000 tests are in print and a good HRC will know where to look for the most appropriate measure. There is a tendency to use inappropriate tests just because the organisation has bought them. Rather than spend all one's effort measuring the personalities of directors, the HRC may wisely recommend the measurement of organisational culture (the values and norms of the organisation), the climate (the perception of employees), the communication networks, the clients, the customers or the competitor's perceptions. Measuring instruments (questionnaires, tests) need to be sensitive, reliable, valid, multi-dimensional, sensitive to faking, 'normed' for the appropriate population. HRCs must, of course, not only choose and administer good tests but know how to analyse them appropriately and interpret the data. As HRCs know, many personnel officers shy away from objective 'hard' data, preferring softer interviews, reports or selected quotes from 'key players'. This may be one reason why they are often despised by their hard-faced colleagues in accounts, strategic planning and even marketing. Instruction: There is, and there will probably always be, a place for 'chalk-and-talk' training. Education, now more likely to be run with impressive videos, self-instruction and completion booklets, plus elaborate feedback reports, remains a central task of some HRCs. Training adults is a challenging task for the HRC. There are those in organisations who are themselves very bright and highly educated who may be extremely critical of any 'outside consultant'. Equally, those with chips on their shoulders because they never went to university, or did and did rather badly, may make poor students flipping between the sycophantic and the cynical. But there are others who are deeply appreciative and very good students. The good HRC soon realises that training adults is rather different from educating students. Training managers must be practical and concrete with lots of memorable examples, helpful models etc. Whereas academics are trained to be critical and sceptical, HRC instructors soon realise they are more appreciated if they are enthusiastic about the cause. HRCs are frequently extroverts with a self-confidence that extends somewhat beyond the bounds of their ability. As a result they rarely fear the role of teaching, training or instructing, though they may not be that good at it. Good teaching is a rare combination of intellectual ability and knowing how to put it across. Certainly, instructing or teaching is a crucial function for many HRCs. For many, alas, the term 'training' has a poor reputation and trainers are considered, rather lowly (paid) sorts of consultancies especially when teachers are trained to deliver 'packaged' courses. Process: Some HRCs specialise in process or interpretation as opposed to product. When, for instance, a management team is underperforming or suffering low morale, the process-oriented HRC might be called in not only for diagnosis but also cure. Process skills are closely akin to group psychotherapy and indeed it may be how the consultant was trained. Just as most accidents are the result of human error, so quite commonly poor business operations are the result of human frailty. Whether one prefers to use meaningless phrases like 'personality clash' or not, many people recognise that the quality of human relationships in offices, teams and departments contributes to business success or failure. It is the intangible psychological factors of morale, conflict and lack of commitment that the process consultant hopes to make manifest and explicit. Good HRCs, and those with psycho-analytic training, are frequently able to reveal unexpected or even paradoxical findings, such as depression amongst employees being a consequence of their anger. To some, 'process consultants' represent the wackiest California-type psychological air-heads who ask both intrusive and daft questions primarily to embarrass one. Furthermore, they may not even come to a conclusion, write a report or deliver any tangible outcome. Insight alone is often the orally explicit goal of the process consultant. It is nearly always the case that process work has to be done by the outside consultant. Politically, the personnel department may wisely judge it necessary to lure in consultants, albeit at some critical (and financial) cost. Beware the HRC who claims to be equally competent at all the above functions. But many business people do recognise that changing a business requires dynamite and it is often the consultant who lights the fuse. Victor Kiam once accused consultants of being like castrated bulls because all they can do is advise, not act. The question, of course, remains of where to get good advice Knowing and understanding what HRC consultants offer and do well is crucial for any company. No 'Which?' guide exists for the naive shopper, only compendia or lists of companies that specialise in HRC. Fitting the consultant to the problem is clearly as relevant as the employee to the job.

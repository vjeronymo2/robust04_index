			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Aegon set to borrow Dollars 500m Aegon, the Dutch insurance group, has a Dollars 500m programme for the issuance of debt instruments, Reuter reports from London. Arranger Morgan Stanley said the programme allowed full flexibility with regard to maturities and currencies, including guilders, D-Marks and French francs, and allowed for both unsubordinated and subordinate instruments. Morgan Stanley GmbH is arranger for D-Marks, Societe de Banque Swiss (France) is arranger for French francs, and there are nine banks in the dealer group. Aegon plans to use the programme both for private placements and public Eurobond issues, which would allow the company to accommodate specific investor demands.</p>

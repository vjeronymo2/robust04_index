			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: A drama out of a crisis THE PLAY billed as Angels in America at the Cottesloe runs for just over 3 1/2 hours and is only Part One. The real title is Millennium Approaches. Part Two of Tony Kushner's epic Angels has only just been completed and is called Perestroika. If you think that sounds pretentious, beware. Part One is not a moment too long. Right down to the variation on the Faustian ending, it struck me as one of the most powerful theatrical pieces I have seen for many a year. The taxi-driver on the way home asked me what it was about. I told him rather limply that it was about AIDS. 'Where do the angels come in?' he said pensively. The answer to his question is that Angels is a play in praise of homosexual love and with some sympathy for even the most anonymous homosexual encounters, the problem being that AIDS is getting in the way. Even when the disease strikes, the love and the lust go on. When one of the victims dies, the twist to the Faustian ending is that the angel rather than the devil comes to collect him. There is, of course, a great deal more to it than that. Millennial it certainly is; it is also very American. The last line, as the angel comes to rescue the dying lover, is 'God almighty]', then, as the angel descends: 'Very Steven Spielberg.' This is only millennium approaching; heaven knows what will happen in Part Two when it comes nearer. There is a lot of history, some American, some European, some real, some imagined. The disease of AIDS is juxtaposed to the black death in the 14th century and the great plague in the 17th. Prior Walter, the good guy victim in Angels, has ancestors going back to both and who appear to him in his final hallucinations. The earlier pestilences - or the 'spotty monster' - seemed much more universal, the people wholly unequipped to deal with it, though the suggestion is that only time and science will tell. In any case, life before and after pre-millennial tension goes on. The recent history concerns Roy Cohn, an extreme right-wing Republican lawyer who worked for Senator McCarthy and helped send the Rosenbergs to the electric chair. Cohn died of AIDS just as the disease was becoming widely identified. Yet just because some homosexuals were villains and hypocrites, the play suggests, it does not mean that homosexuality should be condemned. The case is made for coming out of the closet. Kushner carries the case further. One of the characters is a Mormon, originally happily married yet having suppressed homosexuality all the way. He defies the lucrative blandishments of Cohn to go off to be an aide in the Department of Justice in Washington, where he could protect Cohn, because he says that would be unethical. In the end, however, he finds solace with Louis, the surviving Jewish lover of Prior. Religion, like history, has a strong part in the play. Jewishness is set alongside Mormonism and occasionally Catholicism. The message is that none of them know how to cope with homosexual passion. Politics comes in as well. At the beginning of the third act, there is a marvellous scene between Louis, the liberal Jewish homosexual, and his black, more radical, former lover, Belize. Louis says that American politics have nothing to do with race: that is why America is so different from Europe. Belize politely dissents. Not everyone will like the play, nor agree with its thesis. Some of the physical scenes are very explicit. Having read the text beforehand, I assumed I was in for a grim evening. Yet if you want an example of vibrant America, this is it. There is nothing wrong with drawing inspiration from Spielberg and the best of Hollywood. Henry Goodman as Cohn gets better and better the closer he is to dying. Marcus D'Amico (Louis) and Sean Chapman (Prior) play the central lovers with all the feeling of Antony and Cleopatra. Felicity Montagu, as the chief female victim of the male urge to prefer males, stands up very well, though towards the end she disappears to Anartica to inspect the gap in the ozone layer where no doubt we will hear more of her in Perestroika. Declan Donnellan directs with the utmost sensitivity. You should see this play, for even if you loathe it, you will love discussing it afterwards.</p>

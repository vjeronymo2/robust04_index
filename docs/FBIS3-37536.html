This has been done in view of the boycott of the  elections announced by the Dniester authorities.    To prevent the opening of polling stations, a special  situation was introduced there by a decree of Igor Smirnov, the  Dnestr Region leader. Armed posts were placed in some populated  areas and on bridges across the Dniester. People engaging in  the election campaign are being detained. The Moldovan  leadership fears that on the election day - 27 February - the  population of the left bank regions will be afraid to cross the  Dniester and come to the polling stations opened on the right  bank. Therefore, under Mircea Snegur's decree, the citizens of  the Dniester Region will be allowed to vote during the week  beginning 21 February.</p>

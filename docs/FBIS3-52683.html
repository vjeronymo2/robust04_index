It has become the talk of the public  and the intellectuals, overshadowing all other regional and  international issues. The question that is being asked in every  house is who killed or kidnapped Mansur al-Kikhya? [passage  omitted]    The question is: Did Libya kill or kidnap Mansur al-Kikhya?  At first glance, we can say yes on the basis that the Libyan  regime has a vital interest in the disappearance of al-Kikhya.  But after scrutinizing the situation, we find ourselves facing  various possibilities.    First of all, it is illogical that Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or  one of his agencies would resort to this criminal act at this  specific time, when the international crisis against Libya is  boiling and reaching its peak and while al-Qadhdhafi is trying  hard to acquit his country of the Lockerbie incident.    If we say that al-Qadhdhafi did it, after realizing that the  U.S. Administration saw al-Kihya as a suitable substitute to  take power and succeed al-Qadhdhafi in Libya, would it be  illogical for al-Qadhdhafi to sacrifice his relations with  Egypt? Al-Qadhdhafi has wagered on these relations even at the  expense of disagreeing with some of his comrades in the  Revolution Command Council. He has worked to cultivate these  relations despite the regional events that have come between  Egypt and Libya. I personally believe that al-Qadhdhafi was  not ready to sacrifice his relations with Egypt, and  particularly with President Mubarak, by kidnapping a Libyan  opposition figure who has only his tongue and a pen.    Even if we agree that al-Qadhdhafi had decided to sacrifice  his relations with Egypt and President Mubarak and did this  deed, how could al-Kikhya have been smuggled out amid the strict  security measures on the border between the two countries?  Could al-Kikhya have been kidnapped from his hotel so easily  and without an uproar or shouts for help?    In the midst of conflicting reports, we have forgotten to  discuss the real beneficiary of the disappearance of al-Kikhya,  particularly in Egyptian territory. We have forgotten Israel  and the United States. Both countries have a common interest in  striking at the Egyptian-Libyan relations, which have stood fast  despite the strong winds blowing on them over the past few years.    If we concede from the start that the United States is using  all means to subjugate Libya and that one of the basic methods  to do this is to tighten the suffocating blockade on it and if  we agree that Egypt with its status, prestige, and common border  with Libya still represents a support for the Jamahiriyah, why  shouldn't the United States fabricate an incident that would  force the regime in Egypt to sever its relations with Libya, at  the least, or push it into war to overthrow the Libyan regime,  in the most extreme case.    The experience in Somalia was a lesson for the United  States.  The U.S. air bombardment of Iraq did not succeed in overthrowing  President Saddam Husayn's regime. Only a ground war or an  internal coups could change the situation. But because the  United States does not want to dispatch its troops to a new  swamp, their solution was to find another state that would do  the job for it--especially since the United States has failed to  change the regime through military coups. Certainly, the United  States could only use Egypt, which, because of the size and  equipment of its forces and its strategic location, could  achieve what others could not. In addition, this would serve  the U.S. and Israeli goals of starting a war among the sons of  the nation to ultimately serve the Zionist aims.    I also believe that the search recently focused on finding a  justification, especially after al-Qadhdhafi refused to  relinquish his country's sovereignty and decided not to turn  over the Lockerbie suspects.    The justification was Egypt's dignity. The Americans decided  on a plan to kidnap al-Kikhya from Egyptian territory and to  accuse the Libyan regime of doing the kidnaping. This would  provoke the people to condemn the perpetrators of this act and  then matters would escalate.    In fact, a state of resentment has spread among the masses,  especially since some newspapers have jumped to conclusions and  have started leveling accusations at the Libyan regime,  demanding that it be disciplined and that Egypt's squandered  dignity be avenged.    Thus the situation remains the same. Matters continue to  escalate. Despite the Libyan denial and the Egyptian  Government's belief that Libya is not behind this crime, some  people remain determined to fan the fire and involve themselves  in the scenario of the hellish U.S. game. [passage omitted]    Thus, we must warn against falling into this new trap, this  wicked plan that is aimed at igniting the fire of war between  the Arab people in Egypt and Libya. This is an abominable crime  into which we must not be pushed. We must force those who are  playing with the country's national security to stop and realize  that the eruption of war under the pretext of disciplining  al-Qadhdhafi is the U.S.-Zionist plan.    Despite all this, we call on the government to spare no  effort in searching for the Libyan opposition figure and to  remove the ambiguity surrounding his disappearance.</p>

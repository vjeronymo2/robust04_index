			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with V. Agafonov, chief of Nevel Customs Post, by </F> Yu. Kozlov; place and date not given: "Fifty-Five Customs Agents  on a Transparent Border"]    [Text] As far back as I can recall, Belarus has  always existed more prosperously and better than Russia. At any  rate better than Nevel Rayon in Pskov Oblast, which adjoins it.  Formerly the Nevel side had poverty, hunger, and a shortage of  gasoline, while on the Belarus side it was not really abundance,  but definitely better. Traffic moved principally in one  direction--from hungry Pskov Oblast into Vitebsk Oblast. But the  link of time has disintegrated. Such a suddenly acquired  indisputable factor of independence as the Belarus hare, which  at first could be exchanged for 10 Russian rubles, was called  upon to protect the higher standard of living and at the same  time restrain Pskov Oblast residents from emptying Belarusian  shelves.    At present the situation along the new Russian borders  is completely different. The hare lost considerable  weight--seven for a ruble. Even though store shelves in Belarus  are hopelessly empty, the flow of goods still continues to flow  into Russia--from the doubtful hare to the still lively ruble.  Russia to Belarus at the present time is something like Poland  used to be to Russia, and Germany to Poland. On Sundays the  Nevel market is highly reminiscent of a Polish or Hungarian  market at the end of the 1980's. Remote Russian towns very  quickly turned into border towns, which amazingly fast become  saturated with the regular infrastructures: secret warehouses  for contraband goods, intrepid people, guilds of conductors,  guiding huge trailers via secret rural roads, drinking  establishments, ramshackle hotels offering travelers saunas,  Russian bath houses, and comely young ladies. Vladimir Agafonov,  chief of the Nevel Customs Post talks about what the  Russian-Belarus border looks like today.    [Agafonov] The Nevel Customs Post has existed since 1  January  1993. It was created on the basis of the Velikolukskiy Customs  Post and includes a crossing point for motor vehicles along with  two railway crossing points Nevel 1 and Nevel 2.    [Kozlov] How many people work at the customs post?    [Agafonov] There are 55 persons at the three crossing  points.  Most of the inspectors work directly at the motor vehicle  crossing point--they conduct inspections of motor vehicles  entering and exiting Russia.    [Kozlov] When will construction of the new customs complex  be  completed?    [Agafonov] Right now the motor vehicle crossing point  represents, so to speak, a temporary facility. It is planned to  introduce the new complex on 30 June. All of the services  required for customs control will be deployed over an area of  three-and-a-half hectares. Four lanes will be in operation--two  for passenger vehicles, and two for trucks.    [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, how was it possible to find  55 customs officers at once in a remote Russian town such as  Nevel?    [Agafonov] Actually, most of the inspectors live in Nevel.  Mainly they are former officers and young people with a higher  education. Many of them worked in production, but now the  enterprises are being closed and the personnel are discharged.  We send inspectors to St. Petersburg for special courses, after  which they immediately go to work. Unemployment is growing in  the country, therefore we are having no problems with personnel.  I was recently the head of one of the enterprises.    [Kozlov] In other words, no one has years of working  experience?    [Agafonov] Experience is acquired quite rapidly. It is  possible to say that we are growing together with new Russian  customs legislation. The main documents were adopted in May of  last year. Our advantage over the old customs personnel is that  we do not have to retrain.    [Kozlov] On average, how much does a customs inspector earn?    [Agafonov] Our wages are equated to wages in law enforcement  organs. An inspector earns approximately as much as a sergeant  in the militia--slightly less than 2,000.    [Kozlov] How would you describe the state of today's  Russian-  Belarus border?    [Agafonov] The border is quite transparent. There is no  passport control. In our sector there are no frontier forces and  none are planned. There are, however, 26 unmanned customs posts  on alternate routes that could readily accommodate heavy  transport. Even though we do have an agreement with the Belarus  customs service--they return smugglers to Russia--it is,  naturally, possible to catch far from all of them.    [Kozlov] Do assertions that Russia is being robbed and  everything of any value at all is being exported, correspond to  reality? Let us recall the latest film by Stanislav Govorukhin.    [Agafonov] To a certain degree they do, or rather did. In  the  first months of the customs post cargo, mainly raw material, was  shipped out of Russia. This year the situation has changed.  Shipments have been declining. Presently more is being imported  into Russia than exported. In May the flow of freight decreased  somewhat, but up to then 130-200 trucks were lined up daily  waiting to enter Russia, and there was no exit line.    [Kozlov] What is being imported in Russia?    [Agafonov] Mainly foodstuffs, alcohol, and consumer goods.  Less frequently, equipment.    [Kozlov] Each customs service has its history and  traditions.  What can the Nevel Post be proud of?    [Agafonov] When the flow was coming from Russia we detained  up to seven freight shipments a day. We saved quite a lot of  fuel, lumber, nonferrous metals, and fertilizer for the country.  One shipment had 20 tonnes of copper, another one had 38 tonnes  of nickel, while a third one contained seven tonnes of black  caviar.    [Kozlov] Was that contraband?    [Agafonov] For the most part. Sometimes, however, the  corresponding structures simply did not know how to complete the  required documentation properly.    [Kozlov] What happens with the detained freight?    [Agafonov] It is stored in our guarded warehouses. Legal  proceedings are initiated concerning the violation of customs  rules and an appropriate decision is made. Frequently the matter  is turned over to organs of the Internal Affairs Ministry or the  procurator's office. Perishable goods are sold through the  retail network of the Nevel Rayon, as soon as documents are  prepared regarding the confiscation.    [Kozlov] What is the situation with narcotics and weapons?    [Agafonov] There have been some individual cases.    [Kozlov] Vladimir Nikolayevich, customs legislation changes  so rapidly that people are simply unable to keep up with it. Do  the existing rules infringe on the rights of normal citizens who  are not smugglers?    [Agafonov] If one wants to export or import some goods  within  average limits, not at all. Personal effects with a value of up  to 50 minimum wages and import $2,000 worth may be exported.  Most goods may be imported into Belarus from Russia and into  Russia from Belarus without any duties. Every citizen of Russia  has the right to import one domestic motor vehicle from any CIS  country once a year. There are restrictions on the export of  gasoline--a full tank plus a 20-liter can. The Belarus side  exercises rather strict control over the export of food from the  republic.    [Kozlov] The establishment of a new country--the Republic of  Belarus, took place virtually before your very eyes. How does  the economic state of that country appear today out of the  window of a Russian customs post?    [Agafonov] At first the tendency of Russians to export goods  to Belarus was evident, since the economy there was functioning  with greater success than in Russia. Sometime in October of last  year the pendulum swung the other way--goods are being shipped  from Belarus to Russia in order to acquire cash in rubles.    [Kozlov] What can be said about the Belarus currency--the  hares?    [Agafonov] Absolutely no one wants them in Russia. Citizens  of Russia exchange rubles for hares in order to purchase  Belarusian goods, which are still somewhat cheaper than similar  Russian goods but are of an inferior quality. On the whole that  is done by people on both sides of the border who are not very  prosperous. As far as I know, most of the residents of Belarus  have a positive attitude toward the Russian ruble zone.    [Kozlov] Will there be any changes at the customs post after  the final entry of Belarus in the ruble zone?    [Agafonov] I do not think so. Of all the freight shipped  through the post that from Belarus amounts to barely more than  10 percent. There may be some changes in duties, but customs  control will continue as it has been.    [Kozlov] How are relations with your Belarusian colleagues  shaping up?    [Agafonov] We have excellent relations. We are in contact  almost daily. I frequently meet with customs personnel from  other CIS countries. Everyone favors cooperation and restoration  of ties. We are also for that. But without harm to Russia.</p>

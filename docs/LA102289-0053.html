			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SCHOOL HAS CHANGED, BUT MISSION REMAINS THE SAME  </P> <P> It's 7:45 a.m. and Teri Uyemura's sixth-grade class is drifting onto campus  like the morning fog that often blankets this part of Northwest Pasadena. They  walk past the three security guards posted at the school, through halls of  jostling, yelling seventh- and eighth-graders and plop down into the wooden  desks of Room 115 at Washington Middle School.  </P> <P> There's Chris Spearman, wearing a pair of knee-length "Do the Right Thing"  shorts and sporting a red, yellow and green pendant of the African continent on  his chest.  </P> <P> Followed by Victor Hernandez, with his rat-tail haircut, inquisitive eyes  framed by glasses held in place with a skier's-type leash.  </P> <P> And Hugo Sanchez, with his pants slung low on his hips, who will make several  trips to the pencil sharpener and the Kleenex dispenser in the coming hours as  other heads bend over class work.  </P> <P> "He's so bright," Uyemura says wistfully of Hugo, who already towers over his  5-foot, 1-inch teacher. After 19 years of teaching sixth grade, the last four  at Washington, Uyemura knows that with the right encouragement, Hugo will  blossom.  </P> <P> Welcome to the sixth grade, Pasadena Unified School District.  </P> <P> Here in a sunlit classroom festooned with children's drawings and homework  assignments, Uyemura wrestles with ignorance. She battles the effects of missed  breakfasts, broken homes, too much TV and not enough sleep.  </P> <P> Washington Middle School, built in 1924, during the post-World War I boom when  Northwest Pasadena meant swank homes and privilege, now lies in the poorest,  most ethnic part of town.  </P> <P> Many affluent whites have fled both the area and its public schools. Most of  Uyemura's kids are black or Latino. More than half have only one parent at  home, teachers say; most families are on welfare.  </P> <P> That doesn't faze Uyemura.  </P> <P> "I don't want to hear any kind of complaining," she announces during the first  month of class, pivoting on her low heels to better take in the room. "All of  you guys are supposed to get ready for the seventh grade, and you're not going  to get anywhere unless you do this work," she says, referring to math problems  (division with remainders) she has just assigned.  </P> <P> Whether she is explaining homonyms at the board or asking her wriggling charges  to name the seven continents and four oceans, Uyemura is the boss in Room 115.  </P> <P> She knows it, and the class knows it too.  </P> <P> Unlike some of the other teachers they have for electives, Uyemura commands  students' respect. They may murmur and goof off when she leaves the room for a  minute, inscribing the desktops with a style of graffiti found throughout  Northwest Pasadena and throughout Los Angeles. Or the boys may flick pens at  each other to impress the girls, then holler, "Don't you be touching on me!" as  they punch the nearest shoulder.  </P> <P> But a sibilant murmur of "Sh's" accompanies Uyemura's return. Several of those  in the class are garrulous, but this year, Uyemura says with relief, she has a  basically good bunch of kids. There is no troublemaker, and just a glimmer of a  class clown, the playful Rickey Armendariz, whom she has so far discouraged by  explaining that such behavior is for babies and will not be tolerated in the  grown-up sixth grade.  </P> <P> Others, like Margaret Gonzalez, she merely beams grateful smiles at, smiles  that the smart girl returns shyly. Slender, with brown locks pulled back neatly  in a ribbon, Margaret breezes through her assignments, then pulls out "A Light  in the Attic" and reads while the others catch up.  </P> <P> Uyemura instills trust too. When she bends over a student's work, she sticks  her face right up to theirs, looking them eyeball to eyeball, praising them out  loud for good work, sometimes admonishing them privately for bad behavior.  </P> <P> Sixth grade works on a simple system of incentives, punishments and rewards.  Students who finish a set amount of class work, which varies whether they want  to earn an A, B or C, can go to "break" when the bell rings. Those who don't  stay in.  </P> <P> "I like the sixth grade," Uyemura reflects during lunch, catching her breath  while students wander in and out of the classroom to talk about weekend  excursions and coming projects.  </P> <P> "They're right at the age when you can talk to them and reason with them.  They're trying to discover who they are."  </P> <P> It's hard sometimes, since the class is interrupted repeatedly, by a monitor  coming around for candy money, an instructor poking her head in for 30 seconds  to confer with Uyemura, a special-education teacher collecting a child for  individual counseling.  </P> <P> Despite the attentive classroom and the children's interest in learning, this  is no little red schoolhouse.  </P> <P> "A lot of kids I have are borderline to giving up. They're really close,"  Uyemura says, her voice tinged with sadness. She mentions one student about  whom she is concerned.  </P> <P> "He could real easily be out on the street and be a gang member," she says.  </P> <P> Another has shown up twice for school in recent weeks. When he arrived one of  those days, another instructor sent him right to detention. He hasn't been  back.  </P> <P> Things were different between 1958 and 1960, when Uyemura attended Washington  Middle School. There was a woodworking shop, intramural sports, social and  civic clubs -- more of a campus life.  </P> <P> Today, security guards patrol the campus to keep violence, especially  gang-related activities, away. The school is surrounded by fences that are  locked at night. After-school sports were scuttled when games started  attracting unsavory neighborhood denizens.  </P> <P> The ethnic makeup was different then too. Uyemura remembers a fairly even mix  of white and black students then. Today there are few whites and an increasing  number of Latinos, with a sprinkling of Armenians.  </P> <P> But kids are still kids, especially at that tremulous threshold between  childhood and adolescence. Earlier in the day, they had hung with rapt  attention on the words of Jim Robinett who team-teaches science with Uyemura in  the adjoining classroom.  </P> <P> Robinett had sliced open the embalmed heart of a sheep before the intrigued  class, and the talk had gone from arteries to embalming fluid to a  well-received discussion about Cleopatra and the famous Egyptian mummy King  Tut.  </P> <P> To the kids, this suddenly wasn't school, it was "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"  with Robinett assuming the mantle of Indiana Jones as he spun his tale.  </P> <P> Later, Deandre Hall, a slender boy whose hair is closely shaved, except for a  triangular patch at the base of his skull, came running up to his teacher.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Uyemura," he said, happy to show off his knowledge of ancient Egyptian  history. "I heard about him. I heard about that man who was wrapped."  </P></p>

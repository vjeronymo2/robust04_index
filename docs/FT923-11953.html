			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Charterhouse Estates in receivership Charterhouse Estates and its CEL Liverpool subsidiary, property companies owned by the water authorities' pension fund, have been put into administrative receivership with secured debts of over Pounds 10m. The two companies are involved in inner city regeneration. CEL Liverpool owns several hundred residential and corner shop proper-ties in Liverpool while Charterhouse Estates owns development sites in Southwark, Lambeth and West London. Mr Chris Barlow, of Cork Gully in London, who with Mr Mark Palios, of Cork Gully in Liverpool, was appointed a joint administrative receiver, said he was unable to put a value on the companies' assets. 'Given the complexity of the property situation and the state of the market, at this stage I cannot be precise about what our strategy for disposing of the properties will be so it is too early to estimate the likely realisation from the property portfolios,' he said. Mr Barlow said the total size of the companies liabilities was unclear.</p>

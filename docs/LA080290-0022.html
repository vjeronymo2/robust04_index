			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Reliance Group Holdings Inc.: The New York-based insurance, investment and  development company reported second-quarter income of $164.7 million,  contrasted with a $5.9-million loss for the year-ago period. Revenue was up 26%  to $1.15 billion, boosted largely by sale of the company's General Casualty  subsidiary. Profit gains were registered by its title and mortgage insurance  units, but soft pricing and a loss of $9 million from fire damage in the recent  Santa Barbara-area disaster were blamed for lower profit in property and  casualty insurance.  </P> <P> Tables, D15  </P></p>

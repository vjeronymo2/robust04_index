			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Federal District--Jorge Carpizo's disputes with  members of the Federal Judicial Branch have exceeded the bounds  of legality and entered the realm of confrontation.    Such was his reaction to the decisions of a couple of judges  and a magistrate who considered bills of indictment submitted by  the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]  inadmissible. Claiming that these decisions had caused the  release of "dangerous drug traffickers," Carpizo exploded,  resorting to a verbal and even incriminating attack.    Also exhibiting alleged errors made by judges and  magistrates  in their action, he publicly accused them of "negating the PGR's  efforts in the battle against drug traffic."    Within the next few days, the PGR will file an  administrative  complaint in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN)  against Olga Sanchez Contreras, the third district judge of  criminal proceedings, for having released two presumed  participants in the 24 November shooting at the Ochoa Bali-Hai  restaurant. The judge maintained that the PGR is attempting to  conceal its own mistakes by accusing the Judicial Branch.    She declared that, in fact, the PGR has compiled its  preliminary investigations poorly, and that its charges are  groundless.    The clashes between Jorge Carpizo, head of the Executive  Branch's juridical division, and "certain" representatives of  the Federal Judicial Branch, of which Carpizo was a member  before joining the Executive Branch, are nothing new.    According to sources close to the PGR, during recent months  it has been common practice for judges to refuse, or to declare  themselves disqualified, to hear cases remanded by that  department, particularly those associated with drug traffic. On  other occasions, they have refrained from issuing arrest  warrants or orders for the formal imprisonment of presumed  criminals.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Albert Musin: "Special Services Are Active Not </F> Only on Their Own Turf. A Spate of Resignation Begins Among  Republic's Leaders"]    [Text] It became known the other day that in the capital  of Kazakhstan, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Uzbekistan's special services  kidnapped well-known opposition leader Murad Dzhurayev, whom  they had been hunting for his part in publishing the ERKH  newspaper.    Dzhurayev was grabbed in a private apartment. According to  some information, Erkin Ashurov, director of the Samarkand tea  packaging factory, was arrested with him. To all appearances  the kidnapped men were taken out to Tashkent.    When Kazakhstan human rights activists asked the Republic's  prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs for  clarification regarding this, yet another incident involving  Uzbekistan's special services, the reply was once again that the  local law enforcement organs "had not been notified" about the  holding of the "operational measure" by Ministry of Internal  Affairs operatives of another state on territory within their  jurisdiction.    It can also be stated that the agreements on cooperation  between special services and law enforcement organs of CIS  states (the latest such agreement was signed between Kazakhstan,  Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan in Dzhambul on 12 May) contain no  mechanism to prevent abuses and violations of human rights on  the part of these services.    Meanwhile, in Uzbekistan they are vividly discussing a whole  series of sensational resignations and "transfers to other jobs"  of ranking leading lights including Mavlon Umurzakov, chief  adviser to the president; and Islambek Yusufbekov, chairman of  the State Committee on Science, among others.    More remarkable in this series is the firing of Umurzakov,  who was in charge of "cadre selection and placement" both when  he was head of the organizational department of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan and in the  position of adviser to the president, and who has been regarded  as one of the most powerful men at the top. His resignation  touched off a whole chain of dismissals of officials of various  ranks down to regional officials who used to be his "proteges."  Umurzakov was sent, according to Karimov's order, to be "in  charge of Syrdarya Oblast," only to disappear without a trace.  Rumors have it that he is on the run because he had come to  take bribes without moderation, thereby causing displeasure  among his comrades and primarily another "gray eminence," Ismail  Dzhurabekov, who had earlier been unrivaled in this department  and had invariably been agricultural vice prime minister ever  since Rashidov's times. According to one view, Karimov is  getting rid of his closest but too despicable comrades in arms  in this manner in a bid to bolster his positions, which have  been seriously shaken of late.    Local observers note an extremely nervous atmosphere among  the president's entourage and among his staff as a whole. In  their opinion, the staff is weary, harassed by constant  contradictory and excessive demands, and whereas any official  could dream of getting close to "the man at the top" in the  past, now only few feel attracted by the prospect.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Arts: The Mountain Giants - Theatre An initial warning may be in order: The Mountain Giants is more for the head than the heart and parts of it are obscure even by the standards of Pirandello. It was the author's last play and was unfinished when he died in 1936, though he left an outline for the final act. The production at the Cottesloe is a new version by Charles Wood who has written a conclusion that looks as if it is faithful enough to the original intentions. The Giants are fascists, yet while there are mentions of Herr Hitler and Berlin, they are plainly of the Italian, not the German variety, and therefore less efficient. The Italian giants, like the Germans, go in for stadiums, not theatres, but they are not really giants at all, 'just trying to be, hoping to be.' In a lovely Italian line, it is said that they are simply 'the Giganti family', as one may speak of other Italian dynasties. In fact, the giants never appear. There is one scene of loud martial music and the sound of giant feet marching, but they do not reach the stage. The most they do is send a bureaucrat to represent them. All that may seem lucid enough in exposition. The trouble is, however, that it does not emerge until around the middle of the play. The beginning is much more characteristically Pirandello. One set of peasant actors, led by the magician, Cotrone, meets another, more professional group known as the Contessa's company. There are some familiar exchanges about illusion and reality, then some more mystical scenes about dreams. It is only gradually that we understand that the professionals are under pressure from the regime, and that freedom of the imagination is in danger of being suppressed. In the second act the threat becomes clear enough, but then there is another twist. It is not the absent giants who boo the actors' play off the stage, but the huge audience of workers who 'dig, build and pave' for the giants' state. By then, all the customary playing with illusion is gone. The stark conclusion is that, under totalitarianism, individual art cannot exist: harder to say in the Italy of the 1930s than it is today. The piece ends, almost as it began, with the Contessa being wheeled off, as she was first wheeled on, in a cart, possibly dead. There have been other satirical shafts along the way. The sailors who support the regime, for example, are presented as a set of dummies in a child's nursery and only occasionally come to life. Presumably they are serving only to wear the uniform and are not really dangerous at all except in their readiness to conform. Even under William Gaskill's direction, this remains a collector's item: fascinating to watch, but not an entirely coherent play. It contains one magnificent performance by an actor who continues to grow in stature. That is Desmond Barrit as Cotrone. He will be remembered as playing both twins in the RSC's Comedy of Errors and, more electrically, as the property developer in The Chinese Wolf at the Bush earlier this year. Physically large, sometimes he just needs to stand there to impress: when he speaks he compels attention. As the magician commanding the actors, he is the one wise man in the play, standing slightly above it all. The actress who stands out is Sian Thomas as the Contessa, but one cannot say it is the best part Pirandello wrote. Cottesloe Theatre. (071) 928 2252</p>

NATO needs to create the "backbone" [7 March] of a security  system in Europe, where the changes taking place in the post-  communist countries are creating a range of problems and  conflicts whose consequences affect the whole continent, Baudys  said in a lecture entitled "Security in Europe" at a conference  organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation.    Europe requires clearly defined security structures - and  defined procedures for discussion, information exchange and  authority - should these conflicts escalate, he said.    He said the Czech Army's cooperation this year with units  from the French, German and Dutch armies should be taken only  symbolically, because "we need to begin from the very bottom."    Joint military exercises are already being planned for next  year in the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme, he  said, adding that materials clarifying the legislative status of  the exercises are currently being drawn up.    The Czechs have had bad experiences with international  leagues and unions, he recalled. Czechoslovakia's first  treaties and the Little Entente ended with the Munich Agreement  in 1938, and following the Second World War membership of the  Warsaw Pact was "forced on us." Baudys said he was certain the  Czechs' association with NATO would be a different kind of  experience.</p>

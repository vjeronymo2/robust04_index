We intend in the new broadband personal communications service to meet fully the statutory mandate of Section 309(j)(4)(D), as well as the objectives of promoting economic opportunity and competition, of avoiding excessive concentration of licenses, and of ensuring access to new and innovative technologies by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women. As explained more fully in this Order, in some respects it is necessary to do more to ensure that businesses owned by members of minority groups and women have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of personal communications services than is necessary to ensure participation by other designated entities. In particular, we have concluded that steps such as adoption of bidding credits, tax certificates, alternate payment plans and relaxed attribution rules, must be taken to encourage investment in minority and women-owned businesses. These special provisions are tailored to address the major problem facing minorities and women desiring to offer PCS_lack of access to capital. Moreover, because broadband PCS licenses in many cases are expected to be auctioned for large sums of money in the competitive bidding process, and because buildout costs are likely to be high, it is necessary to do more to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in broadband PCS than is necessary in other, less costly spectrum-based services. In our view, these steps and the others we adopt are required to fulfill Congress' mandate that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. The measures we adopt today will also increase the likelihood that designated entities who win licenses in the auctions become strong competitors in the provision of broadband PCS service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 97. In instructing the Commission to ensure the opportunity for designated entities to participate in auctions and spectrum-based services, Congress was well aware of the difficulties these groups encounter in accessing capital. Indeed, less than two years ago, Congress made specific findings in the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, that ``small business concerns, which represent higher degrees of risk in financial markets than do large businesses, are experiencing increased difficulties in obtaining credit.'' <FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>  Because of these problems, Congress resolved to consider carefully legislation and regulations ``to ensure that small business concerns are not negatively impacted'' and to give priority to passage of ``legislation and regulations that enhance the viability of small business concerns.'' <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of 1992, Section 331(a)(3), Pub.

Congress also recognized that these funding problems are even more severe for minority and women-owned businesses, who face discrimination in the private lending market. For example, Congress explicitly found that businesses owned by minorities and women have particular difficulties in obtaining capital and that problems encountered by minorities in this regard are ``extraordinary.'' <FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>  A number of studies also amply support the existence of widespread discrimination against minorities in lending practices. In October 1992, the year prior to passage of the auction law, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an important and highly-publicized study demonstrating that a black or Hispanic applicant in the Boston area is roughly 60 percent more likely to be denied a mortgage loan than a similarly situated white applicant. <FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>  The researchers measured every variable mentioned as important in numerous conversations with lenders, underwriters, and examiners and found that minority applicants are more likely to be denied mortgages even where they have the same obligation ratios, credit history, loan to value and property characteristics as white applicants. The lending discrimination that occurs, the study found, does not involve the application of specific rules, but instead occurs where discretionary decisions are made. Based on the Boston study, it is reasonable to expect that race would affect business loans that are based on more subjective criteria to an even greater extent than the mortgage loan process, which uses more standard rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 112(4), 331(a)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 68 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mortgage Lending in Boston: Interpreting HMDA Data, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Working Paper 92&hyph;7 (October 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 99. Importantly, the Boston study also found that, because most loan applicants have some negative attributes, most loan denials will appear legitimate by some objective standard. Accordingly, the study stated, the lending discrimination that occurs is very difficult to document at the institution level, so legal remedies may be largely ineffective. Indeed, Congress had already attempted to address discriminatory lending practices through laws that bar discrimination in lending, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974 and amended many times since then. Congress, therefore, could reasonably assume, based on the Boston study, and its legislative experience regarding discriminatory lending practices, that minority applicants for licenses issued in spectrum auctions would face substantial (albeit subtle) barriers to obtaining financing. Any legal remedies, even if effective, would, moreover, come too late to ensure that minorities are able to participate in spectrum auctions and obtain licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

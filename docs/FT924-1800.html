			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Buy-out bid values Printech at IPounds 24m A MANAGEMENT buy-out bid has been launched for Printech International, the Dublin-based printing supplier to the computer industry, which obtained a full listing on the London and Dublin stock exchanges in May 1991. The cash offer of 77 1/2 p per share represents a 41 per cent premium over the last dealt price of 55p, and is worth a total of IPounds 23.7m (Pounds 25.4m). The bid is backed by DCC, the holding company headed by Mr Jim Flavin, which holds a 46.6 per cent stake. The buy-out will be carried out through Ochil, an 80 per cent owned subsidiary of DCC, in which Printech executive directors will have a 20 per cent minority interest. Their Printech shares will be replaced by Ochil shares, while remaining shareholders will receive cash or loan notes. A senior debt facility of IPounds 9m, arranged through the Bank of Ireland, will finance the cash part of the bid. By yesterday afternoon, 85 per cent of shareholders had accepted the offer. One who had not was Mr John Lawrie, the chief investment manager at Scottish Provident Ireland who called it a 'pathetically derisory offer'. 'This bid demonstrates how cheap Irish equities have become. It is unprecedented for a thriving company to be bought out at barely eight times earnings. This development represents a threat to the long-term viability of the Irish stock exchange if sound second-line companies can be taken out like this', he stated. Mr Flavin said: 'Institutional investors have shown little appetite for the smaller capitalised stocks. Neither the company nor the shareholders were benefiting from the listing'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Togolese people are now only four days away from  the legislative elections. Of course, the political parties are  deeply involved in the campaign. Nonetheless, there is a  dispute within the opposition. Here is Raphael Mbadinga:    [Begin recording] [Mbadinga] There is especially a war of  words among the opposition parties. Those who are in favor of  boycotting the 6 February elections are accusing the moderate  opposition of seeking to legitimize President Gnassingbe  Eyadema's government by taking part in the elections. According  to the radical opposition, President Eyadema's government has  not yet met all the conditions for truly democratic elections.  Zarifou Ayeva is critical of the attitude of the moderate  opposition here:    [Ayeva] Regarding my friends in the opposition who have  involved themselves unashamedly in this affair, I wonder how  they will find their way out. One only has to observe France's  position. Minister Roussin is already withdrawing his support  for the presidential elections. Tomorrow, faced with the  worsening situation on the ground, France will withdraw again.    [Mbadinga] The moderate opposition has reacted by saying,  and  I quote, the Togolese people are tired. They have had enough of  endless political transition. The legislative elections could  therefore be a solution to the Togolese crisis, unquote. These  petty squabbles of the opposition are publicly embarked upon in  the country's privately owned newspapers. [end recording]</p>

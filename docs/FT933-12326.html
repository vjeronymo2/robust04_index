			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Long View: Time for franc talking JOHN MAJOR might have been able to enjoy a quiet gloat over the renewed plight of the French franc this week if only he had not had one or two other small matters on his mind. The real irony of the Westminster battle, perhaps, is that it has been all about a treaty which is apparently in the process of being undermined by the foreign exchange markets, anyway. All the elaborate plans for a smooth and orderly transition to economic and monetary union are being tested to destruction as recession-hit Europe sado-masochistically raises its short-term interest rates: this week, they hit 8 per cent in Belgium, 10 per cent in France, and more like 20 per cent in Denmark and Spain. It is possible that the link between the franc and the D-mark can survive another weekend. But the fragility of the European Monetary System has been emphasised once again, and there is precious little indication that the lessons have really been taken on board. Economic craziness usually stems from well-meaning political imperatives. The French, in the post-war era, have always been committed to building close relationships with Germany: this was, after all, the original central purpose of the European Community. One result was the Maastricht treaty and the strategy of the franc fort which, through its unquestionable stability against the D-mark, would reflect political as well as economic convergence. The objective even transcended party politics and the Socialists duly trooped to political disaster in the April election, happy to have won the 'battle of the franc.' British attitudes have been vastly different, of course. In 1990, John Major put sterling into the exchange rate mechanism largely because there was a short-term problem with inflation, which had hit 10.9 per cent, and an associated crisis over 15 per cent interest rates. Inside the ERM, there was a chance that interest rates could come down; and, indeed, they did for a while. But once the British economy had slid into recession, much lower interest rates still were appropriate. By the summer of last year, a banking crisis loomed, making it highly dangerous to raise rates again to defend sterling's parity. A year later, we seem to have a re-run of the 1992 summer crisis, this time with the French under fire. Last year, the French economy was still expanding, but this time it is in quite deep recession and will contract by approaching 1 per cent in 1993, according to the latest forecasts. High interest rates are becoming not just awkward but dangerous. It has been all rather predictable; and yet, the EC Monetary Committee decided in May that there were no serious 'fault lines' in the EMS. But, they said, exchange rate adjustments should remain a crucial feature of the system and fundamental disequilibria should be recognised early. Moreover Germany, as the anchor country, should be ready to raise taxes rather than run an excessively tight monetary policy which would impose intolerable interest rates upon other member states. This is, needless to say, all pie in the sky. Run by dispassionate economists, the ERM might stand a slight chance; but, in practice, it is at the mercy of politicians who are not always known for being flexible and pragmatic. Should Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, increase taxes on German voters in order to help out the French or the Danes? It is a nice idea, but there is no political mechanism to make it happen. Extreme cyclical pressures have also exposed weaknesses in the system. Its flexibility has been limited mostly to one-off exchange rate adjustments intended to reflect permanent changes in competitiveness. But recent difficulties have not really concerned relative costs or inflation but have been about interest rates where Germany, for the time being, needs a significantly higher level than France or the UK. Purely temporary changes in exchange rates up and down would destroy the point of a fixed-rate system. But if inappropriate interest rates are applied for too long, the system must collapse, anyway. The right approach would have been to accept, about two years ago, that the economic shocks resulting from the re-unification of Germany required that the D-mark should be floated or, at any rate, permitted a sharp up-valuation. But the French analysis was that the German upheavals made it even more essential politically that the currency link should be maintained and re-emphasised. It has a crazy logic and you have to admire men of principle - but, usually, it is wiser to follow practical chaps. In the past few months, too, the example of the UK has become increasingly embarrassing for the French. When sterling was pulled out of the ERM last September, the continentals nodded knowingly: the feckless Brits had opted for the easy, inflationary way out once again. In fact, the British economy has responded encouragingly to the opportunities outside the ERM, and yesterday's figures of an upturn in second-quarter GDP were in stark contrast to what is going on in any country with a currency tied to the D-mark. Moreover, what goes down can come up again: the pound tumbled to 7.9 francs at one stage five months ago, but the rate is now near 9. Left to float, the franc could soon become much stronger than the mark. Perhaps the monetary committee members should compile another report. I believe they should conclude that progress towards an ever-closer union must be led by political initiatives, behind which can follow economic integration. Exchange rates should come second, not first. As for John Major, he might ponder on the response of sterling and the gilt market as he faced political extinction this week: they turned not a hair at the prospect of his fall. That is not much of a vote of confidence.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (18): Ill winds from Cape Canaveral and central Asia - Research and development THE mood at the annual meeting of Germany's aerospace industry federation in September was sombre, verging on suicidal, Quentin Peel writes. The venue was the splendid Petersberg hotel, overlooking Bonn from the mountains across the Rhine, but there was no other good news for the top executives, planners and customers of the industry. The space men were the gloomiest: they are facing the probability of drastic further cuts in Germany's international space programmes, such as the Hermes space shuttle and the Columbus space station, which will put many of their jobs in jeopardy. 'We have already stretched all our programmes to the absolute limit, by slowing down spending,' according to one senior manager. 'From now on it is going to hit our jobs. The latest American deal with the Russians will leave us out in the cold.' There was little of cheer for them from their colleagues in the defence and civilian aircraft industries. Deutsche Airbus is laying off 2,700 workers in Hamburg. And the Eurofighter 2000, the defence industry's prestige product, has just had its maiden flight postponed by another six months. Mr Wolfgang Piller, president of the federation, was apocalyptic. 'If you know the strategic importance of the aerospace industry, and then consider its public standing and apparent value in public opinion, and in wide sections of the political establishment, you can only conclude that there is a grotesque lack of proportion,' he said. 'In complete contrast to Japan, where aerospace has been declared a 'strategic industry', in Germany there is far more concern about the dying industries of the 19th century than there is recognition of the unique potential of aerospace.' Throughout German industry, and not just in aerospace, there is a growing fear that the country is becoming hostile to innovation. Mr Paul Kruger, the new minister of research and technology, spelt it out in a series of guidelines for future government policy last July. 'Fear of new technologies, rather than creativity, dominates German society,' he warned. 'Our greatest efforts are devoted to 'fencing off' innovation potential, rather than liberating and encouraging it. 'Our first reaction, even to quite small steps into technological virgin territory, is far too often hysteria, rather than justified vigilance, soberness, and confidence in our own creative power.' Yet the government is by no means blameless in according the research sector less than top priority. Mr Kruger, a new minister from east Germany, has been unable to prevent his budget from being frozen in nominal terms, at DM9.47bn, and therefore effectively cut. 'I am not content, but I can live with it,' he said. What he is trying to do now is focus his limited funds on key priorities - with environmental research, health, transport and energy top of his list. He wants to do far more to promote better links between the conservative basic research establishments, and German industry. He wants to stimulate more competition for cash. Above all he wants a debate on the benefits of new technology, rather than the dangers. As for the European Space Agency, to which Germany is supposed to pay DM1.17bn next year, Mr Kruger believes he can still negotiate 'significant savings'. According to Mr Frieder Meyer-Kramer, head of the Fraunhofer institute for systems technology and innovation (ISI) in Karlsruhe, per capita spending by the federal government fell from DM126 for western Germany in 1989, to DM117 for the united Germany in 1993. The growth of R and D spending fell from 7.1 per cent in 1981-89, to 3.4 per cent in 1989-91. As a proportion of gross domestic product, total public and private R and D spending has slipped from 2.88 per cent in 1989 to 2.66 per cent in 1991. Much of the decline can be attributed directly to the huge cost of unification, and the need to make cuts in virtually all other budgets. Nevertheless, Mr Meyer-Kramer, whose institute is the country's leading researcher in the fashionable field of technology foresight, fears that 'the crumbling technological competitiveness of the federal republic will simply worsen' if the spending decline continues. Mr Konrad Seitz, former head of the planning department at the foreign ministry, has argued that Germany is in danger of getting caught between the twin millstones of low wage competitors and high technology competitors, failing in both tasks. He argues for a huge effort to switch to 'new' technologies such as information technology, biotechnology, new materials, new energy sources, and aerospace. Mr Meyer-Krahmer disagrees. 'I don't believe this is sensible, because it makes no allowance for the traditional strengths of the German economy,' he says. 'Germany's strength is concentrated particularly in engineering, transportation, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. We should reinforce our traditional strengths through the application of new technologies, like information technology.' He says it still needs a considerable change in industrial thinking. 'The motor industry, for example, needs to see itself as a 'mobility industry', dedicated to the goal of providing all sorts of instruments and systems for ensuring mobility - with or without cars.' ISI published a Delphi report earlier this year on the expectations of German industry, suggesting 87 different 'critical technologies' on which Germany should concentrate in the future. A key element is that technologies can no longer be compartmentalised, because it is precisely in the borderline areas that the most exciting advances are being made, as in bio-informatics, and optical-electronics. Mr Meyer-Krahmer also defends the fragmented state of the German research industry, and rejects calls for bigger, more concentrated research centres. But if the fragmentation remains, there is a big need for better inter-disciplinary communication. He knows there will not be any more public cash for the immediate future. 'The cash tills of the federal government and the states are empty, when it comes to financing new costly initiatives in the coming years. Public financing of research has reached its limit.' One answer he suggests is increasing privatisation of the publicly-financed research industry. 'If we are thinking about mobilising more private capital for our transport infrastructure, why not for research infrastructure too? I am sure this will become a central theme in the coming years.'</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Little progress towards long-term job security The official unemployment figures may be falling, but there is little sign that long-term job security is returning in Norwich, Southampton or Manchester. While the pace of job-shedding may be slowing, employers see little need to take on additional full-time staff. Mr Rod Sellers of British Vita in Middleton said: 'Employers will tend to hire people on short-term contracts to cover short-term demand increases. None of us is confident enough to take on long-term staff. We tend to bring in part-time or temporary people instead.' Mr Geoff Walters of Southampton city council's economic development office said: 'Unemployment is falling but what appears to be happening is the steady growth of part-time jobs and in some cases the substitution of full-time by part-time jobs.' These local trends are confirmed at national level. The spring Labour Force Survey from the Department of Employment, which covers March to May, showed that part-time employment rose by 86,000 between winter and spring, while full-time employment fell by 8,000. Mr Walters sees the growth in jobs as primarily male, particularly in retailing and restaurants. In contrast, Ms Sandra Dineen of the enterprise services centre at Norwich city council has seen the fastest growth in female part-time work. Both southern towns were affected by the nature of the early 1990s recession, which had a much greater impact on the south of England than its 1980s predecessor. Ms Dineen said that while unemployment in Norwich as a whole was 1 1/2 percentage points below the national average 'to the north of the city there is a pocket where male unemployment is 22 per cent. This is the first time in any recession that unemployment has been a real problem'. Big employers in all three areas are still shedding staff, as illustrated in Manchester last week by electricity group Norweb's decision to cut 1,200 jobs in the next five years. The old-style certainties are fast disappearing. The new flexible labour market means employees must be prepared to change jobs, industries, working hours and pay structures. In such an uncertain world it is no surprise that the feel-good factor is elusive.</p>

The European, and especially the German, air and space industry  has experienced a crisis year. Even the near future does not  look much better. International airlines cancel about as many  aircraft contracts as they award. Military aircraft production  is suffering drastically reduced procurement, and the  governments in the United States and Japan are even more  concerned about these industries than is the German government.    The consequences for DASA (Deutsche Aerospace AG), under  whose roof almost 70% of the German aviation and space  industry  is concentrated, are now known. By 1996, DASA will shut down six  plants; it will give up three more sites and reduce its work  staff by another 10,300, down to a total of 70,000 remaining  positions. But even these drastic measures will only stabilize  the situation for Daimler's subsidiary under the most optimistic  premises.    In a conversation with Handelsblatt, Hartmut Mehdorn,  DASA's chairman for the aviation sector, said: "The measures we  have announced will only suffice if there is a positive decision  for the construction of the European fighter aircraft, if our  remaining development departments continue with the FLA (future  large aircraft) project, and if we can build 120 to 130 Airbuses  a year. If any one of these premises falls through, we shall  have other problems to confront and for which we will require  help."    A further setback looms for the already markedly reduced  production of the Airbus. The only current major, hotly  contested contract for commercial aircraft--Saudi Arabia's $6  billion U.S. dollar order for some 50 to 60 aircraft--will, in  the opinion of experts in the aviation field, go exclusively to  U.S. producers. As a result, production by the Airbus partners  (DASA, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Casa) will sink still  further because part of that contract had already been included  in their plans--over optimistically it now seems. But the  Europeans have still not abandoned all hope because President  Clinton's (who personally fought for this business) announcement  that Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas had won the entire contract  has not yet been officially confirmed. As Mehdorn puts it, "the  door is still not closed."    Cost of the Jaeger 90 Can Provoke New Arguments    More hopeful is the belief that Bonn will make a positive  procurement decision for the EFA fighter aircraft (Jaeger 90).  Since DASA's public announcement of a substantial reduction in  its work force, there have been an increasing number of signals  from Bonn indicating that no foreign-built competitor aircraft  will be purchased. However, the costs involved in the  construction of the high-tech Jaeger 90 could well provoke new  discussions. Mehdorn said: "On the basis of 1988 cost estimates,  the EFA will cost DM57.8 million. That amount represents the  `fly-away' cost for which the industry is responsible and which  really cannot change very much. We are not responsible for the  higher system costs, which include the logistics expenditures of  the customer over the entire service life." In DASA's opinion,  there is considerable room for savings in the system costs,  which have been put at about DM130 million. The cost  negotiations between Bonn and the EFA Consortium, set for 1995,  should provide fireworks both because of the inflation-driven  cost increases since 1988 as well as because of the greater  costs resulting from technical and bureaucratic delays.    If the decision is positive for EFA, then the production  capacities can--to a considerable degree--be fully utilized.  That, however, does not hold for the development departments.  Consequently, Mehdorn is relying on the "future large aircraft,"  a tactical military transport successor to the aging  German-French Transall aircraft. This new four-engine heavy  cargo aircraft (payload 25 tons), which will also be offered for  commercial use, must, in the opinion of DASA planners in Germany  and France, be ready by the year 2002. This means that the  program has to be approved in 1994.    Mehdorn wants to win Bonn over to the FLA and to this end  proposes a revolutionary way for the military to procure it. "We  want this to be different from the EFA process. We have proposed  to make this aircraft efficient and inexpensive from the  industrial point of view." We can do this if the governments  involved dispense with their conventional comprehensive,  detailed technical specifications and merely prescribe "what the  aircraft must be able to do." DASA and Aerospatiale, as well as  partners who join in the venture later, will develop, build, and  finance "structures as in the Airbus project, using available  Airbus components." The aid that would still be required from  the government could then be limited to DM25 million yearly, a  credit pledge, and a guaranteed procurement.    However, Mehdorn does not believe that even a successor to  the Transall will ensure the continued existence of a German  aviation industrial capability in the long term. To do that, the  entire financial support policy would have to be restructured  and intensified. He wants a yearly budget of at least DM300  million for "technology projects." In this way, Mehdorn  believes, the aviation and space industry could retain its  capability and participate in a market, which is estimated to  reach a volume of DM800 billion in the next 20 years. Moreover,  new aircraft programs would have to be indirectly subsidized, as  in the United States, because direct development subsidies would  be greatly reduced. "To match the United States in these  matters, we need an advance development program borne entirely  by the government," DASA's chairman asserts, estimating that  U.S. subsidies via NASA in 1993 and 94 amounted to about $1  billion U.S. dollars annually and another $1.6 billion dollars  annually via the Air Force.    Although no specific amounts of financial subsidies are  available in the case of Japan, the upcoming competitor against  the European aviation and space industry, DASA believes that the  accumulation of patents identified indicate that aviation and  space is Japan's "next strategic attack point." In order to meet  this attack, Mehdorn asserts that, in addition to financial  outlays, Germany needs an "integrated aviation support  structure, in which industry, the universities, the major  research institutes, the DLR (German Aerospace Research  Institute), and the various responsible ministries all  participate."    The Americans, especially Boeing, the world's leading  producer of commercial aircraft, which is already cooperating  closely with Japanese companies, are serving as midwives at the  birth of the Japanese aviation and space industry. So as not to  have that developing alliance become a competitor against the  European Airbus partners right from its inception, the head of  DASA, Juergen Schrempp, entered into an agreement with Boeing to  establish a joint working group, consisting of the Airbus  partners and Boeing, to make a feasibility study for one of the  most ambitious aircraft projects ever--a large 500 to 600-seat  aircraft. The feasibility study, which was ready in March,  concluded that "owing to the enormously high costs of  development, estimated at $10-12 billion U.S. dollars, a project  of this nature could only be undertaken on a worldwide basis. It  is still problematical as to whether joint trans-Atlantic  measures will follow from that conclusion." Mehdorn concludes:  "Just as there are opponents in this country to cooperation with  Boeing, there are opponents to cooperation with Europe at  Boeing."</p>

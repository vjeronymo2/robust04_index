			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: DEBT RATING LOWERED FOR MICROPOLIS CORP.  </P> <P> Micropolis Corp.'s "significantly diminished" cash levels have led Standard  &amp; Poor's to lower its rating of Micropolis' convertible subordinated  debentures -- a type of debt security -- to triple-C from single-B-minus.  </P> <P> Micropolis is a Chatsworth-based maker of computer disk drives that has been  struggling for the past year. The upshot of S&amp;P's action is that, should  Micropolis borrow money in the future, it likely would have to pay a higher  interest rate to compensate investors for the perceived increased risk of the  company's ability to repay its debts.  </P> <P> In announcing the rating cut, S&amp;P noted there "are no assets to be sold and  no operations that could easily be spun off to raise cash," and that its new  rating assumes "that alternate sources of liquidity will become available  beginning in 1990."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified Yemeni Socialist Party, YSP, </F> spokesman; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] We heard the statement made yesterday by the  Presidential Council during its consultative meeting, a  statement that can only be deemed as emanating from the council  of the ruling military family, which contradicts its stand on  unity, democracy, the building of the state, and the merger of  the Armed Forces. Justifying the military aggression against the  forces of the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, which began on 27 April and  continued today, did not require this revolutionary statement,  which proves to our people and the whole world that the speech  by the president in Sab'in Square was clearly directed toward  planning aggression and launching civil war, and was a  hysterical declaration of war against everyone. The Presidential  Council statement was issued to confirm this, by asserting that  the 'Imran operation was to be a lesson to be taken note of by  anyone with ambition.    The family's council has discarded its latest facade,  revealing its intention to reject the plan to merge forces,  which had been proposed by the defense minister four times over  the past few years. The Army merger would prevent the officers  of the al-Ahmar clan from continuing to dominate the Armed  Forces, and would expose the corruption and smuggling caused by  the looting of soldiers' pay and food, the threats and abuse of  soldiers, the creation of thousands of nonexistent positions in  every unit, and the gaining of control over most military  supplies.    The merger would have provided the Armed Forces with  professional capabilities, would have freed them from the circle  of family and tribal loyalties, and would have turned them into  a real shield to protect the homeland and its constitutional  institutions. It would appear that the ultimate aim of  rejecting the Armed Forces merger and returning their [word  indistinct] was to isolate and direct blows against them, as  happened in Abyan, Harf Sufyan and 'Imran. However, the heroic  defensive efforts of the 3d Brigade in responding to the  treacherous attack against it, and the foiling of successive  attacks upon it, will make the gangs of the ruling military  family pay a high price. At the end of the day they will suffer  disgrace and utter defeat.    What makes one anxious concerning the council statement is  what it says about democracy and the rule of law. The family  tramples on this every day, and boasts of having come to power  with its pistol and the property of others, so that there should  never again be democracy. It arrived to where it is now through  the blood of the leaders and heroes of Yemen, through  internecine tribal strife, and by setting the country ablaze  through a series of assassinations during the run up to the  elections. It spent millions in government and private funds to  corrupt and destroy the elections. It then set out to destroy  the results of the elections and undermine the unity of the work  of the constitutional institutions, while planning the  assassinations of its members and cadres, so as to return to  totalitarian presidential rule.    This is what it is attempting to restore by digging with its  bloodied fingernails, so as to discard all talk of  constitutional amendments and attempts to reform the regime.  After state institutions readied themselves to take up their  constitutional responsibilities, by establishing security,  stability, and by providing the people with a decent standard of  living, it poised itself to threaten the country's safety and  independence. Today it is working to cripple national consensus  and the pledge and accord document, which has received both  national, Arab, and international support, and which had led  everyone to hope that state institutions destroyed by the ruling  military family would be put right. That family has destroyed  everything in the country, so as to have the people, placed for  years under an autocratic military regime and controlled by a  partitionist oligarchy, returned unwillingly to such a system  through chaos, destruction, and war, while entrenching in the  minds of the people the idea that it was the family which had  brought unity and democracy.    The ruling military family decided to slaughter democracy on  its glorious anniversary, 27 April, when the president, in  Sab'in Square, declared indiscriminate war on everyone, on the  Yemeni Socialist Party -- which he had achieved unity with  through the dialogue commission -- and on the parties and  political forces of the nation.

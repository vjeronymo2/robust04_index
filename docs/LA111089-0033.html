			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALCOHOLISM  </P> <P> In response to your editorial ("It's What You Do That Counts," Oct. 31) I  commend state Sen. Art Torres and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre  for their courage in accepting their disease (alcoholism) and doing something  about it.  </P> <P> Now more than ever they remain my heroes of politics. They will serve as good  role models for young Chicanos in the barrios and wherever alcohol is  prevalent. If Chicanos win the war on drugs and alcohol then nothing can stop  them from achieving success in life.  </P> <P> JAIME B. VEGA  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

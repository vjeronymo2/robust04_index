			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Sweden plans tighter budget The Swedish government will have to intensify its savings drive if it is to meet its debt stabilisation targets, Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, warned yesterday. He said new measures would have to be outlined in next January's budget if state debt as a proportion of gross national product was to be stabilised by 1998. Although he was not specific, commentators say that up to SKr30bn (Pounds 2.5bn) of extra budget-strengthening measures may be needed to regain market confidence. The government has already promised budget savings of SKr100bn over the next five years. The shaky state of public finances has become the focus of heated political debate in the run-up to September's general election. This follows the decision by Skandia, the leading Swedish insurer, to boycott government bonds in protest at Sweden's budget deficit and fast-rising debt.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Hopes of saving failed hospital A private hospital which went into receivership after receiving Pounds 27m of public money could be saved, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish Secretary, said yesterday. Investors now believe the Health Care International medical centre at Clydebank might still be made to pay, he told MPs on the Commons Scottish Affairs committee. But Mr Lang all but ruled out the idea of the Pounds 180m development being handed to the National Health Service. HCI collapsed when it ran into severe cash-flow problems less than five months after opening. Mr Lang admitted yesterday that the government did not become aware of the scale of the problems facing HCI until the summer.</p>

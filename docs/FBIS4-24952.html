			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Zhongquan (4258 0112 3123): "Great Radiance </F> of Marxism in China Today"]    [Text] Abstract: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism for  today's China. The most fundamental aspect of this theory is the  answer it has provided to the question of what socialism is and  how to build socialism in the present historical context.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is an important development of the basic  theory of Marxism. This development mainly finds expression in  the following aspects: 1) the theory of initial stage of  socialism; 2) the theory of developing and emancipating the  productive forces and the "three-beneficial" criteria with "the  criterion of productive forces" at the core; 3) the theory of  planned commodity economy of socialism and socialist market  economy; and 4) the theory on the nature of socialism.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has steadfast faith in socialism and  puts all his mind on the socialist cause. He has put forward  many new ideas for the purpose of better adhering to Marxism and  adhering to the socialist orientation, emphasizing adherence to  the socialist orientation not just in terms of the primal system  but also in all his reform, opening up, and modernization  policies.    The 14th CPC National Congress highly appraised Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as "the latest achievement in the integration of  Marxism with China's reality and the Marxism in today's China."  The Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  as a historical record of the full-scale reform and opening up  of our country and the enormous changes in the process of  socialist modernization, actually reflects the process of  founding, enriching, perfecting, and developing this Marxist  theory of today's China based on the reform, opening up, and  modernization. Understanding a great ideological theory often  takes time. As we carry on studying the third volume of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in greater depth, we  will be able to perceive ever more keenly the great radiance of  this Marxist theory in today's China. [end abstract]  <H5>  I. </H5>   It has been nearly 80 years since scientific socialism  evolved from theory to practice. In our country, it has been  almost 40 years since the socialist system was established.  Over the past decades, the orientation of our building  socialism has been perfectly correct [wan quan zheng que 1346  0356 2973 4292] and we have made great achievements and changed  China's face. However, quite a number of errors have also been  made and we have encountered setbacks and tribulations. The  reasons are many. In a theoretical sense, a fundamental reason  is the failure to be completely aware of or clear about the  basic question of what Marxism is, what socialism is, and how to  build socialism.    We are communists and have practiced socialism for many  years  and yet we have not clearly understood the question of what  socialism is and how to build socialism. This seems hard to  understand when one first hears it but, on thinking it over, one  realizes that as far as our country is concerned, this is the  very crux of the matter. Taking class struggle as the key link  and failure to shift the focus of the party's work to  energetically developing the productive forces over a long  period of time made it impossible to put an end to the poverty  in the people's livelihood. Can one say we had a clear  understanding of this issue? Pursuing some economic and other  policies over a long period of time beyond what was feasible in  the respective historical phases restricted, and even seriously  dampened, the enthusiasm in production of the broad masses of  workers. Can one say we had a clear understanding of this  issue? Obviously, our socialist practice in the past carried a  certain subjectivity, one-sidedness, and blindness to a large  extent. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "Today, though  we are practicing socialism, in fact we are not up to it yet."    The argument that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism in today's  China can be proven from many angles. However, the most  fundamental point is that he answered the question of what  socialism is and how to build socialism in today's historical  context. What is today's historical context? Since the 1970's,  the historical context of this phase at least has the following  three distinct features: First, peace and development have  become the theme of our times. To boost the economy and improve  livelihood has become the common aspiration of all peoples.  Second, the scientific and technological revolution worldwide  is moving ahead at lightning speed. The economy of some  developed countries continues to prosper, further widening the  "south-north" gap and putting some underdeveloped countries in a  more disadvantageous position. Third, the rapid rise of the  economy of some burgeoning industrialized nations and regions  surrounding China has brought not only a rare opportunity but  also a grim challenge and pressure on China in its development.  After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, while summing up our country's experience of  successes and setbacks in practicing socialism and drawing on  the ups and downs, successes and failures which other countries  had experienced in practicing socialism, Comrade Xiaoping never  stopped seeking to understand and solve the question of how to  build socialism by referring to this new historical context.  Pursuing the policy of reform and opening up was to find a  correct answer to this question through practice. The putting  forward of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics was to take a further step in answering this  question from a theoretical approach.    By studying the volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, one can easily see that in the process of  developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the following five  unequivocal points while treating the misunderstandings on the  issue of understanding and building socialism: 1) poverty is  not socialism and excessively slow development is not socialism  either; 2) egalitarianism is not socialism and neither is  polarization; 3) socialism cannot be developed with rigidity and  self-closure, nor can it be developed by copying other countries  indiscriminately; 4) no democracy, no socialism; no legal  system, no socialism; and 5) socialism cannot be successful  without due attention to both material and spiritual  civilization. These five aspects were Comrade Xiaoping's  rethink about "what socialism is" from the perspective of  integrating theory with practice. They clarified the  distinction between scientific socialism and various distorted  forms of socialism. By clarifying what socialism "is not," he  actually answered the question of "what it is." Comrade  Xiaoping is not a "book worshipper" and has never studied  problems using a scholastic approach. Instead, he has always  grasped the core of an issue by closely integrating it with  reality. He has repeatedly emphasized: The Marxism we must  adhere to "must be the Marxism which integrates with China's  reality"; the socialism we must adhere to "must be the socialism  with Chinese characteristics which fits in with China's  reality." This understanding of socialism is in line with the  world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and is  a flexible application of the Marxist, scientific ideological  line. This correct understanding of socialism standardized the  path of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in all  dimensions. The 13th CPC National Congress in 1987 summed up  the experience in building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and made a macrosummary of the theory, thus  further clarifying this issue. Therefore, when meeting with  foreign guests in May 1988, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Our  mind used to be full of do's and don'ts but we have now broken  out of them" and "it is not until now that we have solved the  question of what socialism is."    Solving here means finding a "new road" and "putting forward  a series of new principles and policies." As Comrade Xiaoping  put it, its "focal point is to shift from taking class struggle  as the key link to centering round developing productive forces,  from closure to opening up, and from sticking to the old ways to  carrying out reforms in various fields." According to this idea  and on the basis of Comrade Xiaoping's talks on his inspection  tour of southern China in 1992, the 14th CPC National Congress  made a new summary of this theoretical system, clearly putting  forward the new concept of "Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics" and made an  appeal for "equipping the whole party" with this theory, thus  upgrading the understanding partywide of this new theory which  was considered "Marxism for today's China."  <H5>  II. </H5>   As "Marxism for today's China," Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has a  very rich content. Looking upon it as both Marxist and Chinese,  both socialist and contemporary, we can find the following  especially important aspects in which it is a development of  basic Marxist theory.    1. The theory of the initial stage of socialism.    This was a great creation made by the second-generation  central leadership collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the  core and is of great significance both in theory and in  practice. First, this theory is a profound analysis of the  national conditions of our country. It confirmed that to build  socialism in a context of backward productive forces and an  underdeveloped commodity economy, it is imperative to first  accomplish the task of industrialization and of the  commercialization, socialization, and modernization of  production. Thereupon, it clarified the the starting point in  formulating the party's line, principle, and policy and laid the  first theoretical cornerstone for the establishment of the  theoretical system of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Second, highlighting the initial stage of  socialism, considered quite a lengthy period, in the entire  history of socialism helped us improve our understanding of the  protracted and arduous nature of building socialism and overcome  the "left"-leaning impetuosity transcending the confines of each  historical phase which we had failed to overcome for decades.  Third, the theory of the initial stage of socialism is the  theoretical basis of the theory that the party's basic line  should be upheld unswervingly for 100 years. It takes at least  100 years to basically realize socialist modernization and  achieve the level of medium-developed countries. All this  period belongs to the initial stage of socialism. The party's  basic line is the basic line that takes care of the entire  initial stage and ensures the fulfillment of this goal. To  achieve this goal, the party's basic line must not be shaken.  Lastly, the theory of the initial stage of socialism has opened  up a new approach to building socialism for underdeveloped  countries. The specific national conditions of our country  determined that China could not directly conduct a socialist  revolution and that China's revolution must be carried out in  two phases; in the same way, they determined that after its  revolution succeeded, China could not directly copy the  formulation for building socialism in developed countries  conceived by Marx and Engels but must first go through an  initial stage of socialism. If the theory of new democracy  provided a model for the convergence between democratic  revolution and socialist revolution in underdeveloped countries,  the theory of the initial stage of socialism has provided  another approach to the convergence between the socialist  construction of an underdeveloped country and the socialist  construction in the developed phase.    2. The theory of developing productive forces,  emancipating productive forces, and the "three-beneficial"  criteria with the "criterion of productive forces" at the core.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics first of all confirms the idea that the  fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces  and lays special emphasis on their development. If finding an  answer to the question of what socialism is and how to build  socialism is the theme of the three volumes of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, the main answer to  this theme, namely, emphasizing the need to concentrate energies  on the development of productive forces and that "socialism with  Chinese characteristics is the socialism that continuously  develops social productive forces," is a main line running  through all three volumes of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. He used this idea to answer every question he  raised about what socialism is. He emphasized that "development  is the last word" and that we must rid ourselves of all  interference and strive to boost economic construction even if  it means we will have to toughen our scalp [ying zhe tou pi 4289  4192 7333 4122]; this is our overriding concern and "everything  has to give way to this overriding concern." He also suggested  that "the most important principle of socialism is to develop  production" and emphasized that the basic line of the party is  to "center round economic construction."    That "reform is also the emancipation of the productive  forces" is another new viewpoint in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.  There was no mention in Marxist and Leninist books regarding  whether or not the issue of emancipating the productive forces  would remain after the establishment of the socialist system;  and neither was any answer given to this question in Mao  Zedong's works. Through his rethink on the socialist practice,  Comrade Xiaoping believed that it does not fit in with the  context of a socialist country to only talk about developing the  productive forces without mentioning the need to emancipate the  productive forces through reform. Generally speaking, the basic  contradictions of a socialist society, production relations  versus productive forces and superstructure versus economic  base, which are two aspects of the unity of opposites, basically  conform with each other. However, under special circumstances,  the two sides can also experience sharp conflict. For example,  the old system may seriously restrict the development of the  productive forces and wrong lines and policies may cause  repeated setbacks to economic construction. Therefore, Comrade  Xiaoping suggested emancipating the productive forces through  reform and that "we should be inclusive when talking about  emancipating the productive forces and developing them. Here,  "being inclusive" means that the socialist system in our country  actually shoulders the dual task of developing the productive  forces and emancipating them. This further deepened our  understanding of the movement of the basic contradictions of  socialism and developed the socialism theory of Marxism,  Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought.    The "criterion of productive forces" is a Marxist concept  with a well defined meaning put forward by the 13th CPC National  Congress. In his talks made during his inspection tour of  southern China, Comrade Xiaoping developed the theory of the  "criterion of the productive forces" into the theory of the  "three benefits" criteria. We consider it a development for the  following reasons: First, it not only upholds the theory of the  "criterion of productive forces," (being the most important of  the "three benefits"), but also makes more concrete and  practical the abstract theoretical form of the theory on the  "criterion of productive forces." The second and third  "benefits" are the extension, supplement, and specification of  the first "benefit." Second, in terms of epistemology, the  theory of the "three-benefit" criteria is more comprehensive.  As productive forces develop and the overall national strength  increases, does it mean the people's living standards will  definitely improve accordingly? The dramatic changes in some  socialist countries indicate that the answer is no.  Theoretically, they should go hand in hand but, in practice,  there is often a contrast [fan cha 0646 1567]. In view of such  historical lessons, proposing the theory of the "three-benefit"  criteria will be more conducive to the consolidation and  development of the socialist system. Third, it embodies an  understanding of the principal social contradiction in our  country at present more clearly and integrates the criterion of  productive forces with the criterion of people's interests. At  present, the principal social contradiction of our country is  that between the ever growing demand of the people for materials  and culture and backward social production. The way it is  written, the theory of "three-benefit" criteria not only  highlights the fundamental task of putting development of the  productive forces in the first place but also emphasizes the  need to implement it at the basic point of improving people's  living standards. In other words, it puts whether or not  something is conducive to improving people's living standards  together with whether or not it is conducive to developing the  productive forces, making it a criterion for measuring the  correctness and performance of the party's work. This is the  integration of the criterion of productive forces with the  criterion of people's interests. In practice, it is more  conducive to reflecting the party's aim of serving the people  wholeheartedly and the socialist nature of our country which  puts the people's interests first.    3. Theory on socialist planned commodity economy and  socialist market economy.    These were epoch-making breakthroughs in the traditional  socialist economic theory and can also be considered two  revolutionary structures [jian gou 1696 2845] of Marxist  political economy by the second-generation central leadership  collective with Comrade Xiaoping at the core. As far as the  social-economic form is concerned, for a long time, it was  believed that socialism was a society of product economy and its  management system follows that of the planned economy. From  Lenin to Mao Zedong, though this opinion was changed somewhat in  theory and practice, there was no thorough breakthrough. The  reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee has been "an earth-shaking cause, a  great experiment, a revolution." As a summary of the experience  of the great revolutionary practice, the "Decision By the CPC  Central Committee on the Reform of the Economic Structure," made  by our party in October 1984, put forward the formulation that  the socialist economy "is a planned commodity economy on the  basis of public ownership." For the first time, it admitted  that the commodity economy is an intrinsic, innate, and  essential requirement for socialist economic development and  laid a theoretical foundation for making a series of major  economic policies in China's overall reform and opening up.  With the surging tide of reform and opening up, the conflict  between planning and market in the system and the mechanism of  economic management has become progressively intense. While  equating the planned economy with socialism, long-standing  traditional values also mixed up the market economy with  capitalism. It has been very difficult to change this fixed  concept. Comrade Xiaoping has made a dozen speeches since 1979,  repeatedly pointing out: "There is no fundamental contradiction  between socialism and the market economy," that socialism can  also practice the market economy, that "productive forces can be  better emancipated" by integrating planning with the market, and  that "it is untrue that practicing a bit of the market economy  means following the capitalist road." In his talks during his  inspection tour of southern China in 1992, he once again pointed  out that planning and market "are both economic means" and "not  an essential distinction between socialism and capitalism."  Later, through the 14th CCPC National Ccongress, our party  officially established the theory of the "socialist market  economy." The "Decision By the CPC Central Committee on Certain  Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market  Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, further enriched and developed this  theory. The founding of the theory of socialist planned  commodity economy and the theory of socialist market economy are  the "latest achievements" in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a product of  the integration of Marxism with China's reality. They are the  chief markers of his theory reaching the height of Marxism.    4. The theory on the nature of socialism.    This was a new viewpoint presented by Comrade Xiaoping  during  his southern China tour. How should we look at the theory of  "the nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition? In  my opinion, this new definition, compared with all previous  definitions, has at least the following four merits: First, it  highlights the object of the effort to dispel chaos and restore  order. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Concentrating energies  on the development of the productive forces on the basis of  adhering to the four cardinal principles" is the "most  fundamental effort to dispel chaos and restore order." It is  obviously in view of the grave historical lessons that the  theory on "the nature of socialism" emphasizes the need to  develop the productive forces. Second, it highlights creativity  which contains new ideas. Comrade Xiaoping believes that it was  incomplete to talk about developing the productive forces in the  context of socialism in the past without talking about  emancipating the productive forces through reform; we should  talk about both emancipating and developing the productive  forces. Summing up the two tasks of socialism, namely,  emancipating the productive forces and developing them, the  nature of socialism not only underlines the role of the  productive forces issue but also underlines the significance of  reform. Third, it highlights the dynamic nature of socialist  development and the gradual fulfillment of the nature of  socialism. Socialism is a very long historical phase, divided  into the initial stage and other stages, and is in a constant  state of change and reform. Fulfilling the nature of socialism  is a historical process. It cannot be achieved soon after the  socialist system is established, nor can the deadline be  categorically set for the conclusion of the initial stage of  socialism. "Eventually reaching common prosperity" embodies  this historical feature. This is conducive to overcoming the  long-standing tendency toward "egalitarianism" and stabilizing  the party's current basic policies while preventing  polarization. Fourth, it highlights the ultimate goal in  pursuing and developing socialism. Volume three of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping contains many  expositions on the goal of socialist construction. The ideas  are clearly presented and are mainly concerned with "developing  production" and "common prosperity," culminating in the  conclusion that developing production also has the purpose of  eventually achieving common prosperity. The theory on "the  nature of socialism," this new summing-up definition, fully  reflects this ultimate goal.    III.    As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is certainly "Marxist" and "socialist." Comrade  Xiaoping has firm faith in Marxism and spares no effort either  of thought or action in the socialist cause. A thorough  understanding of volume three of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping can easily make us see that many of his new  thoughts are aimed at upholding Marxism and socialism in a  better way. There are enormous elaborations on this point, the  following few of which are particularly outstanding:    1. The emphasis that Marxism is a scientific theory  --"We cannot desert our theoretical lineage!"    Comrade Xiaoping has a profound understanding of Marxism and  an uncanny power to grasp and use it. Whenever he asks, and  answers, what socialism and Marxism are, he starts from the  basic tenets and spells out briefly, precisely, accurately, and  plainly the theoretical foundation for the series of reform and  opening up policies. He said on his southern inspection tour:  "We have been talking about Marxism all our lives. Marxism, in  fact, is not at all esoteric. It is quite down-to-earth and  simple."    Comrade Xiaoping lays much emphasis on the fact that his  thought has only inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism-Mao  Zedong Thought. In August 1991, he told some central  comrades-in-charge: "We have not dropped Marx, Lenin, nor Mao  Zedong in pursuing reform and opening up and focusing our work  on economic construction." He firmly opposes the alleged  opposition between his thought and theory and  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. When American reporter  Mike Wallace asked about this, he pointed out explicitly: "I am  a Marxist and I have always followed basic Marxist principles"  and while his thought "differs in some aspects from Mao Zedong's  concepts, the two share certain principles." This explains the  relationship between Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and Marxism but not  between his theory and Mao Zedong's, which is more complicated.  Here we need to make two distinctions. One, following the  "Resolutions on Certain Problems in Party History Since the  Founding of the Nation" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of  the 11th CPC Central Committee, we separated Mao Zedong Thought  from his mistakes in his later years. Mao Zedong Thought refers  specifically to the theories and principles proved correct by  practice and excludes his mistakes in his old age. Two, we  distinguish between basic theoretical principles and certain  specific policies or concepts. What Comrade Xiaoping describes  as "some difference" between his and Mao Zedong's ideas refers  mainly to the difference between his ideas and Mao Zedong's  erroneous thoughts and some of his individual policies in his  old age. Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics was founded on the negation of Mao  Zedong's mistakes in his old age. Moreover, even if they were  both right in policies or ideas in a given circumstance,  different historical conditions and different social exposure,  cultural characters, and intellectual perspectives between the  two would have resulted in different options taken -- hence the  "difference." However, this is not the main thing. When  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is compared with the basic principles of  Mao Zedong Thought, we find that "the two are identical [yi yang  0001 2876] after all" and proceed along the same lines. There  are obvious common points and continuity between the two in the  general line of thinking (both affirm combining the general  principles of Marxism with China's specific realities),  theoretical character (both stress choosing one's own path,  opposing blind faith in the canon, and upholding Chinese  characteristics), theoretical approaches (seeking truth from  facts, case analysis for individual cases, and so on), and  theoretical content (compare certain viewpoints under the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics with related  viewpoints in Mao Zedong Thought). Of course, we cannot simply  identify one with the other, holding that Mao Zedong Thought  already contains the view of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. This does not accord with reality and is  another kind of partiality. As explained above, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's building socialism with Chinese characteristics is  grand theory; we can even say that it took Mao Zedong Thought to  a new dimension. A new stage in historical development  necessarily demands a parallel new phase in theoretical  development. Once we recognize that the historical development  following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee had moved to a new stage, the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics as a scientific summation  of historical experience must necessarily develop Mao Zedong  Thought and take it to a new stage.    2. The emphasis that socialism is a good system; and  the pursuit of reform and opening up is aimed at consolidating  and developing socialism.    For some, the question whether or not China should choose  the  capitalist or socialist road has never been properly solved.  This, coupled with confusing propaganda by overseas hostile  forces, has enabled a few to cherish the hope of edging China  toward capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping's attitude toward this is  very clear: He remains firm throughout in criticizing this  mistaken tendency and has explained from varied angles and  perspectives, why China cannot pursue capitalism and why only  socialism can save and develop China. His analysis is based on  modern Chinese history and a comparison between the two systems  and he approaches the issue in a global context, explaining it  in terms of peace and development for mankind. He points out:  China's pursuit of socialism is also a key issue for the world;  "if a 1-billion-strong China took the capitalist road it would  be a disaster for the world"; China shows its sense of  responsibility for one-fifth of humanity and "might make greater  contributions to mankind" in opting for a socialist path.    Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics upholds socialism not only in matters  concerning fundamental structures but also in all the policies  on reform, opening up, and modernization. Comrade Xiaoping has  pointed out repeatedly: "The four modernizations we pursue are  socialist in nature because only socialism is cohesive enough";  "the enlivening of the domestic economy and opening up to the  outside world we are talking about develop under the principle  of socialism"; "the absorption of certain good elements from the  capitalist society is done to complement the development of a  socialist society." This is why he has been consistently tough  on bourgeois liberalization. He believes that "bourgeois  liberalization" is a political concept with a definite meaning  which is identical to "taking the capitalist road." Any  tendency which dilutes or blurs the political content of this  concept is harmful. This helps us understand why, during the  entire process of reform and opening up, he, as he put it  himself, "has talked most of the time about opposing bourgeois  liberalization and I have been firmest about it" and "on this I  have never yielded."    3. The emphasis that it takes the unceasing and  unyielding effort of several or even dozens of generations to  achieve long-term peace and stability in Chinese society.    Socialism in China is a hard-won achievement. What must we  do to consolidate and develop the present status and achieve the  heroic objective of catching up with medium-developed countries  in per capita GNP by the mid-21st century? This has been a key  problem long on the mind of Comrade Xiaoping. He has been  occupied above all by two issues: One, keeping the party's  basic line and policies unchanged for a long time and two,  grooming and selecting successors from whom to form a good  central collective leadership. With these two problems solved,  "China will be as steady as a mountain" and "socialist China  will be unconquerable."    The problem of keeping the party's basic line and basic  policies unchanged for a long time is a theme running through  volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and  is expounded and explained scores of times in the book. This  shows that this thinking of his has taken a long time to mature  and is highly consistent. More striking is the fact that, after  the 1989 political turmoil, he not only did not "change course  nor what he advocated" but dwelt on the subject even more  frequently, showing the extraordinary firmness of his thinking.  On his southern inspection tour he stressed that "the basic  line must be kept unchanged and is untouchable for the next 100  years." Whoever wants to change this line "will be struck  down." Given the consistency and firmness of his thinking, this  emphasis of his is a logical necessity. In May and September  1989, he talked about "the political assignment" to the party.  Keeping the party's basic line and basic policies unchanged for  the next 100 years is the most important political assignment he  has given to the whole party and people of the whole country,    Comrade Xiaoping also talked a great deal about selecting,  promoting, and grooming successors, because the political task  of keeping the party's basic line and policies unchanged for a  long time requires organizational guarantees, specifically in  the form of the passing of leadership from cadres of the older  generation to younger cadres. He said on his southern  inspection tour: "In a certain sense, the key to a sound  pursuit of Chinese affairs, a sustained effort at socialism,  reform, and opening up; speedier economic development, and  long-term peace and stability for the country, lies in the  personnel." "Personnel are what we have to rely on when we talk  about keeping the party's basic line in command for the next 100  years and long-term peace and stability. What really determines  the whole situation is personnel." This is something we cannot  just take light-heartedly. He also said: "If ever there is a  problem with China, it will most probably come from the party."  How profound this observation was! When this problem is  solved, and when generations of leaders can be selected,  promoted, and groomed through a relatively perfect system and  mechanism, who can guide various tasks with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in a comprehensive and accurate fashion, uphold  the party's basic line and policies comprehensively and  correctly and keep them unchanged, remain firm throughout in  upholding the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people,  work for the benefit of the people in a down-to-earth and  sustained fashion, the broad masses of the people, who are  masters of the historical fate of this country, will certainly  feel that "after all, socialism and reform and opening up are  good and that our cause will remain relevant forever!"    As the Marxism for contemporary China, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a theoretical system with an open structure.  As explained above, its greatness lies in its ability to anchor  socialism in the contemporary world and make it more open, more  receptive to all the civilized achievements of human society,  including absorbing and digesting all advanced knowledge and  skills embodying the laws of modern and socialized production in  contemporary capitalist countries, turning them into nutrients  for socialism, hence endowing the embattled world's socialist  cause with new vitality and a bright future. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is a brilliant paradigm of how Marxism can be  integrated with China's practical conditions and socialism with  contemporary realities. Of course, it has not, and cannot,  ended the search for an understanding of how China constructs,  consolidates, and develops socialism. The theory will be  continuously enriched, perfected, and developed in the process  of studying new situations, solving new problems, and being  verified by practice. This is precisely its brilliance and  greatness.</p>

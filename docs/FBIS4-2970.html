			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (XINHUA) -- Some Hong Kong  newspapers criticized the report released yesterday by the  British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee as a  "negative example", "self-contradictive policy" and "challenging  report" in editorials published today.    "WEN WEI PO" said the report rendered a firm support to  Chris  Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, and his political  constitutional reform scheme. It also declared that the British  side would take its own action in the latter half of the  transitional period.    This showed the intention of the British Government not to  adhere to the principles of the Basic Law, and to refuse to work  for a smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and try to put up  new obstacles for the formation of the future government of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.    The aim of pursuing a tough policy toward China by the John  Major administration is to win support of the British Parliament  and alleviate its domestic pressure, the paper said.    The "HONG KONG COMMERCIAL DAILY" said, analysing suggestions  raised in the report, one can see the British government is  self- contradictive in its policy toward China.    For instance, it said, the report admits China will turn  into  an economic power in the next century and there is a need to  keep a good relationship with China on the one hand, but advises  the British Parliament to develop ties with Taiwan on the other  hand.    It is known to anyone that China opposes the policy of "two  Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". If the British Government  get in touch with Taiwan, its relationship with China will sure  to fall back.    In addition, the report showed a wish to solve the  Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong, but at the same time  supported Governor Patten in his bid to deliver to the  legislative council his political reform bill, which China  strongly opposed, the paper added.    The "TA KUNG PAO" described the report as a "challenging  report". It interfered in China's internal affairs without using  any packing, it said.    It will be fruitless for the British Foreign Affairs Select  Committee to cover up the fact that the British side sabotaged  the Sino-British negotiations on the 1994-94 electoral  arrangements in Hong Kong, the paper said.</p>

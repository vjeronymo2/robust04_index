For this reason, the dynamics of the effects  of three nootropic drugs, i.e., piracetam, meclofenoxate, and  mexidole, on the brain activity of a total of 32 nonpedigree  male rats (weight, 180 to 250 g) was studied. The animals in  group 1 received intraperitoneal [IP] injections of piracetam in  a dose of 500 mg/kg daily for 2 months, the group 2 animals  received IP injections of meclofenoxate in a dose of 70 mg/kg  daily for 5 months, and the group 3 animals received IP  injections of mexidole in a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 5  months. The control rats received a physiological solution under  analogous conditions. The studies of the bioelectric activity of  the rats' brains were carried out when the rats were wide awake  and unrestrained. Five to 6 days before the neurophysiological  experiments, the rats were anesthestetized with nembutal (50  mg/kg IP), and monopolar Nichrome electrodes were implanted into  the sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocampus of their brains.  Fourier spectral analysis of encephalograms [EEGs] of the rats'  brains was performed by using a Berg-Fourier Analyzer (O.T.E.  Biomedica, Italy) and an analysis period of 4 minutes 8 seconds.  Bioelectric activity was recorded in 5-minute segments before  and after (for 2-3 hours) injection of the drugs. The studies  established that prolonged injection of piracetam results in an  intensification and stabilization of the dominant power peak of  the _th_-range (4-8 Hz) and a simultaneous decrease in the  power  of the _a_-range (8-13 Hz). A statistically significant  decrease  was noted in the fast-wave _b_[.sub]1[/]-range (13-20 Hz) of  the power spectra of the cortex EEGs. In the hippocampus, on the  other hand, piracetam induced a decrease in the relative power  of the _th_-range, ahthough it still exceeded the values found  for intact animals. At the same time there was a decrease in the  power of the _a_-range and an increase in the power of the  _b_-range (13-32 Hz) of the spectra of the EEGs of the  hippocampus when compared with the values obtained for one-time  administration of piracetam in intact animals. Discontinuation  of piracetam did not cause any drastic changes in bioelectric  activity or in the respective power spectra of the EEGs of both  brain structures studied. Prolonged administration of  meclofenoxate was found to significantly alter the structure of  the EEG power spectra, especially in the case of EEGs recorded  for the cortex. Not only was the primary peak in the  _th_-intensified, but the power of the _a_-range increased  significantly as well because of the appearance of a pronounced  dominant rhythm with a frequency of 10-12 Hz. High-amplitude  fluctuations in bioelectric activity (i.e., fluctuations with  the same frequency) developed as well. The appearance of a new  peak with a frequency of 10-12 Hz was characteristic for nearly  half the animals after one-time administration of meclofenoxate.  Discontinuation of meclofenoxate resulted in an intensification  of the dominant peak and a lengthening of the period of  high-amplitude discharges (frequency, 10-12 Hz) in the  bioelectric activity of the rat brains' cortices. Chronic use of  mexidole was found to increase the dominant peak in the  _th_-range more markedly than in the case of one-time  administration of the drug. An increase in the  _b_[.sub]1[/]-range of frequencies was another characteristic  effect of prolonged mexidole use. Discontinuation of mexidole  resulted in significant changes in the bioelectric activity and  power spectra of the EEGs recorded for both the cortex and  hippocampus. High-amplitude fluctuations that gradually  increased and subsided (frequency, 8-12 Hz) appeared in the EEGs  recorded for both the cortex and hippocampus but especially for  those of the cortex. Prolonged injection enhanced the effect of  all three drugs as compared with the effects achieved after  one-time administration. The EEG-level effects of the three  drugs were confirmed by observations of the rats' behavior: All  three drugs increased the rats' levels of wakefulness and  excitability.

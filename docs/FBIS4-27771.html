			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Discussion by Kyoto University Professor Emeritus Mitsuharu </F> Ito and Tokyo University Professor Kazunori Ishiguro; place and  date not given]    [Text] What Is "Market Access"?    [Mitsuharu Ito] I've maintained for some time that economic  problems between the United States and Japan should be settled  through talks according to international rules. But among  Japan's economists this view seems to be in the minority--that  is, with the exception of Ryutaro Komiya.    Of course international rules are quite different from  domestic laws and tend to carry little weight, I know. But  that's all the more reason we have to try to follow them and  make them more effective. I don't believe Japan has in any way  been trying to do this recently. Rather, it has been doing the  opposite in trying to resolve its current trade problems.    This was the case with regard to the semiconductor dispute  and it is also the case this time in regard to mobile  communications. In fact, I feel there's even a certain danger in  the way the issue was resolved.    To take life insurance, for example. The United States is  making certain demands on Japan. Americans see that foreign  firms have a 4.2-percent share of Japan's insurance market.  Compared to other OECD countries (excluding Japan, of course),  this share is just too small, particularly when compared with  the European Community countries. They want it raised to a  two-digit figure. This is only fair, they say.    So, using this as proof that Japan's market is closed, they  say we should introduce the broker system into Japan. It's a  system we don't currently have, but it is a characteristic of  the U.S. life insurance market. What Japan has instead is a  system where insurance companies set up their own insurance  agencies to represent them. In the United States, on the other  hand, consumers go to a broker, tell him what kind of insurance  coverage they want and ask him to find a good company to  represent them. Based on this difference in their systems,  Americans complain that Japan's market is closed. Therefore,  they say there are obstacles preventing their access to Japan's  markets.    This same kind of claim can be seen in recent negotiations  between Japan and the United States over other matters.    I'd like to ask Mr. Ishiguro, then, what exactly does  "market  access" mean?    [Kazunori Ishiguro] "Market access" came into vogue about  the  mid-1980's. It's a term that still hasn't been formally defined.  To be frank, my own personal view is that [Americans] are very  cleverly playing on the symbolic meaning of the term to get  [Japan] to swallow their demands and somehow think it  understands what the term means.    At the Uruguay Round of GATT talks, people were speaking  about "market access negotiations" as if everyone just naturally  knew what was meant. But after a while, it was used to include  so many different demands, one couldn't tell anymore what it  meant.    In the life insurance example we just took up, the term was  "equitable market access." In the case of mobile communications,  the term people are using is "comparable market access." What  these terms mean, in effect, is: if Japan has a 20-percent share  of our market, then we should have a 20-percent share of Japan's  market. It's that kind of simplistic argument. But rather than  rebutting the other side's argument point by point on its  theoretical merits, we cave in and make concessions. So the  situation keeps deteriorating until we're at the point where we  are today.    At the recent Uruguay Round of talks, final steps were being  taken to create an international body, the World Trade  Organization (WTO), to take a comprehensive approach to matters  concerning intellectual property rights and trade in goods and  services. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time the term  "market access" appears in a trade agreement concerning services.    Services aren't the only area that will be affected,  however.  The entire trade issue will be affected. And what would simply  have been negotiations to raise tariffs has been made over into  market access talks. Japan doesn't usually catch on fully to  that kind of subtle difference. So, the idea of market access  has somehow gotten mixed in with the idea of nontariff barriers,  which came out of the Tokyo Round [of GATT talks], and rather  than just eliminating tariffs, we begin talking about  eliminating all kinds of other barriers. Finally, the emphasis  shifts and we're employing the concept of "market access."    What we have to do, I think, is look back over GATT's long  history and with the disciplined eye of the historian and  scholar see whether this direction was really part of the  natural course of events and whether the argument that has been  developed, particular the argument the Americans have developed  (the European Community is arguing a similar position) really  has any merits to support it.    Another thing. When did this argument about "unfair trade"  develop? According to some people, it is one of the major  principles informing the GATT agreement. But the words "fair" or  "unfair" are never directly mentioned in the original GATT  agreement. Article 6 of the agreement establishes certain steps  that can be taken against violators of antidumping rules or  against [government] subsidies, but gradually more things were  added to expand the content of Article 6, and it came to be  linked to debates on unfair trade.    Then, the differences in the various economic systems got  emphasized and countries were told to "Americanize" their ways.  But there were also deep-rooted reasons for countries to resist  this "harmonization" of their respective systems, so naturally,  it wasn't possible to change everything over to the American way.    Americans consider Japan its easiest target, and Japan has  been their first line of attack. Japan doesn't understand this  and, being solicitous toward the United States, quickly makes  concessions. That attitude on Japan's part, wouldn't you say,  has contributed to the present state of confusion the world is  in.    I think we should approach U.S.-Japan trade problems in the  same way we would a damage suit. If Japan just says "yes" to the  other party's demands, no matter how unreasonable, without any  opposition, then that means Japan agrees to accept the other  party's demands and the case is closed. In effect, it is  acknowledging that the other party was right.    What Are GATT's Principles?    [Ito] With regard to the differences in our systems... if we  go back in history to the formation of the International  Monetary Fund (IMF), we'll see, just as we see in GATT's case,  that it was right after the end of World War II, and people  believed that their future economies would be very closely tied  to the economies of other countries. People also reflected on  the situation before the war. They asked themselves: could the  sort of conflicts that arose in the past when different economic  systems came into contact have been avoided? If so, let's create  the kind of mechanisms that will prevent those conflicts in the  future, they said.    So, what emerged is the so-called national treatment  principle which is found in Article 3 of the GATT agreement. In  other words, this means you extend the same freedom you extend  to your country's own companies, citizens, and property to  foreign companies, citizens, and property, without  discrimination. This, I think, is one of the principles  contained in GATT. Recently, however, this principle seems to be  coming apart.    If you can imagine, there are even some Japanese theorists  who are now following the same logic as the Americans'--namely,  the logic that sees whatever is "American" as "universal." U.S.  demands ignore the principle of treating foreigners in the same  way one treats nationals--the principle established by GATT's  founding fathers--in favor of the principle of mutuality.    [Ishiguro] I think there are several issues here. First of  all, and here I'm thinking primarily of the insurance problem,  bilateral rules haven't been established by most countries with  regard to financial services, including insurance, and the trade  services agreement, which was recently drawn up, still doesn't  officially go into effect for awhile. But that agreement was  drawn up at the Uruguay Round to move international trade in  services as close as possible to GATT's basic principle  regarding trade in goods. So, the "national treatment" principle  you were talking about also becomes one of the agreement's basic  principles.    GATT was set up, from a legal point of view, according to  the  principle of equal opportunity, which combines both the  principles of national treatment and most-favored-nation  treatment.    [Ito] "Liberalization," the term we hear so often, doesn't  actually appear in GATT but we can find it here [in the  principle of equal opportunity] if we look.    [Ishiguro] "To liberalize" means to set free of  restrictions.  It means affording countries an equal opportunity. Article 6,  which I mentioned earlier, is odd given how GATT was set up on  the basis of equal opportunity. It seems to me that the original  intent of Article 6 has been gradually broadened until we have  the situation we have today.    In GATT, we also find the idea of mutuality, which was  mentioned. In the past, this principle was thought of in terms  of reciprocity, or the idea of countries making mutual  concessions with regard to tariffs. But here, too, the idea of  mutuality changed along with the emergence of debates about  unfair trade or the kind of results-oriented approach we find in  demands to secure a market share.    I think these latest developments are wrong and we should  return to our original point of departure.    Another term that is used a lot is "borderless economy." It  doesn't necessarily mean that we will have a uniform, homogenous  set of laws that will apply universally to every country,  regardless of national boundaries. "Harmonization" is another  term in popular use. But the fact that the term is used in a  different way in Japan than it is in the United States concerns  me very much.    If we are going to think about world harmony, then we should  get to the true meaning of "harmonization." We ought to find it  has an entirely different meaning. Compared to the efforts being  made toward harmonization based on comparative law, Americans  are coming from an entirely different place, with American rules  reflecting the U.S. desire to export. I think this [difference  in perspective] is what's behind U.S.-Japan trade frictions and  in the background of the Uruguay Round.    Danger of Reverse Discrimination    [Ito] The term "market access" seems to me to have been very  cleverly fabricated. It carries the nuance that consumers can  have access to whatever goods and services they want whenever  they want them. By drawing on that nuance, the term leaves the  impression that an economic system without adequate market  access isn't to the consumers' benefit. Like a conjurer, it  seems to cast this spell over us. But it's not clear what the  term really means.    Another point--the issue of what is "fair" or "unfair." When  a foreign enterprise can't enter another country's market  because their systems differ, I don't think the problem should  necessarily be considered in terms of "fairness" or "unfairness."    The claim that something is "unfair" because of such  differences is really a demand by latecomers to get a larger  share of the market. It seems to me to be nothing more than a  call for reverse discrimination. I think "reverse  discrimination" is one of those words we'll find tucked away in  the demand for market access.    [Ishiguro] Yes, just as you point out. There's very symbolic  meaning to the fact that the concept of market access should  have come from the area of trade in services. Systems in various  countries differ markedly in this area. Where services are a  government monopoly--for example, this was the case in  communications--even nationals were excluded from the field. If  we were to afford foreigners "national treatment"--in other  words, if we were to treat them the same way we treat our own  citizens--then foreigners couldn't enter the field either. Even  with national treatment, there would be no improvement in market  access. "Market access" in such a case, then, means forcing open  your trading partner's market in order to get in, so the term,  from the start, goes beyond the idea of national treatment.    [Ito] How is this issue being resolved in the Uruguay Round  of talks?    [Ishiguro] The services trade agreement was framed in such a  way as to recognize market access. And this became one of the  major focuses of debate. Fortunately, Japan's young bureaucrats  persevered in Geneva, and I think we can safely say the term,  "market access," has been fleshed out and stripped in principle  of the idea of numerical quotas in the final form of the accord  proper.    However, in the case of financial services, a codicil of  sorts has been added--an "article of agreement recognizing (and  committing to) the deregulation of financial services. In  effect, it says: Even in policies meant to be nondiscriminatory,  reverse discrimination [preferential treatment of nonnationals  over nationals] is sanctioned in order to recognize the entrance  of foreign enterprises into national markets. It may become an  issue--for example, if Japan's life insurance companies are  unfairly discriminated against--but until that [problem] arises,  foreigners, it says, should be given preferential treatment.    It's hard to believe, but after the Uruguay Round was  concluded, the Japanese Government announced it would deregulate  financial services based on this "article of agreement." This is  truly to practice reverse discrimination. In short, what's in  this article of agreement is exactly what the United States was  demanding all along.    There seems to be a certain consistency in what the United  States has been advocating. But what does this all mean for  Japan? According to what is in the article of agreement, it  means Japan will practice reverse discrimination. The Japanese  Government hasn't taken a steadfast position on this point. Nor,  to make matters worse, is it a point that has been of much  interest to Japan's economists.    Concerning Mobile Phones    [Ito] This can really be said to be part of the U.S.  strategic trade policy. A classic example comes to mind in the  recent problem over mobile phones.    I'd like to go back over the problem to illustrate a point.  The trouble began with the Market-Oriented Sector-Selective  (MOSS) talks in January 1986, when Japan acceded to U.S. demands  that it open our mobile phone market to the frequency used by  Motorola's equipment.    American television, for example, uses a different frequency  than does European television. There are about three different  systems being used in the world. At the time of the MOSS talks,  the United States demanded that multiple formats--the format  used by United States, by Europe, etc.--all be made available in  a single country, though this was something that had never been  accomplished before. What format a country uses had been left to  each country to decide for itself. Japan was the first to  recognize two formats for mobile phones. Supposedly, this was to  encourage competition and would be good for the consumer. With  this decision, the Japanese Government then assumed the problem  had been solved.    This MOSS conference was the occasion for bilateral  negotiations between the United States and Japan. But given the  experiences before World War II, when the logic of the strong  prevailed in bilateral talks, the push after the war has been  toward multilateral negotiations, and GATT has advocated the  idea of each of the parties concerned making mutual concessions.  This MOSS conference, however, violated that convention.    In April of the following year (1987), Nippon Ido Tsushin  Corp. (IDO) set up a system to accommodate both the formats of  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and Motorola in the  Tokyo area and in central Japan. Daini Denden (DDI) used  Motorola's format in the remaining areas. NTT Docomo, on the  other hand, set up a parallel nationwide network to accommodate  the NTT transmission format. Since then Motorola has claimed,  through the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), that  Japan has not gone far enough in opening its market and has  continued to demand that it be allocated more frequencies and  that additional relay stations be set up to handle calls using  its phones.    In talks between Motorola and IDO, which is a private  corporation, the latter rejected as economically unfeasible the  idea of setting up additional relay stations for Motorola. More  recently, however, negotiations have resulted in an acceptance  of Motorola's demands as the result of pressure from the U.S.  Government. Also accepted was the U.S. demand that a certain  amount of Motorola terminal equipment be sold on Japan's market.  In effect, what was essentially a problem between two private  enterprises and should have been decided by the consumer in a  free market was thus resolved in a pact between two governments,  forcing the demands of a private enterprise to be met.    If Japan had ever made similar demands of the United States,  Americans would be outraged and wouldn't even consider them  worth discussing.    Specifically, in IDO's case: about 10,000 phones were using  Motorola's format, 310,000 were equipped to accommodate NTT's  format. One of the demands was to even these figures out. There  are 400 relay stations that can accommodate NTT's format and 110  which can accommodate Motorola's phone equipment. Motorola  wanted 80 more relay stations deployed by April and another 130  within two years. Adding this many relay stations will require  an investment of about 30 billion yen. For Japan IDO, this is a  huge amount of money and, I think, will be an economic hardship  on the company. Yet, it is the government that is backing this  disregard for the economics of the situation.    That's not all. While the threat of invoking Super 301  [provisions under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness  Act; expired in 1990 and revived in March 1994] was forcing an  agreement between these two private enterprises, Japan's  minister of posts and telecommunications and the U.S. ambassador  to Japan were giving official recognition to the agreement in  order to elevate it to the level of a pact between the two  governments. If this hadn't been done and the United States  imposed sanctions against Japan through Super 301, the Japanese  Government was afraid even if it appealed the case to GATT,  without an existing agreement between governments, the case  wouldn't constitute a GATT violation and Japan would lose its  appeal.    [Ishiguro] From what you say, I can see that various issues  are involved. But to jump ahead and give my conclusion, I'd say,  if another agreement already exists in addition to the special  pact between governments, even if Japan appeals to GATT, it's in  a very unfavorable position. I can see it all very clearly. But  since there are various background factors to consider, maybe we  should go over these point by point.    First, I think we should begin by explaining what's strange  about what the U.S. government is saying. On the one hand, it is  appealing to the principle of competition and the market  mechanism, claiming Japan must open its markets. In other words,  it's arguing from the perspective of private enterprise. On the  other hand, it ignores the logic of a private enterprise like  IDO. If we want to understand the rationale behind what the  United States is saying, I think we can find it in the idea of  affirmative action. This is the idea, which has emerged as an  issue within American society, that is used to secure the rights  of ethnic minorities, Blacks, and women. Affirmative action  presupposes a person has been discriminated against in the past.  In the case we've been discussing, the logic behind the U.S.  actions would be that it has been discriminated against and  treated very badly by Japan. When there is no attempt to redress  the situation of those victimized by discrimination, the  argument goes, then you end up with a socially very untenable  situation. Therefore, according to this logic, reverse  discrimination is acceptable.    At the same time, according to decisions handed down by the  U.S. Supreme Court, unless there is actual proof that a person  has been discriminated against, this kind of reverse  discrimination can't be recognized. This kind of proof doesn't  exist in Japan's case.    So, in lieu of any proof of past discrimination, the United  States wants the Japanese Government to hand over a document.  Assumed implicitly in the document is the U.S. claim of past  discrimination. And on the basis of that claim, promises are  made in writing. And once those promises have been made, it  becomes a pact between the two governments in which Japan  recognizes the U.S. style of affirmative action, and reverse  discrimination is justified. This seems to be the sort of  argument the United States is trying to go with. Therefore, it  would behoove the Japanese Government when sending documents  overseas to carefully review them as if they were contracts and  to carefully study the logic behind them. If this sort of  "check" has been adequate, I would think Japan has a good chance  to win its appeal when it goes before GATT, even in the  [Motorola-IDO] case.    Given these assumptions, I would say Japan's biggest mistake  was in not having gone to GATT with a case it might easily have  won. Instead, concerned about what the United States might do,  it settles the matter in a vague, ambiguous way.    [Ito] The same could be said in the case of semiconductors,  too, can't it?    [Ishiguro] The logic [strategy] developed by the United  States began around the time of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor  accord. Thus, there's a precedent for a trade policy which tries  to establish numerical targets. Yesterday's experience becomes  today's truth. In the case of the semiconductor negotiations  between the United States and Japan, one side said guarantee us  a market share and, for some reason or another, the other side  came up with 20 percent. It is the same with the vaguely worded  agreement on auto parts that came out of President Bush's visit  to Japan.    So there was the semiconductor accord, then the auto parts  accord. Using these two as a springboard, the U.S. government  then, at the recent U.S.-Japan summit meeting, urges a trade  policy on Japan that is results-oriented and tries to establish  numerical targets. But Japan's officials--particularly those  from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and  the Ministry of Finance--have gone all-out to build a  barrier-wall. Because the Americans can't crack the wall, they  turn to officials at the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications who have been standing to the rear of the  stage, and whip out their "301" hammer. And when they do,  Japan's officials, trained by long years of tradition to react  like Pavlov's dogs, finally end up giving in to a compromise  agreement.    [Ito] Encouraged by its success with mobile phones, the  United States is also applying its strategic trade policy to  auto parts. Its set up numerical targets for auto parts and is  trying to get private enterprises to buy a specified number of  such parts. Toyota and Nissan have begun to comply. This is very  dangerous, I think.    Also behind these problems is the tendency of Japan's  bureaucrats to accommodate the other party's demands without  officially agreeing to do so and then having their solicitude  turned into a firm commitment. This is also the case with regard  to auto parts. As soon as the United States sees that private  enterprises will accommodate some of its demands, it comes with  a request to the Japanese Government that it somehow put these  things down in writing. I can't help feeling this is all done as  a safeguard in the event that Japan brings the matter up before  GATT.    [Ishiguro] The U.S. strategy is very simplistic. In other  words, Americans see everything in terms of lawsuits and  litigation. In fact, lawyers hold very important positions in  government. It is in this sense that I have been saying  U.S.-Japan trade disputes should be considered in the same light  as lawsuits among companies. It is in this sense, too, that we  shouldn't go around writing up strange letters of agreement,  since that alone is enough to lose us our case.    Are Japan's Markets "Closed"?    [Ito] Another legal question I have is this: with whom does  the burden of proof lie when the United States accuses Japan of  having closed markets or of having regulations that close its  markets off to other countries?    [Ishiguro] Normally, of course, the burden of proof in a  civil suit would fall on the United States. In GATT's case, too,  if it is a question of resolving a dispute--to take the case,  for example, of mobile phones--the United States would state the  nature of the problem and Japan, in turn, might argue that, as  the result of negotiations between the two countries, the case  boiled down to a question of "comparable market access."    [Ito] And the United States would then have to prove its  claim, I guess.    [Ishiguro] In GATT's case, the term, "burden of proof,"  isn't  necessarily something one customarily hears. But basically,  that's what it boils down to. So, in the mobile phone case,  Japan should have just sat still and waited.    [Ito] Yes. We should have just had the United States prove  where and in what way Japan's markets were closed. The reason I  say I'm in the minority is that Japan's economists take it for  granted that Japan's markets are relatively closed in nature.    [Ishiguro] I can't understand that. However, in terms of  distribution, I have a feeling that the tenor of debate has  changed somewhat. Before, there seems to have been some scholars  who thought Japan's distribution system was a problem. The tone  in recent arguments, however, seems to be that Japan's system  has its own inherent rationality.    [Ito] Speaking of distribution, about five years ago, an  Italian delegation of distributors and a French delegation came  to Japan and said our markets were about the most convenient for  the consumer than anywhere else in the world. Objectively  speaking, the retail industry is extremely competitive. For  every 5 percent of the retailers who go under, another 5 percent  enter the market. When we compare international figures on sales  profit ratios and turnover, we certainly can't say Japan's  markets aren't competitive. I have the feeling that  international comparisons of this sort really aren't being made.    To take the example of the life insurance industry. As far  as  regulations are concerned, there are far more controls on the  industry in the United States. There are also a great many state  regulations. With land, too. The United States has a lot of  regulations. Japan not only has fewer of them, the ones that  exist tend to be ignored. Of course, besides the regulations  that are explicitly written into law, the Japanese receive what  can only be called an excessive amount of "guidance." At the  same time, this isn't to say the fewer regulations there are,  the better off we are. There are a lot of areas in society where  some restrictions are necessary.    For example, if we climb to the top of "Sunshine City" at  night and look down, we'll see bright, glittering neon signs of  every color and hue. In Paris or London, there are no such  displays. That's because there are regulations concerning neon  signs. Some people are all in favor of relaxing regulations. But  if city plans are drawn up without any regulations--restricting  supermarkets or whatever--our cities would be in complete chaos.  Necessary regulations of this kind are far too few in Japan.  Words like "relaxing regulations" have a magic ring to them,  they have a certain value judgment attached to them, and are  similar in this sense to words like "market access."    Finally, we're told: Because Japan has such a large surplus,  it has to meet the Americans halfway." Personally, I find this  reasoning rather odd. But I'm in such a minority, probably no  one other than Mr. Komiya subscribes to my view. I don't believe  we'll find an international rule anywhere that tells the  creditor nation it has to take steps on behalf of the debtor  nation. The United States once took the same position, gaining  the support of [then former] secretary of state [Cordell] Hull,  when the IMF was being formed. It was the United States that  rejected the idea of a creditor nation's "shared responsibility.  It based its position on the argument for self-responsibility;  namely, that a debtor nation should take the responsibility upon  itself to correct its own deficit; that IMF would provide funds  to the debtor nation during this period of adjustment, thus  preventing any drastic adjustments from occurring; and that the  World Bank would provide the necessary loan to enable long-term  structural changes to take place.    However, the United States is now essentially talking about  the shared responsibility of creditor nations. In reality, I  don't think it would serve any purpose to lay the burden of  responsibility on a creditor nation when suitable adjustments  haven't been undertaken by the debtor country. I believe views  like mine are definitely not in the minority among the world's  economists.    In fact, a similar claim was made in a 1987 report issued by  the U.S. President's Advisory Council. Professor Baguatei [as  transliterated], a leading international economic theorist, is  also saying the same thing. But since it can't reverse itself on  its earlier claim, the United States talks instead about there  not being sufficient market access or about our markets being  closed, thus shifting the blame onto another country. I can't  help but think this is the case.    [Ishiguro] I think that in the relationship between our  countries--especially in regard to trade negotiations concerning  services--there's going to be a problem agreeing on what the end  goal for deregulation should be. In listening to the claims of  the United States and the EC, it looks like they're going to be  arguing that an entirely deregulated environment is the best.  That's entirely nonsense when it comes to financial services.  Anyone who remembers what happened with the Bank of Credit and  Commerce International (BCCI), for example, would know that.    There was a time, quite awhile ago, when problems in the  securities field were causing the general investor in Japan a  lot of trouble, and to prevent such things from happening in the  future, regulations here were strengthened. Every country has  undergone a similar experience: either because of tradition or  some development in the past, they have all at one time or  another introduced regulations into certain areas of their  society. To ignore such regulations entirely and argue that it's  good to ease restrictions is just too simplistic. If we don't  argue, first of all, how illogical such a view is, we're never  going to resolve the issue and will end up sinking deeper and  deeper into a quagmire.    Japan Should Be Consistent    [Ito] When [our trade] problems cut deep into the center of  our financial sector or the auto industry and other parts of our  economy, I don't think those in the business world are going to  tolerate the situation any longer. I've been saying for quite  awhile that if America is going to invoke Super 301 provisions  against us, the earlier it's done, the better. We should appeal  to GATT and fight such a move. Even if the United States loses,  it probably won't back down but, again, that's all right.    When we look at the world economies, we have to wonder if  developing nations can fight a powerful country like the United  States and appeal their case to GATT should the United States  impose Super 301 sanctions against them. The only ones powerful  enough to fight Super 301 are the EC countries and Japan. EC has  done it. Japan must stand firm with regard to maintaining  fairness in world trade and supporting GATT. For example, even  if Super 301 is imposed against us, Japan should consider that  one of the costs of preserving certain world principles. The  fewer victims there are, the better; the sooner this comes to  pass, the better. This is what I've been saying. But, the ranks  of those who fall victim are steadily growing, and the negative  repercussions keep multiplying and spreading.    The United States is not the whole of the world. Of course,  there are many things there that have universal value. At the  same time, there are many examples from its past history where  mistakes have been made. For example, out of its confrontational  relationship to the president, Congress may enact legislation  that violates international rules. The president may not apply  the law as strictly as intended. And, in the end, Congress may  repeal the law on its own, having recognized the error of its  ways.    In this sense, American culture is still young. If Japan  does  not act at such times to correct the United States and its  actions, what hope can we hold for the future of the world  economy? Those in business and international trade and industry  complain that academicians make such statements because they  have no vested interest in such matters. "Think about our  position," they say. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that over  the past 10 years their situation has been getting worse.    [Ishiguro] Basically, I totally agree. Only, I think there  are also two schools within MITI. Of the two, the  traditionalists are solicitous of the United States and have  made a series of concessions to the Americans. But MITI has also  cultivated the kind of agency it takes to put out publications  like the Industrial Structure Council's Unfair Trade  Report. Staff has already put out the 1992 and 1993 reports  and the 1994 edition is now being worked on. The report  maintains that multinationalism, if carried out on the basis of  international rules, can take us wherever we want to go. I would  highly recommend it.    Finally, I would like to direct the discussion to our views  on four basic points. First of all, I think we can say Japan's  policy toward the United States, to put it simply, has been to  see the world through U.S. eyes. To go a step further, the world  has only existed for us somewhere beyond the shadows of the  United States. We have to correct this attitude.    Hideo Tanaka, an eminent scholar of English and American  law,  among others, has said that Americans have relatively little  interest in getting an objective, comparative view of the laws  and regulations that exist in other countries. In other words,  the world is up against a large yet uniquely different country  which has a tendency to try to judge the rest of the world by  its own standards. If Japan finds itself thinking it would like  to join with developing countries to better the world, it will  have to be more prepared than it is now to speak clearly and  frankly to the United States.    Second, there are certain to be various occasions when Japan  will consider appealing a matter to GATT, and the United States,  of course, will try to get Japan's politicians to step in. The  question is: How will our politicians respond?    Third, when the Motorola problem came up, for example, the  argument was that, since it had to do with communications, it  was the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunication's problem, but  even within MITI, people were arguing that the problem started  because their suggestion to ease regulations hadn't been  followed. Self-contradictory arguments like this occurred. Then,  the Industrial Structure Council released a document opposing  the United States' strategic trade policy, and at the U.S.-Japan  summit meeting that followed, a clear "no" was voiced. It seems  rather odd considering what was happening prior to the summit.  When the problem occurs in someone else's backyard, we brush it  aside, saying it doesn't concern us.    You have reason, certainly, to feel apprehensive. This  problem, the one which arose with regard to Motorola, is also a  problem that affects our financial sector, it is a problem that  affects the auto industry, and since it could occur in any other  industry as well, it's a problem that cuts across every sector  in our economy. We have to be strongly cognizant of this fact.    The final issue I'd like to bring up is Japan's mass media.  We said "no" at the U.S.-Japan summit, and the talks were said  to have "broken down." "To break down" is an odd phrase. It was  natural to say "no" at the summit, and I expected more than a  certain amount of support from our mass media people overseas.    In fact, when Japan said "no," it had done something it  normally doesn't do, and it seemed the line to any future  negotiations had been cut off. At least, that was the view of  the media. It was then that the media people began looking for a  scapegoat, and locking steps with the Americans, started saying  how unusual and odd Japan's bureaucrats were. We researchers too  were targeted. Then, concerned about what the United States  would do, a segment of the economic community started to call  for a compromise to be reached.    It was in this context that the Motorola problem emerged. As  soon as Japan swallowed the entire set of American demands, the  media immediately moved on to other things, as though the matter  had been settled. This despite the fact that our young  bureaucrats--in Washington and elsewhere--were hard at work  trying to correct any American misapprehensions. This lack of  consistency, is spreading its way throughout all of Japanese  society, including the mass media, wouldn't you say? I have the  feeling this is structurally Japan's weakest point.    [Ito] I think that Japan's economists, especially those who  were educated after the war, don't view the United States in  relative [as opposed to absolute] terms. Those before them saw  the United States from Europe's perspective, so they understood  the unique character and idiosyncratic elements of American  society. The lack of such a perspective has become a weakness  among our economists.    For example, consider the U.S. patent system. Is it being  assessed in the context of international law? Americans adhere  to the first-to-invent principle when it concerns their own  companies, their own discoveries, their own inventors. That's  the reason there are so many industrial secrets. Unlike Japan or  Europe, they don't adhere to the first-to-apply principle. Yet,  despite upholding the first-to-invent rule among their own  enterprises, they follow the first-to-apply rule for foreign  companies, foreign products, and foreign inventors. This is a  violation of GATT's principle of nondiscrimination, which says  foreigners and nationals have to be afforded the same treatment.    The United States is a country where its systems are always  in a state of flux. Japan's economists don't realize that and  are too intent on seeing its present systems as absolute,  immutable entities.    I think we have to view the world with slightly more  attention to its diversity.</p>

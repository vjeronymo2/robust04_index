Our correspondent Renata Havranova,  editor of the PRACE daily, has details of this morning's  deliberations.    [Havranova] The Slovak parliament has again debated and  passed the bill on privatization. After the fiasco suffered by  Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar when the parliament refused his  idea of personal union of the government and the National  Property Fund, Meciar had the law returned by the president to  the parliament. However, the deputies confirmed the original  decision, according to which the prime minister cannot hold the  post of chairman of the presidium of the National Property Fund  and the finance minister cannot hold the post of chairman of the  fund's control board.

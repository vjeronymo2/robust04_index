			<p>BFN     [Text] Cautious optimism is being voiced on the Israeli  side on the eve of the resumption of the economic talks with the  Palestinians in Paris. Close to 70 percent of the issues have  been finalized, and the sides plan to conclude the remaining 30  percent in the sessions scheduled to begin tomorrow. Our  economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports:    [Begin recording] [Stein] There has been a turning point in  the Israeli position: Attainment of the economic accord is no  longer a prerequisite for the signing of a comprehensive  agreement with the Palestinians. Commenting on the need to  conclude all outstanding issues before signing the agreement,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sounded less categorical this  morning.    [Rabin] The least we need is a macro framework -- which must  also be included in the agreement -- or temporary arrangements,  which we could implement until a full economic accord is  attained.    [Stein] In previous rounds, Israel presented to the  Palestinians a 40-page draft accord, 70 percent of which has  already been worked out and finalized with the Palestinians.  Finance Minister Avraham Shohat noted today that his ministry  has drafted a contingency plan in the event that Israel  evacuates Gaza and Jericho before attaining a full economic  accord and no longer has full influence over what is done in the  field.    [Shohat] We have worked out an alternative, which we will  present to the Palestinians. In practical terms, it is a  one-sided move because it does not stem from an agreement on  cooperation.    [Stein] Shohat voiced cautious optimism today, on the eve of  his departure for Paris at the head of the Israeli delegation.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Think-tank urges energy conservation A RUSSIAN think-tank yesterday warned against throwing money at Russia's ailing oil and gas industry without tough energy conservation measures and savage structural reforms to privatise or close down loss-making enterprises. The report, produced for the Russian Foreign Policy Foundation by experts including Mr Andrei Konoplyannik, a deputy energy minister, also lays great stress on the need for energy conservation, saying that 40 per cent of energy produced in 1991 had been wasted. While national output had fallen by 7.5 per cent, oil consumption had decreased by only 2 per cent. Expectations that resources would be freed up for additional exports had also proven unfounded. It forecast that oil production this year would fall to 380m tonnes, an even gloomier figure than the 398m tonne estimate by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy. Although the gas sector is generally considered more stable than oil, production could fall 10 to 12 per cent over the next year after showing no growth in 1991 unless urgent (but unspecified) action was taken. While stressing the importance of foreign capital both for Russia's oil and gas industry, and the West, which would promote secure supplies and stability within Russia, the report says that foreign investment which focussed exclusively on oil production would be a catastrophe. Unless foreign capital flowed to a broad range of sectors (including conservation), oil reserves would be rapidly exhausted without sufficient compensation for the country as a whole.</p>

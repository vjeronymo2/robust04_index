			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] A DAILY NEWS front-page story says Tanzania has  warned warring factions in Rwanda that it won't tolerate the  killing of any Tanzanians in that country. Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha,  principal secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation, said yesterday that his government  will take stern measures against the murder of any Tanzanians by  any group belonging either to the Rwandan Patriotic Front forces  or by government forces.    He said Tanzania has made great efforts to promote peace in  Rwanda and would therefore expect its citizens to be accorded  security and special treatment in that country: We are not  joking. We would never forgive any side held responsible for the  death of any Tanzanians in Rwanda.    Meanwhile the government has moved to evacuate its citizens  from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi, where the first batch of 20  evacuees arrived on 10 April. The same story is carried in the  fifth page of UHURU, which adds that the security of Tanzanians  in Rwanda should be strictly ensured.</p>

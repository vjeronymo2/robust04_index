			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> PROP MAKES A POINT OF AIDS PREVENTION  </P> <P> When Cypress College student Joe Gaudio showed up at school on Thursday, he  didn't expect to be sitting in front of more than 200 students with a condom  pulled over his head.  </P> <P> But that's exactly what happened to the 19-year-old freshman when he came to  watch Suzi Landolphi's zany, energetic and no-holds-barred presentation on safe  sex and AIDS.  </P> <P> "It was embarrassing, but I knew it was all in the spirit of good fun," Gaudio  said. "If it helped anyone, then I'm glad. I think people are often afraid to  talk about sex, and it's something that needs to be talked about."  </P> <P> Landolphi, 40, isn't afraid to talk about sex, as she proved repeatedly while  working the crowd at Cypress College much like Joan Rivers would work a Las  Vegas showroom.  </P> <P> "Girls, the next time a guy says he'd use a condom but they're too small, tell  him about Joe's head," Landolphi said to the audience of mostly 18- to  22-year-olds.  </P> <P> Snappy one-liners, double-entendres and blunt talk about sex are the trademark  of Landolphi's frenetic, one-woman show called "Hot, Sexy and Safer" which she  uses as a vehicle to get college students across the country to think about  safe sex and the realities of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> "You can't get AIDS through something like spit," she said as she stomped  across the stage in her bright orange high-top sneakers. "Which is a good thing  because I spit a lot when I talk. You can't get it from tears or sweat, sharp  knives, forks, plates or toilets."  </P> <P> But she urged students to use condoms, to know about a partner before sleeping  with him or her and to abstain from drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> "You need to keep your lines of defense strong," she said.  </P> <P> Landolphi also called for compassion toward those afflicted with the virus and  for tolerance of different sexual orientations.  </P> <P> "Eventually, every one of us will know or love someone who is HIV-positive,"  she said. "We don't have to judge; we need to understand better."  </P> <P> Landolphi will make about 200 appearances this year at college campuses  throughout the United States. A producer of television commercials, she  volunteered for the AIDS ACTION Committee in Boston six years ago. Through that  involvement, she made public service announcements and eventually began giving  safe sex lectures to high school students. She began touring college campuses  two years ago.  </P> <P> "My real hope is that this will be the generation that will start something  better than a sexual revolution," Landolphi said. "I hope this will be the  generation that starts a sexual evolution." The tone of Landolphi's show came  as a shock to some, but most agreed that her approach had made them think.  </P> <P> "I was a bit shocked by the graphic manner, but it was language that the  students can understand. I think she really got through to a lot of people,"  said Garret Drake, student body president.  </P> <P> Gail Taylor, director of student and campus activities, agreed. "I've been at  Cypress College for 13 years, and this is the first major event dealing with  safe sex and AIDS," she said. "These are topics a lot of people are  uncomfortable about but Suzi makes it comfortable." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

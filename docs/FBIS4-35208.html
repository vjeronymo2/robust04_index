			<p>BFN     [Text] Another incident between the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and the Palestinian police occurred near the Erez  checkpoint yesterday. Our military correspondent Alon Ben-David  reports that an argument erupted between an IDF patrol and the  Palestinian police, during which the Palestinian policemen  cocked their weapons and aimed them at an Israeli officer. The  Palestinians claim that the IDF soldiers cocked their weapons  first, while the IDF soldiers claim the Palestinians threatened  them without cause. The joint liaison and coordination  committee launched an investigation into the incident.</p>

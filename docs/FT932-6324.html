			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P upgrades Portugal STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, has upgraded the Republic of Portugal's long-term foreign currency debt from A+ to AA - . The new rating has been assigned to the Y75bn five-year Eurobond issued in January. The bond's launch spread over the comparable Japanese government bonds was about 75 basis points, but it widened to the mid-80s. Yesterday, the spread narrowed by about 7 basis points, bringing it down to 70 - 75 basis points. Daiwa Europe, one of the lead managers, said the change would open up the Republic's Eurobonds to more institutional investors but others would still be deterred by the split rating. Moody's, the other big rating agency, has not altered the A1 rating it assigned in 1986. Mr Manuel Pinho, director general at the Portuguese Treasury, said the main aim was to create a benchmark and to continue pushing out the maximum maturity of the bonds issued. Portugal plans to borrow a further Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.5bn by the end of the year. The state's annual public sector borrowing requirement is running at just over Dollars 3bn, about 4 per cent cent of GDP, down from 12 per cent in 1985.</p>

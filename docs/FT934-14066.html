			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Farm traders slip on butter oil case - European Law The European Court of Justice has confirmed that agricultural traders cannot escape the commercial risks inherent in exporting to command economies such as the former Soviet Union. The ECJ made its ruling in answer to questions raised by the English Commercial Court in the course of proceedings brought by An Bord Baine and Inter-Agra against the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce. Inter-Agra had contracted to sell 15,000 tonnes of butter oil to Prodintorg, a trading organisation in the former Soviet Union. It was a condition of the contract that the butter oil conformed with the Soviet standards applicable to butter for conversion into butter oil. An Bord Baine, in turn, had contracted with Inter-Agra to supply butter for export to Prodintorg and to lodge the tendering security required by EC rules. Accordingly, it successfully tendered for 11,000 tonnes of salted butter held by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce. Its tender was accompanied by a written undertaking that the butter would be exported to the USSR after being processed into butter oil. At that time the butter satisfied Soviet standards which had been in force for 30 years. However, the Soviet authorities changed the quality requirements for imported butter oil. It was impossible for acceptable butter oil to be produced from the butter which had been the subject of the tender. The change in quality requirements was not published or communicated to the tender party or intending exporter. The ECJ held that the concept of force majeure must be interpreted by reference to the legal context in question as it does not have the same scope in the different fields of Community law. In the context of EC agricultural regulations, the nature of the public-law relationships between traders and the national administration, as well as the aims of the regulations in question, must be taken into account. Accordingly, the ECJ confirmed previous rulings that the concept of force majeure was not limited to absolute impossibility but had to be understood in the sense of abnormal and unforeseeable circumstances, outside the control of the trader concerned; the consequences of this, in spite of the exercise of all due care, could not have been avoided except at the cost of excessive sacrifice. The ECJ said that although the amendment of Soviet law was a circumstance outside the control of the trader concerned, it constituted a usual commercial risk in commercial transactions with an organisation of a command economy. It was not an abnormal and unforeseeable event. A prudent trader could take precautions. C-124/92: An Bord Baine Co-operative Ltd and Compagnie Inter-Agra SA v Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce, ECJ 6CH, 13 October 1993. Japanese distribution companies and dumping calculations The ECJ has rejected an attempt to overturn its previous approval of the European Commission's approach to calculating the domestic selling price of Japanese companies which distribute their products in Japan through local sales subsidiaries. The ECJ has confirmed that the Commission is right to use the sale price charged by the subsidiary to the first independent customer rather than the price at which the sales companies buy from the manufacturing division since they belong to the same corporation. Matsushita challenged the 26.3 per cent definitive anti-dumping duty imposed since January 1990 by the EC on exports of its CD players from Japan. It argued that the sales from its manufacturing division to its sales subsidiaries were sales in the ordinary course of trade and should be used by the Commission for the purpose of determining if dumping existed. The ECJ agreed with the Commission that the only sales in the ordinary course of trade were the sales by the subsidiaries since they formed a single economic unit with the rest of the Matsushita group.

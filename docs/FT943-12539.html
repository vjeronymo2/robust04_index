			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Guide on pension payouts delayed The final version of guidance on how to compensate investors who have suffered from poor advice on personal pensions is unlikely to be available until the autumn, about three months behind schedule. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, is expected to announce this week its plans for pressing ahead with the guidelines for life companies and independent financial advisers, while conceding that the original timetable has slipped. Public concern about the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to customers transferring or opting out of occupational schemes erupted last December. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said then that all those affected would be fully recompensed, and the government made clear that it expected effective remedies to be introduced promptly. The initial plan was for SIB to produce firm guidelines by the end of this month. It is now expected to produce provisional guidelines next month, but these could be revised 'at the edges' if there were difficulties with implementation. One of the problems causing the delay has been that the two studies commissioned by SIB on the extent of poor advice given to customers - as opposed to the extent of the failure to meet regulators' requirements - have both fallen behind schedule. Better information about the scale of compensation that may have to be paid is needed before SIB can take a view on whether the provisional plans are workable. A recent industry estimate put the total compensation bill at between Pounds 400m and Pounds 800m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Deng Ying (6772 4481) and Central </F> People's Radio Network reporter Zhang Yusheng (1728 7183 3932)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Feb (XINHUA) -- The third national work  conference on frontier defense that ended today demanded  national frontier defense under the new period to take serving  the state economic construction as its center; to actively  develop good-neighborly relations with neighboring countries;  and to vigorously promote economic development, prosperity, and  stability along the border areas to ensure a smooth  implementation of reform, opening up, and economic construction.    In his work report to the current meeting on frontier  defense  that began 1 February, State Councillor Luo Gan, who is also  secretary general of the State Council and chairman of the  National Frontier Defense Committee, pointed out: Since the  last meeting in 1979, China has achieved remarkable success in  work related to frontier defense, thanks to the conscientious  discharge of such duties as consolidating frontier defense,  promoting good-neighborliness, bringing prosperity to the people  along the borders through development, and maintaining stability  that gradually put itself onto a track of peacetime development  and management and helped create a peaceful and tranquil  environment for reform and opening up. On the basis of  upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, China has  normalized relations with all its neighboring countries, thus  creating the best ever surrounding environment since the  founding of the nation, which brought economic construction  along the frontiers, particularly the rapid development of  border trade. Army-government and army-people relations as well  as solidarity among the various nationalities along the borders  have been further consolidated and strengthened. The  army-police-people joint defense effort has turned out to be a  good frontier defense format under the new situation.    After analyzing the development and changes in the internal  and external situations and conditions along the borders, Luo  Gan pointed out: Under the new historical period, China's  frontier defense must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics;  adhere to the party's basic line; conscientiously implement the  principles and policies of the party's Central Committee, the  State Council, and the Central Military Commission on frontier  defense as well as the relevant state laws and regulations;  resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial  integrity; preserve and develop good-neighborliness with  neighboring countries; strengthen nationality solidarity; uphold  reform and opening up; promote economic development along the  border areas; maintain border security and stability; and create  a fine surrounding environment conducive to the socialist  modernization drive. Hence, it is necessary to firmly develop a  consciousness on national security, territory, and sovereignty;  actively promote cooperation and exchanges with neighboring  countries in various forms and levels; energetically develop  border trade; severely crack down on various criminal  activities, including smuggling, drugs and firearms trafficking,  and the sale of women; and maintain normal order along the  border areas to ensure that reform, opening up, and economic  construction are carried out in a peaceful, tranquil  environment, both internally and externally.    The meeting demanded governments and frontier defense  committees at various levels along the border areas to further  adapt themselves to the needs of establishing a socialist market  economic system by unifying ideological understanding and  deepening reform. Besides, it is necessary to strengthen the  legal aspect of frontier defense, speed up infrastructure  construction, improve personnel quality, and strengthen  organizational leadership to create conditions more favorable to  strengthening frontier defense management.    Over 170 representatives from the frontier defense front  attended the meeting, during which they exchanged experiences in  frontier defense management, studied characteristics and  missions of frontier defense under the new period, and discussed  draft laws and regulations pertaining to frontier defense  management.</p>

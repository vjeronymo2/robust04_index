			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Turin seeks a new driving force: The city's dependence on Fiat poses problems for its politicians Turin does not look like a city with an identity crisis. The graceful squares and palaces of the centre and the less picturesque factories of the periphery bear witness to the domination of two dynasties: the royal House of Savoy and, in this century, the industrial House of Agnelli, founders of the Fiat motor group. But this legacy is not enough to sustain the city. At the centre of the intriguing election campaign being fought on the piazzas and production lines is the question of Turin's economic and industrial future. Mr Gino Giugni, labour minister in the country's current technocratic government, and one of the leading candidates in Turin for the left's Progressive Alliance, sums up the problem. 'If the city lives by praying to Fiat, and identifies itself with the Avvocato (Gianni Agnelli, Fiat chairman), Juventus (the Fiat-controlled Turin soccer team) and other symbols of Fiat power, then it is destined to decline.' Turin's dependence on Fiat has benefited the city during the good times, but when the company is facing difficulties, as it has recently, the city also suffers. This is a particular conundrum for the Progressive Alliance. Turin has always been a citta rossa, a stronghold of the left, which has drawn on the support of Fiat employees. But advocating that Turin reduce its dependence Fiat will, not be enough unless the left can also propose alternatives which will tackle the 11.2 per cent unemployment rate and restore some of the city's pride. Mr Giugni points to high-tech industry - for example, telecommunications and electronics - as one alternative path which the left intends to encourage, but he admits that north-west Italy still needs to encourage the strong entrepreneurial spirit which has developed in the north-east. The days are also gone when the left could rely on the inherent militancy of the city's workers. In last year's run-offs for the election of a new mayor, the hard-left candidate was defeated by Mr Valentino Castellani, a university professor representing the more moderate Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the main party in the Progressive Alliance. According to Mr Ezio Mauro, editor of the Turin-based daily La Stampa, 'that proved that in Turin a space had opened up in the centre for a non-radical left which could beat both the right and the radicals'. Mr Castellani himself admits that the general elections will be a tougher test of this moderate support. His candidacy for mayor was eventually supported by the traditional Torinese families, white-collar workers, Fiat and the city's employers' federation, but opponents say that was mainly because Mr Castellani represented the lesser of two evils. This time around, the PDS will have to confront in a direct contest the challenge of the centre parties, and more importantly, the right-wing alliance of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's new party, Forza Italia, the federalist Northern League and the neo-fascist National Alliance. The PDS may also be handicapped by its uncomfortable alliance with Reconstructed Communism, the hammer-and-sickle communists who refused to be absorbed into the reformed PDS. In Turin, the task of playing down the contradictions is made doubly difficult by the fact that Reconstructed Communism's leader, the articulate Mr Fausto Bertinotti, is standing for election there. As Mr Enzo Ghigo, co-ordinator for Forza Italia in Turin, puts it: 'We are the real alternative to the left: we are the centre.' Forza Italia and the League are hoping to encourage support among entrepreneurs and employees by reducing the cost of employing new, particularly younger, workers, and encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises. To answer Turin's desire for more autonomy from Rome, a mild fiscal federalism along US or German lines is also being stressed. The Progressive Alliance is likely to win more support in Turin, however, in spite of these obstacles. One reason is that it has carefully tailored its party list to run along the city's political dividing lines. Reconstructed Communism's Mr Bertinotti, for example, is standing in one of the constituencies dominated by Fiat workers, while in the historic centre the Progressive Alliance is fielding the moderate PDS candidate Mr Franco Debenedetti, soft-spoken brother of Carlo, chairman of the Olivetti computer group. Mr Debenedetti faces the toughest task of any Progressive Alliance candidate. One of his opponents is Mr Valerio Zanone, a former mayor standing for the centre parties; another is Mr Gipo Farassino, who made his name as a singer of dialect ballads and is now secretary of the Northern League regional branch. Mr Farassino is particularly critical of the costly deal struck with Fiat last month by Mr Giugni in his capacity as labour minister, to avoid big job losses and industrial unrest in the motor industry. Fiat itself appears not to be taking sides in the campaign, but the right claims the Giugni accord may have bought the votes of many of the company's 115,000 Turin workers for the Progressive Alliance. But although the agreement should be enough to help Mr Giugni's election, the big question for Turin is whether it will also buy breathing space after the poll, during which a new government can help the city develop new confidence and a new sense of identity.</p>

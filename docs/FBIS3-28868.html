			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Unchanged Ambition for </F> Aggression"]    [Text] It was revealed in a report that the United States  officially appropriated a budget for the Team Spirit joint  military exercise in its defense budget bill for next year's  fiscal year. This was revealed when U.S. Defense Secretary Perry  answered a question raised by a senator at the budget  deliberation of the Senate Military Committee on 9 February.  Also, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff explained  that the budget for the Team Spirit joint military exercise is  included in next year's budget bill.    For the United States to appropriate a budget for the Team  Spirit joint military exercise in the budget bill of next year's  fiscal year is a planned and intentional maneuver to aggravate  tension on the Korean peninsula and to further drive the  situation toward a catastrophic war. This is an open challenge  against us who hope to achieve peace and reunification.    As everyone knows, the Team Spirit joint military exercise  is  a large scale war exercise to invade the North, which is being  committed by mobilizing hundreds of thousands of enormous forces  including up-to-date war equipment such as nuclear weapons and  U.S. imperialist aggression forces brought in from the U.S.  continent and U.S. bases in the Pacific, the U.S. troops  occupying South Korea, and the South Korean puppet army.    In its character, content, and scope, this war exercise is a  very provocative and reckless preliminary war and a test nuclear  war aimed at a nuclear preemptive strike toward the northern  half of our republic. Whenever this war exercise is committed,  tension is aggravated on the Korean peninsula and a strained  situation is created in which a war may break out at any moment.    That is why the world has been strongly demanding the  permanent suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise.  Also, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit war exercise was  brought up as one of the important agendas in the North-South  dialogues and DPRK-U.S. talks.    In fact, under the conditions in which more than 1,000  nuclear weapons are deployed in South Korea, if a war breaks out  on the Korean peninsula, its flame will be easily spread outside  the territory of Korea, then a grave consequence will arise.    The United States has promised in the DPRK-U.S. talks and  contacts that it would suspend the Team Spirit exercise. This  is because the United States itself has admitted the danger of  the Team Spirit exercise. In the DPRK-U.S. talks and contacts,  the United States has promised that it will not use any arms,  including nuclear weapons, nor pose a threat to us by them.  However, the United States has abandoned its promise and put  pressure on us, while talking about sanctions against us. Also,  it has officially included the budget for the Team Spirit war  exercise into the defense budget for the next fiscal year. This  is another mean betrayal, as well as a challenge to the party to  dialogue.    While smiling at us at the negotiating table, the United  States has said that it will not conduct the Team Spirit war  exercise. On the other hand, behind us, it has included the  budget for the Team Spirit exercise into the defense budget for  the next fiscal year. This fact clearly shows that although the  United States babbles about the relaxation of tensions or  dialogue or peace on words, it does not indeed want them, and  that it pursues only the reckless policy of power to crush  [apsal] us with military might in cooperation with the South  Korean puppets.    Also, this has proven that there are no changes in the  United  States' policy toward Korea. As a coyote's instinct is not  changed, the United States' aggressive instinct and ambition  will not change. In fact, under these circumstances in which the  Cold War ended on the earth and in which our nation wishes  peace, not war, there is no reason at all for the United States  to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise next year.    It will not be even beneficial to the United States itself  to  squander a great amount of expenditures by introducing a great  number of troops and war equipment into South Korea and by  conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise for several  months.    Nevertheless, the United States wants to conduct the Team  Spirit war exercise again next year against us. This shows that  it wants, without fail, to set a fire of war on the Korean  peninsula. However, the United States will not frighten our  people -- who rise up for the just cause -- nor bring them into  submission by any military threat or blackmail.    Our people and the People's Army, who are ready for either  dialogue or war, will return a war for a war if the United  States dares to wage a war against us. They retaliate  thousand-fold against aggressors.    The United States must not commit a rash and thoughtless  act,  being clearly aware that we do not make empty talks. The U.S.  plot to resume the dangerous Team Spirit joint military exercise  will be strongly denounced by the broad peace-loving people  throughout the world.</p>

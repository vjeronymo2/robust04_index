			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 28, 1992, the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (``1992 Act'') was signed into law. P.L. No. 102&hyph;546. This legislation added new subsections (c) and (d) to Section 4 of the Act. New Section 4(c)(1) authorizes the Commission, by rule, regulation, or order, to exempt any agreement, contract or transaction, or class thereof, from the exchange-trading requirements of Section 4(a) or any other requirement of the Act other than Section 2(a)(1)(B), 7 U.S.C. 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  New Section 4(c)(2) provides that the Commission may not grant an exemption from the exchange-trading requirement of the Act unless,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter alia, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the agreement, contract or transaction being exempted will be entered into solely between ``appropriate persons'' as defined in new Section 4(c)(3) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  subject to such limitations as may be deemed appropriate by the Commission, in the public interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In granting such an exemption, the Commission must also determine that the agreement, contract or transaction in question will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act and that the exemption would be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In vesting the Commission with this new exemptive authority, Congress recognized the need to create legal certainty for instruments that may contain some features similar to those of regulated exchange-traded products but that are sufficiently different in their purpose, function or design, or other characteristics such that traditional futures regulation may be unnecessary. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG

promote responsible economic or financial innovation and fair competition, the Commission by rule, regulation, or order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, may (on its own initiative or on application of any person, including any board of trade designated as a contract market for transactions for future delivery in any commodity under section 5 of this Act) exempt any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class thereof) that is otherwise subject to subsection (a) (including any person or class of persons offering, entering into, rendering advice or rendering other services with respect to, the agreement, contract, or transaction), either unconditionally or on stated terms or conditions or for stated periods and either retroactively or prospectively, or both, from any of the requirements of subsection (a), or from any other provision of this Act (except section 2(a)(1)(B)), if the Commission determines that the exemption would be consistent with the public interest.

The Petitions for Exemptive Relief  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 16, 1993, the Commission published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of petitions for exemption submitted by the CME and CBOT pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c), and a request for comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In its petition, submitted on April 8, 1993 (and supplemented June 18, 1993), the CME sought an exemption from most of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations with regard to the purchase and sale of certain contracts denominated by the CME as Rolling Spot <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> TM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  futures and options contracts (``Rolling Spot Contracts''). The CBOT's petition, submitted on June 30, 1993, requested that the Commission establish a ``professional trading market exemption'' from most of the provisions of the Act and regulations for trading in any instrument of the CBOT and other boards of trade, including those designated previously as contract markets by the Commission. Under both petitions, trading in exempted instruments would have been limited to certain participants, and trades would have been cleared through an exchange clearing system approved by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 43414 (Aug. 16, 1993); 58 FR 44402 (Aug. 20, 1993) (correction); 58 FR 52948 (Oct. 13, 1993) (extension of comment period to Dec. 15, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, the Commission requested comment concerning the appropriate disposition, pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c), of the applications submitted by the CME and the CBOT. Specifically, the Commission requested comment on approximately 100 issues under the following general headings, corresponding to the determinations that the Commission must make in order to grant an exemption under Section 4(c), 7 U.S.C. 6(c): (1) Whether the exemption is consistent with the public interest and purposes of the Act; (2) whether the contracts to be exempted will be entered into solely between ``appropriate persons'' as defined in Section 4(c)(3) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3); and (3) whether the exemption will have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Commission or any contract market to discharge its regulatory or self-regulatory duties under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

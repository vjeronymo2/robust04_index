			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Buoyant Tories put money on economic upturn - The issues dominating the likely two-horse race for next month's Newbury by-election FOR PEOPLE who could trample on the green shoots of Mr John Major's political spring, the voters of Newbury appear remarkably calm about their opportunity. The risks for the prime minister are considerable. Defeat in the by-election next Thursday would cut the government's overall majority at Westminster to 19. It would also threaten the fragile confidence beginning to emerge among Tory MPs, especially if it was coupled with a poor performance in the county council elections on the same day. Liberal Democrat by-election victories in the last parliament showed that the 9.3 per cent swing which the party would need to take the seat  - held by the Tories with a majority of 12,300 last April - should be well within their grasp. But they still need to find the issue to set their campaign alight. In villages such as Lambourn on the Berkshire downs, it is easy to see how the constituency has been solidly Tory since 1924. In the more suburban parts of the constituency such as Thatcham and in Newbury itself, a market town of just under 40,000, the presence of a consistent Liberal challenge is more apparent. The Tory candidate is Mr Julian Davidson, the determinedly buoyant 30-year-old who fought Mr Paddy Ashdown in Yeovil in the general election. Although his own family firm has been a victim of the recession, Mr Davidson's message is relentlessly positive about the prospects for the economy, and for Newbury, and particularly for the two together if he wins the seat. It is a re-run of the general election campaign: 'vote Tory on Thursday for recovery on Friday'. Mr David Rendel, his Liberal Democrat opponent, has a better doorstep manner, his attentive concern honed by four general elections as well as involvement in local politics. For Labour, it scarcely matters that Mr Steve Billcliffe is a competent and irreproachably local candidate - the party polled fewer than 4,000 votes last April. It is even split about whether it would prefer a Tory or a Liberal Democrat victory. Although the contest is a two-horse race, it has attracted a record 19 candidates. Beyond the usual fringe contenders are three candidates in favour of a referendum on Maastricht, a Give the Royal Billions to Schools candidate, and a Defence of Children's Humanity in Bosnia candidate. On the doorstep, however, the main issue is the economy. The constituency is still prosperous though not at the level of its expectations in the 1980s boom years, when high-tech companies took advantage of its prime location on the M4 corridor. House prices have collapsed, and the unemployment rate of just under 7.5 per cent is much higher than it was a few years ago, though it is still below the national average. Even so, the will to punish the government for the recession has been weakened by some encouraging economic signs locally as well as nationally. There are also more specialised concerns. The racing industry, an important local employer, emphasises that the Budget decision on value added tax on bloodstock has been a critical element in retaining support for the Conservatives. Mr Rendel's anti-hunting stance is suspect in such a rural area, but among farmers the government's handling of the integrated administration and control system is even more unpopular. The only specific national issue to show signs of dominating has been the Tories' unpopular Budget decision to impose VAT on domestic fuel. While Mr Rendel says the tax change has aroused 'very strong anger', the mood is not yet like the fury over the poll tax, which swept away a Tory majority of 19,000 in the Ribble Valley by-election. He has also seemed surprisingly ill-prepared for the Tory counter-attack over the Liberal Democrat commitment to a carbon tax. To win, the Liberal Democrats need to make VAT on domestic fuel more of a focus for widespread anger about Conservative broken promises, and make people believe that a vote for them will mean change. Otherwise, the Tories look set to win by a short head.</p>

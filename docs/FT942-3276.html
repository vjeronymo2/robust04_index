			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at Norwegian shipowner Wilhelmsen Wilhelmsen, one of Norway's largest shipping groups, lifted pre-tax profits three-fold in the first four months of the year to NKr321m (Dollars 44.5m) from NKr110m in the same period last year. It was helped by a NKr180m gain from the disposal of a drilling rig. The shipowner said there was uncertainty over the remainder of the year. Group freight revenue was unchanged at NKr1.2bn but operating profit, before depreciation, fell NKr26m to NKr226m. Pre-tax profit, after minority interests, rose sharply to NKr281m from NKr83m.</p>

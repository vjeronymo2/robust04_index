			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: The wild west lives in Australia's centre - Nicholas Woodsworth rides with lean and mean John Brack, a fine example of Outback Man IT WAS chilly and raining when the Ghan pulled into Alice Springs, in the middle of Australia. Beside the railway tracks, in the empty, wine-box-littered bed of the Todd river, where they camp, ragged and barefoot Aboriginals hugged themselves for warmth. In town, runnels of water made dirty red maps on the sides of dust-coated cars. Outside the pubs, dogs crouched bedraggled and patient in the back of pick-up trucks. Alice seemed a sodden sort of place. This was not the outback I had imagined. Perhaps I had been too much influenced by the train brochures I had read. The Ghan, I learned, was named for the Afghan cameleers who had been brought in last century to open up the 1,100km transport route across the outback from Adelaide, on the southern coast of the continent, to Alice in its red centre. The train follows the same route. Why Afghan cameleers? Because tough, wily, desert Afghans were best equipped to survive travel in this vast and inhospitable area. Who better than men of the desert to cope with endless spaces of rock and sand and sparse bush, with blinding sun and brain-addling heat? Not only were they tough but, Moslems, they were the only men in the country who did not drink like fish; they alone could be trusted to bring liquor supplies through to the stockmen and miners, the traders and homesteaders in the thirsty bars of the interior. The frontier atmosphere, the isolation, the harshness of the land and the thick-skinned durability of the people who live there, appealed to me. In the sprawling cities and suburbs of the south I had seen the way 90 per cent of Australians live. The suggestions of beer commercials to the contrary, few Aussies today have to cope with giant spiders in backyard dunnies. The place where man heroically confronts nature, once central to the character of every Australian, now lies far to the north in the remote heart of the continent. A few days spent camping and riding there would, I thought, provide an antidote to urban life. Heat and dryness I had anticipated; no one had mentioned the danger of floods or freezing to death. But then, it seems, the outback is a place that breeds all kinds of extremes. No one was complaining about the weather at the Ross River Homestead, a simple but comfortable outback resort an hour's drive from Alice along the edge of the rocky MacDonnell range. For the last three years the vast cattle stations that make up the region have suffered severe drought. The hardiest of grasses died off, dams and tanks dried up, and cattle had to be trucked south to richer grazing lands. None of this was apparent from the guest bungalows sitting below the sharp ridge of iron-red rock that faces the Ross River. Beyond a paddock shared by a flock of squawking, pink-crested galahs and half-a-dozen slowly ruminating camels, the bush stretched away fresh and green. Young leaves were swelling and the ground was soft and green. In the three weeks since it had begun raining, the bush had been transformed. Without a searing sun and at least a sand dune or two, a camel-ride seemed somehow inappropriate. Instead, the chilly weather begged a bracing and energetic outing on horseback. Early the next morning I was sitting astride Nibbler, a chestnut gelding, and setting off for the hills in the company of lean, mean, cowboy-hatted John Brack. Was the entire Ross River outfit staffed, for the sake of authenticity, by characters who might have wandered in off a Crocodile Dundee set? It seemed so to me. There were any number of horsemen who might have accompanied me on my ride: Ian, a blue-eyed Paul Hogan look-alike who, in desperado fashion, sloped around the homestead in boots and an ankle-length oil-skin coat; Grub, an energetic young ringer, or cowboy, whose work around camp-fires and horse paddocks left him permanently dirt-caked from head to toe; Froggie, a beer-bellied, ear-ringed ex-miner whose tattooed biceps and forearms danced with naked ladies. Each one a strong personality in his own right, all have been shaped by life in the bush. In the end, though, John Brack proved a fine example of Outback Man. With his cowboy boots, denim jacket, dangling cigarette and cockatoo-feathered hat, Brack might have walked out of a Marlboro ad. He has spent most of his life working on horseback. But he is too genuine a product of his environment to fit the slick and disingenuous advert image. His smile proves it. Six years ago he fell under a kicking horse at a rodeo. When he woke after three months in a coma, his jaw had been broken in eight places and there were 40 stitches and a metal plate holding it together. His grin is no less broad today, but the front teeth remaining are few and far between. No matter how kicked around by outback life, Brack, like most locals, professes a profound dislike for the city. He cannot stand its ways and what he sees as its hypocrisy. He hates yuppies, he says, and cannot understand foreigners. There is not enough room in the city to feel free, he will tell you; and John Brack needs plenty of room. He talks and acts bluntly. He will give you his last cent if you need it, but if you transgress his code of rough justice you are likely to wind up with a fist in your face. Today, with no family responsibilities, he moves from job to job, drinks and smokes heroically, and refuses to respect any kind of authority. Brack may not be a typical outbacker, but this is a place where outsiders, rebels, misfits, black sheep and eccentrics have always thrived. Heat, boredom, isolation, aboriginal/white racial grievances, a shortage of women, an extremely high level of alcoholic consumption - all contribute to a frontier mentality that has all but vanished on Australia's periphery. One figure tells it all: in the Northern Territory, the vast and sparsely inhabited state stretching from Alice Springs north to tropical Darwin, the murder rate is 14 times higher than the national average. The wild west lives on in the Australian centre. But life in the outback is not all drifting, drinking brawling and bravado. Most of it is sheer work, the forcing of a living from an ungiving environment. Having ridden miles through the morning with John Brack, I found myself on the edge of the Love's Creek cattle station and talking to its hard-working general manager, Aboriginal Henry Blomfield. At 1.5m acres, Love's Creek is only a moderately-sized station (Anna Creek station, to the south, is 12m acres). Nonetheless, just keeping an eye on the 6,000 head of cattle that graze the range here is a full-time job. When I met him, Blomfield was especially busy: he was halfway through the annual muster, the round-up of the 1,300 cattle he must sell each year to keep the station profitable. Blomfield remembers days as a child on Love's Creek when cattle were mustered solely by stockmen on horseback. Today his men still use horses in the rough terrain, but also four-wheel-drive trucks, off-road motor-bikes, and a helicopter. The hours, none the less, remain long and the work tiring. Would he or his men care for an easier job in the city? I asked Blomfield over a lunch-time meal of Love's Creek beef brisket and tea stewed in a billy tin over a fire. Never, he replied. As far as he is concerned the outback life is the only life. Certainly it is not the money that attracts the stockmen, both white and Aboriginal, to the cattle stations: they generally earn as much in a week as Blomfield's helicopter pilot does in an hour. We did not stay to watch. John Brack had some mustering of his own to do. By late afternoon we were back at the homestead and collecting half-a-dozen Ross River guests for an overnight ride and camping trip. The weather changed as we rode out. Before sunset, the sky had turned a startlingly clear, dustless blue, and luminous sunshine was glowing on every bush and ghost gum tree and ancient ochre rock in the valley. Unconcerned, kangaroos hopped and browsed just yards from our single file of horses. By the time we arrived at our campsite, an open, grassy spot at the base of a dramatic rockface, Grub had a fire going, Froggy was cooking dinner, and the stars were out. After dinner, around the fire, Grub described how he had once been stuck in his car in a mud wallow for three days. Froggy told us it was all right to punch a woman as long as she punched you first. John Brack admitted he had once cleared a Darwin pub by passing through it with a live chain saw and slicing off the legs of bar stools as he went. The stories continued, wild tales of bull hunters and crocodile catchers, crazed opal miners and drunken helicopter musters. Just occasionally I glanced up to the night sky to see the Southern Cross wheeling overhead.

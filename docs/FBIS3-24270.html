			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Nikolay Mikheyev, chief of the </F> Federal Counterintelligence Service Military-Medical  Administration, by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondents Dmitriy  Kholodov and Vladimir Murashkin; place and DATe not given: "The  One and Indivisible Property of Special Services: KGB Leadership  Liked To Vacation in Yalta"]    [Text] It is forbidden to take photos at the KGB  resort. Our MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondents learned this  as soon as they pulled out their cameras. Among those who  vacation here are not only staff officers of state security but  also members of the covert staff and illegal agents who, quite  obviously, do not want their photos taken even for such a widely  read newspaper as MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS. For the same reason,  the resort is located in a quiet corner of Moscow Oblast and is  surrounded by a good fence--no strangers are permitted on its  territory.    "Moskvich" is one of MB's [Ministry of Security] recreation  facilities, which are now under the jurisdiction of the  Military-Medical Administration of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FSK]. It was built quite recently,  in 1989. It can accommodate 810 guests and serves the FSK, the  SVR [Foreign Intelligence Service], the GUO [Main Protection  Directorate], the FAPSI [Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information], and the border troops--every  agency that has emerged in Russia in place of the KGB since the  reforms of 1991-1993.    "Why did the agencies that emerged during the reform of the  special services decide not to divide the KGB sanitariums and  resorts but instead left everything under the FSK umbrella?" our  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent asked Major General Nikolay  Mikheyev, chief of the FSK Military-Medical Administration.    [Mikheyev] Take the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium in  Sochi--how do you divide it? And the only hospital? All the  services--the FAPSI, the main directorate for protection of  president, intelligence, the border troops, and so on--supported  the idea of keeping the medical services together as a whole.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Is there a lot to divide?    [Mikheyev] Four and a half thousand accommodations. There  are  seven sanitariums and eight resorts--in the North Caucasus, at  Caucasus mineral waters (Kislovodsk, Mineralnyye Vody), and the  central belt of the European part of Russia.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Did you lose a lot after the  disintegration of the USSR?    [Mikheyev] About 50 percent of available capacity. Since  1991, 15 health facilities--eight sanitariums, four resorts, and  three pioneer camps--have been transferred to the jurisdiction  of independent states. In Ukraine--in Crimea, near Kiev, and in  Odessa. Three health facilities were left in Georgia and one in  the Baltics. Our children mainly spent their vacations in  Ukraine. Since the disintegration of the USSR we do not have any  children's camps on the Black Sea shore. By presidential edict a  pioneer camp in Anapa, which previously belonged to Ukrainian  enterprises, has been transferred to us.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How did the nationalization of KGB  property proceed in the republics?    [Mikheyev] We were simply informed. That is all. For  instance, in Georgia: the Samshitovaya Roshcha sanitarium in  Pitsunda for 850 accommodations, absolutely new--built just two  years ago. Now the property of the information and intelligence  service of Georgia. The future of the sanitarium is unknown. We  have to enter into agreements with the independent states: With  Ukraine, we swap vouchers.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] How much does it cost to vacation  in  a security organ sanitarium?    [Mikheyev] Because of inflation, prices keep going up. In  1991 a voucher cost 400 rubles [R]. Now it is on average  R140,000-160,000. For 21-24 days, room and board included. By  law, members of special services, as military personnel, have  allowances. The wife gets the voucher at 50 percent of the cost,  the officer--25 percent. That is, he pays R40,000.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Do all officers vacation in equal  accommodations? Are there not some privileged sanitariums for  higher-ranking personnel or state-owned dacha complexes?    [Mikheyev] The Military-Medical Administration does not have  dacha complexes. Everybody vacations in the same manner, eats in  the same cafeteria. There are resorts that have been built  recently. They are better--they have rooms for two. Those built  before the war as a rule have four persons per room. There are  upgraded accommodations--two-room suites, but for an extra cost.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] Where do the top people in your  agency like to vacation?    [Mikheyev] In the summer many of those who had vacations  went  to Sochi, to the Imeni Dzerzhinskogo sanitarium. In the past,  they liked Yalta very much. Kislovodsk is popular--for some  reason, they prefer the old building there, built in the park  zone in 1932, although there is now also a new one, with more  conveniences.    [MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS] And the last question. How are  vouchers divided between the agencies?    [Mikheyev] In proportion to personnel numbers. Everybody has  equal conditions. We regularly exchange opinions on this  subject. There is no problem with this. There is a different  kind of a problem. For instance, we do not have any sanitariums  or resorts in the Asian part. One is only now under construction  in Vladivostok. Meanwhile, people from those regions do not come  here--travel costs are too high. We have to make arrangements  with the Ministry of Defense and the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs]. They accommodate our requests. In exchange, we give  them vouchers here, in the European part. [end Mikheyev]    Small buildings hide among pine trees. Cozy  rooms--"three-star"--are furnished with custom-made furniture.  The sports complex has a large year-round swimming pool (still  functions).    Among recent guests here were Americans who came from  the International Sports Association to award belts to our  officers--karate specialists: special services staff train and  take exams here, at the resort.    There are two ways to vacation in "Moskvich." To apply  to the FSK and pay the full cost--about R14,000 a day. Or get  recruited as, for instance, a covert agent and vacation for 25  percent of the cost. Your choice.</p>

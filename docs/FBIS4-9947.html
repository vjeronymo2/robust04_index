			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the newspaper GRANMA, deputies have  begun their analysis in preparation for the next session of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. In Granma,  ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon chaired the country's first  meeting with deputies to analyze the results of Parliaments in  the Workplaces and to note some of the ideas that could be used  in preparation for the ANPP special session scheduled for 1 May.    Preliminary reports submitted by Deputy Ernesto Suarez, who  is also an ANPP secretary, state that 3 million workers  participated in the parliaments, by which the workers  demonstrated their patriotism, honor, and willingness to do  whatever might be necessary to save the Revolution. For that  meeting, the ANPP president and seven permanent ANPP working  committees visited Granma for the rendering of the province's  accounts in preparation for the next special period of sessions  of our parliament.    Rafael Dominguez Fernandez, president of the provincial  government, released a report on the socioeconomic  characteristics of Granma, its work objectives, and a rendering  of its accounts. Also present were Deputy Jaime Crombet, who is  a member of the Cuban Communist Party [PCC] Central Committee  and vice president of the ANPP; and Alfredo Enriquez Pina, PCC  first secretary.</p>

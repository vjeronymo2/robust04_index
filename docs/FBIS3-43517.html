			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tension between Togo and Ghana has increased again  today following Wednesday [5 January] evening's deadly attack  against the Lome inter-army regiment which houses president  Eyadema's residence.    Earlier today on our station, the Togolese foreign minister  accused the Ghanaian authorities of being passive accomplices;  he said that the attack is coming from Ghana, from a commando  operating from this country. He added that Ghana had also  become a rear base for the forces of the opposition leader,  Gilchrist Olympio. To say he is not involved is nonsensical,  concluded the Togolese foreign minister.    Ghana strongly denies any involvement in this case, saying  that Lome has no evidence whatsoever. As for the opposition  leader, Gilchrist Olympio, who was directly accused, he did not  take long to react to what Ouattara Natachaba said:    [Begin recording] [Olympio] We believe that the statement by  Natachaba is particularly irresponsible. We have always said  that Togo is very sick, and the national tissue is in the  process of disintegration. What we need is not recriminations,  but a genuine roundtable, gathering all the parties at the local  level and our foreign mediators, particularly France, Germany,  and the United States. Therefore, I would say that the violence  we are witnessing at the moment was expected.    [Repoter Assan Diop] So Mr. Olympio, you reject the  accusation of being responsible for this action by a commando on  5 January?    [Olympio] Absolutely! We reject it categorically and add  that we deeply regret the shedding of blood. [end recording]</p>

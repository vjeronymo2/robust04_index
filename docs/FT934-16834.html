			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Warning on EC pensions compromise: Restrictions may damage industry and raise costs says trade association EC MEMBER states are moving towards a compromise on liberalisation of pension funds which could damage the industry and increase the cost of labour and pensions, according to the pension funds' trade association. The measure, which would affect 83 per cent of the Ecu1,000bn (Pounds 766bn) of assets in European pension funds, was originally intended to open up cross-border investment and management of funds. But the European Federation for Retirement Provision yesterday warned that the EC risked adopting 'a counter-productive and restrictive directive'. 'You have to query whether it's worth having a directive at all if it's one with restrictive norms,' said Mr Philip Lambert, chairman of the EFRP and general manager of Unilever's pension funds in the Netherlands. The federation claims that a working group of national officials, appointed in June to re-examine the draft directive, is diluting the measure, despite objections from countries such as the Netherlands and the UK,which have large funded pension schemes. For example, the draft would abolish requirements for pension funds to invest a minimum of their capital in certain categories of assets, such as government bonds. The EFRP has welcomed this move, but believes EC countries will be able to get round the obligation easily because maximum limits are not outlawed. Some member states, such as Italy and France, also want to maintain or strengthen strict limits on the proportion of assets which can be invested in currencies other than that of the fund's home country. The measure should be discussed by ministers at one of the two internal market councils to be held before the end of this year. Officials from Belgium, which holds the EC presidency until January, said yesterday that a general 'willingness to compromise' existed on the directive. The Belgium presidency has called a pensions funds working group meeting today.</p>

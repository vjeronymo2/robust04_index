			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Fokus Bank halts merger talks Fokus Bank, Norway's fourth largest bank, is pulling out of merger talks with Christiania Bank, the second-largest banking group, following political support for it remaining independent. The two state-controlled banks announced on Monday they were discussing a merger that would have been one of the biggest rationalisations of the Norwegian banking system since it was engulfed by a loan-loss crisis at the turn of the decade. But the announcement was followed by a meeting of parliament's all-party finance committee at which it became clear there was majority support for Fokus Bank remaining self-standing by raising funds through a reprivatisation process. 'We now have clear political backing to pursue an independent solution - there is definitely a majority in parliament for that,' said Mr Leif Klevan, chief executive of Fokus. 'We will prepare a new plan for the government on how to proceed, probably by raising money from the markets.' Fokus, taken over by the state in 1991, seems to have outflanked the Labour party government, which appeared to favour a merger with Christiania but which is in a minority in the Storting (parliament). The bank was lifted by reports that a group of private foreign and domestic investors was ready to step in with a NKr500m (Dollars 68.5m) recapitalisation package. Banking sources said yesterday this proposal was serious. The government, which controls all the main banks, has been considering restructuring the banking system for more than a year. It commissioned a review from Davis International Banking Consultants of the UK which is understood to have included a Christiania-Fokus merger as one of the possible options. But no concrete steps have been taken since Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank were merged to form Den Norske Bank in 1990. Meanwhile, the first steps towards reprivatisation have been taken through a share issue last month by Christiania Bank, which left it 69 per cent owned by the government, and a similar move planned by DnB, the country's largest bank, in the spring. The breakdown of the merger talks is a disappointment for Christiania which hoped to strengthen its geographical spread by what would have been in effect a takeover of Fokus, which is based in the western city of Trondheim. Both Christiania, with assets of NKr114bn, and Fokus, with assets of NKr30bn, reported a return to profit in the first nine months of last year.</p>

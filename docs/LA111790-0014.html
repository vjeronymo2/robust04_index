			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> STUDENTS MAP THE STATES IN A BIG WAY  </P> <P> Students at Simi Elementary School won't have any trouble finding Texas or  Florida on the map.  </P> <P> In fact, even Rhode Island, the smallest state in the country, would be  difficult to miss on the new 45-by-26-foot map of the United States painted on  the school's playground over the weekend.  </P> <P> Principal Leslie Frank said the map was painted by parents, students and  teachers to celebrate National Geography Week.  </P> <P> The map, which Frank also worked on, took about 10 hours to complete, she said.  </P> <P> Frank said the map will be used as a learning tool for students, who can use  multicolored chalk or watercolors to fill in the names of the capitals and  cities of each state as well as mountain ranges and other landmarks.  </P> <P> She said students will be encouraged to create games using the map and what  they have learned from their geography lessons.

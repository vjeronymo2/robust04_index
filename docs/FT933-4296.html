			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Airtours changes broker and public relations team AIRTOURS, the travel group, has changed its broker and public relations adviser, dropping the firms that advised it during its failed bid for Owners Abroad earlier this year. It is also expected to appoint a second merchant bank. The group announced yesterday that Hoare Govett would become its stockbroker, replacing Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Brunswick is replacing College Hill as public relations adviser. It is believed that the group intends to appoint Morgan Grenfell as its merchant banker. It is thought that Morgan Grenfell will work alongside British Linen Bank, the group's current merchant banker. Mr Eric Sanderson, British Linen Bank's chief executive, is a non-executive director of Airtours. Airtours said last night that it felt the need for change and for new ideas. The changes in advisers implied 'no specific criticism' of those dropped by the company.</p>

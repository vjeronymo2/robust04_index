It has only subsided for the  present.    According to the Constitution, Parliament cannot prevent the  government from signing treaties. However, ratification may be  greatly delayed or may not materialise at all for years, like in  the case of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.    This does not mean the almost weeklong uproar over GATT was  an exercise in futility. Rather, it brought home to the  government serious misgivings on the economic arrangement to  which India has been committed.    This has been a desperate gamble by a government commanding  only minority support in the Lok Sabha. It is the precise reason  behind the government's studied ambiguity on every item that may  affect the country under the new world trade regime.    The statement by Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the Union commerce  minister, has tried to hide rather than reveal the actual  implications of the trade regime, to be ushered in next year.  Associated Press filed a report from Geneva on December 17 that  said, "Indian farmers and drug companies are likely to be hit by  patent fees on seeds and pharmaceuticals."    Mr Mukherjee has tried to cover up even this. That the  prices  of medicines will shoot up cannot be denied.    Mr Eduardo Faleiro, the minister of state for chemicals, has  assured the country the government can control prices of  medicines through the drug price control order. He is well aware  that no international commitment by the government can be  negated by any control at home.    This is particularly true when the present government is  fervently offering oblations to the god of the market.    The government has never taken Parliament into serious  confidence about the problems and pitfalls in the Uruguay round.  At the Funta del Este meeting of GATT in 1986, India took a firm  stand which some bureaucrats sought to surreptitiously modify.  But this was scotched at Montreal.    However, the surrender lobby was never disarmed. Its  intrigues continued until it came on top in 1991 with the  present government.    The line of surrender was clearly palpable when the Dunkel  draft was first published two years ago. Not accidentally, this  was precisely the point when the government was practically  hijacked by the International Monetary Fund-World Bank  mafia--Mr Manmohan Singh and his team.    The capitulation line in GATT fitted beautifully with  submission to the IMF's structural adjustment prescription two  years ago. In fact, the Dunkel draft represented an essential  component of Manmohanomics.    Thinking the Dunkel injunctions could be defied without  upsetting the well-entrenched structural adjustment edifice of  the finance ministry is absurd. A similar argument is it would  be disastrous if India refused to sign GATT.    This is similar to the argument about the problems in case  India failed to meet commitments on debt servicing in 1991. As  with the new economic policy, the government has avoided telling  Parliament the full implications of each item of the elaborate  structure of the new GATT.    An extensive and exposing public campaign was launched  immediately after the Dunkel draft was released, particularly on  the question of patents. No recent campaign has mobilised such a  wide response from intellectuals cutting across party lines.    The government was in a quandary. On the one hand it had  already surrendered on the economic front to the Fund-Bank  dictates due to the machinations of Mr Manmohan Singh and his  team. On the other it had to contend with serious objections to  the Dunkel draft by all political parties, including a  considerable section of Congressmen.    Not surprisingly, the government took the subterfuge of  so-called consultations to cover up its capitulation at the GATT  talks. A cabinet sub-committee was set up under Mr Arjun Singh  to elicit public opinion on the Dunkel draft. It met a number of  spokesmen with different points of view. No one has been told of  the outcome of the exercise.    Despite representations by different bodies, public meetings  and discussions, the government maintained a studied silence at  home. Meanwhile, it was virtually inactive at the negotiating  table in Uruguay.    Indian initiative in rallying the developing nations to  force  changes in the world trade pattern is not possible. The  negotiators themselves were hamstrung by the government's  continuous commitments to the Fund-Bank.    The government's mendacious position is clear from the  timetable it fixed for the final round of parliamentary  discussion on the Dunkel draft. The deadline for the new GATT  accord being December 15, the government conceded a debate in  Parliament to begin on December 6. Obviouisly, the government  was not serious about the debate influencing its stand at Geneva.    Even Mr Mukherjee's statement could be extracted by  Parliament after the cabinet had already instructed the  government's representative at GATT to sign the new accord. As  in the case of economic policy, the government moved without  consulting Parliament, though it does not command a clear  majority in Lok Sabha.    Though a public campaign by an informed body of concerned  citizens is on, this was not reflected in the Opposition's  performance in the past two years. There have been angry  protests in both houses of Parliament in the past week but only  after the horse had fled from the stable.    The standing committee of Parliament attached to the  commerce  ministry examined the Dunkel draft for six long months. It  submitted its report only on December 13--two days before the  GATT deadline. So, its critical evaluation of the draft is only  of academic interest.    Had this job been given top priority and done three months  earlier, there could have been some chance to force the  government on this issue. As in other urgent issues nowadays,  Parliament is defaulting in its role as the mirror of public  perception and concern.    It is clear from the world situation that GATT is hardly  going to establish a global regime of peaceful trade. Frictions  are inevitable between countries, regional groups and certainly  the developed giants of the Group of Seven.    It is widely perceived the new era following the end of the  Cold War will witness fierce rivalry among industrial giants for  capturing the world market. In other words, an unprecedented  trade war is in the offing.    In such a situation, a watchful government in the developing  world representing the bulk of the world's manpower, resources  and market can effectively intervene to defend third world  interests. Whether India will aspire to play this role and if  the present establishment, with the halter of Manmohanomics  round its neck, can play it is for the nation to judge.</p>

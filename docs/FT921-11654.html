			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waldegrave calls upon spirit of NHS founder - Health THE Conservatives yesterday invoked the spirit of Aneurin Bevan, the Labour minister who founded the National Health Service, in support of their claims that the NHS reforms are working. Mr Huw Griffith, a consultant neurosurgeon and a nephew of Mr Bevan, came to Tory Central Office to say that he did not believe the health service would be safe in Labour's hands, and that his uncle would have supported the government's reforms. His conversion came, he said, during battles between ministers and the medical profession on the reforms four years ago, when he saw Mr Kenneth Clarke, then health secretary, 'treated very much as my uncle was in 1946.' Calling himself a former Labour supporter, but refusing to say how he would vote at the election, Mr Griffith emphasised how the changes were facilitating innovation. Within the NHS, he added, the reforms were increasingly supported by 'people like myself, on the shop floor or the coal face'. Support for his assessment of Mr Bevan's likely reaction was not, however, forthcoming from elsewhere in the Bevan family. Mrs Arianwen Norris, Mr Bevan's sister, said she was horrified by the way the Tories were trying to claim her brother's support for 'the terrible changes to the NHS'. Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, cited Mr Griffith's views as evidence that leaders of the health service professions were coming round to the reforms: the government had won the intellectual argument, he said. Further proof of his confidence on the issue came as Mr Waldegrave revealed he had given up private health insurance on gaining his present post because he 'did not think it was necessary to have it'. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, said: 'If William Waldegrave believes that the spirit of Nye Bevan supports his changes to the NHS then there is a wheel missing from his Ouija board. 'Nye Bevan would not have supported two-tier waiting lists or opted-out hospitals. His whole life was dedicated to taking health out of the market.'</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Industry's unstoppable slide: FT study shows that Britain cannot count on manufacturing for an export-led recovery IF Mr John Major is looking to industry for an export-led recovery he may be disappointed, a Financial Times study has found. The trade gap in manufactured goods is likely to continue in spite of recent efforts to promote exports. A survey of industrial sectors over the past 20 years by FT reporters shows that some sectors now in deficit, such as motors and electricals, are reviving as a result of foreign investment. However, the decline of other sectors could offset any such gains. Britain went into deficit in manufacturing trade 10 years ago, and the deficit widened last year in spite of the recession. There is now a long list of products in deficit that were in surplus 20 years ago. Besides motors and electronics, sectors which have moved into deficit include textiles and furniture. Individual items in deficit range from nuts and bolts to bicycles, cigarette lighters and pianos. It is not an easy problem to grapple with. Guinness recently announced rationalisation and job losses in the Scotch whisky industry. It is to spend Pounds 25m on new automatic bottling equipment, all from abroad. 'It is virtually impossible to buy high-speed, sophisticated bottling equipment in the UK,' Guinness said this week. 'The technology is in the hands of the Germans.' The FT's findings, which will be published in a two-part series starting on Monday, show that even in sectors still in surplus the pattern is one of decline. The most commonly cited example of British industrial success in world markets is pharmaceuticals, which last year contributed a trade surplus of about Pounds 1.3bn. In 1970 exports of pharmaceuticals exceeded imports by a factor of four. By 1980 it was a factor of three, and last year exports were less than double imports. There is a similar pattern in chemicals, which are also in surplus overall. In the 1980s the industry cut production of petrochemicals sharply following heavy losses in the previous recession. As a result it was unable to supply demand in the boom conditions at the end of the decade. Import tonnage of PVC, a basic plastic used in the construction industry, trebled between 1980 and 1991 while export tonnage halved. It is unlikely that the devaluation of sterling since last September will help. In 1970, when manufactured imports were only two thirds the size of exports, sterling stood at an average DM8.74 and Dollars 2.40. Since then, devaluation and a declining trade balance have gone hand in hand. The brightest spots in the picture are motors, where massive Japanese investment is expected to plug the deficit by the mid-1990s, and in electronics, where Britain is benefiting from foreign investment in consumer electronics, semiconductors and personal computers. However, business location experts do not think the UK will continue to enjoy the lion's share of inward investment into Europe. Mr David Rees, location specialist with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, said: 'In the next five years, I think Britain will continue to earn a high share of manufacturing projects relative to the size of its economy. But I do not believe it will retain its lead.' The reason he says is low-cost competition from eastern Europe and greater efforts by other western European countries to attract investment.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (7): 'Let markets lead the way'  -David Lascelles meets the head of Ofgas, the industry regulator Clare Spottiswoode has a dual role to play as the UK prepares to deregulate its domestic gas market. As director general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, she is working with the government to set out the rules for the new market. And once deregulation has occurred, she will oversee the market to ensure order and fair play. Ms Spottiswoode came to the job nearly a year ago after a career as a Treasury economist and more recently a businesswoman in her own right. Although she had limited experience of the gas industry, she had a strong personal belief in the virtue of free markets and competition - a belief which she says has strengthened since she came to Ofgas. This view has shaped her approach to the regulatory issues. She would rather have a free market and use regulatory action to correct flaws, than intervene in every detail. 'We'll try and let markets do it; if not, we'll find a technical way through,' she says. Competition is also the best way to get British Gas to shed its huge 'legacy costs', as she calls them. 'Regulation can only ever nibble away at the edges. Nothing can engender the culture shock that competition can,' she says. Ms Spottiswoode has advised the government to draw up a brief Gas Bill which provides the enabling legislation but leaves the detail to the terms of the operating licences which she will issue to public gas suppliers (PGS). Although this will put a lot of power in her hands, she says it will give the system the necessary flexibility to evolve. PGS will have the right to seek judicial review if they disagree with her rulings. But Ms Spottiswoode also says she expects parliament to give her guidance about the line she should take. One of the first issues she will have to address is who to give licences to in order to ensure that the market works. She will not insist that applicants cover particular geographical segments of the market. Would-be PGS will be allowed to define their markets however they wish. Many, Ms Spottiswoode believes, will want to operate nationwide: no PGS need actually own any gas pipelines to provide a service so there should be no geographical constraints. However some applicants may be organisations such as housing associations which define their markets by residential type rather than geographical area. If, once the licences have been issued, there are gaps in the market which leave some areas without a gas supply, she will use her powers to 'stretch' existing licences to ensure that these areas are covered. Similarly, she will be able to command companies to patch up holes in the market if a supplier goes out of business. The next problem is how to avoid cherrypicking: new suppliers going for the choice markets and the easy profits. Ms Spottiswoode believes this problem has been exaggerated, and says it can be dealt with by identifying the people to be protected and including the necessary obligations in the licence. There are three issues. One is energy efficiency. There will be a requirement on PGS to give advice on efficient use of gas. Another is care for the elderly and disabled. The PGS will have to cater to their needs, although Ms Spottiswoode does not believe that these costs will be particularly heavy. She points out that the elderly tend to have good payment records. 'The costs are so small that suppliers won't try to avoid them,' she says. It is even possible that a PGS may choose to specialise in the market for people whose bills are paid by social security. The third is debt and disconnections - or bad customers. Ms Spottiswoode says that many people fell into this category in the past because there was no incentive for British Gas to catch them before their debts became unmanageable. In the new market, suppliers will keep a much closer eye on payments so that non-payers can be spotted early, she says. Although many expect the new suppliers to offer discounts to the better payers in order to lure them away from British Gas, Ms Spottiswoode says that it would make commercial sense for British Gas to cut prices first since these customers are cheaper to serve. That way, all prices will tend down to the discounted level, and cherrypicking will be much harder. Ms Spottiswoode maintains that deregulation will not mean price increases - as some critics have argued. She expects most prices to fall. 'I don't see that anyone will lose as a result of competition,' she says. 'Maybe just a few, but they will be caught by the social security net.' However she admits that this is 'a leap of faith' on her part because no other country has gone as far as the UK in deregulating its utilities. All these plans, however, depend on the government giving the go-ahead for gas deregulation - something that will be revealed in the Queen's Speech in mid-November. Ms Spottiswoode is optimistic. She says that support for deregulation is widespread. British Gas wants it, so do the consumer associations, she says. 'When we started work on this we thought there were a lot of contentious issues. But there are not really that many. The real problem is the legislative timetable.' Ms Spottiswoode intends to deliver this message when she appears before the Trade and and Industry Select Committee of the House of Commons next week. But if the government decides not go ahead with the gas bill in the next session of parliament, what could she do to preserve the head of steam that has built up behind deregulation? It would be possible to lower the threshold at which competition can enter the market, but that would still require an order to be laid before parliament. If parliament did nothing, the process of change 'could fizzle out' creating instability, she says. But she would work hard behind the scenes to ensure that that did not happen. If gas is not in the Queen's Speech, she hopes that John Major, the prime minister, would at least make a statement promising to deal with it next year. That would be sufficient to keep investors interested.</p>

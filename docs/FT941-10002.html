			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Sparring partners in a new game: Economic and political upheavals make today's US-Japan summit unpredictable In the good old days BC (Before Clinton), there used to be a comfortable ritual to annual US-Japanese summits. American congressmen would rant and rave about Japanese trade practices, and perhaps do violence to some Japanese product on the lawns of the Capitol; US negotiators would talk tough in the pursuit of processes known by acronyms, such as MOSS or SII, whose letters mean less with the passing years; and a Japanese prime minister would arrive gift-laden, with an economic stimulus package here, or a trade concession there, to be told by the US president, concerned above all with cold war geopolitics, that the US had no more important bilateral relationship in the world than with Japan. He would then go back to Tokyo to bask in the warm glow of a Ron-Yasu or George-Toshi friendship, secure in the knowledge that, whatever enemies existed in America, there was a firm protector in the White House. No more. There has never been a less predictable US-Japanese summit than that scheduled today between Mr Morohiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Their common political lineage - a pair of progressive regional governors now intent on reforming their nations against entrenched opposition - is itself an unusual ingredient: none of the Liberal Democratic prime ministers who presided over the Japanese system for 38 years can be said to have come from a stable comparable to his US presidential counterpart. Now all the old economic and political certitudes are in question. Japan is in the throes of a political revolution, the outcome of which is unclear. But it is definitely stuck in the third year of an economic recession. The US, in contrast, is in the third year of expansion and is flexing its economic muscle on the global commercial stage. It no longer looks at Japanese achievements with envy, devising ways of protecting US industry from tidal waves of Japanese products. Instead, under the banner of open markets, the US seems more determined than ever before to extract from Japan significant changes in the way it goes about its own business at home. Criticised though this US approach may be in classical free trade and academic circles, it is pursued by clear-headed, hard-nosed negotiators, with a taste for brinkmanship. Most have minimal prior experience of Japan but all are flushed with the successes of the Nafta and Uruguay Round agreements and enjoy the full confidence of the president, a majority in Congress and the support of a preponderance of business and labour leaders. The pre-summit perspectives from Tokyo and Washington reflect these changed circumstances. The Japanese message is that foreign pressure still helps get things done in Tokyo, but much less than it used to. The US reading is that nothing less than measurable results will count. This is not to say that the summit will result in abject failure. Mr Hosokawa, no doubt relieved to get away from his domestic political tangle for a few days, will obligingly promise Mr Clinton much of what he wants on deregulation, tax cuts, government spending and reductions in barriers to imports. This alone could furnish a sufficiently acceptable veneer for the president and prime minister to sell to their domestic markets. Mr Clinton might even be pleasantly surprised that Mr Hosokawa has had to defer plans for a rise in sales tax, criticised by the US as an unnecessary damper on Japanese consumer spending. But that is thanks to resignation threats from the Social Democratic party, the biggest and prickliest member of Mr Hosokawa's seven-party coalition, rather than Washington's menaces. Beyond this point, however, Mr Clinton will find his Japanese visitor more obdurate than might be expected in one hanging on to power by his finger nails. In fact, the Japanese coalition's disarray obliges Mr Hosokawa to take a rigid line against US pressure for numerically measured decreases in Japan's record trade surplus and increases in the market share of imported goods. Opposition to numerical targets is one of the very few things that - almost  -unites an otherwise fragmented Japanese establishment. All members of Mr Hosokawa's diverse coalition, stretching from the far left to the religious right, want him to say no to targets. The opposition Liberal Democratic party agrees - and Mr Hosokawa now depends increasingly on its co-operation. But the strongest opponent of targets is the finance ministry, whose power has been greatly increased by the destruction of the LDP's authority and its replacement by the weak and fragmented coalition. On this issue the finance ministry has an unlikely ally in its one-time rival, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, weakened by internal arguments and unable to stand up to its bigger neighbour in Kasumigaseki, Japan's Whitehall. On the surface, Japan's point against numerical targets is economic. A free market cannot be rigged, and Tokyo cannot abandon deregulation to suit the special interests of a trading partner, the well-rehearsed argument goes. Accepting targets would amount to admitting the so-called 'revisionist' argument popular in the US, that Japan is so different from other industrialised countries that foreign pressure is the only way to bring change. Moreover, last July's economic accord between Mr Clinton and former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa spoke only of a 'highly significant' cut in the trade surplus and 'quantitative' measures. Yet under the surface, the argument denotes a change from an old generation that alternated between aggression and subservience to the US, to a new one able to take a consistent, independent line. Mr Hosokawa symbolises that change. At 55, he is a generation younger than most former LDP prime ministers. His straight-talking style goes down well with the Japanese public and with Mr Clinton - even if it upsets some coalition partners. 'Nakasone and Miyazawa were the only LDP prime ministers that could deal with Washington intelligently, without being stubbornly pro-US,' says a former Japanese foreign ministry mandarin. 'But even they were affected by the US Occupation. Hosokawa doesn't suffer from this,' he adds. 'This is not the Japan that can say No,' says a senior Miti negotiator, referring to a nationalistic book of the same title by Shintaro Ishihara, a maverick LDP member. 'Now it is time for us to say No sometimes and then make counter-proposals.' In this case, the counter-proposal emerging in the Tokyo bureaucracy over the past few days is for a system to monitor imports, measured on past criteria, but with no commitments. The idea owes something to former vice-president Walter Mondale, the new US ambassador in Tokyo, whose moderate proposal for non-binding indicators has won respect in Kasumigaseki. Whether the final agreement looks like that is another matter. 'We don't trust them with numbers and they don't trust us without numbers,' says the Miti negotiator. Japan's generation change is, however, gradual. US pressure has, in some ways, advanced not only Washington's but also Tokyo's interests in the past few chaotic weeks. It made possible the last-minute clinching of a Y15,250bn (Dollars 141bn) package of tax cuts and government spending. The US may since have dismissed the package as modest and too concerned with the short term, but the impending summit did focus the minds of Mr Hosokawa's fragile and bickering coalition. US pressure has also helped Mr Hosokawa pursue his deregulation drive against entrenched interests in an increasingly powerful government bureaucracy and a small business community whose taste for protection has been sharpened by recession. Accordingly, officials see no real difficulties in agreeing on three of the four priority sectors in the talks to enact last year's US-Japan framework economic agreement: insurance, and government procurement in medical equipment and telecommunications. The government wants to deregulate these sectors, irrespective of the US. The fourth, cars and car components, is more difficult as government influence there is weaker than in the other three, argue officials. Accordingly, Mr Hosokawa will tell Mr Clinton talks on US car exports to Japan should be left to industry associations, not officials. Even here, the US can expect some kind of a deal, following the appointment of the diplomatic Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, the chairman of Toyota, as new boss of the Keidanren business federation. At 68, he belongs to the pro-Washington generation. He opposes US demands for numerically measured increases in market share, yet he does not want to harm relations with the US, if only for the sake of his company's joint venture with General Motors. The US position, in contrast, appears both less subtle and more solid. Its equally well-rehearsed argument, in the words of Mickey Kantor, the trade representative, is that 'Japan's markets are closed by any measure you may choose'. No trade agreement in the last 20 years has reduced the Japanese trade surplus (it was Dollars 59bn with the US last year) or increased its propensity to import. Roger Altman, deputy secretary of the treasury, says the US approach, with both a macro-economic and sectoral focus, is predicated on the fact that 'Japan is out of step with the rest of the industrialised world'. The charge of managed trade, he says, is 'a canard - it is not managed trade to ask that Japan deregulate its insurance and pension fund management markets'. The US is merely insisting on 'the eligibility to compete', not demanding a predetermined share of any given market. This suggests, again, some small wiggle room for compromise on the vexed issue of numerical targets in the four sectors under negotiation, especially the three where Japanese government procurement and regulation most impinge. In any case, Mr Kantor insists that the US has never asked for 'one numerical target'. But these sectors are merely the first wave of a process which the US sees stretching out indefinitely. 'I reject the 'turn the other cheek' philosophy,' Larry Summers, the Treasury undersecretary, told the Washington Post this week. 'If we do that, we will never have any political constituency in favour of keeping our own markets open.' This constituency - the US Congress - has been, by its standards, relatively quiet towards Japan of late. This is partly because of other preoccupations. But Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, warned the other day that, even though he thought the legislature should not take narrowly targeted action against specific countries, it was within its prerogatives to pass additional 'process' bills. These would permit the US to take retaliatory action against countries deemed to have unfair commercial practices. Mr Kantor, for one, has shown no reluctance to threaten to invoke such laws. On balance, there is no intent to humiliate Mr Hosokawa in Washington, as Mr Miyazawa arguably was last April, just three months before he lost office. But the US side has been watching Japan's unfolding political dramas with acute interest, if tinged with suspicion. According to Mr Kantor and Mr Bowman Cutter, the presidential adviser, the prime minister represents the forces of progress, at least in contrast to Tokyo's bureaucratic mandarins, because of his clear commitment to deregulation. If his political condition is fragile, Mr Kantor goes on, 'we're trying to strengthen it'. On non-economic and non-trade issues, which do still exist in the bilateral relationship after the cold war, President Clinton may do the same, including assuring Mr Hosokawa of the continuing US security involvement in the region. There are clear areas of co-operation and common interest with respect to North Korea's nuclear potential, while the two leaders have plenty to discuss about China, Cambodia and other global issues. The president might even note, approvingly, one remarkable development in Japan's involvement in the wider non-commercial world. Two of its citizens - Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN high commissioner for refugees, and Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy - are playing leading roles in Bosnia, a distant country in which Japan has no direct stake. At the end of the day, Mr Clinton may even intone the magic words about Japan's importance to the US. But his meaning will be different because American expectations of Japan have changed. So have Japan's expectations of itself.</p>

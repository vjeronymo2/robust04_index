			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> MORE BARS:  </P> <P> Birraporetti's, 3333 Bristol St. (in South Coast Plaza, near Sears), Costa  Mesa.  </P> <P> Open from 11 a.m. daily. Last call is 1:30 a.m. (714) 860-9090. A gleaming,  upscale watering hole with lots of room to stretch out and a hassle-free  environment. It attracts a somewhat cosmopolitan clientele, but if your idea of  a bar is to jockey for room along with lots of vivacious, talkative people,  well . . . have you thought of moving to Chicago?

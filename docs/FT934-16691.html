			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown sells more abattoirs HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, is on the way to completing its withdrawal from the red meat slaughtering industry with the sale of three more abattoirs in the north-east of England. The abattoirs, in Sunderland, Bedale and Doncaster, were sold for an undisclosed sum by Hillsdown's FMC slaughtering subsidiary to Northern Counties Meat Group, a new consortium formed by FMC management and backed by financial investors. One of Hillsdown's aims was to sell the abattoirs as a going concern in order to preserve the jobs of 130 employees. The latest sale leaves Hillsdown with five abattoirs. The group announced with its interim results last month that it expected to be out of the business altogether by the end of the current year. It has been reducing the number of abattoirs from over 25 during the past two years in an effort to move away from an increasingly unprofitable industry. The sale is in line with provisions made last year when Hillsdown took a Pounds 92.3m provision to cover its withdrawal from the slaughtering business and other problems.</p>

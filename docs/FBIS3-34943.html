			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Good Morning" column by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid] </F>   [Text] Turkey has the right to move in many directions to  save its eroding economy as a result of the economic blockade on  Iraq. Among the neighborly countries, Turkey benefited the most  from the exportation of Iraqi oil. Furthermore, it was more  secure than the other countries because its borders with Iraq  were under the control of the central government [in Baghdad].  Such security does not exist at all now because of the  miserable situation in northern Iraq. Turkey's attempts to  coordinate with the so-called Kurdistan Front as well as its  relations with al-Talabani and Barzani did not save it from  terrorist operations, explosions, and assassinations. These acts  are U.S. and Western commodities that are exported to the  closest friends, not out of revenge, but to maintain their  subservience.    Diplomatic sources said that the Turkish prime minister was  serious in presenting its country's problem to the leaders of  the UN Security Council permanent states. In fact, she  presented Turkey's economic problems and damage resulting from  the sanctions on Iraqi oil exportation. It seems, however, that  the efforts of the prime minister either cooled down or were  confronted by U.S.- Gulf obstacles.    Turkish journalists, whom we met in Baghdad, ask the  following question: How long will Turkey's hand remain extended  to the Gulf states like Saudi Arabia and the rulers of Kuwait?  Can these emirates feed Turkish citizens and provide them with  basic needs and a secure life?    The violence that prevails in Turkey, particularly in  Anatolia, demonstrates the feeling of humiliation, poverty, and  subservience. The Turks, who live along the international  highway that leads to the Iraqi borders, are now regretting the  time when they were their own masters. They planted their lands  and sold their commodities and agricultural products to the  neighborly country with dignity and a feeling of reassurance  about their future.    The Turkish citizens know full well that their country's  future lies in a firm trade exchange with Iraq and in common  historical interests between the two countries. No donor state  can resolve the problem of a country like Turkey because it is  an economic-security issue to which Iraq is a direct party.  Turkish officials know well that Iraq spares no effort to  promote its relations with its neighbors, provided that those  neighbors are free in adopting their decisions and take into  consideration the interests of their own people, not other  objectives that are dictated to them from outside.    Mrs. Ciller raised Turkey's suppressed cry regarding the  effects of the economic blockade. Others should understand that  the entire Turkish people will raise a louder cry if the  disregard of Turkey's relations and historical relations with  Iraq continues.</p>

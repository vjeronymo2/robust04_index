			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Management: A change of propaganda - Impoverished Russians are having a first taste of promotional gimmicks, and are being invited to buy designer clothes An executive without a car is like a rabbit without ears.' If that Russian slogan does not grab you, there is a long-running advertisement on Moscow buses for a brand of western toothpaste which is not to be found in the shops. A year after the collapse of communism, the Russian advertising market is still in its infancy. More than half a dozen big western agencies have offices in Moscow, but out of the 200 Russian agencies there, only a handful offer a full range of marketing services. Foreign companies are promoting goods which are mostly unavailable, and domestic companies producing ads which mean little or nothing. Russian advertisements are still addressed more to other businesses than the consumer, reflecting the fact that 'biznez' is still the preserve of state-owned enterprises and a few slick entrepreneurs. A lack of sophisticated marketing advice also means that companies often use television where specialist publications would be more appropriate. As a result, grumpy TV viewers are treated to adverts offering shares in banks, trading houses and new-style commodity exchanges, or to glitzy pictures accompanied by acronyms and symbols which are never explained. A notorious example is the collie which advertises Alisa, a Russian exchange which trades in building materials. 'This dog begins to inspire hatred, hatred for people who are really rich from those who feel this dog has nothing to do with them,' said Sergei Abramov, a Russian marketing expert. If any explanation is provided, it usually makes clear the product in question (such as holidays abroad) is for a resented minority of Russians with lots of money, or foreigners. Thanks to the appearance of western consumer goods advertised by western companies, the market is finally moving towards ads aimed at ordinary people. A billboard in central Moscow displays a Mars bar, a product now available in kiosks around the capital; television ads show western-looking women using Vidal Sassoon shampoo as a Russian male voice extols the virtues of 'Wosh end Go'. The new breed of ads is exemplified by insurance company White Tower's use of a picture of a Russian family to illustrate 'seven good reasons' for buying an insurance policy. Under the banner headline: 'We foresaw misfortune in sunny weather', the ad - prepared by InterCity Communications, one of the biggest Moscow agencies - offers a service which few Russians needed to bother with in the past. Research by the US-based BBDO agency, which updates a Russian market sample every month, shows that brand recognition is very high, even though there is still very little precise information about who has money to spend. After years of seeing the Olivetti name on the clock which appears on TV screens just before the evening news, many viewers interviewed for the research said they thought the Italian computer company was a clock-maker. Another branch of marketing, public relations, has developed along typically corrupt Russian lines. For Russian businessmen it consists mainly of organising rumours against competitors and paying journalists to write flattering articles about themselves or critical articles about rivals. Inter-City's Karine Iskhanova admits it is common practice for agencies to pay newspapers to write articles about their clients without specifying they are ads. She also says that many clients are still intent on dictating ads, and who should appear in them (including a general manager's scantily-clad girlfriend lying on a pile of money to advertise computers). At the other extreme, officials are also beginning to look at public relations as a necessary substitute for old-style propaganda. The Defence Ministry, alarmed by falling conscription rates, is now running a TV ad proclaiming that 'real men' serve in the army, and showing handsome youths jumping over obstacle courses and handling sophisticated military hardware. In seeking to introduce western capitalist values, the Russian government has just hired BBDO (as part of a consortium of western advisers in banking, auditing and public relations) to help excite 160m citizens about the prospect of receiving vouchers to obtain Rbs10,000 of shares in the century's biggest ever privatisation campaign. Given the shortage of both home-made consumer goods and marketing expertise, the opportunities for foreign advertising companies and western products are as challenging as the obstacles. There is almost no distribution system, the currency is not yet fully convertible, and the banking system is chaotic. However, the cheapness of advertising space and time is an important incentive for western manufacturers. By all accounts television (Pounds 1,250 for a 30-second spot around evening news) and radio (Pounds 75 for 30 seconds) are extremely cheap, while newspapers have tended to price themselves out of the market by raising fees in an attempt to compensate for falling circulation. 'We're talking pennies (per thousand of audience),' says one Californian executive. After being lied to for seven decades, the Russian audience is remarkably gullible to whatever is new and different, providing it is not offensive. Mike Adams, chief executive of Young &amp; Rubicam/Sovero, a US-Russian joint venture in advertising and public relations, suggests the following values are particularly important in understanding the Russian audience: the individual as part of the community; envy; the moral imperative; suffering; honouring the past. While western agencies try to persuade Russian clients that they are not only sensitive but affordable, Russian companies are making a pitch for foreign business. 'You have to grow up in this market to know it,' says Oleg Pisarsky, director-general of Metapress agency. 'It is based on acquaintances and trust. The only thing my foreign competitors have is piles of dollars.'</p>

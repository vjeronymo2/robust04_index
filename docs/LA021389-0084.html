			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND JEWS;  </P> <P> PUTTING 'X' INTO XMAS: A MORE SENSITIVE APPROACH  </P> <P> I know the feelings undoubtedly are well-intentioned, but here's a modest  proposal for Christmas celebrations that start earlier and earlier each year,  that appear in more of our institutions each year: Keep them to those who want  to celebrate the holiday.  </P> <P> From a Jewish point of view (probably a Buddhist or Muslim point of view, too),  America has no faster, more effective way of telling some of us that we are  different, that we are supposed to belong where we do not.  </P> <P> Beyond commercialism, beyond the obvious seasonal appeals to peace and good  will, Christmas is a fundamental religious event. Promoting it as a secular,  American holiday is not only insensitive, it is wrong. Worse is taking the  relatively unimportant coincidental Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and elevating it  to the importance of Christmas.  </P> <P> For many American Jews, Christmas has become a symbol, a kind of acid test of  belonging or not belonging in a Christian mainstream. It becomes exaggerated as  the Christmas season stretches earlier and longer into the year.  </P> <P> One reason I live in Southern California is that my children in fact will be  able to grow up in an area that has Jews and Jewish institutions among its mix  of ethnicities. It's different from North Providence, R.I., where I was the  only Jew in my high school.  </P> <P> Southern California is a melting pot where many teachers try to be sensitive to  the mixed backgrounds of their students. Yet, these efforts often fall short  and result in their own kind of alienation.  </P> <P> Here's what happens in the elementary schools of West Los Angeles:  </P> <P> The teacher uses both Christian and Jewish symbols in the art projects during  December. On the last day of school before vacation, she singles out my  daughter for having done good work and tells her she gets to take home the  class Christmas tree. The child knows this is odd but cannot persuade the  teacher that she should reconsider.  </P> <P> The teacher tells her third graders to split up, all the Christian children on  one side of the classroom, all the Jews on the other. She wants to distribute  the appropriate packet of art materials for a project. What of those children  who are neither? What of those children whose parents are of more than one  faith?  </P> <P> At the annual holiday party (Why is there always a holiday party?), the parent  exhorts the students to greater enthusiasm for the requisite Hanukkah song  added to "balance" the classroom caroling. You have to really get into it, sing  and dance like the Jews do, the students are told. My son rolls his eyes.  </P> <P> The incidents are relatively harmless, but there always seem to be incidents.  </P> <P> Hearing an authority announce that Jews must line up separately from everyone  else sends chills. It is a reminder that even here, even in Los Angeles in  1989, we are viewed as different.  </P> <P> Being treated as "different" is never far away for us. My mother was locked up  for several years as a prisoner of war only because she was a Jew. A  significant portion of my family was killed during the Holocaust. My father was  the first Jew to be hired to the college faculty where he once taught.  </P> <P> Why do public schools have to depend on the symbols of Christmas? Why does my  employer have to put Christmas trees throughout the building? Why does the  President have to light the "national Christmas tree" on the White House lawn?  </P> <P> If it is important to have Christmas in the schools, let's treat it for what it  is, and organize the curriculum around discussion about the meaning of the  holiday to those who celebrate it. Easter is not about bunnies; it is about  what many recognize as the resurrection of a divine figure.  </P> <P> My home state gave us the creche case, the continuing dispute over whether it  is right to place clearly religious symbols on public land. What is most  troubling is not the decision made by the officials of Pawtucket, R.I., but the  idea that there never was any question about whether it might offend.  </P> <P> So the proposal is this: You celebrate, and I'll take pleasure in the idea that  you are celebrating. But, please don't make me feel as if I must join you.  </P></p>

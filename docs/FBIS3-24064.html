By the end of the year there were positive  tendencies in industry (the rates of reduction of production  volumes slowed up) and trade (the growth rate of retail  commodity turnover in the oblast during the half year surpassed  the preceding year's level). But toward the end of the year the  situation became more difficult. The results of the year are  characterized by a considerable reduction of production volumes  and investment activity, a crisis of mutual nonpayments of  enterprises, high rates of inflation, and an appreciable decline  of the standard of living of the population.    The basic indicators characterizing the oblast's  socioeconomic situation in 1993:                                      1993 (in actual       1993 in % of 1992 (in                                    prices)               comparable prices)   1                                 2                     3   Industrial output                                       73   Production of consumer goods,     636.5                 91  billions of rubles   including:   foodstuffs                        174.2                 86   alcoholic beverages               94.8                  118   nonfoodstuffs                     367.5                 89   Capital investments from all      518                   80  sources of financing, billions  of rubles   Startup of residential            979.9                 85  buildings from all sources of  financing, thousands of square  meters of overall area   Average daily dispatch of         246.9                 80  freight by rail transportation  (on railroad divisions of  Chelyabinsk Oblast), thousands  of tonnes   Shipment of freight by general    76                    53  purpose automotive  transportation, millions of  tonnes   Procurements of animal  husbandry products from all  categories of farms:   cattle and poultry, thousands     98.4                  94  of tonnes   milk, thousands of tonnes         416                   99.5   eggs, millions                    573.8                 101   Retail commodity turnover of      779.6                 81  officially registered public  catering enterprises, billions  of rubles   Paid services, billions of        91.5                  71  rubles   Exports, millions of dollars      286.3   Imports, millions of dollars      197.9   Profit (January-November),        1,118.8               8.7-fold*  billions of rubles   Emission, billions of rubles      551.7                 10.7-fold*   Per capita monetary incomes       38,155                9.2-fold*  (average for month), rubles   Consolidated consumer price                             1,024.6**  index, percent   *--in actual prices   **--December 1993 compared to December 1992    <H5>  FINANCES </H5>   Over 11 months enterprises and organizations of the oblast  received 1.1188 trillion rubles [R] in profit. As compared to  the corresponding period of last year there was an 8.7-fold  increase in profit. As of 1 December all branches of the  national economy had achieved a positive financial result.    According to the results of their operation, every eleventh  enterprise sustained losses. The proportion of enterprises  operating at a loss was great. In computer service--33.3  percent, housing and municipal services--30.8 percent, and  publishing houses--50 percent.    As of 1 December 1993 monetary funds in the working accounts  of the enterprises and organizations of industry, construction,  transportation, and agriculture amounted to R77.1 billion. Of  this amount, 82 percent of the money was in industry. On the  whole the monetary funds available to the enterprises cover the  volume of their defaulted indebtedness to suppliers by only 16  percent.    As usual, the problem of mutual settlements among  enterprises  remains critical. Credit indebtedness among these branches  amounted to R1.717 trillion, of which about 40 percent was  defaulted indebtedness. The share of industrial enterprises in  the overall volume of defaulted indebtedness by suppliers  amounted to 90 percent. Considerable amounts of defaulted credit  indebtedness were related to the existence of debit indebtedness.    As of 1 December 1993 debit indebtedness amounted to R1.7907  trillion, of which R758.9 billion (42.4 percent) was defaulted.  A large part of it was defaulted indebtedness of buyers--R689.5  billion.    The shortage of financial resources of the enterprises is  covered to a considerable degree by bank credit. The overall  amount of indebtedness on bank credit in the branches that were  examined amounted to R254 billion, including in industry--R143.2  billion (56.4 percent). Indebtedness on loans that were received  amounted to R31.2 billion, of which 86.8 percent was in industry.    As a result of the lack of money in the working accounts  there continues to be growth of defaulted indebtedness on funds  granted for consumption. As of 1 January 1994 this sum in  industry, construction, and agriculture amounted to R31.7  million, which is 1.3 times more than during the entire 11  months.  <H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>   Over the year documents were filled out for the  privatization  of 1,023 facilities, including 703 municipally owned enterprises  (68.7 percent of the overall number of enterprises, 90 owned by  the oblast (8.8 percent), and 230 federally owned (22.5 percent).    The overall value of the property of privatized enterprises  exceeds R172.1 billion. Privatization is proceeding most  actively with municipally owned enterprises.    A total of 255 enterprises are being converted into  joint-stock companies--this is one-fourth of the enterprises  that submitted documents for privatization. Of the three  versions of benefits offered to the labor collectives,  preference is given to the second version which enables the  labor collective to have a controlling block of shares. This  version of benefits was chosen by 70 percent of the enterprises  that became joint-stock companies.    About R18 billion in capital was received from  privatization,  which is 3.4 times more than during the first half of 1993. Most  of the capital (about 60 percent) remains on the territory of  the oblast.    Last year 183,800 apartments were privatized in the oblast.  As compared to 1992 their number increased 1.6-fold. Since the  beginning of privatization (1989-1993) 299,000 apartments have  been privatized, which is 35.8 percent of the overall number of  apartments subject to privatization.  <H5>  LEVEL AND INDEXES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>   The consolidated consumer price index for the full  range of goods and services in December 1993 as compared to  December 1992 amounted to 1,024.6 percent.    During the course of the year consumer prices and rates rose  most rapidly for paid services rendered to the population. In  December 1993 as compared to December 1992 they increased  48.1-fold, including services of a legal nature--664.3-fold, of  cultural institutions--170.4-fold, and housing and municipal  services--60.2-fold.    A decisive impact on the growth of overall consumer prices  was made by the change in prices of foodstuffs, which make up a  large proportion of them. In December 1993 as compared to  December 1992 consumer prices for food products increased  9.1-fold, including vegetables--22.2-fold, potatoes--19.2-fold,  eggs--18.3-fold, fruits and vegetables--12.3-fold, bread and  bakery items--12.1-fold, and milk and dairy products--11.9-fold.  Consumer prices for nonfood commodities increased less than  those of food commodities. With respect to this type of goods  there were sharp price increases for medications (54.3-fold),  household chemical items (20.5-fold), children's footwear  (12.4-fold), hosiery items (12.2-fold), rubber footwear  (11.7-fold), construction materials (11.5-fold), and knitted  underwear (10.9-fold).    The consolidated retail price index for consumer  goods of the trade network in 1993 as compared to 1992  amounted to 1,085.6 percent. Prices increased most for nonfood  commodities--11.6-fold, including for medications and chemical  products--23-fold, glass dishware--19-fold, paper and office  supplies--16-fold, rubber footwear and toys--15-fold, passenger  cars and leather and textile-combined footwear--14-fold, and  headgear, haberdashery, and household chemicals--13-fold.    On the whole in 1993 as compared to 1992 prices of  foodstuffs  increased 10.4-fold, including for herring--16-fold, meat and  poultry--15-fold, canned fish and vegetables--14-fold, sausage  items, fish, lard, potatoes, and vegetables--13-fold, margarine  and margarine products, milk and dairy products, cheese, tea,  salt, and nonalcoholic beverages--12-fold, and canned meats,  fruits, and ice cream--11-fold.    The level of prices and rates of services in the  sphere of consumer services increased 18.3-fold on average for  the oblast during the year. There was a sharp increase in the  rates for services of notary institutions (692-fold). The higher  prices of food products and municipal, transportation, and  health services gave a powerful impetus to the growth of prices  for tourist-excursion (18.5-fold) and sanatorium-health resort  services (17-fold). During the past year prices and rates of  consumer services increased 16.7-fold, of which the cost of dry  cleaning services increased 27.4-fold, shoe repair--26.3-fold,  ceremonial services--24.7-fold, tailoring of  clothing--20.6-fold, and bath services--17-fold. There was a  sharp increase in prices for services of institutions of culture  (30.8-fold) and public health (13.8-fold). The cost of passenger  transportation services increased 27.9-fold. As compared to last  year there was an increase in the cost of airline tickets  (45.9-fold) and railroad tickets (19.6-fold), and the cost of  passenger travel on urban commuter transportation increased  11-fold. There were appreciable increases in prices of  communications services (10.8-fold) and housing and municipal  services (9.6-fold).    The consolidated wholesale price index for industrial  products for the set of representative commodities in  December 1993 as compared to the preceding month was 107.8  percent, and compared to December 1992--1,034.5 percent.  Throughout the entire year there was a growth of wholesale  prices in the food, meat, and dairy industry. In October the  maximum growth of prices was observed in the bread baking  industry (the index as compared to last month was 201.5  percent), and in December there was a considerable increase in  the butter and fat industry (146.7 percent). The increase in  wholesale prices in all branches of industry brought about an  inevitable increase in retail prices, which, in turn, raised the  cost of the consumer basket.  <H5>  THE SOCIAL SPHERE </H5>   Labor placement and employment of the population.  In 1993, 54,200 citizens looking for work applied to the  employment service regarding placement, 89.6 percent of which  were not engaged in labor activity, 4.1 percent--pensioners, 5.2  percent--students wanting to work during their free time, and  1.1 percent--employed population.    As of 1 January 1994 there were 17,900 registered as  unemployed in the oblast, 63.4 percent of whom are receiving  unemployment compensation. In terms of length of unemployment,  36.2 percent of the unemployed have not been working for from  one to four months, and 69.4 percent of them are receiving  unemployment compensation.    During the year 2,900 unemployed citizens received  occupational training through the employment service, and 1,600  of them (55.2 percent) were placed in jobs upon completion of  training.    As of the beginning of 1994, 1,066 enterprises reported the  layoff of 15,300 workers, while 773 enterprises reported a need  for workers to fill vacancies (vacant positions)--3,800. The  number of workers laid off exceeded the need for work force  fourfold.    Certain branches of the economy have part-time employment.  During January-September in industry, construction,  transportation, scientific institutions, and consumer services  additional leave on the initiative of the administration was  assigned to 127,700 workers. As of 1 October 1993 the number of  people working part time in production was 45,100.    The number of workers. During November the average  registered number of workers in all branches of the economy was  1,388,200, which is 45,300 less than during the corresponding  period of last year.    Monetary incomes and expenditures of the  population. In 1993 the monetary circulation under the  conditions of the further deepening of inflation processes and  the decline of public production did not improve. According to  working figures, monetary incomes increased in 1993 by R1.4796  trillion or 9.2-fold as compared to 1992, and reached R1.6603  trillion. Consumer expenditures rose by R767.6 or 8.1-fold and  amounted to R867.4.    According to figures from the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation for Chelyabinsk Oblast, issuance (the transfer of  monetary funds from reserve to circulating) increased 10.7-fold  as compared to 1992 and reached R551.7 billion in 1993. During  the year payments of wages increased 9.3-fold and amounted to  R836.6 billion, the issuance of incentive payments, monetary and  other payments--10.5-fold, and stipends--7.2-fold.    The average monthly wages during January-September increased  each month by an average of 20 percent, in October as compared  to the preceding month--by 17 percent, and in November--by 8.8  percent. During nine months of last year the growth rate of  wages was higher than the growth rate of prices and in the  fourth quarter the growth rate of prices outstripped the growth  rate of wages.    In November the average monthly wages in the economy of  Chelyabinsk Oblast amounted to R109,865 and wages at  agricultural enterprises, forestry enterprises, and institutions  of science and public education were almost 50 percent less.    The highest growth rates of average monthly wages in  November  as compared to an analogous period of 1992 were in institutions  of public education--13.1-fold, although the average monthly  wages were not high--R64,609, and in computer service  organizations--12.7-fold.    The proportion of consumer expenditures in the overall sum  of  expenditures decreased from 83.5 percent in 1992 to 78.1 percent  in 1993. As compared to 1992 there was a considerable increase  in mandatory payments and voluntary contributions (11.3-fold)  and an increase in the savings of the population in deposits and  securities (12-fold) and expenditures of the population on paid  services (10.3-fold). In terms of average per capita monetary  income the process of stratification of the population is  continuing. While in the third quarter of 1993 most of the  families (71.7 percent) were in 10 groups with incomes from  R20,000 to R70,000, in the fourth quarter 43.2 percent of the  families were in these groups. The proportion of families with  incomes from R70,000 to R100,000 increased from 12.5 to 25.4  percent, and over R100,000--from 8.2 to 30.2 percent.    The consumer goods and services market. The oblast  produced consumer goods (including alcoholic beverages) valued  at a total of R636.5 in current prices. As compared to 1992  their output decreased by R59.7 billion or 8.6 percent.    The output of food products decreased by R28.6 billion or  14.1 percent. Meat production decreased by 11,500 tonnes,  sausage items--by 5,763 tonnes, semimanufactured meat  products--by 1,821 tonnes, butter--by 154 tonnes, whole milk  products--by 4,738 tonnes, canned goods--by 5,344,000 standard  cans, cereals--by 4,712 tonnes, bread and bakery items--by  42,900 tonnes, confectionery items--by 1,929 tonnes, macaroni  items--by 8,713 tonnes, and margarine products--by 10,800  tonnes. There was an increase in the output of fatty cheeses,  mayonnaise, and nonalcoholic beverages. The production of  alcoholic beverages increased by 18.2 percent measured in  monetary value. The output of vodka and liquor items increased  by 140,000 decaliters or 2.8 percent.    During the past year a total of R367.5 billion worth of  nonfoodstuffs, including light industry goods, were produced,  which is 11.1 percent less than during the preceding year.    The population of the oblast acquired 19 percent less goods  (in comparable prices) than in 1992.    Education. As of the beginning of the 1993-94  school year in the oblast there were 11 higher educational  institutions, one branch of the Moscow Commercial University,  and 71 secondary specialized educational institutions.    In 1993 two tekhnikums were closed. The Magnitogorsk Higher  Music School was transformed into a music pedagogical institute.  Among the secondary specialized educational institutions there  are 15 colleges, nine of which acquired the status of a college  in 1993.    Some 9,000 specialists with higher education and 14,900 with  secondary specialized qualifications were sent to the branches  of the oblast economy in 1993. Of the overall number of  graduates, 32 percent of the VUZ [higher educational  institution] specialists and 50 percent of the tekhnikum  graduates were not placed in jobs. The list of unemployed was  increased by 499 specialists with higher and secondary  specialized qualifications.    The admission of students into VUZ's during the year  decreased by 100 and amounted to 10,600 students while  admissions to tekhnikums increased by 300 (18,700 students). The  competition amounted to 1.7 and 1.6 people per space,  respectively.    During 1993, 54 children's preschool institutions were  closed. The main reasons for the closure of kindergartens and  day nurseries were the inadequate number of children, the  dilapidated conditions of the buildings, and the high parental  payments. The buildings of the closed preschool institutions  were made into hotels, residences, dormitories, warehouses,  offices, and banks. More than 10 percent of these premises are  empty.    Health protection. The number of hospital beds in  medical institutions as of the end of the year was 48,100, which  was 134 beds for every 10,000 residents. For every 10,000  residents of the oblast there is an average of 36 physicians and  101 people working as intermediate medical personnel.  <H5>  MATERIAL PRODUCTION </H5>   Industry. The production volume (in comparable  prices) decreased by 20.6 percent as compared to the preceding  year. The tendency toward retardation of the decline of  production that was observed toward the beginning of last year  continued until November. During the last two months of the year  there was a significant reduction of production, in November--by  24 percent and December--by 26.9 percent.    Each month during the year at an average of 35 enterprises  there were lengthy production shutdowns (in November and  December at 53 and 63 enterprises, respectively). During the  year the losses of working time for this reason amounted to 2.5  million man-days or 12.5 percent of the scheduled working time.  More than half of the shutdowns of enterprises last year were  related to difficulties in selling products and about one-third  to lack of provision of material resources. As a result of the  lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and productions during the  year, R65.2 billion worth of products were not produced.    Labor productivity in industry decreased by 15.8 percent.  The  number of industrial production personnel amounted to 559,000  and decreased by 32,000 or 5.4 percent. The average monthly  wages of workers in basic production in industry were R84,800,  including in December--R146,200.    Industrial enterprises of the oblast failed to deliver to  consumers R134.7 billion worth of products under agreements that  were concluded. The greatest arrears in product deliveries were  found in enterprises of the metallurgical complex--97.9 percent  of all the indebtedness.    In the fuel and energy complex with an overall reduction in  production volume of 2 percent, the output of electric energy  decreased by 7.8 percent and coal extraction--by 1 percent.    The agro-industrial complex. The volume of gross  agricultural output (in comparable prices) on all categories of  farms, according to preliminary calculations, decreased by 6.6  percent during the year. The reduction of volumes occurred  mainly on public farms. On private subsidiary farms of the  population the volume of products produced exceeded last year's  level by 3.6 percent, and on peasant farms--by 1.6-fold.    Labor productivity dropped by 8.6 percent and 210  agricultural enterprises ended the year with a profit, while 65  ended it with losses. During the year the farms received R15.4  billion in profit. The profitability level was 14.8 percent.    As a result of the reduction of the planted areas and the  reduction of productivity in 1993 as compared to 1992 there was  a reduction of the gross yield of grain crops from 2,781,300  tonnes to 1,817,700 tonnes (65.4 percent), potatoes--from  634,900 to 503,700 (79.3 percent), and vegetables--from 131,200  to 111,800 tonnes (85.2 percent).    The farms of the oblast stored up 16,500 tonnes of potatoes  (39.5 percent of the 1992 level) and 36,500 tonnes of vegetables  (63.1 percent). The annual volumes of mandatory deliveries of  potatoes were fulfilled by 30.1 percent, of vegetables--by 66.4  percent.    In 1993 there was a certain slowing up of the decline of the  production of animal husbandry products at agricultural  enterprises: During the report year they produced (sold for  slaughter) 128,500 tonnes of cattle and poultry in live weight  (95.5 percent of the 1992 level), 512,000 tonnes of milk (99.4  percent), 639 million eggs (94.5 percent), and 1,504 tonnes of  wool (105.6 percent).    On average from one cow the farms of the oblast obtained 165  kilograms (8.1 percent) of milk more than in 1992. The average  yield of wool from one sheep increased by 0.7 kilograms (21.9  percent). The average daily weight gain of cattle being fattened  increased by 80 grams (24 percent), for hogs it dropped by 35  grams (11.5 percent), and the egg production of laying hens  decreased by five eggs (2 percent).    The number of head of the main kinds of livestock continues  to decrease. During last year the number of cattle decreased by  8.2 percent and amounted to 640,800 head, including cows--by 6.4  percent (221,500 head). The number of hogs decreased by 12.5  percent (262,500 head), and sheep--by 12.6 percent (330,600  head). The number of head of poultry increased by 4.5 percent  and amounted to 7,772,600. A smaller number of calves and  piglets were born. The maintenance of the main kinds of  livestock improved.    During the past year state resources have acquired 98,400  tonnes of cattle and poultry (94.2 percent of the 1992 level),  416,000 tonnes of milk (99.5 percent), 573.8 million eggs (101  percent), and 813 tonnes of wool (94.4 percent). The annual  volumes of mandatory deliveries of cattle and poultry were  fulfilled by 108.1 percent, milk--by 104 percent, and eggs--by  140 percent. State procurements of cattle and poultry increased  in seven rayons and cities of the oblast, and milk--in 12.    By 1 January 1994 in the oblast there were 7,022 peasant  (farmer-run) farms with an overall area of land granted to them  of 409,600 hectares (an average of 58.3 hectares per farm). The  re-registration of the sovkhozes and kolkhozes is continuing.  During the year 259 farms were re-registered, of which only 29  (11.2 percent) retained their status.    The scale of rural construction continued to decrease in  1993. The volume of capital investments in the development of  the agro-industrial complex was R72 billion and decreased as  compared to 1992 by 27 percent. During the year facilities were  introduced to accommodate 1,050 cattle, 140 hogs, and 400 sheep,  and 79 kilometers of roads were built. The introduction of  animal husbandry facilities, silage and haylage structures grain  storage facilities, and roads decreased three- to fourfold as  compared to last year.    Capital construction. Only one-fourth of all the  startup facilities and capacities were introduced. Facilities  were not introduced at plants of the processing branches, nor  were capacities for producing consumer goods, machine-building  and metallurgy facilities, or water and air purification  facilities at many industrial enterprises. The startup of fixed  capital amounted to R200 billion.    During the year R518 billion was invested in the economy.  This is 20 percent less than in 1992 and almost 50 percent less  as compared to 1989 or 1990. Expenditures of state enterprises  and organizations in the overall volume of capital investments  amounted to R205 billion (40 percent) and R303 billion (58  percent) came from joint-stock companies and limited liability  partnerships. Internal capital of enterprises and organizations  made up 70 percent of the overall volume of capital investments.    Enterprises and organizations with all forms of ownership  assimilated R154 billion in centralized capital investments  during the year (30 percent of all the funds), including from  the republic budget--R52 billion and the local budget--R79  billion.    The proportion of capital investments in production  construction amounted to 58 percent and nonproduction  construction--42 percent.    The process of destatization accelerated in the construction  complex. The greatest development was in mixed and private forms  of ownership. Of the overall volume of contracting work  performed, 57 percent was performed by organizations with the  mixed form of ownership, 29 percent--by organizations with a  private form of ownership, and only 14 percent--by state  organizations.    During the year construction organizations with all forms of  ownership performed contracting work for a total of R350 billion.    A total of R216 billion in capital investments or 42 percent  of the overall volume went for the construction of facilities in  the social sphere. Almost two-thirds of these funds was used for  housing construction. Residential buildings with an overall area  of 980,000 square meters were put into operation. New apartments  were assigned to 16,600 families.    As compared to 1992 the startup of housing decreased by 15  percent and as compared to the average annual startup during the  period of 1986-1990--by 40 percent. The scale of housing  construction in the oblast dropped to the level of the beginning  of the 1950's.    Funds belonging to the population of the oblast were used  for  the introduction of 66,000 square meters of residential space,  or 7 percent of the overall amount introduced. Of this area  26,000 square meters were constructed by housing construction  cooperatives and 502 buildings with 40,000 square meters--by  individual builders.

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Private post operators may win local licences THE GOVERNMENT is considering a plan to allow private postal operators to bid for licences to compete with the Post Office in different regions. The move is part of the government's review of the organisation of the Post Office. Ministers are not expected to make a decision until the end of the year and the licences plan is the most radical under consideration. The Post Office's letters division, Royal Mail, has a monopoly on delivering all letters with postage costs of less than Pounds 1. Business Post, an express delivery service company which submitted the proposal, would like to offer a comprehensive letter service in part of the UK. Because of the size of the Post Office - it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 247m for the year to March 29 this year - Business Post believes that private operators should be given the opportunity to compete in different parts of the UK. Under its plan, private operators would bid for the franchise to compete exclusively with the Post Office in northern England, for example. No private postal operator would set up a rival service in an area where another private company was operating. Mr Michael Kane, managing director of Business Post, said: 'No private postal operator can compete effectively with the Post Office throughout the UK. But there would be plenty of companies which could compete with the Post Office in certain regional areas.' He has already had talks with officials from the Department of Trade and Industry and plans further meetings. He said: 'The DTI appear very keen on our idea and are scheduled to come to our offices to see how it could work.' The DTI says it is considering all proposals. Business Post's plan also envisages the creation of an independent regulator that would introduce competition progressively. Mr Kane proposes the gradual introduction of competition along the same lines as the telecommunications industry, where licences are issued for an initial period to private operators who satisfy certain conditions. He says he realises that the conditions would have to include compulsory services to rural areas, but that would present no obstacle to those already operating parcel-delivery services to such areas. Since the Post Office cross-subsidises deliveries to these non-profitable regions with the surplus from the profitable urban areas, Mr Kane says he believes there is no reason why private operators should not be able to do the same.

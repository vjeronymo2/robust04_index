			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wentworth advances 74% to Pounds 436,000 A 74 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 251,000 to Pounds 436,000, was announced by Wentworth International Group for the six months to September 30. The plastic packaging products group achieved a 66 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 6.54m) and the pre-tax result was after an exceptional Pounds 29,000 credit. However, Mr Haque Khan, the chairman, said group profits had suffered from losses at Wentworth Cartons which had been badly affected by the current economic climate. Further cuts to its manufacturing cost base had inevitably led to further redundancies, he added. Looking ahead, he was confident of increased activity both at Paraphane (flexible laminates) and within the point-of-sale display division of Edwards (corrugated packaging). Earnings came through at 0.29p (1.78p) on an increased number of shares. As usual, there is no interim dividend.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Alain </F> Debove in Bonn; date not given]    [Text] Bonn -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  will visit Paris on Thursday, 24 March. He will deliver a  lecture at the French International Relations Institute. He  discusses here the misunderstandings that have disrupted  Franco-German relations in recent weeks.    [Debove] What is the state of relations between Bonn and  Paris following the misunderstandings of recent weeks? Are  there still problems?    [Kinkel] Things must be put into perspective. I dispute the  fact that there have been serious disagreements between Bonn and  Paris. The French ambassador in Bonn had an unofficial meeting  with the press. That prompted some irritation in Germany but  this has meanwhile been cleared up. I had a detailed discussion  with Alain Juppe, my counterpart, who is a friend; we both  published communiques; the French ambassador amended his  remarks; and I am now pleased to be going to Paris on Thursday  for a visit agreed upon a long time ago. Contacts between the  two countries are so diverse, close, and natural that even  differing opinions on some questions -- such things happen to  the best couples -- could not undermine the excellent bases of  our relationship.    [Debove] However, there are minor tensions, for instance  with  regard to the commemoration of the 6 June landing....    [Kinkel] Yes, this subject is playing a role, at least in  the  press in the two countries. But since 1945, France and Germany  have always managed to commemorate with dignity the important  dates of their common history. I will mention the meeting  between Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in Reims cathedral  in 1963 and the joint commemoration which was attended by  President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl at the Verdun cemetery  in September 1984. There is no doubt in my mind that the French  and Germans will also be able to celebrate in an appropriate way  the end of World War II and Germany's return to the community of  democratic states.    [Debove] There sometimes seem to be disagreements between  Paris and Bonn on the question of the expansion and deepening of  the European Union.    [Kinkel] I do not see things in that way. We think that  expansion and deepening are necessary. Indeed, there are  different concepts on this subject within the European Union --  but not between France and Germany.    [Debove] Is the Franco-German couple still the driving force  of European building?    [Kinkel] After extremely difficult years, Germany and France  have managed to establish preferential friendly relations and  have been and will remain the driving force of European  unification. As I have already said in the past, when France  and Germany cooperate closely in Europe many things work; if  France and Germany do not agree, many things do not work.    Franco-German relations have an essential importance for  Europe and that must continue. I am deeply convinced of that  and, since I have been foreign minister, I have personally  contributed to realizing that objective by working for it in a  practical way. The good relations with my French counterparts,  first Roland Dumas and now Alain Juppe, have also had very  positive effects in that way. We must ensure that there is not  the slightest cloud over Franco- German relations.    [Debove] Do you think that expansion has not changed that at  all?    [Kinkel] No. The expansion to four EFTA (European Free Trade  Association) countries was decided jointly by the Twelve. I  observed that, throughout the negotiations, France and Germany  were always on the same side. There were therefore no problems  between France and Germany in the negotiations on expansion, and  we should not allow anybody to make us doubt that.    [Debove] Does that mean that we do not talk with each other  enough?    [Kinkel] No. With regard to contacts between ministers, we  have very close relations. That was the case between Roland  Dumas and me. It is also true of the federal chancellor and  other colleagues. We have jointly launched many common actions.  I am thinking, for instance, of the Juppe-Kinkel initiative on  Yugoslavia and our trilateral talks with Poland. I am thinking  of what Alain Juppe and I have acheived together with regard to  an association between the Central and East European countries  and the WEU [Western European Union].    At the level of experts, we have set up a joint working  group  on European questions, which has already met nine times. We  must not allow people to make us believe that there is  irritation which does not really exist in Franco- German  relations. When we had differences of opinion on the subject of  the Uruguay Round in the GATT framework or on the subject of the  EMS [European Monetary System], I constantly pointed out that  even good friends can sometimes face problems and have differing  views on some subjects.    That is not worrying in the least; you just have to discuss  the matter calmly, and that is what we did. France was able to  rely fully on Germany's solidarity, especially on the difficult  issues of recent times. And vice versa. From our viewpoint,  for instance, France's attitude with regard to the question of  Germany's seat on the (UN) Security Council and the support it  gave us on the question of the European Central Bank played an  important role.    [Debove] What will the next joint approaches be?    [Kinkel] One of the most difficult questions that Europe  will  have to settle will be that of the Central and East European  countries' rapprochement with the European Union. As in the  past, Franco-German relations will play an absolutely decisive  role in the success of this process. And I will suggest to  Alain Juppe, my counterpart, that we cooperate particularly  closely in this sphere.    The French side has the greatest interest in the situation  in  the Maghreb. I will suggest mobilizing to clearly show that we  are making a special commitment with regard to that region. On  the continuation of the resolution of the situation in the  former Yugoslavia, France and Germany will in the future have to  continue to cooperate closely as they have done so far, and I am  sure that this will happen.    [Debove] Following the Juppe-Kinkel initiative, should we  not  fear the establishment of a pax americana?    [Kinkel] I think that Alain Juppe, like me, was grateful to  the Americans for becoming more involved in the Yugoslav  question. France has shown an absolutely remarkable involvement  in the former Yugoslavia. It has deployed more than 6,000  soldiers there and has taken a very courageous attitude, with  the president at its head. The Washington agreement really  cannot be described as a pax americana. It is clear that in  drawing up this agreement, the European action plan based on the  Juppe-Kinkel initiative played an absolutely decisive role, and  tribute was expressly paid to it during the signing in  Washington.    [Debove] Will the transfer of the seat of government to  Berlin be the sign of a change in Germany's foreign policy?    [Kinkel] The revolutionary upheavals in Central and East  Europe and in the former Soviet Union, from which Germany  benefited most through reunification, have led to changes in  Europe which have naturally also led to changes in German  policy. But I think that we have succeeded in not giving the  impression that we have even the slightest intention of leaving  the European Community's framework of interests in any way at  all or abandoning the preferential relations between Germany and  France. Quite the reverse. We still want to show restraint in  our foreign policy, especially after reunification, which was  only possible thanks to France and our European partners.    Our aim is not to secure any prerogative or any predominant  position, but we want to remain integrated in the European  Community of interests, in which Franco-German relations are and  remain of special importance.</p>

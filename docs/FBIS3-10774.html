Spanish experts in building  materials-efficient housing are in Santiago de Cuba, where they  will spend three days implementing a training program to turn  out professionals who have mastered the technique. Eduardo  Hernandez, head of the habitat commission of the nongovernmental  organization (Sur) and Inez Sanchez, the representative in Cuba  of that Spanish institution, exchanged views with the people of  Santiago on the importance of moving forward in that specialized  field.    Graduate-level courses on restoration and materials  efficiency in housing construction will begin in Cuban  universities at the end of this year. The courses will last 15  days. It is hoped that, nationwide, some 500 technicians and 50  teachers will be trained in two years.</p>

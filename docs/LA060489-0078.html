			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Rape victims' right of privacy would be extended to all crime victims in New  York under a bill supported by state Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams. Also backing the  measure was Marla Hanson, a model whose face was slashed with razor blades in  an attack three years ago. Hanson said she had been humiliated by sexual  innuendo by a defense attorney for the suspects in the case even though there  was no sexual aspect to the attack. The state's Rape Shield Law bars defense  attorneys from harassing rape victims with inquiries into their sexual  histories. The bill would grant this protection to all crime victims, forcing  defense lawyers to consult with the judge before introducing evidence of a  victim's sex life.  </P></p>

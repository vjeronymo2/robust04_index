			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADING in stock market futures was volatile yesterday as fears of Wall Street weakness failed to materialise and traders straightened their books on the last day of the account, writes Peter John. The futures contract for March delivery opened at 2530, in response to overnight falls in New York equities. It was immediately marked down to around 2522 and reached its estimated fair value of 22 points over cash. Then March picked up slowly throughout the day although each rally was sold down again on pessimism over Wall Street's opening. The gloom was misplaced and dealers trying to leave themselves short were caught in a bear squeeze which sent the contract up to a premium of almost 40 points against the underlying market. This compares with the new fair value estimate of 16 points from Monday. At the official close March was 2,551. It moved up further in after hours dealing. On LTOM, turnover of just over 26,000 contracts was boosted by good two way business in Lonrho. Lonrho saw 4,895 contracts traded, equivalent to 4.9m shares, and volume was boosted by the introduction of a number of new option series. Roll-Royce was also active.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Mortgage market monitor urged A HOUSEBUYERS' council to regulate the mortgage lending industry and improve consumer protection and information was yesterday urged by the Catholic Housing Aid Society. The charity recommended the move after a study it conducted on repossessions found that restrictive lender practices, reinforced by a lack of consumer information, contributed to the rising tide of repossessions. Judges in county courts were criticised for being unwilling to exercise their discretion to postpone repossessions. The housebuyers' council would be responsible for creating a more competitive and efficient mortgage market by developing 'an appropriate regulatory and consumer information framework'. Members of the council would include representatives of government departments, regulators such as the Office of Fair Trading, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and consumer representatives. Its tasks would include: Registering and regulating lenders - mortgages offered by unregistered bodies would not be legally enforceable. Setting a maximum mortgage of 95 per cent of valuation. Establishing a regional network of independent advice centres for housebuyers. Developing and enforcing a code of practice for lenders dealing with arrears. The study is based on 60 repossession cases taken from the files of National Debtline, a Birmingham-based telephone hotline. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, said he would support a more coherent regulatory framework. He warned, however, that it would not be easy to create such a framework given the existing legislation on consumer credit, finan-cial services and estate agencies. Repossessed.

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Letter: Champion of the amateur Sir, May I be allowed to add a word to Noel Goodwin's obituary (Arts, June 22) of Sir Charles Groves? It should not be forgotten that throughout his life Sir Charles was a vigorous champion of the amateur musician, conducting choirs and orchestras throughout the country and giving them the recognition they deserved for their service to the community. For eight years from 1972-1980 Sir Charles was the federation's president and supported our work in every possible way. Since 1980 as a vice president he was unstinting with his time and encouragement for amateur musicians and never once refused our requests for help. Sir Charles' death has deprived us all of our last senior conductor who happily collaborated with amateurs and professionals alike. Russell Jones, director, National Federation of Music Societies, Francis House, Francis Street, London SW1</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / NZ 'heads for first budget surplus in 17 years' New Zealand will show a budget surplus of NZDollars 420m (Dollars 246m) for the year to June 30, the first it will have achieved for 17 years, Mr Bill Birch, finance minister, said yesterday. The forecast is a sharp turnaround from the Treasury prediction made last October before the general election which returned the National party government. The Treasury then had predicted a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn for the June year. Mr Birch said that because of the rapidly improving economy, tax receipts would be NZDollars 2bn higher than expected, while government spending and other costs had been held down. The projected surplus was the latest in a string of good news items on the New Zealand economy. Other recent statistics have shown a steady improvement in the balance of payments, continued low inflation, and strong job creation. National Bank, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary, in its latest survey released yesterday, reported that business confidence remained buoyant. Optimism was increasing in the more densely populated North Island, which until now had been slower to enjoy the economic revival. Two former senior executives of Fortex, a collapsed New Zealand meat company, were yesterday charged with 27 accusations of fraud totalling NZDollars 42m. The charges included publishing a false statement. They were Mr Graeme Thompson, the chief executive and a former New Zealand Businessman of the Year, and Mr Michael Millin, general manager for finance. The Securities Commission and other New Zealand authorities are investigating the company, whose sudden and unexpected collapse in March saw suppliers, farmers and other lenders lose up to NZDollars 160m. Fortex was known internationally for developing new slaughter operations and 24-hour production in an industry that for decades had been in the grip of tough unions. It had an international marketing network, with plans to open a slaughterhouse in Britain. Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver, says he has had over 40 expressions of interest in the company's two plants which are being offered for international tender. They are worth an estimated NZDollars 100m.</p>

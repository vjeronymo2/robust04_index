			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / DTI plans review of company law THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to consider ways of easing disincorporation for companies and to reduce the amount of information required to be filed at Companies House, as part of a review of company law. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, speaking at the Institute of Company Accountants' founders' lecture yesterday, announced the creation of six working groups to consider some of the more technical aspects of the law. The subjects to be covered by the groups flesh out some of the details of the review of the 1985 Companies Act unveiled by Mr Hamilton last November. He says the main thrust of the review is deregulation. The groups will be made up of business people, lawyers, accountants and DTI officials, and will prepare discussion papers for public consultation. They will include: Improvements in the operation of Company Voluntary Arrangements, an insolvency procedure to keep companies out of liquidation, which has been used only infrequently since it was introduced. A reduction in the number of requirements to file information at Companies House. The law on groups of companies. Disincorporation by companies wishing to shed corporate status. Section 151 of the 1985 Act, limiting or prohibiting companies from assisting people to buy shares in them.</p>

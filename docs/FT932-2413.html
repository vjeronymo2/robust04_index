			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Forte leads action with Pounds 100m, 10-year deal THE Eurosterling sector of the international bond market saw plenty of action yesterday, with three substantial offerings: from Forte, WestLB Finance Curacao, and Bayerische Landesbank. Borrowers were keen to exploit the strong demand from investors for sterling-denominated paper, especially on the back of yesterday's inflation and unemployment figures. Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, launched a Pounds 100m, 10-year deal intended to help lengthen the group's maturity profile. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate sterling, substantially reducing the cost of borrowing. Mr Morris Grossfeld, group treasurer, said Forte's recent borrowings in the international bond markets would be used to help pay off an existing Pounds 350m syndicated loan and a Dollars 200m Eurobond issue, both maturing in 1994. 'Our plan was to lengthen our debt maturity and the 10-year area was the maturity we were missing,' Mr Grossfeld said. Forte recently launched a Pounds 90m, 15-year convertible bond issue and a Pounds 200m, 25-year bond issue. The 10-year bonds were launched at a yield spread of 135 basis points over the gilt, tightening to 133 basis points. Bond market participants said the group's credit rating of A-/BAA1 was not especially attractive, but pointed out that there was good demand for 10-year Eurosterling paper at the moment. The deal was bought mainly by UK institutions, although Samuel Montagu, joint-bookrunner with JP Morgan, said European investors looking for a good yield spread over gilts had bought paper. In the Eurodollar sector, City of Yokohama launched a Dollars 190m, 10-year deal. The bonds were launched at a yield spread of 29 basis points over the US Treasury bond, which the lead manager said was in line with a recent offering from City of Kobe. The proceeds were swapped into fixed-rate yen. A Dollars 50m Eurobond from Banco Itamarati of Brazil attracted some attention as it coincided with the announcement of changes to the withholding tax rules applying to Brazilian Eurobonds. Dealers said Brazil had increased the minimum maturity period for Eurobond withholding tax exemption to 36 months from 30 months. The change affects fixed- and floating-rate notes and certificates of deposit.</p>

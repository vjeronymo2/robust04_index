			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimondo Bultrini: "The Left Warns: `Dark Times </F> Are Back'"]    [Text] Rome -- "The darkest times of the five-party system  are back," PDS [Democratic Party of the Left deputy leader]  Massimo D'Alema asserted. "One of the worst moments in the  republic's history," former Labor Minister Gino Giugni echoed.  No, "the worst moment in Italy's history," CGIL [Italian  General Confederation of Labor] Secretary Alfiero Grandi  corrected.    Immediate (or almost) reactions from opponents to  Berlusconi's government came in a crescendo of alarmed and  pessimistic tones. The PPI [Italian Popular Party] also spoke  in hard, uncompromising tones: "The `new' amounts to very  little, and is not always of the highest quality," Rosa Russo  Jervolino said. For his part, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario  Segni asserted that the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] had applied  the Cencelli manual [powersharing system] and favored "many  first republic personalities." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI,  Secretary] Ottaviano del Turco accused Berlusconi of having  given in to [League Secretary] Bossi's "veto power." Such  things used to happen -- the PSI secretary recalled -- during  the so-called First Republic and used to be called instances of  "partyocracy degeneration."    This comparison between the "new" which is being offered to  the country by the new majority, and the old establishment which  is reemerging here and there in Berlusconi's order, has become  to some extent the "refrain" of many current comments: "The  only novelty lies in arrogance," D'Alema said. "The only  criterion is power sharing. And this," he added, "is supposed  to be the new politics? The Second Republic?" Fellow party  member Claudio Petruccioli spoke in almost identical terms: "A  government which certainly seems neither new nor reassuring."    Specific accusations were also made. Again, Russo Jervolino  remarked: "The government is plethoric. The fascists' presence  is significant." It is therefore a government which gives rise  to concern among PPI members "because of the way it came into  being and because of its structure." Again, Segni said: "We  probably owe it to [President] Scalfaro, whom I sincerely thank  for this, that the prime minister's lawyer (Previti -- LA  REPUBBLICA editor's note), who had advocated placing the public  prosecutors under the government's authority, did not get hold  of the Justice Ministry."    The increasing number of opinions expressed as the evening  unfolded, concerned not only the government's overall  composition, but also the individual ministers appointed by the  Knight. The most targeted were [Christian Democratic Center,  CCD, member and new Education Minister] Franceso D'Onofrio ("We  are waiting for him," the Students Union said threateningly),  and [League member and Institutional Reform Minister] Francesco  Speroni, who was the object of former President Cossiga's  sarcasm.    "Now," Cossiga remarked, "we can finally expect a  significant, specific Italian contribution to the never resolved  political-constitutional debate between Schmitt and Felsen on  the role of guarantees in modern rigid constitutions and the  evolution of federalism -- the latter being a subject area which  so far had not been addressed by Italian constitutional science,  and in which Canadian and North American contributions were  predominant." "Now" -- and this is where the sting came --  "this science will be greatly advanced by the new institutional  reform minister." Speroni replied immediately, making use of a  historical quotation: "Federalist Switzerland," he said, "has  been better governed than the Italy of centralist and Christian  Democratic know-it-alls."    "Number One Berlusconi" was not targeted exclusively by  critics. Among the trade unions, only the CGIL was decidedly  against, together with CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade  Unions] member Raffaele Moreste, who, referring to the  government, said doubtfully: "I do not think it is highly  qualified." According to UIL [Italian Federation of Trade  Unions] confederal secretary Giancarlo Fontanelli, "they are men  whose professionalism and prestige are unquestionable," while  CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni preferred to wait for "the platforms  and the choices made" before giving an opinion.    A wait-and-see position was also adopted by Confindustria,  which requested Berlusconi to "present an `organic' platform, as  well as immediate initiatives in the areas of taxation, finance,  and the labor market." Small businessmen, on the other hand,  did not conceal their satisfaction, speaking as they did of "a  firm statement of trust," while they waited -- as Confapi  [Italian Confederation of Small Industrialists] Chairman  Alessandro Cocirio said -- "for economic recovery, particularly  for small- and medium-sized businesses." Stock Exchange Council  chairman Attilio Ventura also expressed "personal satisfaction."  In his view, "we have a solid government," which "for some  time, the country had been waiting for," with the economic  portfolios having been "given to people who are competent and  businesslike." The women in Federcasalinghe [housewives  federation] were also "fully satisfied," particularly "because  of the creation of a Family Ministry," their chairwoman Federica  Rossi Gasparrini explained.    Finally, magistrates were cautious: "There are no objections  in principle among magistrates," said national secretary Livio  Pepino, "but we will be looking very closely at the minister's  choices." Tribute to new Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi was  paid by Pact for Italy deputy Pietro Milio, the criminal lawyer  currently defending former Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic  Security Service] employee Bruno Contrada: "A valid and  appropriate choice," he said.</p>

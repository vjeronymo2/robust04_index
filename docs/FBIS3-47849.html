He said the plan was discussed among some U.S. officials  soon  after North Korea declared to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty (NPT) on March 12, 1993.    But Seoul and Washington have never discussed the plan  together, formally or informally, the official said. Neither  has the United States suggested to Seoul such a plan, he said.    He said the U.S. Government did not adopt the policy because  there were doubts about its effectiveness in making North Korea  withdraw its decision to leave the NPT.    Seoul's position on this matter is that the joint  declaration  on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula which was signed  between the two Koreas on Dec. 31, 1991, was primarily a promise  between the two, the official said.    It believes that more important at this stage is to reopen  the suspended Joint Nuclear Control Commission (JNCC) to discuss  implementation of the declaration, he said.    Moreover, an additional procedure to make the declaration an  international treaty may not be necessary because the United  Nations has already mentioned the declaration in its resolutions  concerning the North Korean matter, he said.    The official, however, agreed on a possibility that the  United States and South Korea may differ on this matter because  of their different viewpoints on the North Korean nuclear matter.    While Washington's primary concern is to have Pyongyang give  up its nuclear weapons development program using all available  means, Seoul needs to be more cautious as it is a matter  concerning the fate of the nation, he said.    The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the  Korean Peninsula which took effect on Feb. 19, 1992, requires  the two Koreas not to possess nuclear reprocessing or uranium  enrichment facilities.    This prohibition of nuclear reprocessing and enrichment  facilities has caused a serious debate inside South Korea since  then and many conservatives in the country are still calling for  a review of the declaration.    They, most of all, insist that the South, which produces  some  50 percent of its electricity using nuclear power plants, needs  nuclear reprocessing plants for economic and technological  reasons rather than for strategic reasons.    Quoting a high-ranking government source, a local daily  reported yesterday that the United States is demanding the South  agree to making the inter-Korean declaration an international  treaty, where the two Koreas are guaranteed stable supply of  nuclear fuel in return for giving up nuclear reprocessing  facilities.</p>

The exchange of notes came as a result of the implementation  of agreements concluded at the Russo-American summit in  Vancouver last April. It is intended to officially assert the  high level of mutual understanding between Russia and the United  states in the sphere of consular relations, to systematise and  facilitate to the maximum all the visa formalities, and also to  eliminate obsolete provisions which are ineffective and  contradict the current spirit of cooperation.    The agreement is based on the principle of issuing multiple  visas for terms ranging from one to two years to a considerable  share of the citizens of both countries. This refers primarily  to participants of various exchanges in the sphere of science  and education, officials of joint Russo-American organisations,  companies and banks, businessmen, and also certain categories of  officials of state institutions, making official trips.    This agreement, which will take effect as of January 15,  1994, cogs in with the relations of partnership and cooperation,  typical for current Russo-American relations, and pursues the  purpose of further promoting political, commercial, economic,  scientific, and technological cooperation, expanding contacts  among people and between the public organisations of the Russian  Federation and the United States, the report of the Russian  Foreign Ministry's Consular Department notes.</p>

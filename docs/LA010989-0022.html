			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Hard Rock Cafe in New Orleans is caught between a rock and a hard city  commission that has turned down a request for a "walk of fame" on the sidewalks  surrounding the French Quarter eatery. The restaurant wants to install a dozen  brass plaques, emblazoned with stars, as tributes to musicians who have visited  the Hard Rock. Similar plaques have been planted at Hard Rock Cafes in other  cities. The Vieux Carre Commission, which guards the architectural integrity of  the French Quarter, the oldest section of the Mississippi River port city, said  that the quarter should not be home to memorials for the living and that  sidewalks should not be used for advertising. The cafe will resubmit the  proposal. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

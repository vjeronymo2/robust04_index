			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Book Review: When it's time to go to the country REFERENDUMS AROUND THE WORLD: THE GROWING USE OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY Edited by David Butler and Austin Ranney AEI Press, Dollars 19.95, 304 pages Democracy is always evolving. Now, just as its triumph over totalitarian ideologies appears as-sured, representative government - the goal of western democrats since the American and French revolutions  - is under challenge from a different quarter. The call for change comes from those who can be described as 'direct democrats'. Dissatisfied with the limitations of representative democracy, they want to give ordinary citizens an active role in government. Their main demand is wider use of referendums - something on which they are making significant headway. Theirs is a fraught struggle - and is bound to be so since they confront one of the world's most entrenched vested interests: the class of professional politicians. This excellent study is both a catalogue of, and a commentary on, referendums across the world since the French Revolution. Nearly 800 national referendums are listed. While no decade before the 1970s records more than 80 referendums, there were 177 in the 1970s and 153 in the 1980s, about half in bona fide democracies. The tally for the 1990s looks set to exceed 200. David Butler and Austin Ranney's catalogue includes most modern dictatorships - a reminder that referendums can also be a handy aid to dictators. But referendums have played key roles in transitions to democracy. Like elections and bills of rights, however, the democratic credibility of a referendum is only ever as strong as a community's political conscience and culture (and dictators) permit. For mature democracies, the key issue is whether referendums can deepen democracy by generating informed public debate on policy questions, and not just prejudice manipulated by demagogues or the media. The experience of Switzerland is critical to any assessment because that country has held more referendums than all other nations combined. With 6.5m citizens, and a regime which since 1848 has proved more durable, democratic and prosperous than virtually any other, its example may offer important lessons for other democracies. In addition to mandatory referendums on constitutional changes, 100,000 Swiss citizens can oblige the state, by means of an 'initiative', to hold referendums on laws passed by parliament or on proposed constitutional reforms of their own devising. The Swiss typically vote on six to 12 national questions a year, spread over two to four separate ballots. Four striking conclusions emerge from the chapter by Kris Kobach, a former Oxford University doctoral student: Switzerland's representative institutions are not rendered irrelevant by the referendum process. Rather, parliament and the government are guaranteed a significant constitutional role, with power to make counter-proposals and to delay polls. Popular votes generally support earlier parliamentary decisions. But the prospect of a referendum on an issue, and the need to carry majorities in more than half the 23 cantons for constitutional changes, weighs on ministers and MPs. The referendum in Switzerland has in effect taken the role played by the opposition in other western democracies. Since 1959, the Swiss government has been a permanent cross-communal coalition of four largest parties, obliged to conduct a continual dialogue with citizens. Although most 'initiatives' are defeated, they are still influential. Kobach cites the 1989 'initiative' proposing to abolish the Swiss army. It was defeated. But the 36 per cent vote in favour exceeded expectations, prompting cuts in the size of the army, a relaxation of military service and a civilian option for men (a proposal rejected in a 1984 referendum). In Switzerland, then, referendums go hand in hand with federalism and a consensual approach to government. That means the Swiss model cannot simply be transplanted into different traditions. Ireland is a case in point. In his chapter, Vernon Bogdanor, reader in politics at Oxford University, argues that the republic abolished its variant of 'the initiative' in 1937 partly, it seems, for fear that it could result in the tyranny of the majority. On the same grounds, one could argue, a referendum process is unlikely to help secure lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Much would depend on the definitions of electorates and guarantees for Catholic and Protestant communities, each of which fears persecution by the other. If an Irish federation combining the republic and Northern Ireland ever emerged, localised referendums could help provide legitimacy. Bogdanor also discusses what lies behind the increasing resort to direct democracy in western Europe. He argues the rise of representative government in the late 19th century was accompanied by the rise of mass political parties. Dominated by professional politicians reliant on office for status and income, the parties halted movement towards direct forms of democracy. Voters accepted this, believing their interests depended on 'their' party's triumph. Now, however, ever fewer voters in the west identify with a single party, while ever more are suspicious of politicians. It is no accident that Italy, whose party system generated patronage and corruption on a massive scale, is the European country to witness the most dramatic increase in the use of the referendum in the past decade. A century ago AV Dicey, the English constitutionalist, predicted that, 'once established, the referendum would never be got rid of by anything short of a revolution'. He may be right but, in Britain and perhaps elsewhere, political revolutions may be needed to make it an integral part of government in the first place.</p>

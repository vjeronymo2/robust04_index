			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Corporation cut may prove cruellest: In the second of a series on the tax base, Philip Coggan considers a fierce debate The government's financial position has sharply deteriorated this decade, with the public sector moving from surplus to the Pounds 50bn deficit expected for this financial year. April's tax increases, which will have a substantial effect on consumers' pay packets, are designed to restore the health of the public purse. Economic recession has been the main cause of the problem, with unemployment causing a rise in social-security spending and a fall in tax revenues. But there is also a debate as to whether government actions have weakened the tax base and created a structural deficit on top of the cyclical effect. One key issue is whether events in the mid-1980s had effects on corporation tax receipts which are still working through the system. The debate was outlined by Mr Bill Robinson, a former adviser to the last chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, in a series of FT articles last summer. His argument was that the 1986 oil-price fall caused a sharp drop in petroleum tax revenues. This was temporarily disguised by a surge in corporation tax receipts, which had two causes. The first was the vigorous expansion of the economy in 1986-88. The second was former chancellor Lord Lawson's reforms in 1984, which reduced corporation tax rates from 52 per cent to 35 per cent over time but severely cut the tax shelter provided by the capital allowances. According to the Treasury bulletin, published in the summer of 1992, these two factors meant that 'growth in corporation tax receipts accounted for something like one-third of the swing in the public finances from deficit to surplus between 1984-85 and 1988-89. At its peak in 1990, corporation tax contributed about 11 per cent of total tax and National Insurance receipts'. These buoyant revenues may have made the government over-confident and led to the tax cuts in the 1988 Budget. But then came the recession. The Treasury bulletin stated: 'Changes to capital allowances and loss offset provisions, and the abolition of stock relief, have made (corporation tax) receipts more sensitive to the cycle over the long term.' Corporation tax revenues have dropped from Pounds 21.5bn in 1989-90 to the official forecast of Pounds 14.7bn for this financial year. Mr Robinson believes this decline laid bare the weakness resulting from the oil-price decline and the income tax cuts of 1988. The point is far from universally accepted. Lord Lawson describes the argument as 'complete nonsense from beginning to end'. He says the government was well aware of the effect of falling oil taxes and had planned accordingly. Lord Lawson says the main cause of the government's financial difficulties is the surge in public spending in the early 1990s - to be fair, this is also a main part of Mr Robinson's argument. On the tax side, Lord Lawson points to two factors. He says the 1980s saw a tendency for profits to increase as a percentage of GDP (in part a reaction to the 1970s era of low profits). GDP was also growing strongly. The recession therefore caused a sharp fall in tax receipts but he believes this cyclical effect will work for the government as the economy recovers. There is support for Lord Lawson's arguments. In its green budget, published last year, the Institute of Fiscal Studies analysed the ratio of corporation tax liabilities to company profits, which declined from a peak of more than 50 per cent in 1990-91 to about 47 per cent in 1992-93. The institute, however, said: 'This is not a dramatic decline, and tax remains higher relative to profits than in the early 1980s. There is certainly no indication that revenues will not recover with profits.' Even the Treasury has admitted, albeit in mandarin-speak, that it took its eye off the public-spending ball in the late 1980s. In its summer 1993 bulletin it said: 'Spending accelerated uniformly across programmes from 1988-89 with GGE (general government expenditure) rising by over 3 per cent a year. The rise in GGE was partly cyclical and this element can be expected to reverse as the economic recovery gathers pace. But there were also structural or underlying increases reflecting rising expectations and demand for public services.' Mr Robinson agrees that excessive growth in public spending helped cause the deterioration in the government's finances. Looking at the changes in the government's financing plans between 1990 and 1993, he argues that, if one excludes the effects of the recession, the government spent Pounds 19bn more than expected. But he also points out that its revenues were Pounds 13bn less than forecast. Time alone will settle the argument. If as the economy recovers tax revenues fail to pick up by as much as expected, the government will have to re-examine its 1980s reforms.</p>

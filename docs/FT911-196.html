			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Arts: The Black Rider - Berlin Theatre Festival To kill your wife in a shooting accident is one thing; to turn the episode into a musical would seem, gall aside, to invite theatrical fiasco in the worst of taste. Add lyrics that slide between German and English, a set that crosses von Sternberg with a western, rock music with fairground honky-tonk, and disaster looks assured. So it is with reluctant but moonstruck admiration that I report The Black Rider (text: William Burroughs) as the star of the Berlin Theatre Festival (to May 20) and one of the most delightful, inventive, profound and originally musical musicals composed; a fitting - self-consciously so - successor to those other mythical English-German concoctions, The Threepenny Opera and Cabaret. The Black Rider overlays the modern legend of Burroughs, the Beatnik junkie who shot his wife, with the old tale of the village clerk who has to pass muster as marksman before he can marry the gamekeeper's daughter. He makes a pact in 'silver bullets' with the devil but on his wedding day Satan betrays him and he shoots dead not the targetted white dove but his wife. This was the story, converted to a happy ending, of Weber's Der Freischutz. Now Burroughs, the Texan director and stage designer Robert Wilson, and rock composer Tom Waits, have reworked the original into a contemporary version. Other myths get woven in. Wilson's devil is a sleek Master of ceremonies in whiplash tails who croons the Cabaret welcome 'So come on in/it ain't no sin/take off your skin/and dance around in your bones'. He introduces the cast, his 'devil's band', as they step one by one out of a black felt sentry-box. For three hours of graceful, cold artifice, they look, act and sound like figures from the silent movies: movements abrupt, irregular, too fast, too slow, as if wound up by a shaky hand projector; chalk-white, bony faces, blackened eye sockets, lips thickened into permanent red pouts. Every image is ice-hard: hair pulled back crisp or standing up in spikes, clothes exagerating bodies with jagged collars, razor pleats, square and rectangular dresses. The set continues the theme; Wilson turns children's drawings into three-dimensional monstrosities. Crooked chairs, two metres high, dangle at odd angles along with a huge frame whose broken glass juts into the flesh of its 'living' picture, the gamekeeper's ancestor (Heinz Fossbrink). Pine trees are scissor cut-outs which collapse and grow again like cartoons, illuminated sugar pink and lime green against a black forest. Large or small scale, Wilson is a master of spectacle: the clerk William and his Katchen floating above the stage for a duet as the great neon sign of a gun descends before them; the white stockinged leg in red stiletto that appears out of a slit in the black sentrybox, image of naivety, severity, brittle romance. Best of all, the whole, the sustained dramatic unity of the vision, is greater than the sum of its parts. Tom Waits' sarcastic ballads, full of folk and blues and rock, call back the scarred idealism and mock simplicity of Kurt Weill, while Burroughs' monosyllabic banality has here found the setting which makes it seem perfect. Nursery rhyme humour marries English with German, while Hollywood kitsch rolls into Teutonic romanticism. Wilson's cast bop and strut and beat out the mesmeric rhythms in husky tempting voices. The devil (Dominique Horwitz) has the best tunes, and mocks us for loving them. In 'Last Rose of Summer' he picks a flower from the floor, affects a tear, disappears into his box and, inside it, hovers up to the roof of the stage. Annette Paulmann and Stefan Kurt, as Katchen and William, screech like vultures and sing like angels. She plays an imaginary piano and draws patterns in the air as she sings the breathless lyric 'I'll shoot the moon right out of the sky for you, baby'; he dances a ballet of despair, shock and loss breaking through his wax face, before rallying with 'I'll be back on some lucky day'. This production returns to Hamburg's Thalia Theatre after Berlin, with a stop in Amsterdam on May 14-16. So far plans for a London visit have not materialised, but this is a show worth a plane ticket. Scene from The Black Rider, unexpected hit of the Berlin Theatre Festival</p>

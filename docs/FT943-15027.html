			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / No end of ways for an MP to top up pay As Reverend William McCrea can testify, there are no end of ways in which MPs can supplement their Pounds 31,687 salaries without accepting payment for tabling parliamentary questions. The Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster has an alternative source of income more unusual than most: he is a gospel recording artist. But he is not alone at Westminster in turning his creativity to profit. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mrs Edwina Currie, the former health minister, write fiction. Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the veteran Tory MP for Perth and Kinross, paints. No doubt Mr Hurd would continue to write and the Rev McCrea to sing irrespective of whether they were MPs. More controversial are the ways in which MPs exploit their positions to augment their income. Probably the most common method is agreeing to act as non-executive directors or parliamentary advisers for companies, trade associations and pressure groups. Some directorships pre-date the time when an individual became an MP; equally not all terminate when an MP ends his or her association with Westminster. But an MP on the payroll is particularly useful for organisations which are keen to keep up with developments in parliament and ensure their views are given satisfactory airings in the corridors of power. One service which MPs might provide in return for their retainers is tabling parliamentary questions on subjects of interest to their remunerator. Another widespread source of income which is often but not always dependent on an individual's position as an MP are fees received for journalism and broadcasting. Many allude to such payments in the annual register of members' interests - including Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, who writes a fortnightly column in Travel Weekly; and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who contributes two regular racing columns. Restrictions on ministers are more stringent than those on ordinary MPs. Directorships must be relinquished on taking office. Investments which might give rise to a conflict of interest - actual or apparent - should be disposed of or put in a blind trust. This sometimes results in MPs having to take a sharp fall in income on being promoted to office. Many ministers are permitted to remain members of the Lloyd's insurance market. But they must obtain clearance from the prime minister to do so. Corporate directorships and many of the available posts as parliamentary adviser are traditionally associated with Conservative MPs. What is traditionally associated with their Labour counterparts is sponsorship by a trade union. Details in the register of members' interests are often accompanied by a note saying there is no personal gain to the MP concerned. There are one or two examples of Labour MPs having links with companies, however. The register indicates that Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, advises three companies, while Mr Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry North West, is chairman of a machine-tool company and an engineering group. This is sometimes said to be the age of the career politician, with more and more MPs seeming to arrive at Westminster with little experience of employment outside one party organisation or another. But there is not much evidence that the extent of outside interests or the high proportion of MPs who have them is on the decline. Just 60 MPs had nothing to declare in the 1994 register, a document requiring disclosure of overseas visits and land and property holdings in addition to other interests. In 1987, the corresponding figure was 82.</p>

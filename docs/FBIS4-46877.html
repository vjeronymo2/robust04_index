			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Suren Harutyunyan, former first secretary of </F> the Armenian Communist Party, by Ruben Hayrabedyan in Moscow;  date not specified]    [Excerpts] After his voluntary departure Suren Harutyunyan,  the former first secretary of the Central Committee of the  Armenian Communist Party, avoided any interviews with the  republic's press. He did not wish to cast any shadow on the  leadership of the republic or to play any destabilizing role in  Armenia's political affairs. However, recently various rumors  began to spread about him, some approaching the proportions of  absurdity. First they said, to Harutyunyan's surprise, that he  is a leading representative of Russian-American business (let us  say that he goes to work at the Russian Foreign Ministry by  metro). Then they linked his name with the leader of one of the  factions of the Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. Then they  accused him of being a renegade within the Armenian Communist  Party. When I called Harutyunyan to ask for an interview, he  said that he considers it below his dignity to answer those  charges, adding: "I have been in politics for too long to  respond to them." However, he is prepared to talk and express  his thoughts about Armenia, the destiny of his people and the  most recent period of its history.    [Passage omitted]    [Hayrabedyan] Now it is possible to hear in Armenia  "diatribes" that if Harutyunyan had been more decisive, the  opposition would not have assumed power and thus would not cause  so much damage to the people with the mismanagement it has  demonstrated in its administration of the state and would not  have turned a prosperous republic into ruins.    [Harutyunyan] They acted "more decisively" in Georgia and  Azerbaijan, and what happened? The fact that no blood was shed  in the explosive environment of those days and things did not  escalate into a civil war, was principally an accomplishment of  Armenia's leadership at that time and not that of the  opposition, as it is often portrayed. The latter approached  matters with the principle of "the worse it gets the better it  is for us" and tried to provoke the authorities. Recall the  sieges laid to buildings during the meetings of the Supreme  Soviet, the acts of violence against some deputies and so forth.  One cannot enumerate all of them. There were many opportunities  to use forceful methods. But deliberately we did not resort to  such steps to avoid creating in the republic a conflict  situation with tragic consequences. On the other hand I should  not conceal the fact that they put much pressure on me from  Moscow and in Yerevan to undertake the "decisive" steps you  mentioned. I can only imagine how they would condemn me then and  now if I had used force. [passage omitted]    [Hayrabedyan] Mr Harutyunyan, let us now discuss a very  sensitive subject: Armenia's independence. You were the  republic's leader when it was under "Russia's yoke" and when  Russia was "plundering our national treasures" and was  "trampling" over our national feelings and so forth. We were  able to win that independence, and now we are running from it as  if it was the plague. And where do we run? Overwhelmingly to the  detested "imperialist Russia." It always seemed to me that,  given our geographical location and limited resources  (especially energy), Armenia would be the last to leave the  USSR--it had to. Please tell me how you view Armenia's  independence.    [Harutyunyan] I welcome the independence of our fatherland.  The independence of any nation deserves respect. On the other  hand when I look at today's poor Armenia, I begin to wonder  whether this is what the struggle was for, whether this is what  every Armenian dreamed of and whether everything was done  correctly. To be frank, I have thought at great length about  these issues and I have always always been told that I have a  cautious approach with regard to the concept of independence for  Armenia. As a consequence of my work, I knew well the republic,  its capabilities and means and I often asked myself whether we  can survive on our own. There is no need to look too far. Only  18 percent of our raw material needs came from local sources.  Our entire supply of fuel, iron, and was imported. We imported  80 percent of materials needed for light industry. Our domestic  farm production accounted for 25 percent of our grain needs, 39  percent of dairy needs and 60 percent of the meat we needed. One  can enumerate such numbers ad infinitum.    [Hayrabedyan] Yes, but did not the proponents of  independence  know about that? If they did, what did they rely on?    [Harutyunyan] You should ask that question to them. If you  add to what I said the unreliability of our surroundings and the  lack of any access to open seas, then you find yourself facing  an unpromising situation. It is wonderful when you achieve peace  and prosperity with independence. Independence is preferable  even when the situation does not get any worse. But when life  turns into a complete hell and when tens of thousands of people  are forced to flee the promised land...    This automatically leads to the question: How did Armenia,  the prosperous republic of not so long ago, end up in a pit of  disasters? Do we not guilty when we seek self-sufficiency and  when our own resources are highly exaggerated? The lessons of  the last few years, as bitter as they may be, are very  instructive for our people. Hrant Matevosyan is right when he  writes: "Today we are settling old scores with the empire, but  was it not that empire that fed and clothed us? Did we not smile  and laugh? Were we not happy with our lives? Were we not in  charge of our lives?"    [Hayrabedyan] At a recent anniversary ceremony in Moscow  [poet and activist] Silva Kaputikyan said bitterly that  evidently the people can also make mistakes.    [Harutyunyan] The truth is that winning independence is  completely different from demonstrating it. How can you arouse  the people and fight for an idea when you do not know how you  can realize it and when you do not have a more or less realistic  program for national development. I repeat: I am also attracted  to the idea of an independent national state, but I knew well  that political independence without economic independence is a  hollow notion.    [Hayrabedyan] For 70 years we said that Armenia cannot exist  without Russia. Then, over the course of a few months, we  "proved" unexpectedly that we can live better without the  Russians. After all, "we have cognac, mineral water, and we are  a talented people." There were even threats uttered against  Russia. You have held leadership positions in Moscow and  Yerevan. You know the domain of relations between the two  countries well. What is the place of Russia in our nation's  destiny?    [Harutyunyan] "Having been liberated" from Russia we now  turn  to it--let us be candid--with begging hands. In the past we  demanded even more. Could the well-fed and satisfied Armenian of  Soviet Armenia ever contemplate going into exile? Today a  degradation of the nation is under way. Its character is  changing. We are losing our national dignity. We are becoming  uninvited guests and making our hosts nervous.    I think that Armenia must have good relations first with its  neighbors, including Turkey, and it must have strong ties with  Europe and the United States. However, every small nation must  have its supremacies [as published] in its geopolitics. Whether  we like it or not, we are condemned to be together with the  Russians. I think that in the aftermath of the events of the  last few years we realized once again Russia's role in the  protection of Armenia's independence. To me this is very natural  and does not need additional proof. In that context, I would  like to say the following: I am terrified by even the  theoretical possibility that what happened to the USSR may  happen to Russia--that is the disintegration of that country.  With whom will we be left then? Every Armenian must think about  that. [passage omitted]    [Hayrabedyan] Do you not think that in Armenia there are  forces that wish to discredit you in order to isolate you from  the republic's political life?    [Harutyunyan] I feel very comfortable with regard to  everything that is undertaken around my name. It would be  surprising if my person were viewed unequivocally, perhaps for  the simple reason that I had the task of governing the republic  during an extremely critical period. However, it is another  matter when there is inserious talk. Being unwilling to rise  above their unrealized ambitions, my opponents sink to the  cheapest levels of defamation. Experience shows that the "most  demanding" critics are those who demand the impossible from  others because they do not know what to do and how to do it.    [Hayrabedyan] What would you say about Armenia's Communist  Party? In general how do you view your past? Do you try to erase  it?    [Harutyunyan] The Armenian Communist Party was in a deep  crisis in as early as 1988. It had been weakened in an  organizational and political sense. But that was not a  phenomenon that occurred in Armenia alone. The entire Communist  Party of the Soviet Union was sick. The course that events took  not only in Armenia but also across the entire Soviet Union can  largely be explained by that phenomenon.    Today, the Armenian Communist Party is being rebuilt on new  foundations. I believe that it has quite promising capabilities  to influence the process of extricating the republic from the  jaws of this brutal crisis. My posture with regard to the work  of the Communist Party as well as that of the other political  parties in Armenia is one of supreme respect. I would only  caution that a wave of orthodoxy does not overtake the Communist  Party, especially given the fact that it is operating in the  especially peculiar conditions of Armenia's reality.    As for my past, we learn lessons from the past. What has  happened is my life, and I would not run away from it under any  circumstances.    [Hayrabedyan] So, Mr Harutyunyan, what do we have today? We  have a fatherland with a ruined economy, a population that is on  the brink of bankruptcy and despair and horrifying levels of  unemployment. Meanwhile the war goes on, and the country  continues to lose intellectuals and entrepreneurs. The people  are completely depoliticized. How can they live? What must be  done?    [Harutyunyan] It is useless to make any predictions, given  Armenia's current situation. I would not want to come across as  a self-proclaimed strategist who watches the battle from the  sidelines. I have met not too few such individuals. The present  Armenian authorities have made many mistakes and have many  flaws. On the other hand, I understand the objective  difficulties that loom before our nation and the leadership of  our republic.    There are many critics, but constructive approaches are  missing. Today there are more questions than answers. The  principal weakness of the present opposition is precisely that  it, too, cannot answer the question "What is the way out?" Today  there is an evident struggle for survival in the land of  Armenians. Obviously everyone is doing that the best way he can.  But we cannot be saved individually. I sympathize with those  people who believe that a pannational program to extricate  ourselves from the current impasse is our principal task.  Armenia is stepping into the 21st century without a planned  national program. The incompetence of Armenia's political mind  is discouraging.    In the present circumstances I support not the division of  the public but its unity and national consensus. Today none of  the Armenian political parties have the ability to extricate the  country from its crisis. It is essential to bring together all  patriotic forces and to form a united broad-based front for  national salvation. The condition of the republic sometimes  appears to be insurmountable. Even so, I am convinced that the  country may be reborn and joy may come to the Armenian hearth.  The only thing that is necessary is that that hope and belief  does not die out in the heart and mind of every Armenian.  [passage omitted]</p>

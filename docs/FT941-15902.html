			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Howe attacks conduct of Iraq arms inquiry: Scott dismisses as ludicrous accusation that he was 'detective' and 'inquisitor' The validity of the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry was brought into question yesterday in a spirited public attack by Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary. Appearing as a witness, Lord Howe criticised the conduct of the inquiry in a lengthy statement, and issued a veiled threat that Lord Justice Scott's eventual recommendations would be considered invalid by officials and ministers. He accused Lord Justice Scott of acting as 'detective, inquisitor, advocate and judge'. In particular, Lord Howe said he was concerned that witnesses did not have the right to be represented by counsel or to cross-examine other witnesses. Lord Justice Scott described Lord Howe's criticisms as ludicrous and insisted that no official or minister had complained to the inquiry. Downing Street emphasised last night that Lord Howe was speaking for himself and not the government. Lord Justice Scott had to decide on procedures once the decision on the form of the inquiry had been taken. However, Lord Howe insisted he had consulted officials and ministers and said they supported his stand. It also emerged last night that his views are shared by senior Foreign Office and Downing Street officials. It is not clear if his attack will undermine the inquiry's conclusions. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to make an immediate statement reaffirming his confidence in Lord Justice Scott. Mr Smith said Lord Howe's attack was a 'deliberate and clearly premeditated attempt' to undermine the findings of the inquiry 'only four days before the prime minister is due to give evidence'. Earlier Lord Howe had claimed to be speaking largely on behalf of what he called his former 'flock' at the Foreign Office - officials, ministers, and intelligence officers. He said the Scott inquiry had not fully complied with the 'cardinal principles' for conducting a public inquiry in a fair way. 'Many of those who are looking at these proceedings from outside are bound to be less enthusiastic to accept conclusions in so far as the cardinal principles have not been complied with,' Lord Howe said. The 'principles' referred to by Lord Howe are guidelines for the conduct of public inquiries laid down by the Salmon royal commission report of 1965. The commission was set up after strong criticism of Lord Denning's inquiry into the Profumo affair. It recommended that witnesses should be allowed to be represented by counsel. Downing Street would not be drawn on whether the procedures adopted by Lord Justice Scott were right or wrong. Mr Major would have a better idea of this after he appears next Monday. It pointed out that if Lord Justice Scott's investigations had taken the form of a tribunal of inquiry, the matter would have been sub judice and subject to reporting restrictions. In a statement read out by the secretary to the inquiry, Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, Lord Justice Scott said the inquiry's procedures were 'established with a view to ensuring its efficient conduct while paying full regard to the need to safeguard the interests of individuals'. He pointed out that witnesses were allowed to ask for legal assistance and would be given every opportunity to respond to personal criticism of their conduct before the final report. Later, Lord Justice Scott received a vote of confidence from Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, former head of the civil service, who said he was sure the judge was conducting the inquiry with 'judicial fairness.'</p>

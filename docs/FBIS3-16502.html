			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Mircea Snegur by Pol Mathil; place </F> and date not given: "Mircea Snegur On Moldova And Europe"]    [Text] [Mathil] How are we supposed to call your country:  Moldavia or Moldova?    [Snegur] Moldova.    [Mathil] Why?    [Snegur] Because that is what our ancestors called it. It is  the name of a river. Moldavia is more Russian.    [Mathil] Is your national anthem still the same as  Romania's?    [Snegur] Yes. Soon we will have our own.    [Mathil] Despite your historical links with Romania, in  which  Moldova was one of the provinces between the two world wars,  your citizens ruled out unification with Romania at the first  pluralist elections held in late February. Why?    [Snegur] The links are clear. We speak the same language and  we used to be part of Romania. However, the Moldovan conscience  has never disappeared. It created for itself a geographical and  demographic framework. Within this framework, the population is  65 percent Moldovan and 35 percent Ukrainian, Gagauz  (Turkish-speaking orthodox), Bulgarian, etc. Today, all of this  makes up a whole. During a recent national survey, 95 percent of  the citizens said they supported independence.    [Mathil] Can this result be interpreted as a sign of  Moldova's return to Russia?    [Snegur] I know that such an interpretation exists, but I am  convinced that the Moldovan president and parliamentary majority  will prove that it is a wrong interpretation.    [Mathil] It is claimed that you have yielded before the  threat of a definitive secession of "the Russian-speaking  Republic of Dnestr," where the Russian 14th Army is located,  which alone is capable of imposing peace. Is the approach to  Moscow the price of Russian mediation in this conflict?    [Snegur] Our relations with the democratic forces of Russia  and President Yeltsin are completely satisfactory. Yeltsin  himself has said on several occasions that he was in favor of a  united Moldova. While we are fully aware that in Moscow there  are currently forces that take a different turn than Yeltsin's,  I hope that we will manage to maintain good relations. We  therefore accept Russian mediation.    [Mathil] Do you also agree to having the Russian Army stay  in  Transdnestr?    [Snegur] No. The Army must be pulled out. Negotiations on  this are currently being held.    [Mathil] Can your country be compared to Georgia, which has  been torn apart by the secession of Abkhazia, where the Russian  Army plays a similar role?    [Snegur] The situation is different. We managed to stop the  conflict at the outset. The support of the population was  greater, and so was the stability in the country.    [Mathil] Do you not think that your country, like Georgia or  Tajikistan, is the target of Moscow's new doctrine toward  regions which can be called "near neighbors?" Is this not an  attempt to reconstruct a sort of "imperial" entity around Moscow?    [Snegur] There are obviously mutual interests, Russian  interests in Moldova and Moldovan interests in Russia. It is  normal after a long period of economic links and  hypercentralization within the Soviet Union.    [Mathil] Solely economic links?    [Snegur] Yes. We are members of the CIS economic union, but  not of its military structures.    [Mathil] Where do Russian ambitions end?    [Snegur] You should ask Moscow that question.    [Mathil] What do you think of Russian pressure, mostly in  the  energy sector, with regard to Ukraine, your large neighbor?    [Snegur] I would not like to comment on the relations  between  two sovereign states. On the energy front, Moldova is in a more  favorable situation.    [Mathil] What do you think of the secessionist aspirations  of  Crimea?    [Snegur] I am categorically against any secession. The  separatist evil must be stopped.    [Mathil] Are you afraid of Zhirinovskiy?    [Snegur] He should not be underestimated. Everyone from the  former Soviet territory must be very vigilant and create the  living conditions that prevent populism from taking root.    [Mathil] You and your government are former members of the  old Communist Party. Moreover, the parties openly proclaiming  their Communist heritage scored well in the recent elections.  Is the reform program being threatened?    [Snegur] A return to Communism is neither possible nor  acceptable. I am a reformer. The large majority of the new  parliament was elected on a program of reform and privatization.    [Mathil] Starting Wednesday, Moldova will be the 12th  central  and eastern European country to have signed the Partnership for  Peace. What do you expect from the West?    [Snegur] Help to enable us to restore both internal and  external stability, and to help us find our place in Europe.    [Mathil] To join the Partnership, the Russians are asking  for  a "special status"...    [Snegur] I do not know about this issue of a "special  status," but Russia is a major power.    [Mathil] Do you not think that Russia's current foreign  policy reflects certain expansionist tendencies?    [Snegur] You are no doubt referring to certain peace  missions  to try and resolve conflicts in the old Soviet republics.  Without Russia we could not find a solution to these conflicts.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: FICTION FOR YOUNG READERS;  </P> <P> OUR SIXTH-GRADE SUGAR BABIES BY EVE BUNTING (HARPERCOLLINS CHILDREN'S BOOKS:  $12.95; 146 PP.; AGES 9-11)  </P> <P> Babies, boys and big ears. These are the things on Vicki's mind. Babies,  because she and her sixth-grade classmates have been assigned to carry around  five-pound bags of sugar for a week as a lesson in what parental responsibility  might be like. Boys, because a cute seventh-grade one has moved in across the  street. And big ears, because she suffers from the fear that hers are  unacceptably large.  </P> <P> Vicki, narrator of "Our Sixth-Grade Sugar Babies," shares her insecurities and  insights -- such as they are -- with the self-deprecating humor of a  pre-adolescent aching to grow up. She and her overly freckled friend Ellie are  gaga over the new boy, whom they call Thunk -- for Terrific Hunk. In her quest  to appear terribly cool (or at least not be a total dweeb) before Thunk, Vicki  ditches her sugar baby. Her deception seems to lead to the disappearance of an  elderly neighbor, and Vicki must find them both and decide just how far to go  in owning up to her errors.  </P> <P> Vicki's family situation is pure '90s: She lives with her mother, a CPA who  works at home. Her father, who fancied himself an artistic genius, ran off in  search of his fortune when Vicki was a baby and only recently reappeared --  remarried and now father to a 4-year-old, a half-sister Vicki very much wants  to be close to.  </P> <P> With affection and sensitivity, author Eve Bunting captures the triumphs, the  agonies and the self-absorbed melodrama of being an 11-year-old female. Vicki  on her ears: "My Dumbo ears are my two biggest problems in life, requiring  constant vigilance." On sixth-grade boys: He "hooked a finger around the rubber  band that stretches across his top teeth, and pinged. . . . We do have the most  disgusting boys in sixth grade. Not much wonder Ellie and I are attracted to  more mature types." On an attractive seventh-grade girl: "Cynthia hurried along  on the opposite side of the street, her hair bouncing nicely against the back  of her neck. Ellie and I have tried to make our hair bounce like that, but  there must be a trick to it and it's a trick we don't know."  </P> <P> Bunting's story can be excused for giving rather short shrift to characters  other than Vicki. Sensible Mom, elegant Mrs. Oda, even adorable Thunk come off  as two-dimensional -- but perhaps that's as much as young Vicki can perceive.  And the neat solution to Vicki's social-life woes, involving a boy's sudden  change in behavior and Vicki's equally sudden and inexplicable change in  attitude, comes too easily and abruptly to be credible.  </P> <P> But this light, funny and well-crafted tale will entertain the pre-pubescent  set who are beginning to confront the very important problems of babies, boys  and big ears.

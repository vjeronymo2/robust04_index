			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stevo Crvenkovski, foreign minister for The </F> Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Eleonora  Karanfilovska; place and date not given: "Approaching the  Positions"]    [Text] [Karanfilovska] We are having these discussions  just after your discussions with the U.S. special envoy Matthew  Nemitz. What is your opinion about these discussions and your  impression of Mr. Nemitz's discussions in Athens?    [Crvenkovski] We had very useful meetings and very extensive  discussions for two days, encompassing the general picture of  the situation in the whole region, and not only relations  between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] and Greece, which is Mr. Nemitz's mandate. We had  expanded discussions because these relations are affected by the  situation in the whole region. I have not been informed about  the course of his discussions in Athens. I think that Mr.  Nemitz's stay here will be of great importance for the meetings  scheduled for New York next week. It is also very important  that during his stay in Ohrid Mr. Nemitz had the opportunity of  becoming acquainted with the culture and traditions of the  Macedonian nation, which will help him obtain a fuller picture  of the Republic of Macedonia.    [Karanfilovska] Was that the reason why you invited Mr.  Nemitz to Ohrid? There has been some speculation about this in  the media.    [Crvenkovski] I think that it was useful to hold the  discussions in a more relaxed atmosphere, as well as to take the  opportunity of introducing him to the historical values of Ohrid  and Macedonia.    [Karanfilovska] Mr. Nemitz stated that both sides had agreed  not to reveal the course and the results of the discussions.  Therefore, we shall refrain from asking such a question....    [Crvenkovski] Nevertheless, I shall avail myself of this  opportunity to remind you that I have been continually repeating  this during these months of discussions, for which I was exposed  to a series of attacks by journalists. Mr. Nemitz's statement  at least helped me to explain my conduct in public.    [Karanfilovska] A number of these attacks appeared in our  weekly, too, which also mentioned on several occasions the  "Irish formula" as a possible solution for the dispute. We are  not asking you whether there are negotiations about that, but  what is your opinion, and do you find it acceptable?    [Crvenkovski] The reason why I cannot comment on any formula  is because our stance is that there can be no separate solutions  for any of the disputed questions, and that is something that we  have explicitly advocated since the beginning. What we are  prepared to discuss are the entire relations with Greece. If we  reach a solution, it should be regulated in a satisfactory way,  be acceptable for Europe, and encompass all aspects of mutual  relations. In that context we can discuss separate solutions.  It is not our goal to solve some transient problems in  communications between the two countries, but to find lasting  solutions for long-lasting relations.    [Karanfilovska] Now that you have announced a new meeting in  New York, probably at the ministerial level, does it mean that  such a stance for discussions in a package is acceptable for the  other side?    [Crvenkovski] From the statements made by the other side  during the past few weeks you could see that such a position has  been accepted. Even I know that from their public statements,  since we have not had any direct contacts. I think that this is  a position that is more broadly accepted by the international  community. That is a point that we have persistently insisted  upon since the beginning of the dispute and I think that our  positions are beginning to converge.    [Karanfilovska] Is Greece a priority in your work?    [Crvenkovski] Basically, what we are trying to do is to  conduct a normal foreign policy, and we have been working on  "driving that policy" on several tracks from the outset, in  order to avoid the trap that Greece fell into when a single  problem, regardless of its importance, dominated its entire  foreign policy. This is not predominant in our work, neither in  terms of the time that we are devoting to it, nor in its  essence. It is a huge problem and we discuss it continually  with all our partners, but we are also engaged in what a foreign  policy should normally do -- not concentrate on one direction  and one problem.    [Karanfilovska] We are asking this because of the time that  you yourself are spending on the negotiations!    [Crvenkovski] It is true that I am spending a lot of time in  New York, but that is principally out of respect for Mr. Cyrus  Vance's invitations. They are sent to foreign ministers and I  think that it would be impolite to respond at a lower level to  invitations from a mediator whom we highly appreciate, and we  think it is important to communicate with him properly. It is  up to the other side to evaluate its own conduct. Second, the  stay there, although linked with the discussions with Mr. Vance,  provides a good opportunity for discussing other matters not  connected with the dispute. There are a number of countries  with which we still have not established contacts, or are having  difficulties in establishing them, because we cannot find a  suitable place to do this. On the other hand, the United  Nations is an excellent place in which all countries have active  missions. Therefore, a great deal of work on bilateral  questions is carried out there, too.    [Karanfilovska] You did not mention Washington, and you  often have meetings with senior U.S. officials during your  visits to the United States. You have met Secretary of State  Christopher a couple of times. How prominent is the subject of  Macedonia-Greece in these discussions, and how bilateral are  these relations?    [Crvenkovski] Concerning the level of our relations with the  United States and the level of our cooperation, such meetings  are normal during every stay there. The subject of  Macedonia-Greece arises in all the bilateral meetings, and not  only with U.S. officials, because everybody is interested in  this. However, the discussions in Washington principally  concentrate on bilateral questions and regional problems of  interest to ourselves and to our partners, who want to hear our  opinions and evaluations.    [Karanfilovska] It looks as if the United States is choosing  the more southern part of the Balkans for its presence, from  where it will be able to achieve its interests.    [Crvenkovski] I am not in favor of the idea that it has to  do with some presence in the region, with some interests, at  least not in the prevailing sense, as this is an idea that  belongs to the first half of the 20th century and even before  that, about spheres of interest and strategic positions in the  classic sense. The interest is, first of all, in giving support  to models of state development that promise longer stability.  The strategic interest of the United States and the European  Union in Macedonia is to see the success of the political model  that we are applying, which can serve as an example for solving  a whole complex of questions that generate severe crises in  other places since they are not approached correctly.    [Karanfilovska] Could that be the reason why after  Washington was "meandering" from Greece, via Albania and  Bulgaria, Macedonia was "selected" as a kind of a partner in the  Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] The ties with Macedonia have become closer  simply because of the political model, and first of all the  internal one, that we have chosen, and they consider that it is  in their strategic interest to support it for the sake of  stability in Europe, for open borders, with prospects for more  intensive development.    [Karanfilovska] Are the present relations in the Balkans,  and principally the problems with Greece and the closure of the  border, affecting the construction of a different policy toward  the other neighbors, and would it have been different if  relations with Greece had been different?    [Crvenkovski] I think that the policy would have been the  same, but the understanding and the support for that policy  might have been different. What is crucial to Macedonia's  position in the Balkans is to be open in all directions --  transportation and communications -- and to take the role that  naturally belongs to it, that is to be the crossroads for all  movement in the region. That is why it is of the utmost  importance to establish normal relations and links with our  neighbors. Therefore, the priority is to establish road,  railroad, and communications links wherever they existed before.  Thus, the east-west corridor was not imposed by the dispute  with Greece or the Greek embargo. It was imposed by the natural  role of the Republic of Macedonia that it is entitled to in the  region. The fact that this corridor is now gaining importance  and support from the international community is to a certain  extent a result of Greece's conduct and the embargo, and in that  context it has helped us. However, the bases of this policy of  communications are independent of the dispute, and that should  normally be the orientation, as should the development of the  north-south route the moment the problems have been overcome.  Macedonia cannot play any role, and principally economic, if it  does not have both directions. The fact that it is a crossroads  is a great advantage for Macedonia. It will lose it if it  neglects either of the two directions.    [Karanfilovska] It is paradoxical, but no matter how  intractable the problem with Greece might look now, it is, in a  way, smaller than the problems, first of all political, that  Macedonia is having with the other neighboring countries, with  which it still has political and economic cooperation. Why can  this cooperation not be achieved with Greece?    [Crvenkovski] We have offered this as a model with Greece  from the outset and we have been insisting on it. Everywhere  there are problems between neighboring countries. The question  is what the attitude of those countries is toward such problems  -- whether there is an open channel for dialogue, and whether  there is good will for finding solutions. We are in favor of  these kinds of relations, because they turned out to be  successful in Europe. That is why the relations with Albania  and Bulgaria, regardless of a number of questions that are  burdening them, are normal relations between European countries.  That is how we approach them, and to a great extent that is  their conduct toward us, too. Therefore, Europe's relationship  toward ourselves and these countries is different.    [Karanfilovska] You said that after the situation is  normalized, the Republic of Macedonia will go on developing the  north-south route as a road to Europe. However, it looks as if  Greece has been redirected on this road via Bulgaria and Romania.    [Crvenkovski] I do not know how they can look for other  directions knowing that they are creating problems on all sides  and in all possible directions. I do not want to get into their  motives for that. For our part, even in relations with Greece,  the basis of our foreign policy is dominant, and that is the  principle of equal distance with our neighbors.    [Karanfilovska] Do you here also include the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia?    [Crvenkovski] Absolutely, speaking in the long term,  regardless of their situation now.    [Karanfilovska] Nevertheless, at this moment there is no  attempt for a dialogue with Belgrade, although this neighbor is  still under the regime of the international community's  sanctions?    [Crvenkovski] There are no diplomatic contacts because the  other side still refuses formally to recognize the Republic of  Macedonia. At this moment the question of succession is an open  problem. We think that it should be settled where it was agreed  -- in the Contact Group in Geneva.    [Karanfilovska] Your Yugoslav counterpart does not share  this opinion. He thinks that Skopje-Belgrade relations will  depend on Skopje-Athens relations.    [Crvenkovski] That is their problem. However, a normal  foreign policy should not limit itself to that. I would not  accept a foreign policy that would be in one part dictated by  someone else or be dependent on third countries.    [Karanfilovska] The Yugoslav Government ordered its Foreign  Ministry to start preparations for a dialogue with Albania. In  your opinion, is it related to the latest events in the far  south of the Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] It certainly is an initiative that deserves  congratulations, because it ultimately leads to the acceptance  of our basic orientation -- that relations in the Balkans can  only be solved through dialogue. The greater the number of  countries that support it, and the greater the number of  bilateral channels for dialogues among Balkan countries that are  opened, the faster it will lead toward EU and U.S. strategic  interest in supporting our model.    [Karanfilovska] There are certain reservations among part of  the opposition and among a number of self-proclaimed independent  intellectuals in Macedonia, who have recently appeared in  public, saying that the conduct of the Macedonian Government  toward Bulgaria is not equal to other countries and that it  still has some reservations inherited from the past.    [Crvenkovski] The basic determination of our foreign policy  is the principle of equal distance between our neighbors,  because that is the only way in which the Republic of Macedonia  can conduct a consistent policy even though at this moment it  does not actually have a real dialogue with some of its  neighbors. Relations with all our neighbors should be put on an  equal footing and there can be no more or less privileged  relations toward any of our neighbors. This naturally applies  to the Republic of Bulgaria, too. Overall, we are trying to  develop relations in a rapid and general way, by applying the  principle of equal distance and by thoroughly insisting on equal  relations in which it will be impossible to place or impose  conditions burdened with the past.    [Karanfilovska] Within the framework of stability in the  Balkans there certainly stands security. Macedonia still has  the open problem of its inclusion in the collective system of  the CSCE, although Albania, in staying neutral, abstained, while  Greece and Cyprus still oppose it. Another question connected  to the security system is the "Partnership for Peace" project in  which Macedonia has demonstrated a great interest, and it was  even announced as one of the topics for the recent discussions  with Mrs. Lin Davis [name as transliterated].    [Crvenkovski] As far as Albania's position on the CSCE is  concerned, the meeting of President Gligorov and Mr. Berisha  gives us the hope that there will not only be no problems from  Albania, but that we can expect active support for the Republic  of Macedonia, which indicates a very important step in  relations. Concerning the "Partnership for Peace" project, we  have shown our interest, as well as in cooperation with NATO.  We have had several official contacts, which raised clearly  defined interests in cooperation from both sides. We have had  intensive discussions on all the possible forms of cooperation  with the Western European Union. However, concerning the formal  participation of Macedonia in the "Partnership for Peace," at  this moment there is one obstacle -- membership of the CSCE. We  discussed this with Mrs. Davis, and we shall continue the  discussions, with the possibility of starting broader contacts  before joining the project.    [Karanfilovska] Are there any discussions with the United  States about bilateral cooperation on a military plan?    [Crvenkovski] At this stage we think our cooperation should  be carried out within the framework of the multilateral  organizations, first of all because they have already developed  good channels of cooperation with the Republic of Macedonia. A  process of adjustment is necessary in the sense of the military  educational system, in order to achieve a cooperation on a  compatible level.    [Karanfilovska] Relations in the Balkans are also burdened  by some far away partners; we have in mind principally  Australia, not only relating to the decision to call the  Macedonians Slav Macedonians, but even more because of the  division of the Macedonian community in that country into those  from Vardar Macedonia and the "others." Is there a danger that  this may be accepted as a model for other countries where there  are such large communities of Macedonians?    [Crvenkovski] That action of the Australian Government  caused a series of consequences that have deeply complicated  relations inside Australia, where all the citizens, regardless  of their origin, had equal treatment and made the country an  example of a multiethnic community. This action, to which we  immediately reacted very strongly, sets a precedent that can  have consequences not only for the Macedonian community there,  but also for others. We know of no country that has renamed its  own citizens who have always had the right to declare their  national affiliation. I hope that the Australian Government  will soon reexamine this action. We were encouraged by the  explicit reaction of the media and of some provincial  governments. What came as a result of this in Australia is not  division, but much stronger cohesion. In this extremely  unpleasant situation there has been created greater cohesion and  coordination among the Macedonians in Australia. I do not think  that this will affect other countries in the sense of limiting  the rights of their citizens.    [Karanfilovska] When your name is publicly mentioned, it is  usually linked with relations with the Republic of Greece. The  journalists' "pursuit" of you usually takes place just at the  time negotiations and discussions are carried out about this.  There is little talk about the other aspects of your work.  What does the minister do in his ministry?    [Crvenkovski] Owing to the growing interest in relations  with Greece, there are some very important events from the  foreign policy area that remain unnoticed or uncovered. I shall  point out the example of the visit to Holland. That was the  first official visit to a European country after the  establishment of diplomatic relations, to which the Dutch side  devoted great importance -- a meeting was scheduled with the  prime minister, there were separate discussions with five  ministers, there was an address in parliament... it was an  extremely important event for our foreign policy.    As far as the work here is concerned, we were heavily  engaged  in organizing the ministry itself and its equipment, and in  setting up embassies within a very short period of time. If we  just have a look at this, together with the international  meetings and conferences that we have attended and where we have  achieved results, only then can we see the job that has been  done here in the ministry.    [Karanfilovska] The public often operates with wrong images.  There prevails the opinion that you are a recluse, an  uncommunicative minister, who rarely makes statements, who is  often absent... however, on the other hand, people who have had  official meetings with you have a different impression. We hear  that you have established private contacts with them, that you  often meet your partners, talk with them, and solve diplomatic  problems in a different way, not only in your office....    [Crvenkovski] The impression that I rarely make statements,  I would say, arises from the interest in the discussions with  Greece. If you look at all my statements, I think that I may  even appear too often. At one time I was even attacked by some  opposition politicians for being too great a presence in public.  As for the impression that people from the outside have, those  who I have contacts with, it is true that it is much easier to  establish official contacts with a state if you establish  friendly links. That is normal in the work of every foreign  minister if he wants to be successful. Private contacts are  important first of all for the official part of the work,  because they enable you to address a partner in the world at any  time, asking for advice, an opinion, or support.    [Karanfilovska] It is evident that, in spite of all your  engagement, you will retain the image of "minister for Greece."  Do you think that at the end of your mandate it will have a  positive or negative connotation?    [Minister] I cannot make evaluations about the final  impression on my work. Nevertheless, it is true that what I am  doing is far from being subordinated to relations with Greece.</p>

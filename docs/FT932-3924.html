			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: HTV chief accuses rivals of 'imperialist ambition' MR LOUIS Sherwood, chairman of HTV, yesterday accused Carlton Communications and Central Independent Television of 'imperialist ambition' over independent television, writes Raymond Snoddy. The two companies, Mr Sherwood said, had been lobbying the government to relax the rules preventing the nine largest ITV companies - which includes HTV - taking each other over. 'As a citizen I absolutely believe in the regional identity of ITV. It's important,' said Mr Sherwood, who will join other ITV chairmen at a meeting on Monday with Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage Secretary, to discuss the issue of ownership. He was speaking after the annual meeting at which he criticised as 'wildly exaggerated ' a Carlton claim that Pounds 100m a year could be saved from non-programme costs if there was to be a consolidation of ITV companies. This, he said, would mean that if Carlton took over HTV there would have to be combined overhead savings of about Pounds 20m a year based on aggregate advertising revenue. HTV said it is demonstrating that economies of scale can be created in ITV, but by working partnerships between companies. HTV is expected to join Meridian and Anglia in opposing at the National Heritage meeting piecemeal changes in ownership rules.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The messy holy war that threatens to split Ukraine - Adultery, money and power divide the Orthodox church Sunday is no day of rest for Mikhail Pyatnitsky. For the past several months on this day of worship, he has dashed about Kiev with his microcassette recorder, listening to sermons and interviewing parishioners, in a desperate quest for a suitable church. 'It's very confusing and I want to make the right choice,' Pyatnitsky explained. Pyatnitsky is neither a religious fanatic nor on a personal odyssey to discover his faith. He describes himself as comfortably Ukrainian Orthodox, a branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church and the dominant faith in Ukraine. But he has a lot to be confused about. Just to pray at Christmas, the average Ukrainian is forced to choose between three similarly-named, but warring churches - the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the Kiev Patriarchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church and the Autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Each claims to be the legitimate church and denounces the others as heretical pretenders. The competition to win Ukrainian souls extends beyond scathing rhetoric. Violence flared when a nationalist paramilitary organisation tried to prevent the head of one church from entering his monastery. Monks claim they have been beaten up. Old women bar cathedral doors to high priests. Communities stage hunger strikes. Scandals have been exposed. Everyone, from New Jersey clerics to the Constantinople See, from Kiev officials and the Russian Patriarch, has taken sides. Unlike neighbouring Poland and Russia, whose dominant churches serve to unify, the Ukrainian church schism is another reminder that so little binds together this fragile three-year old nation. Ukraine is split between Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, between Ukrainian and Russian speakers, and between its more nationalist west, which borders on Poland, and its Moscow-oriented east, part of the Russian empire for more than 300 years. The three churches encapsulate the deep internal divides between Russophiles, pragmatists and nationalists in Ukraine. Each group wants its world view to define the Ukrainian national identity. None wants to be left out. The struggle also exhibits how Ukrainian-Russian tensions are alive in matters of spirit as well as in political disputes over the Black Sea Fleet, nuclear weapons and energy supplies. Things were much simpler under the Tsarist empire, when there was one Russian Orthodox Church. Then dissidents, who wanted nothing to do with Soviets, established an independent church. This Autocephalous Ukrainian Church lived underground in Ukraine and practiced in Ukrainian communities abroad. Ukraine's independence in 1991 ushered yet another split when former president Leonid Kravchuk encouraged the creation of an official Ukrainian church to mark his nation's break from Moscow and to bolster his new state. Not everyone followed. Many priests and congregations continue to heed the Russian Patriarch, who refuses to recognise the independent Ukrainian Church. The independent church of dissidents and diaspora managed to unite with Kravchuk's rebels for a year until they broke off again last September in a priestly squabble. The Moscow followers still use the Old Church Slavonic language and genuflect to the Russian Patriarch, whereas the other two churches conduct their services in Ukrainian and make no references to Moscow. Otherwise little distinguishes the practices of the three churches. White-bearded high priests don similar black robes. Icons and pungent incense fill their churches. The same ancient hymns are chanted and the same theology is taught in their seminaries. 'I go to St Sophia's because no one makes a comment about my wife not wearing a head scarf,' said Sergei Olyokhin, a 36-year old businessman, on his way out of Kiev's main onion-domed cathedral. Olyokhin prefers the relaxed atmosphere and blinking Christmas lights of the new independent Ukrainian church, where his wife, Larissa, sported skin-tight denims, dangly earrings and three-inch black pumps. The Moscow branch's main church is crowded on Sundays with elderly women lighting candles by the dozen. All are in modest dress and head covering. Lidiya, a 62 year old woman, said the head of the independent Ukrainian church, Metropolitan Filaret, 'doesn't have a religious bone in his body. There is no God in his church. It's just a building.' On the edge of Kiev's city limits is the humble church of Ukrainian nationalists. Valentina and Oleksandr Cheshkova travel three hours to worship at this white cossack house with raw wood and iconned interior. Why? 'I was illegally christened by a repressed dissident,' explained Valentina. 'I tried one of Filaret's services once, but it didn't feel right.' Filaret is at the centre of the conflict. Many say he was close to the KGB in the old days of the Soviet Union. Ukrainian government officials confess that he is as active in politics as he is in piety. In Soviet times, Filaret was the head of the Kremlin-controlled Russian Orthodox Church of the Ukrainian Republic, when church officials were 'asked' to be informants and the brave observants were regularly dragged in for KGB interrogations. Filaret made the three-man short list for the Russian patriarch in 1990. He was not selected and when Ukraine declared independence in 1991, he suddenly transformed himself into a nationalist, realising his religious career lay with the independent state. 'We realised that an independent state needs an independent church,' recalled Filaret in his ornate Kiev headquarters, where he once sat as a messenger of the Russian Patriarch. 'Ukrainian sovereignty would be a farce if 20m believers were subordinate to Moscow. 'But Patriarch Alexei (of Moscow) would not have it. He launched a crusade to depose me and eventually had me defrocked,' Filaret said. Just as Ukraine's leaders and the controversial Filaret were desperate to escape Moscow's grasp, Moscow was loathe to lose Ukraine - the historical and spiritual core of the Russian Orthodox Church. The two Slav nations had been one church for more than 1,000 years since Christianity took root in 988 at the famous baptism in Kiev's Dnieper river. Sixty per cent of all churches of the Russian Orthodox faith were on Ukrainian territory. An equal share of the Russian Orthodox clergy was ethnically Ukrainian. Many were sent to Russia to run parishes. Ukraine boasts five seminaries to train priests. Russia has only two. To seal the break from Moscow, Filaret made a career-saving but unlikely alliance with the Autocephalous Ukrainian church. Filaret had previously denounced this diaspora church. With Kravchuk's blessing, he joined the dissident church and established Ukraine's first official and independent church in mid-1992. New Jersey diaspora leader, Mystislav, was elected Kiev Patriarch. Filaret became Bishop of Kiev, the second highest post. The newly-appointed, highly-respected head of the Russo-based church was forced to seek refuge in the fortress-like Kiev Monastery of the Caves, a stunning gold-domed complex of ancient churches dating from the 11th century overlooking the Dnieper River. Filaret grabbed the treasury, residence and St Sophia Cathedral for Kiev. There were scuffles and thousands of protesters, especially old women took to the streets. Kravchuk ordered Ukrainian television to broadcast his church's services and ignore the pro-Russian church. But in spite of Ukrainian government support, only about 3,000 of Ukraine's 8,000 churches have gone over to the Kiev side. The others remain loyal to Moscow and maintain the Old Church Slavonic liturgy. In Dnipropetrovsk, on Ukraine's eastern border with Russia, the two Kiev branch congregations have no church and have been conducting Sunday services in the open air. Ukraine's independent church is not recognised by Constantinople (Istanbul), the Eastern Orthodox See, but the Kremlin one is. Nikolai Zaboga, rector of the Moscow branch's theological academy, says he wants to re-unite with the Kiev church, but first 'they must repent and confess their sins for breaking away from the Moscow church. Naughty daughters will never get a tomos' (the eastern orthodox grant of sov-ereignty). Until then, 'their blessings, marriages, christenings are useless and not recognised by the canon,' he says. Once the churches agree to unify, all sides say that Moscow might grant them independence, paving the way for international recognition of the Ukrainian church. For now the three leaders are unable to sit down at a negotiating table together. And so on each Sunday, Ukrainians remain divided in prayer and Pyatnitsky wanders.</p>

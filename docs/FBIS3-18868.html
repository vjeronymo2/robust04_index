			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christophe Palierse and Olivier Provost: "A </F> French-German Quartet for the Future Armored Vehicle"]    [Text] According to a memorandum from an industrial source  involved with the modular armored vehicle (VBM) project, "by  June 1994, one or more companies will be created, bringing  together Giat Industries, Krauss Maffei, Mercedes-Benz, and  Panhard." At the next "Eurosatory" ground defense equipment  fair to be held in June, "the Mercedes EXF and the Vextra will  be on display on a specific stand bearing the name of one of the  companies." These models will be the concrete implementation of  the French and German proposals, but we will also see "a central  model of the joint EVA [expansion unknown] concept proposed by  the industrial groups."    For the time being, Giat Industries has refused to comment  on  the subject. However, at the Defense Ministry, the contents of  this memo, although considered to be "confidential," were  confirmed. It is up to the Germans, probably in the first  quarter of 1994, to validate the technical choices and in  particular to choose between a wheeled armored vehicle (the  solution felt to be most likely) proposed by Krauss Maffei, MAK  [Kiel Machine-Building Company], and perhaps Wegmann; and a more  conventional tracked vehicle as Thyssen is said to be proposing  with the TH-495. Since Mercedes originated the project and the  design for the wheeled vehicle but is not scheduled to produce  it, Bonn will have to choose a company to act as prime  contractor. Krauss Maffei is the clear favorite, giving rise to  the four-party solution mentioned in the confidential memo.  <H5>  `Very Active Support' of Paris and Bonn </H5>   The joint EVA design to be presented in June at Eurosatory  will not perhaps have been officially validated, but will  benefit from the "very active support" of Paris and Bonn. The  Defense Ministry states that the first version of the modular  armored vehicle should be a six-wheel drive (a six-by-six)  weighing approximately 24 to 25 tonnes and bearing 9 tonnes per  axle. This would make it possible to produce a 36-tonne  eight-wheeler. The basic versions will be in troop transporter  and command post configurations. France also envisages a direct  support vehicle with a turret and a 45-mm gun, and a weapons  system carrier with, among the options, a 120-mm gun. Initially,  the Germans want to configure it as a repair, ambulance,  transmission, and observation vehicle.    The French plan to put 3,000 vehicles into service to  replace  -- given the recent reductions in army hardware -- the existing  4,000 front-armored vehicles, the 900 AMX personnel carriers,  and the 325 AMX 10 RC's [expansion unknown]. Germany should  also purchase 3,000 VBM's, although it has only included 800 in  its future planning. The cost per vehicle remains fixed at 5  million French francs [Fr] excluding tax. Development costs are  estimated at between Fr800 and Fr900 million. This represents a  reasonable level of expenditure -- development will continue  from 1996 to 2000, with the first mass-produced vehicle planned  for the end of 2002 -- which justifies, according to a source  close to the project, "the correct place" given to the VBM in  the upcoming French military programming law for 1995 to 2000,  which proves so difficult to complete.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Gisela </F> Hopfmueller after the cabinet meeting in Vienna on 21 June --  recorded]    [Text] [Hopfmueller] After the cabinet meeting,  Chancellor Vranitzky briefly informed the journalists that the  European Union [EU] plans to discuss important structural issues  at the meeting of heads and state in Corfu, where the Austrian  membership treaty is to be signed, too. The chancellor also  announced that Austria will present a supplement to Jacques  Delors' European white paper with the major future political  goals.    [Vranitzky] This will be an Austrian program, outlining our  specific prospects for the next few years -- on structural,  traffic, and environmental policy, policy on research and  science, etc. I have informed the members of the government that  I will address personal letters to them in the next few days,  inviting them to express their views so that we will have  developed an Austrian perspective on a timely basis before the  formal entry, which will enable us to take the required measures  at home. These are our preparations for the EU Council meeting  in Corfu.    [Hopfmueller] Mr. Vranitzky, when you meet with President  Klestil once more this afternoon, will the issues that you just  mentioned be discussed, or will the final assignment of seats  and standing room under the Greek sun be the main topic?    [Vranitzky] I am primarily interested in issues of  integration policy and not in the assignment of seats and  standing room under the Greek sun, or in the distribution of sun  or straw hats. What I consider significant is that the specific  political implementation and the specific political work should  be begun after the referendum that resulted a overwhelming  support for the integration project. This is the most important  thing for me. All other issues or secondary topics were  discussed extensively in the past few days. I have once  expressed my view clearly, and it is known to everybody now. In  addition, the individual ministries must define through  coordination how the work will be carried out in the future at  the ministerial and bureaucratic level in Austria, and at the  level of civil servants. These are the major issues.    [Hopfmueller] Is the real background to the tug-of-war over  Corfu not the definition of future competences within the  European Union -- that is who will represent Austria politically  in the future within the European Union?    [Vranitzky] Well, you used the term tug-of-war. I would  like to repeat that I never participated in such a tug-of-war.  However, occasionally I am given a rope by the media. I  usually put it aside as quickly as possible.    [Hopfmueller] Well, you could have others participate in the  tug-of-war instead of you.    [Vranitzky] Well, then I would not be sure whether things  are going in the right direction. Thus, I refrain from it.  However, let me repeat the following once more: The next  government, which will in all likelihood be formed and assume  office before Austria's formal entry into the European Union,  will have to discuss and adopt final regulations regarding  competences. The current government, which will only serve for  another three months, must prepare interim solutions, which we  are now doing. I am quite confident that this process will be  concluded shortly.</p>

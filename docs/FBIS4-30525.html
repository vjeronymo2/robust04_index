			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- The Seoul Subway  Workers Union entered a general strike at 4 on the morning of  June 24, according to radio reports from Seoul.    Though the trade union had final negotiations with the  company on their wages, the latter persistently refused to  accept its demand. The unionists are now on a sit-in strike at  Korea University, the Myongdong Cathedral in Seoul and two other  places of the city.    The sympathy strike of subway workers in Seoul and Pusan in  the wake of the start of the general strike by locomotive  engineers throughout South Korea will tie up the traffic at the  worst, said the reports.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Higher rate band hit - Married allowance / The Budget and You MARRIED higher-rate taxpayers under 65 will be Pounds 294 a year worse off because of a Budget change to the married couple's allowance. The measure takes effect from April next year. The married couple's allowance, like most other allowances, will be frozen in the 1993 tax year at Pounds 1,720. At the moment, the allowance is worth Pounds 430 to a basic rate taxpayer and Pounds 688 to higher payers. But Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said tax relief from the married couple's allowance will be restricted to 20 per cent, instead of 25 per cent for basic rate taxpayers and 40 per cent for those in the higher rate band from April 1994. This will limit the maximum benefit from the married couple's allowance to Pounds 344, regardless of a taxpayer's marginal rate. However, the widening of the 20 per cent band to the first Pounds 2,500 and then Pounds 3,000 of income from Pounds 2,000, worth Pounds 25 this year and another Pounds 25 next year, will mitigate the loss. Assuming no other changes to personal allowances, the effect of both measures on a married basic rate taxpayer under 65 in 1994-95 will be a loss of Pounds 36. A higher rate taxpayer will lose Pounds 294. Those aged 65 and over, who receive a higher married couple's allowance, will also see its tax benefit restricted to 20 per cent. However, the allowance will be increased by Pounds 200 so basic rate taxpayers between 65 and 74 will lose no more than Pounds 33.25 in 1994. The corresponding figure for those aged 75 is Pounds 35.36. From April, married women will be able to receive all or half the married couple's allowance following last year's Budget measures. Those wishing to do so should request Form 18 from their tax office and return it by April 5. The limit on the benefit from April next year means that the 1993 tax year will be the only one in which a couple will benefit from the allowance being transferred to the wife if she is a higher rate taxpayer and her husband a lower one.</p>

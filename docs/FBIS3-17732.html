The  increased activities of foreign special services was noted by  Maj-Gen. Vladimir Bobrovskiy, head of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service directorate in Bryansk Oblast.  Military and defense installations, as well as the region's  military potential, are of special interest to them. For  example, a hotel room was recently equipped as a center capable  of monitoring the work of the technical services of a military  aerodrome situated nearby.

Juppe spoke with reporters after discussions with Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller and a private meeting with Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin.    Turkish Government sources said they discussed the Kurdish  separatist rebellion in Turkey and the case of seven Kurdish  deputies who were detained on charges of "separatist" activity  last week after their parliamentary immunity was lifted.    The incident drew concern from several European countries,  including France, who publicly urged the Turkish Government to  respect legal guidelines in any action against the deputies.    Juppe told reporters that Turkey and France were guided by  the "same choices," which he listed as "democracy, justice and  respect for human rights," and stressed that he "hoped that the  two countries can continue to share the same principles."    He made no public reference to the Kurdish deputies.    The French foreign minister also called Turkey, which is a  member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an "element of  stability in a troubled region."    Turkish diplomatic sources said Juppe's discussions here  would deal essentially with international subjects of common  interest.    Juppe, who arrived Wednesday night on a two-day official  visit, placed a wreath at the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, a  national hero and the founder of modern Turkey.    He also met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and was  to head to Istanbul later Thursday for meeting with Turkish and  French businessmen.</p>

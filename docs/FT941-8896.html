			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Back in fashion but with a different cut: Richard Waters finds new currents in the latest takeover wave At a casual glance, it looks as though the US takeover business is back to its old ways. After three depressed years, takeover activity in 1993 nearly returned to the level of the boom years of 1988 and 1989. This week, cable television group Viacom won the biggest contested takeover battle of the 1990s so far, taking on a mountain of debt in the process. Takeover fever has a way of feeding on itself, as company bosses compete for what is seen as a diminishing pool of attractive corporate assets. 'M&amp;A is like the fashion business: it's certainly become fashionable to do it again,' says the head of mergers and acquisitions at one Wall Street investment bank. The fees being earned by advisers on Wall Street also echo the sort of money raked in during the last takeover wave. Fees for Smith Barney Shearson and Lazards, acting for Viacom and Paramount respectively, have been put at Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.5m) apiece. However, the 1990s takeover market differs from the 1980s version in some important respects. Despite the knock-about Dollars 10bn tussle for Paramount, hostile bids are less common and acquirers use strategic arguments to justify their deals, rather than purely financial ones. Few people talk about the dangers of short-termism, a hot topic in the 1980s. Another difference is that much of the activity is focused in a narrow range of industries. In entertainment and telecommunications - or 'multimedia' - and in healthcare a common theme is vertical integration, while banking is undergoing a steady consolidation. According to one estimate, 70 per cent of last year's takeover activity was in multimedia, healthcare and banking. Besides these changes, there have been two other underlying shifts in the M&amp;A business. First, the takeover market is no longer the place where shareholders look first to replace poor managements or realise the value in underperforming companies - one of its main functions in the 1980s. Shareholders are more willing to do the job themselves. In the past year, chairmen have been unceremoniously ousted from companies as diverse as IBM, American Express, Westinghouse and Kodak. Prompted in part by such moves, incumbent managers have become more willing to slash costs and sack workers, or to break up their companies. Some of the biggest corporate deals have involved companies spinning off subsidiaries no longer considered central to their operations - American Express's plan to spin off Lehman Brothers, for instance. Such unbundling was the battle cry of 1980s corporate raiders. It would be wrong to overstate the effects of shareholder activism, though. Company owners still have a tendency to act only after the damage has been done. 'The amount of value that was lost in those companies (which have sacked their chairmen) before they took action was truly extraordinary,' says Mr George Baker, an associate professor at Harvard. The second theme is that takeovers (often dressed up as mergers) are being justified on grounds of strategy rather than price: few acquirers talk about achieving immediate financial gains through the acquisition of undervalued assets. The danger for shareholders is that, while clothing their acquisitions in high-flown talk, some companies could be overpaying. Part of the reason for this shift is that many US managers, having spent years working off the effects of 1980s' over-indebtedness, have begun to search for new ways to expand their businesses. 'They have milked cost-cutting - now they need to look at new ways of creating revenues,' says Mr Herb Allison, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch. Talk of strategic acquisitions is loudest in the healthcare sector and in multimedia - where telecoms, cable TV and entertainment are converging. Both sectors are being reshaped through vertical integration, with producers and distributors huddling together to protect themselves in rapidly changing markets. In the healthcare industry, a flagship deal was last year's Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services, a big drugs distributor, by Merck, the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. This grab for market share by Merck marked a radical departure and has left other drugs companies groping for ways to respond. But it also led to 12 per cent earnings dilution for Merck shareholders in the final quarter of last year. In the multimedia industry, shareholders of acquiring companies have also seen the value of their investments fall. Shares in Bell Atlantic, which is buying TCI, have dropped from more than Dollars 65 before the deal was announced to Dollars 54 1/4 yesterday. Viacom's takeover currency - its non-voting B shares - has slumped to half last summer's level. Investor concern has helped prompt a shift in the financing of takeovers. Last year, on the back of a soaring stock market, acquiring other companies for shares was all the rage. Viacom's bid for Paramount was largely conceived as a stock-swap, but the financing changed - with banks stepping into the breach - as Viacom was forced to raise its bid and its share price came under pressure. Many bankers, starved of asset growth, now talk more ambitiously of a return to takeover financing, with its profitable arrangement and standby fees. Against the background of a shaky equity market, and with a healthy junk bond market waiting in the wings, leveraged takeovers could be about to make their return.</p>

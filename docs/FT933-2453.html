			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Schlesinger helps the dollar THE DOLLAR was well underpinned against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, helped by growing indications that the level of Germany inflation is falling, writes James Blitz. Few dealers expect any signal of an easing in German monetary policy next Thursday, when Mr Helmut Schlesinger chairs his last meeting of the Bundesbank's policy making council in his role as President. 'I suspect they'll be getting the champagne out rather than discussing monetary policy,' said the chief economist at one leading US bank in London yesterday. But comments from Mr Schlesinger on Thursday raised new speculation that German interest rates are coming down faster than the market has expected. The outgoing Bundesbank president said that M3 monetary growth in August had not been as strong as anticipated, following the Bundesbank's DM30bn intervention in support of exchange rate mechanism currencies. There is also growing anticipation of a decline in German consumer price inflation. Next week, the German Lander will give their inflation figures for last month. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank in London, thinks that inflation will fall to 4 per cent for the whole country in the August figures. He also thinks that by October, inflation will have fallen below the 4 per cent level. The dollar closed at DM1.6095 from a previous close of DM1.6065. There was far less activity in the dollar/yen exchange rate, in spite of what must be US disappointment in the fiscal stimulus launched by Japan last week. Both Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Larry Summers, the Under-Secretary for International Affairs, have both expressed satisfaction with the package. Some currency analysts have been surprised by that tone, and believe that they may get more critical after Japanese officials visit Washington next week. However, the US would not want to weaken the Japanese economy so much by allowing the yen to appreciate so strongly, and that the possibility of intervention by the Federal Reserve still exists. The yen closed at Y104.35 from a previous Y104.40. In Europe, exchange rates were little moved yesterday at the end of a quiet week. Sterling closed at DM2.4700 from a previous DM2.4625. Next week's M4 money supply data is expected to be little changed on the week. But Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said that there could be renewed speculation about an interest rate cut if the figure was weaker than expected.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ventures put Tecs to the test Sir, Lisa Wood's article, 'Jobless with special needs 'face funding-cut threat'' (March 31), regarding training for those with special needs, misses a crucial point which is invariably ignored in discussion concerning the financing of Training and Enterprise Councils and the surpluses that Tecs make. The essential point is that Tecs are private companies and have substantial business interests outside of their contracts with government. It is likely that Northumberland Tec will, next year, generate a turnover of more than Pounds 3m from contracts and business ventures which are outside of the government Tec contract. These ventures bring jobs and investments to the county. It is simply naive to criticise Tecs for maintaining staffing levels while payments to providers are cut, if those staff are actually engaged in activities quite separate from their contractual obligations to government. The true test of whether Tecs are providing services which are of value is when they have customers who are willing to pay for those services. Only when Tecs have a significant proportion of their total income coming from outside of the government contract will they have the independence to engage in long-term planning and to deal with their fundamental remit - to promote the regeneration of their local economies.

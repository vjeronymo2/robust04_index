			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Old champion re-enters Kenya's democratic lists: Kenneth Matiba's return signals start of the flight for opposition leadership KENYA'S fraught transition to democracy entered a new phase at the weekend with the return to Nairobi of Mr Kenneth Matiba, a founding father of Kenya's democracy movement. Welcomed home by an enthusiastic crowd, the ex-minister and former detainee, who has spent more than a year in London receiving medical treatment after a stroke, announced his candidacy for the presidency in the election expected later this year. It signalled the official start of the battle for the leadership of the main opposition party, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), likely to be as passionate as the campaign to oust President Daniel arap Moi. Ethnicity rather than ideology, personality rather than policy, are likely to determine the outcome in both cases. Mr Matiba was given a tumultuous reception. But the thousands who turned up to greet him were drawn mostly from his Kikuyu tribe, Kenya's single largest ethnic group. The event provoked an instant response. On the day Mr Matiba arrived home, Mr Oginga Odinga, Ford's interim chairman and undisputed leader of the Luo tribe, Kenya's second biggest ethnic group, said he would not give up his own candidacy for president. Mr Odinga, a former vice president, said that at independence he had moved aside for former President Jomo Kenyatta, a Kikuyu, and he would not do the same again. His stand reflects widespread feelings among Kenya's ethnic groups that the Kikuyu have had their chance at political power and should now allow someone from another tribe to have the presidency. In Kenya there is a common understanding that the tribe which has captured the presidency has received a disproportionate allocation of public sector jobs and economic benefits. A columnist in Nairobi's Sunday Nation newspaper last week advised Mr Matiba to beware of power-hungry individuals who were bent on hijacking the democratic movement for tribal reasons and suggested he stand aside in the presidential race. At the weekend Mr Matiba brushed aside the tribal question and said: 'Kenyans are not the same as they were 20 years ago. John is John wherever he was born.' Yet the reality is that Mr Matiba returned to a country torn by tribal violence fuelled by fears of impending political change. Since the beginning of March, at least 250 people have been killed and 25,000, mostly Kikuyus, left homeless in clashes with President Moi's Kalenjin tribe in western Kenya. Mr Matiba's candidacy is also dogged by a split in Ford's Kikuyu ranks. Many younger Kikuyu politicians are grouped around Mr Paul Muite, the lawyer activist who is adamant that the older generation of politicians should make way. Questions have also been raised about Mr Matiba's health following his stroke. Many doubt whether he is fit enough for a gruelling campaign. Prospects for a stable transition have not been helped by government's failure to elaborate a clear programme, negotiated with the opposition. But as long as Ford remains preoccupied by its internal battles, the uncertainty and tribal clashes will go on.</p>

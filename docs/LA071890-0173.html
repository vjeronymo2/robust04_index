			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO SQUARES ALLOWED HERE;  </P> <P> CONTRA DANCING TO OLD-FASHIONED 'STOMPY MUSIC' MAKES MANY FEET HAPPY  </P> <P> A handsome, middle-aged couple are sitting in a meeting hall, pontificating  enthusiastically about contras.  </P> <P> But no mention is made of Nicaragua or the Sandinistas. These two are speaking  of contras of a different kind -- contra dances that take place the third  Saturday of every month at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center.  </P> <P> "This is my first time. My husband dragged me here," said Irvine resident  Marcella Lowe with a grin. Warren Lowe, 60, a Customs Service inspector, made  his contra debut the previous month and sounded as if he was on his way to  becoming a contra convert.  </P> <P> "I used to dance the Virginia reel to this sort of music back in  Massachusetts," he said, gesturing toward the stage, where a band was playing a  furious fiddle tune. "It's easy to pick up on these dances after you do them a  few times."  </P> <P> She seemed eager to hit the dance floor: "This music has a different beat from  square-dancing music. We used to call this 'stompy music' -- the stuff you like  to pat your feet to."  </P> <P> Contra dancing, according to Richard Nevell's book "A Time to Dance," is a  distant cousin of Morris dancing, an ancient ceremonial activity performed by  men in England to encourage fruitful crops. As the dance evolved, it became  more of a social function involving both sexes.  </P> <P> Early settlers of New England brought the dances with them to this continent.  By the late 18th Century, the French, a dominant force in dance at the time,  renamed this "country dancing" contredanse, which English-speakers later  adapted to "contra."  </P> <P> The term also refers to the position of dancing opposite a partner. Instead of  dancers interacting in groups of eight, as is common in square dancing, contra  dancers line people up in two long rows.  </P> <P> Carolyn Russell is the main organizer of these Anaheim dances. Long before any  happy-footed folk show up to test the floor, Russell stands in the middle of  the small hall, checking the sound system for the Occasional String Band  quintet, in which she plays guitar, bass and, sometimes, French accordion. The  56-year-old Garden Grove resident cuts a casual figure in wheat-colored slacks,  black blouse and Birkenstock sandals as she shouts directions over the music to  adjust the level of various instruments and microphones. Once satisfied with  the sonic levels, Russell took a break in a quiet back room and talked about  exactly what makes these dances worth the effort it takes to set them up and  keep them running.  </P> <P> "I was born on a farm in North Dakota and was raised around old-time music. As  a 5-year-old, I was taken to some of the last authentic country dances in the  area," she explained, speaking softly now that she didn't have to shout over  amplified music.  </P> <P> "Those dances were held in school auditoriums, with benches all around the  sides and lots of coats and overshoes and grandmas and little kids. A fiddler  came down from Canada, usually."  </P> <P> Russell's fascination with music began at a tender age. She got a ukulele when  she was 6, a guitar for Christmas when she was 10 and picked up other  instruments from there. Now, she is such a music aficionado that she also plays  guitar in the Louisiana Cajun Trio and a zydeco band.  </P> <P> She has been plucking tunes with Occasional String Band-mates Carty Wilson and  Hugh Nestor since the late '70s.  </P> <P> "We had been gathering to play music in living rooms forever, it seemed,"  Russell said. "Out of that group of people playing together, the idea of having  dancing developed. My husband and I had a covered, sheltered patio in our yard  in Garden Grove, and put on a dance there for five years, until 1987."  </P> <P> That's when city officials put a halt to the informal gatherings because  Russell did not have an entertainment permit.  </P> <P> Once the band decided that the dancers and the musicians deserved "to build a  good dance, as opposed to a fun thing that ultimately wouldn't go anywhere,"  Russell said, they moved the contra first to Huntington Beach, then in late  1988 to its current location. A labor of love more than a moneymaking venture,  this monthly contra draws 30 to 50 dancers per night -- just enough, at $4 per  adult admission, to cover rental fees for the hall.  </P> <P> (Seven monthly contra dances in the Los Angeles-Orange County area are listed  in the California Dance Co-Operative bulletin, which promises "No partner or  experience necessary. All dances taught and prompted.")  </P> <P> The live music, Russell said, is a vital ingredient of contra dances.  </P> <P> "This music has a way of reminding us of people we love," she said. "My  grandfather and great uncles played various instruments at local dances in  North Dakota and in a small-town band that was something straight out of 'The  Music Man.' Maybe this music gives us those people and those times back, when  people were more of a community, dependent upon each other in real ways. You'll  find strangers talking to each other at this dance and that sense of  community."  </P> <P> Music that emanates from a live band instead of a record player also sets  contra dancing apart from square-dancing, Russell added.  </P> <P> "There's very little square-dancing that I know of, at least in Southern  California, that's done to live music. I think square-dancers are more into  developing precision moves and good-looking things out on the dance floor.  Maybe there are people who get more pleasure out of precision. But this music  is more loose and forgiving."  </P> <P> By the time Russell rejoins the band on stage, most of the potluck supper  dishes brought by dancers have been polished off and folks are out on the  scuffed wooden floor, following the patient instructions of caller Wayne  Battleson as he explains the steps of the first dance. With his long brown  ponytail and cordless headset microphone, Battleson looks like he might be more  at home fronting a heavy-metal band than explaining do-si-dos.  </P> <P> But it's obvious that he has a way with contra clarification. Even the  beginners out on the floor learn very quickly how to differentiate between  "active" and "inactive," "top" and "bottom" couples. Before they know it, they  have graduated to sashays and balances, stars and courtesy turns.  </P> <P> Then the band strikes up, and it's time to put the newly acquired terminology  into action. Joining the band on stage are a couple of musicians who are  sitting in. That too, Russell said, is a part of the contra dance tradition.  </P> <P> "Anyone who wants to can come up and play on stage with us, but whether or not  they'll be on microphone is another matter," she said. "The group spirit is the  pervasive idea."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there is quite a mix of ethnic backgrounds, ages and fashion styles  out on the floor. One dancer who looks to be about 12 is swinging his partner  with the best of them in high-top tennis shoes and a pink shirt stamped Off  Limits. But the youngest participant is 15-month-old David Blair. He giggles  with every bounce as his mother, Zona, balances him on one hip and gamely  extends her free hand to various partners up and down the line. A few dancers  zip through the steps with no-nonsense looks on their faces, but most looked  relaxed and smile frequently, taking time to make funny faces at little David.  </P> <P> Battleson's calls are easy to follow, but when someone loses the way, there are  usually arms reaching out to help errant dancers back into proper position  before they reel entirely out of control. The quick, rhythmic clasping of hands  and synchronized negotiation of turns can be strangely thrilling -- perhaps a  bit like trapeze work, with just a fraction of the risk.  </P> <P> Ruth Shapin, 59, a lawyer from Orange, has been coming to the Anaheim dance  since its early days. "I like the sociability of contra dancing -- the way you  dance all up and down the lines," she said.  </P> <P> Her husband, Ted, a 62-year-old engineer, said the Shapins' daughter recently  participated in a "dance friendship exchange" in the Soviet Union. "They  brought their own band and caller and taught the Soviets how to contra," he  said.  </P> <P> In a sea of pastel summer clothes, Shannon Batts' black miniskirt and boots and  Steve Jackson's skull-print pants and fedora make them stand out in the crowd  of dancers. Yet they too are contra veterans -- and regard themselves as the  resident jesters as well, always stirring up mischief even as they execute  steps skillfully. Jackson frequently punctuated the beat of the banjo music  with a tweet on a whistle, and he and Batts led all the dancers in shouts of  "lemonade!" to rhyme with the caller's command of "promenade."  </P> <P> "I got into dancing because I wanted to have a chance to play and use my body  and have a release after sitting around and being intellectual all day," said  Jackson, 30, a Census Bureau edit clerk.  </P> <P> "This particular dance is different from all the other contras I know," said  Batts, 26, a psychiatric aide and a graduate student in the counseling program  at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> "This dance is very community-oriented," she said. "We bring out food and  flowers and children. The other dances aren't like that. (Those) are just three  hours of hard-core dancing."  </P> <P> During the band's break, a couple of the musicians strolled over to a reporter  to offer a cup of lemonade and a quick tutorial about the "old-time" music they  play at contras.  </P> <P> "You need a good tune that allows you to follow the dance throughout," said Ira  Gwin, 49, director of community development for the City of Commerce when he is  not the main fiddle man in several bands.  </P> <P> "You should be able to sense through the music what the next dance move should  be," banjo player Jack Phillips elaborated. "We play a Southern Mountain  Appalachian style of dance music, which is different from the New England  style. They do a lot more jigs in six-eight time."  </P> <P> Carty Wilson, a mandolin player from Long Beach, stressed that the music this  band plays at contras is very different from bluegrass.  </P> <P> "One of the things we're trying to do here is to perpetuate the older style of  music," he said. "Bluegrass is a flashy style primarily for performance. This  style of music is pre-bluegrass."  </P> <P> By 11:30 p.m., the lemonade jug was drained and all but the most die-hard  dancers were tuckered out. Even the energetic children, who spent their contra  time skipping rope and playing tag on the sidelines, were flagging. Some  dancers helpfully dragged folding chairs into place for the youth theater group  that would take over the hall the next day. Others made their way out the door  slowly, picking up jelly jars full of dark brown honey that fiddle player Gwin  had harvested from his bees.  </P> <P> Caller Battleson, a land-surveyor in his non-dancing time, offered the  evening's final opinion on why a quaint little activity like contra dancing is  thriving in the shadow of the Matterhorn and other more glitzy entertainment  alternatives.  </P> <P> "It's vigorous, flirtatious, social and a way to have a fun time without going  out to the bars," he said. "And the people are just tremendous. You meet the  best people contra dancing."  </P> <P>  Contra dancing takes place Saturday and every third Saturday of the month,  from 7 to 11:30 p.m. at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center, 931 N. Harbor Blvd.,  Anaheim. Admission: Adults $4, children free. Information: (714) 638-1466.  </P> <P> </P></p>

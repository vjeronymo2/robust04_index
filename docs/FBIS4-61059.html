			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Sochi 2 May TASS -- "America, as well as Russia, has  not developed as yet a policy toward each other," said on Monday  [2 May] member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Aleksandr  Yakovlev who participates in the Russian-American forum "Aspen  dialogue" which opened in Sochi today.    This international conference is attended by U.S. senators  and congressmen, Russian legislators, politicians, top  executives of enterprises and corporations from the two  countries.    The present "Aspen dialogue" is the fifth in number. It was  held in the city of Aspen, Colorado State, for the first time in  August 1991 by the international association of industrial  managers headed by Konsantin Zatulin (now chairman of the lower  house committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States) and  the U.S. international centre of civil administration headed by  B. Sivella.    In the opinion of forum participants, it is being held now  in  the conditions when recent romanticism of Russian-American  relations is passing into oblivion.    Andranik Migranyan, member of the presidential council and  chief expert of the lower house committee on the CIS, noted that  "on withdrawing from the Soviet Union, Russia has not found its  bearings with its national and state interests as well as aims.    ``The Russian foreign policy at the first stage was the  continuation of the old Soviet and was aimed at responding to  initiatives of Western countries.    ``This policy created false impression about Russia as a  country which had no specific national and state interests and  seeks to join `the big seven' and to pursue the same policy.''    "We now witness the painful formation of Russian foreign  policy," Migranyan noted.    This transition will be also promoted by the representative  Russian-American forum "Aspen dialogue," which will work for  five days.</p>

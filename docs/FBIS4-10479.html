			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santiago, 11 Apr (EFE) -- General Augusto  Pinochet, Army commander and former Chilean president  (1973-1990), today held a 20-minute meeting with President  Eduardo Frei at La Moneda Palace, according to government  authorities.    The meeting raised expectations due to the recent crisis  between the government and the Carabineros forces, but the  purpose of the visit was for Pinochet to thank the chief of  state for his concern for his wife [Lucia Iriarte de Pinochet],  who underwent surgery last week, according to an official  communique.    The communique states that on the occasion they "also raised  institutional Army subjects." Pinochet apparently arrived at La  Moneda through underground entrances to avoid meeting with the  media.    Last week Frei faced his first government crisis when  Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange ignored Frei's  request for him to resign, after a court ruling charged him with  not fulfilling his duties and with having obstructed the court's  actions in the case of the murder of three communist leaders in  1985. [passage omitted]    Some analysts considered Pinochet's position of not  intervening in the conflict and his statement that the possible  resignation of Gen. Stange "was a problem that concerned him  alone," were decisive in convincing Stange to accept leaving the  post.</p>

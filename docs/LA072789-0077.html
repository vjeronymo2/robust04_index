			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PERSONALIZED' BIRTH CERTIFICATES WILL FUND CHILD ABUSE PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Native Californians will now be able to obtain a "personalized" decorative  birth certificate from the state in a new effort to raise money for child abuse  programs, the Deukmejian Administration announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> The fancy, multicolored birth certificates will sell for $30 apiece, with half  the proceeds going to the California Children's Trust Fund. State officials  said they expect to raise about $375,000 a year for the trust fund, which  subsidizes a variety of child abuse programs.  </P> <P> "The ultimate beneficiaries of the program are needy children," said Bob  Taylor, associate secretary of the state Health and Welfare Agency, in  announcing the start of the program.  </P> <P> The idea for the California "Heirloom Birth Certificate" was borrowed from  Oregon, which has been offering such designer certificates for several years.  It also is similar to California's popular personalized license plate program,  which raises about $20 million a year for environmental projects.  </P> <P> The birth certificate, measuring 11 by 14 inches, includes the name of the  person, his or her parents and the date and county of birth. It bears a gold  state seal and drawings of five state symbols, including the California golden  poppy and the extinct California grizzly bear.  </P> <P> The state is marketing the certificate as a gift item, particularly for parents  and grandparents.  </P> <P> "We are all unique individuals," says a state brochure advertising the program.  "Each with our own identity. And each with a birth certificate that  commemorates the celebration of life. Which is one of the reasons California is  offering a personalized legal birth certificate."  </P> <P> Anyone can order a certificate commemorating the birth of another person, since  birth certificates are a matter of public record in California. The certificate  is valid as legal identification but does not contain such information as the  time of birth or the baby's weight.  </P> <P> The certificates will not be available for anyone born before 1905, because the  state did not keep birth records before that time. They can be ordered from the  Department of Health Services, Office of the State Registrar, in Sacramento.  </P> <P> Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), who carried legislation creating the program,  was the state's first customer. He bought nine birth certificates, most of them  for his children and family members.  </P> <P> "In some cases, I guess, rank does have its privileges," Rogers joked at a  press conference to announce the new designer certificates.  </P> <P> But the senator, an unabashed booster of the program, noted that he could not  obtain one for himself because he was not born in California. "I can't even get  one of these," Rogers said. "I would love to have one but I can't because I was  born in Louisiana."  </P></p>

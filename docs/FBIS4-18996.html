			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ALN: "Rwanda: Dehaene Questions UN Mission </F> in Rwanda Participation"]    [Text] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- Speaking before the  parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Monday afternoon [11  April], Prime Minister Dehaene said: "In the current  circumstances, the conditions have not been met for our  continued participation in UNAMIR [UN Mission In Rwanda]." He  also told the committee that Foreign Minister Willy Claes will  meet with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali within 48  hours in Geneva to discuss the matter.    Addressing the committee, Jean-Luc Dehaene questioned the  future of the Belgian presence in Rwanda: "Everything depends  on what comes of the Arusha agreement." He continued: "If the  Arusha agreement is abandoned, the problem will have to be  settled by the United Nations itself, since the UN forces were  sent to Rwanda on the basis of this agreement being implemented.  While we would still like to see this agreement implemented, we  have to examine the problem of the UN troop mandate in general,  and ask questions about our own participation in the mission."  For Jean-Luc Dehaene, in the current circumstances, the  conditions for the continued participation of Belgium in the  UNAMIR have not been met. The anti- Belgian feeling that has  been developing for some time and which has accelerated in  recent days has made the presence of Belgian UN troops  particularly difficult. On this subject, Willy Claes declared  that he could not see why "we should continue to expose our  troops to additional dangers."    The government has, moreover, authorized Foreign Minister  Willy Claes to broach the issue in clear terms in a meeting with  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The prime minister also stressed that the government's  "absolute priority" now was the success of the evacuation  operation. As for the future of Belgian cooperation in  development, he asked that there be no hasty decision "driven by  emotion."    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told the committee that  he had taken a number of steps to officially make it public in  Rwanda that Belgium denies the report which accused it of being  responsible for the deaths of the Rwandan and Burundian  presidents. This "totally false" report has further  strengthened the anti-Belgian feelings of a minority of Rwandan  extremists, the minister said.    Mr. Claes summoned the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels to  demand that sanctions be taken against RTLM (Free Radio and  Television of the Thousand Hills) which broadcasts anti-Belgian  news. He has also asked official Rwandan radio to broadcast the  Belgian denial, "but I note that that has not been done."    The minister again stated that he had also broadcast this  message on the BBC World Service and BRTN [Dutch-language  Belgian Radio and Television] which are listened to in Rwanda.  He will also try through official Burundian radio.</p>

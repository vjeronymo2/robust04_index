			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEAT DOES SOCCER SHUFFLE, WANTS TO STAY IN SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> The appointment of veteran public relations expert Dick White as general  manager of the Los Angeles Heat may signal that the American Professional  Soccer League team will remain in the South Bay and not move to Orange County  as previously announced.  </P> <P> White, a former sports editor at the Torrance Daily Breeze who has held several  professional sports management jobs over the past 25 years, was appointed  Tuesday to replace Jill Fracisco, who was the only female executive in the  APSL. Fracisco, 26, criticized by team owners for her leadership style, was  quietly fired Sept. 24.  </P> <P> A graduate of El Camino College and a current board member of the school's  fund-raising foundation, White opposes moving the team to Orange County for the  1991 season, a decision announced in August by Club President John Ajemian.  Ajemian's announcement has met with resistance from dissident South Bay owners  and some league officials.  </P> <P> "We are not going to Orange County," White said.  </P> <P> Ajemian said in recent weeks it became clear that the Heat would have trouble  finding a suitable stadium near Mission Viejo, his top choice. In addition,  there is speculation that the San Diego Nomads, who did poorly at the gate  after moving to Southwestern College in Chula Vista, are investigating a move  into South Orange County.  </P> <P> White's appointment is seen as a compromise by Ajemian to several owners among  the more than half a dozen who hold a stake in the Heat.  </P> <P> "I want to go to Orange County, but it is not entirely my decision," Ajemian  said.  </P> <P> Ajemian, 31, and L.A. record company executive Lionel Conway are recognized by  the APSL as holding 50% ownership of the club, although legal documents between  owners have not been finalized yet. Ajemian said he and Conway have put more  than $160,000 into the Heat, which has never turned a profit. The Heat's 1989  budget was less than $400,000.  </P> <P> Ajemian said that he expects White to do "a great job."  </P> <P> "The main thing I think he will do is to get us more recognition in the  community," Ajemian said. "He's been here a while. He will open some eyes."  </P> <P> A resident of San Pedro, White, 50, has held positions in public relations,  marketing and management with the Los Angeles Blades hockey team, San Diego  Sports Enterprises, which ran the San Diego Sports Arena and the defunct Gulls  professional hockey team and Rockets professional basketball team.  </P> <P> He also worked for California Sports Inc., when it operated the Forum, Kings  and Lakers, the Los Angeles Aztecs, a defunct professional soccer team based at  El Camino, the Coliseum Commission and the Hollywood Palladium.  </P> <P> White would like to see the team play at El Camino's Murdock Stadium, but is  also considering Veterans Stadium in Long Beach, where the Heat drew 3,500 for  its first game of the APSL West championship series with the San Francisco Bay  Blackhawks.  </P> <P> Veterans Stadium, owned by Long Beach City College, has a license to sell beer.  El Camino does not allow the sale of alcohol. However, at either site, the  concessions would be run by the host school, with the Heat drawing, perhaps, a  small percentage of the total sales.  </P> <P> White is anxious to negotiate for a home field.  </P> <P> "I wish we had a decision a week ago," he said. "It's my feeling that we are  two months behind now in deciding where we are going to play."  </P> <P> Ajemian agreed.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, (White) should have been hired two months ago," he said. "All  of this should have been decided long ago."  </P> <P> The Heat played its home opener at Murdock Stadium and the remaining nine  regular-season home games at West Torrance High last summer, a field that was  too narrow by soccer standards and offered few of the amenities that league  officials want in a stadium. The team also failed to attract large crowds. The  Heat's largest announced crowd was 1,124 for a game against Salt Lake City in  mid-July. Next season the APSL West is expected to require members to attract a  minimum of 2,500 spectators a game. In addition, the APSL championship game is  scheduled to be played in the West, either San Jose or Los Angeles. The Heat  would be designated the host team if the championship game is held here.  </P> <P> The rent at West Torrance was low, however, compared to Murdock Stadium, which  according to Ajemian, cost more than $9,000 for the one game. The cost at  Veterans Stadium ran about $600, plus incidentals and management fees, which  brought the one-game total to about $2,400. A multiyear pact might reduce those  fees substantially, a source with the Heat said.  </P> <P> El Camino officials have also offered to drop the rental fee to $3,000 per  game, according to two sources.  </P> <P> The club expects to maintain its offices on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo  Beach, a building that is owned by Eugene Schiappa, a founder and part-owner of  L.A. Heat Inc., which was founded in 1986.  </P> <P> White has been working as private management consultant on a part-time basis  since suffering a heart attack last year. He was reportedly approached by a  Heat owner, Roland Martin, about two months ago about taking the job.  </P> <P> He said he attended several games and read about the team in local papers.  </P> <P> "One thing I noticed this summer (at games) was that there was hardly any kid  involvement (in the stands)," he said.  </P> <P> White said his major emphasis will be to improve the team's camp program,  reaching out to youth soccer audiences with free coaching and skills camps  utilizing Heat players. Bobby Bruch, a forward who also directed the Heat's  community service program, is expected to be retained to help with the camps,  but White is expected to hire another person to be the club's community  liaison.  </P> <P> Dawn Smith, director of public relations, has been retained and White is also  expected to hire a secretary.  </P> <P> "Last year the Heat did a good job with the limited personnel, time and budget  it had," White said. "I'm hoping to step up those things (a notch) this year."  </P> <P> Fracisco, who said she was surprised by the firing, wished White well.  </P> <P> "I have a great feeling for that team," she said. "With the contacts (White)  has, I think he will be good for that club."  </P> <P> Fracisco said she might leave soccer altogether.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure what I'm going to do," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Popular tune but a tricky score - With the right vanquished and the left tamed, Clinton can succeed despite a challenging agenda In the cold light of yesterday's dawn, it was just possible to question the extent of Bill Clinton's triumph. His mandate by the popular vote, just 43 per cent, was the third-lowest this century, a thin underpinning to his sweeping five-to-two margin in the electoral college, with a majority built on states which he often carried by little more than a whisker. Even his acceptance address late in the night in Little Rock was hardly triumphal, sounding more like the campaign speeches that in the end came and went like a blur. It was almost as if this most determined and driven of men had not quite fully grasped the enormity of the fact that he really was the next and 42nd president of the United States. But, as every football coach says, 'a win is a win is a win' and this one offers the chance to change the fundamental political dynamic. The US once again has a president and Congress of the same party. By giving Mr Clinton and Mr Ross Perot more than 60 per cent of its votes, the country resoundingly rejected the economic and social policies that had guided it for 12 years and the man it felt had not understood why they were no longer working. And, convincingly enough, if with its heart in its mouth, it entrusted its immediate future to the 46-year-old governor of one of its smallest states mostly on the grounds that he really is 'a different kind of Democrat'. On that score, America's confidence ought not to be misplaced because Bill Clinton is not the identikit profligate Democrat of Republican demonology. Far from President George Bush's claim that Clinton really loves to raise taxes, the evidence is that he gets his kicks from cutting spending, not surprisingly since for 12 years he has been obliged to produce a balanced state budget. This may mean that he will not be able to do all he wants to do - even his party in Congress might not let him do that - but it is a fair bet now that the country has a president who at least has an agenda, a long one, of what ought to be done. Successful or otherwise, his will be a seriously activist, but not necessarily radical, government. In spite of all the seductions that foreign affairs offer every president, and acknowledging that some external exigency might command much of his time, it will begin with a profound domestic orientation. Its first 100 days will be bold and vigorous. There will be weighty job creation, investment and training programmes, involving both the public and private sectors; the explosion in the costs of healthcare will be addressed; there will be substantial attempts to reform the welfare system. There will be pump-priming of the economy through public works, and the local governments of America may suddenly find themselves with federal money to spend. There will be all these things not because there should be but because Clinton won election by claiming, successfully, that they are all necessary. But that alone will not make them happen. As Walter Mondale, who ought to know, put it on election night: 'If Congress treats Bill Clinton the way it did Jimmy Carter, we won't be out of power for 12 years next time, it'll be 28 years.' It is true that Mr Carter came to Washington as an outsider, though with a vice-president, Mr Mondale himself, more versed in its ways than Senator Al Gore. The important difference is that Mr Clinton lives and breathes politics - he even inhales it - in a way that Mr Carter, equally sharp of mind, equally committed to a better country, never did. Intelligent compromise has been the hallmark of his record in Arkansas, after all. Second, the dinosaurs of Congress may not have been rendered extinct by Tuesday's wave of discontent with incumbents, but they have been chastened. Some of their lives have been cut short by term limitation amendments at the state level. The excuse to fight the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue no longer prima facie exists. And if it does transpire, as it may well, that the special interest grip on Congress thwarts reform, then Mr Clinton, who knows about populism, has another weapon up his sleeve, if he can find a way to use it. That weapon is represented by the pure populist, Ross Perot, who got nearly 20 per cent of the vote, a remarkable performance for any independent candidate, and the second-best this century after Teddy Roosevelt in 1912. To describe Mr Perot as mercurial is a gross understatement and nobody has the foggiest idea whether, having failed to buy an election with his own money, he will stay the course and get engaged inside, rather than outside, formal politics. But he did extend a helping hand to the new president on election night and Mr Clinton is far too sharp a politician not to recognise the offer. It is not only President-elect Clinton who senses this opportunity - and the threat posed by Mr Perot and his amorphous movement if it is not taken up. There was the wily Bob Dole on election night, easily returned to his Republican Senate seat from Kansas, promising that he would speak not only for his party but for those who supported Mr Perot. Mr Vin Weber, the smart young Republican from Minnesota who is retiring from Congress in frustration, called the election 'a clear vote for change', which was the specific message of both Mr Clinton and Mr Perot, and a rejection of the status quo, which was 'all the Republicans and Mr Bush could offer'. Mr Perot's agenda was originally very limited - to balance the federal budget and substantially reduce the national debt. His essential policy disagreement with Mr Clinton was only over the ferocity and means by which both should be attacked. But, as his effort unfolded, the billionaire from Texas also began to speak more in Clintonian terms, though with much less of his precision, of the need to tackle structural reform, such as education, health and welfare, and to create more and more private sector jobs. Mr Clinton's likely Faustian bargain with Congress is to give it what it wants initially - public works spending - in return for a longer-term commitment to cut spending and to pursue the social agenda. If properly conceived and presented, Congress might find it difficult to turn down. His healthcare goals - to cut administrative costs and other waste by as much as Dollars 80bn over four years, to weaken the hold of the insurance industry and, if necessary, to engage in some rationing of care - sound laudable and have indeed been endorsed by powerful elements in the medical profession. His aim is a new universal system of 'managed' healthcare, financed by employers and, if necessary, by higher taxes. Embracing the nearly 40m Americans who now have no health insurance will not come cheap. A prerequisite, he has always maintained, is stringent cost controls over federal and state Medicare and Medicaid programmes. The educational goals will also not be achieved at the stroke of a pen. He wants to assure every young person of the right to post-high school education through a national trust fund, access to which would not be denied to higher-income families. Student loans would be repaid differently than under the present formula, or by community service, a constant theme in his vision of a participatory democracy. He wants a national apprentice programme, funded by a 1.5 per cent payroll tax on employers. He believes in choice in state education, but no preferential treatment for private schools. He introduced in Arkansas constant testing of teacher competence (in return for better pay) and believes it can be extended nationwide. He frequently speaks of wanting to 'end welfare as we know it', which he sees as 'a culture of dependency'. This means limiting the time anybody may spend on welfare and the provision of alternative public service employment, in sum what is known as 'workfare'. This will inevitably lead him to calling, first, for ceilings and then cuts on federal and state welfare expenditures, and hence to the risk of alienation from his liberal democratic constituency (he may actually welcome such a confrontation). What all this costs is anybody's guess - and Mr Bush's estimates are now irrelevant. The Clinton calculation is that a growing economy, with more people in productive work, can do the trick. This is why, as his economic advisers were freely saying in Little Rock on election night, a job-creation package will be the first order of business when he takes over and why the promises of middle-class tax cuts may have to wait a while for redemption. The new president knows perfectly well the financial markets doubt that he can square the circle. But he will be coming to Washington with precious few hostages to fortune and even fewer obligations to those who got him there. His own ideology is so resolutely centrist, his own career so conspicuously meritocratic, that he ought to be able to call on the most eclectic range of talents. With the right vanquished for now and the left tamed, the opportunity for the practice of a new kind of politics surely exists. The same could apply to foreign policy, to the extent that it intrudes. Only tentative conclusions can now be drawn but they must include the expectation that a President Clinton will be more interested in dealing with the European Community as a whole than with its constituent parts, which implies some diminution of the 'special relationship' with the UK. He will probably seek to encourage, and less to control, independent Japanese policy initiatives in the wider arena, which could be in that country's longer-term interests. His government will be active on the environmental front, which can only be desirable, and more inclined to intervene in the face of gross violations of civil liberties worldwide, though how and where is far from clear. But he is certainly not an isolationist and nothing like as protectionist as many in his party. In sum, he may be a fair reflection of the present, far-from-confident mood of the nation whose leadership he has inherited. He was elected, quite simply, to get it on a better domestic footing and he will be operating in the sort of altered political circumstances which give him at least a chance of success. The challenges are awesome, the vested interests entrenched, his own agenda dauntingly difficult, his mandate not quite as sweeping as it once appeared on Tuesday night. Given the odds he has already overcome, he probably would not have it otherwise.</p>

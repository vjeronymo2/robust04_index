			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Why is it important to address the special conditions that are attached to the award document? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In some instances, a list of special conditions is attached to the award document. The special conditions are imposed to establish a schedule for reporting certain key information, to assure that the Institute has an opportunity to offer suggestions at critical stages of the project, and to provide reminders of some, but not all of the requirements contained in the Grant Guideline. Accordingly, it is important for grantees to check the special conditions carefully and discuss with their Program Manager any questions or problems they may have with the conditions. Most concerns about timing, response time, and the level of detail required can be resolved in advance through a telephone conversation. The Institute's primary concern is to work with grantees to assure that their projects accomplish their objectives, not to enforce rigid bureaucratic requirements. However, if a grantee fails to comply with a special condition or with other grant requirements, the Institute may, after proper notice, suspend payment of grant funds or terminate the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections X., XI., and XII. of the Grant Guideline contain the Institute's administrative and financial requirements. Institute Finance and Management Division staff are always available to answer questions and provide assistance regarding these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What is a Grant Adjustment? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A Grant Adjustment is the Institute's form for acknowledging the satisfaction of special conditions, or approving changes in grant activities, schedule, staffing, sites, or budget allocations requested by the project director. It also may be used to correct errors in grant documents, add small amounts to a grant award, or deobligate funds from the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What schedule should be followed in submitting requests for reimbursements or advance payments? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Requests for reimbursements or advance payments may be made at any time after the project start date and before the end of the 90-day close-out period. However, the Institute follows the U.S. Treasury's policy limiting advances to the minimum amount required to meet immediate cash needs. Given normal processing time, grantees should not seek to draw down funds for periods greater than 30 days from the date of the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Do procedures for submitting requests for reimbursement or advance payment differ for renewal grants or package grants? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The basic procedures are the same for any grant. A continuation or an on-going support grant should be considered as a supplement to and extension of the original award, and the payment requests numbered accordingly. For example, if the last payment request under the original award is number nine, then the first request for funds from the continuation award should be number ten.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recipients of a package grant should file separate requests for each project in the package. For example, if there are three projects within a package grant, a grantee should prepare three separate payment requests, each identified by the letter of the alphabet designated in the award document (e.g., SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;C). Subsequent payment requests should be numbered consecutively for each project within the package (e.g., project SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;A payment number 2; SJI&hyph;93&hyph;15R&hyph;J&hyph;001&hyph;B payment number 4; etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If things change during the grant period, can funds be reallocated from one budget category to another? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Institute recognizes that some flexibility is required in implementing a project design and budget. Thus, grantees may shift funds among direct cost budget categories. When any one reallocation or the cumulative total of reallocations are expected to exceed five percent of the approved project budget, a grantee must specify the proposed changes, explain the reasons for the changes, and request Institute approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same standard applies to renewal grants and package grants. In addition, prior written Institute approval is required to shift leftover funds from the original award to cover activities to be conducted under the renewal award, or to use renewal grant monies to cover costs incurred during the original grant period. Prior written Institute approval also is needed to shift funds between projects included in a package grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> What is the 90-day close-out period? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Following the last day of the grant, a 90-day period is provided to allow for all grant-related bills to be received and posted, and grant funds drawn down to cover these expenses. No obligations of grant funds may be incurred during this period. The last day on which an expenditure of grant funds can be obligated is the end date of the grant period. Similarly, the 90-day period is not intended as an opportunity to finish and disseminate grant products. This should occur before the end of the grant period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Starting the day after the end of the award period, and during the following 90 days, all monies that have been obligated should be expended. All payment requests must be received by the end of the 90-day ``close-out-period.'' Any unexpended monies held by the grantee that remain after the 90-day follow-up period must be returned to the Institute. Any funds remaining in the grant that have not been drawn down by the grantee will be deobligated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Are funds granted by SJI ``Federal'' funds? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The State Justice Institute Act provides that, except for purposes unrelated to this question, ``the Institute shall not be considered a department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government.'' 42 U.S.C. &sect;10704(c)(1). Because SJI receives appropriations from Congress, some grantee auditors have reported SJI grants funds as ``Other Federal Assistance.'' This classification is acceptable to SJI but is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If SJI is not a Federal Agency, do OMB circulars apply with respect to audits? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the express provisions of the SJI Grant Guideline, OMB Circulars A&hyph;110, A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, A&hyph;88, A&hyph;102, A&hyph;122, A&hyph;128 and A&hyph;133 are incorporated into the Grant Guideline by reference. Because the Institute's enabling legislation specifically requires the Institute to ``conduct, or require each recipient to provide for, an annual fiscal audit'' [see 42 U.S.C. &sect;10711(c)(1)], the Grant Guideline sets forth options for grantees to comply with this statutory requirement. (See Section XI.J.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to FY 1994, the Institute did not require grantees to comply with the audit-related provisions of OMB circulars A&hyph;110, A&hyph;128, or A&hyph;133, but did require that grantees, lacking an audit report prepared for a Federal agency, conduct an independent audit in compliance with generally accepted auditing standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

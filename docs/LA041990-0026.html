			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THAT WONDERFUL BIG MAC ATTACK  </P> <P> McDonald's Corp., which plans to spend $400 million this year to build or  remodel about 1,400 restaurants, says that fully $100 million of that sum will  be used to buy recycled products. McDonald's promises that this big jump in its  support for recycling -- it now spends $60 million a year on recycled paper  goods -- will continue indefinitely.  </P> <P> Given a big enough market, recycled products are often cheaper than virgin  materials; in time, then, McDonald's profits ought to be boosted. That  consideration in no way detracts from the social value of what the fast-food  chain is doing.  </P> <P> Americans, facing rising energy costs to produce what eventually becomes their  trash and rapidly running out of places to dispose of it, have a compelling  need to move toward large-scale recycling. McDonald's serves about 22 million  customers a day, making it not just a major purveyor of food but a big  generator of trash. Along with other large companies, it should take the lead  to create markets that would encourage greater conversion of waste into  reusable products. McDonald's intends to give preference to materials using  recycled plastic, among them ceiling and floor tiles, insulation, roofing,  table tops, trash cans and playground equipment. Manufacturers and distributors  of these and other recycled products are invited to contact McDonald's.  </P> <P> Recycling is especially important for plastics, which now make up about 7% of  U.S. solid waste by weight. That volume, the Environmental Protection Agency  warns, will likely double in just 10 years. New technologies are making some  plastics recycling feasible. Those technologies, combined with new markets of  the kind McDonald's responsibly intends to foster, are vital for dealing with  the nation's burgeoning solid-waste problem.  </P></p>

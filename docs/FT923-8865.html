			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Food and Drink: Bookshelf SOMETIMES food books can be almost too worthy, writes Jill James. Such is Giles MacDonogh's scholarship that The Wine and Food of Austria (Mitchell Beazley, Pounds 14.99, 144 pages) runs that risk. It is so exhaustive in its treatment of the country's wines that might ask: 'Do I really want to know all this?' In its coverage of the origins of the country's wine-making, grapes and methods used, vineyards, producers and imbibers, no grape is left untrodden. MacDonogh comes up with some splendid quotations from producers. Osberger does not approve of the post 1985-trend to drink ever-younger wines ('it's like sending your children down the pit') but, at times, lets his pre-occupation with history get the better of him. The last chapter, on Austrian foods, is one of the most enjoyable and that chapter alone should persuade readers to take it on their next trip to Vienna. A different format would have made the book more convenient for the traveller, for it is too learned for the coffee table. Snappier section headings and lighter, more teasing captions for Manfred Horvath's pictures, which range from dull to excellent, would have improved its presentation.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Emergency urban aid package near AN emergency urban aid package looks set to come to fruition in the US, seven weeks after the Los Angeles riots sparked a new political interest in helping the distressed inner cities, reports George Graham in Washington. The House of Representatives passed the Dollars 1bn urban aid bill yesterday, after a hard-won compromise between Democratic Congressional leaders and the Republican White House. A Senate vote was expected later yesterday. The final package roughly splits the difference between an administration-backed proposal to provide Dollars 500m of disaster aid - to cover the damage caused by the Los Angeles riots as well as the Chicago floods in April - and a more ambitious plan offered by the Senate. The latter's proposals, backed by Democrats but also by some Republicans, would have added Dollars 1.4bn more for summer job creation, youth and crime-fighting programmes.</p>

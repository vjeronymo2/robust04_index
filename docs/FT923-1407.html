			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UN burden too heavy, says Hurd THE United Nations risks being saddled with too heavy a burden of intervention and peace-keeping as the nations of the world were trying to build a stronger system of collective security, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told the United Nations General Assembly yesterday. Mr Hurd, current president of the European Community's Council of Ministers, said governments should realise that the new emphasis on collective peace-keeping and peace-making would require restructuring of armed forces and 'a massive increase' in the funds which the UN and its humanitarian agencies would require from member states. Moreover, these new demands were being made at a time when many member states faced severe budgetary problems. Expressing full support both for the ideas put forward by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, in his 'Agenda for Peace' earlier this year, and US President George Bush's latest initiative to strengthen the UN's peace-keeping work, Mr Hurd said that 'preventive diplomacy' was the best way to deal with the world organisation's increasing work-load. The UN secretary-general should be ready to make full use of his powers to draw the attention of the Security Council to any matter which in his opinion might threaten international peace and security. Greater use was being made of fact-finding missions and the EC wanted to encourage this. Mr Hurd said preventive deployment of troops might take place to deter aggression or conflict between states. Supporting Mr Boutros Ghali's proposal for a peace-keeping reserve fund, Mr Hurd said that, at the end of August, the EC had provided 40 per cent of contributions collected for various new peace-keeping operations since the end of the last General Assembly. Russia yesterday proposed installing 'hot-lines' between the world's capitals and UN headquarters, regular intelligence briefings for the secretary-general and greater use of fact-finding missions to enhance the United Nations capacity to head off conflicts, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. In a speech to the General Assembly, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said that when political means failed 'force may and should be used' to separate the warring sides.</p>

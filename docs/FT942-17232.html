			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Arts: Head-banging with the Cholmondeleys' Metalcholica - Dance Lea Anderson's new show for The Cholmondeleys, Metalcholica, features two customised motorbikes, seven women clad in skin-tight bikers' gear, and a rock/thrash guitar score that is effervescent fun for about 20 minutes but soon lapses into terminal, head-banging monotony. Anderson's choreography - smothered rather than matched or instigated by Drostan Madden's music (played live) - is the usual Cholmondeleys-styled amalgam of lumpish pedestrianism, filigree gesture and occasional bursts of energy harnessed in neat, rhythmic geometry. And here, as in previous works, Anderson skilfully teases her vocabulary into phrases and patterns based upon a chosen theme and its associated images. Metalcholica is fashioned as a road movie in which each Cholmondeley is a rebel without much of a cause or course, who manages to turn the desire for freedom, independence and escape into a full-time, dead-end job. Having taken to the road - metaphorically at least - the women spend much of their time gently gyrating under dusky, purple skies, and slumping into each other's arms after a heard but unseen accident on an imaginary highway. As one of the two women in possession of a bike, Gaynor Coward discovers that hers needs fixing. So, after much pedal-pumping, she retires to a downstage corner to dismantle (and, more impressively, reassemble) the Honda  -an operation which takes up most of the evening. At intervals, Coward downs tools and joins her road-mates in bilious pursuit of a fancy free existence. Assisted by Anthony Bowne's lighting and Sandy Powell's costumes, Anderson conjours up scenes of lonely fantasy and misadventure in the barren, open spaces of the wild west. Mute impersonations of rock stars (generic rather than particular) offer the cast further opportunities to throw on shades, peaked caps and the obligatory fringed, studded leather jackets. That Metalcholica is peppered with fragments of Anderson's earlier creations - the scuttling figures of Fish Wreck, the crawling insects of Flesh And Blood, the truncated mapping of faces and bodies in No Joy, and the hints of alchemy from Precious - comes as no surprise. For the show marks the Cholmondeleys' 10th anniversary and, as you might expect, Anderson has chosen to celebrate the decade by encapsulating what she has learnt and developed. Ironically, the Cholmondeleys' line-up includes three new recruits - Ragnhild Olsen, Angelique Wilkie and Michelle Levi - making their debuts in Metalcholica. Unlike the original members - Anderson, Teresa Barker and Gaynor Coward - Olsen, Wilkie and Levi have not been part of the Cholmondeleys' history and have not yet absorbed the quirks of Anderson's choreography. But the more expansive quality of their movement adds a new and vital interest to the natural introversion of the Cholmondeleys' style. Olsen and Levi, tall and long-limbed like Alexandra Reynolds (who joined the company in 1989), also provide a physical contrast to the three shorter, more compact women. And although they seem to drag their heels against the speed of Anderson's more tortuous arrangements, they illustrate the kind of upper body stretch which, previously, only Teresa Barker could make visible. As the Cholmondeleys grow older, their need for change and transformation becomes increasingly urgent; we know who they are and what they do, and it is all too familiar now. In Metalcholica, Anderson makes sure they die young, but what good is that if we have not yet seen them live fast? The Place Theatre until April 9, then touring.</p>

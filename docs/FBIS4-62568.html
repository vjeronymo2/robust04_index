			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 16 May -- Following my recent meeting with  Bosnian Premier Silajdzic and today's conversation with  President Milosevic, I now believe that representatives of the  Bosnian sides should within the next few days be invited to sign  an agreement on halting hostilities. Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian president's special envoy, who today held a meeting with  the president of Serbia, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent this  in an interview today. [passage omitted]    The Russian deputy prime minister [Vitaliy Churkin] said  that  the president of Serbia is in favor of submitting issues  relating to the future structure of Bosnia and the territorial  demarcation for consideration by the Bosnian Serbs themselves.  Vitaliy Churkin is of the view that "they understand that what  they are now being offered wholly corresponds to their  interests, and that it is unrealistic for one of the Bosnian  sides to demand more than half the territory for themselves. In  general, he added, percentages are no longer a subject of  negotiations. The percentages have been designated; now it  remains to mark these percentages on the map, and the sides will  be assisted in this by the international contact group."    The problem of disengaging the sides in Brcko was also  discussed with President Milosevic, and, as I understand it, the  Serbian side agrees to UN peacekeeping forces being deployed in  this region, taking account of territorial particuliarities,  Vitaliy Churkin announced.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 1ST Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Ukrainian Supreme  Council should adopt decisions that would be proportionate to  the current situation in relations between Ukraine and the  Republic of Crimea", Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said  today in an address to the Ukrainian parliament.    In his view, "the political forces that have proclaimed the  secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine and its merger  with the Russian Federation have now gained power in the  autonomous republic." He believes that the Crimean leaders have  chosen two routes. The first is the adoption of a constitution  that proposes to proclaim the Crimean autonomy an independent  state, and the second is to restore the old Soviet Union, which  is impracticable. He believes that the conclusion should be  unambiguous: The Crimean issue ought to be solved only in the  framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, the president stressed.  "We must do it," Leonid Kravchuk said.    He made the proposal to immediately form the Ukrainian  Constitutional Court, which should repeal all decisions of the  Crimean parliament and president contradicting the laws of the  Ukrainian state. He also proposed making amendments and  addendums to the Ukrainian Constitution, to the law on  demarcation of powers between the Ukraine and the Republic of  the Crimea, in which it is to be clearly defined that the  Crimean autonomous entity is the territory of the Ukrainian  state. In the opinion of the president of Ukraine, all power  ministries of the Crimea should also be subordinated to Kiev.  It is also important to settle budgetary relations. "Now we  must take the most radical measures to stabilize the situation,  because the consequences could be even worse," Leonid Kravchuk  stressed. And this needs to be done in the framework of the  Constitution, be believes.</p>

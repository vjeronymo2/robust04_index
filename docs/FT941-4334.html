			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Better margins boost Christies Christies International, the auctioneers, benefited from growing confidence among art buyers and higher profit margins to triple pre-tax profit Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 18.9m in 1993, including an exceptional gain of Pounds 2.65m from a property sale. The company said that prospects for sales in the current year were encouraging. Mr David Tyler, finance director, said: 'There are an increasing number of buyers in the market, particularly in the US and Asia.' Christies has been through two years of sharply reduced profits, after a peak of Pounds 67m in 1989, and Mr Tyler said 1993 had been a 'significant move in the right direction'. Turnover increased by 34 per cent from Pounds 109m to Pounds 146.8m, including Pounds 15.4m from acquisitions. About Pounds 12m of increased revenues came from a 5 per cent increase last March in the buyers premium, a commission charged on purchases and there was a Pounds 7m gain from favourable currency movements. Spink and Son, the fine art dealer acquired last April, contributed Pounds 15.3m in revenues and Pounds 400,000 in profit. Auction sales increased by 15 per cent 1993, and were 22 per cent higher in the second half than at the interim stage. There was substantial growth in sales of 19th and 20th century paintings, furniture and jewellery. Sales of Old Masters and Oriental Art, however, declined from 1992 levels, with the latter falling as a result of reduced activity from Japan. Despite the benefits of the buyers' premium, increasing competition put downward pressure on commissions earned from vendors last year, and this is expected to continue during 1994. However, the company said there had been a number of successful sales during the first two months of the year, including the Barbara Streisand Collection. In May, a substantial collection of Impressionist and Modern paintings will go on sale in New York. Christies recommended a final dividend of 1.5p, making a total of 2p, compared with 1.5p paid from earnings per share of 6.82p (2.21p). The shares reacted favourably rising 7p to 232p. COMMENT Christies' results underline the extent to which the art market has improved in the past 12 months. The figures were distorted by a property sale, but pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items still grew by 2 1/2 times. Profits forecasts range wildly, given the unpredictability of the business, but with a forecast of Pounds 20m for 1994, the shares are currently trading on a prospective p/e of 33. Christies is expanding its international network and is in a dynamic business, but given increasing competition, this market rating seems too aggressive.</p>

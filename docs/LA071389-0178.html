			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANSECO GETS A NEW CAR, BREAKS IT IN WITH COUPLE OF QUICK SPEEDING TICKETS  </P> <P> Oakland Athletics outfielder Jose Canseco, who has had a series of legal  troubles behind the wheel, got a speeding ticket Tuesday while driving his new  Porsche home to watch the All-Star game, authorities said.  </P> <P> Canseco, alone in the white convertible that still had paper license plates,  was pulled over and ticketed for driving 51 m.p.h. in a 35-m.p.h. zone,  California Highway Patrol spokesman Nick Verhoek said.  </P> <P> The officer who stopped him believed he was going over 65 m.p.h. on winding  Crow Canyon Road through the East Bay foothills but couldn't get a radar  reading, Verhoek added.  </P> <P> "I got stopped for going 13 miles over the speed limit. Can you believe that?"  Canseco said Wednesday at the Oakland Coliseum. When asked if he got a ticket,  Canseco said, "Me? Not get a ticket?"  </P> <P> The speeding ticket was Canseco's second in the new car on Crow Canyon Road,  near his home in San Ramon.  </P> <P> The ticket carries a fine of $50 to $100 that must be paid in 30 days,  according to the CHP.  </P> <P> In February, Canseco was ticketed in Florida for driving 125 m.p.h. in his  $75,000 red Jaguar.  </P> <P> In March, while in Arizona for spring training, he was ticketed again for  speeding in the same car. A's management suggested that it might be time to  trade the car for something less noticeable.  </P> <P> A month later, Canseco was arrested by campus police at University of  California at San Francisco for investigation of having a loaded weapon in the  Jaguar.  </P></p>

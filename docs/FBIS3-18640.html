			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["m.p." report: "Everyone Is Fighting on the Personal </F> Income Tax Front"]    [Text] Perhaps the most significant part of the parties'  electoral programs are those relating to taxation. The signals  of increasing intolerance of fiscal pressures, which the League  has gathered and ridden in recent years, have been picked up by  everyone, and everyone has taken a stance on taxes. In many  cases positions are fairly well defined, with programs on fiscal  decentralization, tax pressure, the distribution of revenues  between direct and indirect taxes, the reduction in the number  of taxes, and tax policies to stimulate investment and  employment. Among them, the topic which has suddenly become a  hot potato is income tax, the famous and infamous 740. This is  the electorally most sensitive tax, the one people notice the  most because it affects their pocketbook.  <H5>  The Right </H5>   The proposal which opened the debate on this topic is that  of  Forza Italia, which intends to apply a single income tax rate of  30 percent regardless of people's income, thereby radically  changing the present system with its so-called "progression," by  which the rate rises with the level of earnings. However, Forza  Italia completes its proposal with a series of deductions and  exemptions (not detailed in the electoral program), which would  effectively lower to well below 30 percent the amount which  those in the lowest brackets would have pay. According to a  purely rationalistic calculation, this system, which would  reduce the revenue coming from the highest tax brackets and  maintain more or less unchanged that coming from the medium and  lower brackets, would lead to an overall reduction of taxation.  Forza Italia's economists believe that the reduction would be  more than compensated for by receipts from taxable income from  many of those people who have until now evaded, owing to, among  other things, excessively high rates.    Among the parties of the right, the League's program, which  devotes a large amount of space to tax federalization, limits  itself, on the issue of personal income tax, to proposing a  reduction in the levy, without further details. The National  Alliance's program proposes "lightening the tax pressure on  citizens and on companies, while adopting special forms of  protection for families in general and for single-income  families in particular."  <H5>  The Center </H5>   The Pact for Italy lists seven "pacts" which Italy's  citizens  need to make with the state. The first of these is the "tax  pact." On personal income tax, there are two proposals: the  first is for a "tax rate structure which means that, taking the  different taxes as a whole, in no case will the total amount  levied exceed one-third of the income of any physical person or  corporate body;" while the second provides that "personal income  tax should refer not to the single individual but to the family  nucleus."    This is what is presented in the official program. Yesterday  Pact leader Mario Segni spoke of reducing the number of tax  rates to three or four (from the present seven) and introducing  tax deductions for the lowest brackets. Augusto Fantozzi, a  lecturer in tax law and the draftsman of the taxation portion of  the Pact's program, distancing himself a little from the maximum  rate of one-third of income, spoke yesterday of reducing the  maximum rate to 40 to 45 percent.    The Italian Popular Party has not yet published its  electoral  program.  <H5>  The Left </H5>   The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also devoted much  space to its tax reform program. For personal income tax in  particular, the proposal is to reduce the number of tax rate  levels, setting the maximum level at approximately 40 percent.  The reduction in income which this solution would involve could  be offset by the elimination of a large part of the deductions,  and reducing privileges and possibilities of evasion.    The Democratic Alliance [AD] too denounces the excessive  level of tax rates and suggests that they be reduced. However,  its program becomes original when it suggests "converting  personal income tax into a tax with a high degree of expense  deductions, along the U.S. model. This -- as is written in the  AD program -- would make it possible to introduce a generalized  conflict of interests between taxpayers, with everyone having an  interest in documenting the income of the other, in order to be  able to deduct it as costs, thereby facilitating a widening of  the tax base." The AD also proposes "shifting the burden of  income tax from work to a tax on consumption, with particular  emphasis on reducing the taxation on income from dependent  employment."    Communist Renewal finally, proposes "reducing income tax,  with priority given to incomes equal to or below the average  wage of an operator in the industrial sector and with the total  recovery of fiscal "drag." In order to increase tax equity and  recover income Communist Renewal proposes "including all income  toward the personal income tax and thereby eliminating areas of  erosion, elusion, and evasion, not to mention the many tax  reductions."</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Pressure on Enterprise chief after failed Lasmo bid Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, may be forced to relinquish one of his roles following the failure last week of the company's hostile bid for Lasmo, its fellow oil exploration group. The Enterprise Oil board will meet shortly to consider Mr Hearne's position, but it is unlikely that there will be pressure for him to resign both posts. However, there has been concern about his dual role since the departure of Mr John Walmsley, the former finance director, who had been considered a counter-balancing force on the board. Mr Hearne telephoned non-executive board members on Friday afternoon just before the bid failure was publicly announced and later said the board remained fully supportive of the takeover attempt. 'They saw it as a good opportunity as long as we got it at a sensible price,' he said. Many industry observers have expressed surprise that Mr Hearne, one of the most highly regarded senior executives in the independent oil sector, should have misread market sentiment so badly. The Pounds 1.6bn all-paper offer for Lasmo attracted acceptances for only 23 per cent of the shares. Additionally, Enterprise acquired 9.8 per cent of Lasmo via a Pounds 159m cash raid last Wednesday when its advisers, SG Warburg and Co, believed that at least 40 per cent of shares would be tendered in favour of the bid. Enterprise is now showing a nominal loss of about Pounds 30m on the investment. The purchase is now raising questions about how the company and its advisers could have misjudged investors' intentions. Privately, some shareholders said that in face-to-face meetings, Enterprise had appeared arrogant and overbearing. Also, there were questions about whether it would be able to realise all the benefits promised by the takeover. Yesterday, Mr Piers Von Simson, the Warburg director in charge of the bid, said: 'A large number of things went wrong. Individually each was not enough to sink the deal but collectively they were.' He added: 'It was our impression that the institutions would come in.' Warburg's failing was its inability to communicate its client's message effectively, he said. 'All along we believed it was an entirely sensible offer,' he added. Mr Von Simson said that plans to underwrite 'a significant cash alternative' to the all-paper bid were scuppered by volatile equity markets in mid-June, making formation of an underwriting group impossible. Warburg did not underwrite a cash offer on its own because 'in reality that's not the way the world works'. Enterprise officials yesterday said Mr Hearne was 'generally happy with the work of the advisers', in spite of last week's costly error in judgment over the bid for Lasmo.</p>

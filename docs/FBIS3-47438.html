Kim, the first civilian chief executive in more than three  decades, spent the first year of his administration cleaning up  irregularities and corruption, most committed during the two  previous administrations led by Army generals.    In the second year, Kim obviously wants to embark on the  construction of "a new Korea," through reconciliation and  harmony through dialogue. Viewed from this angle, many believe  Monday's presidential get-together will provide an auspicious  and extremely well-timed beginning.    The luncheon, to be attended only by Kim and former  presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, is expected  to draw keen public attention as it could provide an opportunity  for Chon and No to make up their personal animosity.    Asked the meaning of the meeting, presidential spokesman Chu  Ton- sik said, "don't we all know without someone elaborating on  it?"    Politicians are free, of course, to attach any significance  they wish to the lunch, Chu added.    The invitation of Choe to the meeting can be viewed purely  as  a courtesy.    But with Chon and No, both former presidents were wrongdoers  when Kim was leader of a democratization movement in the 1980s.    Even after the Democratic Liberal Party was formed in 1990  through a merger of three political parties, including No's  ruling Democratic Justice Party and Kim's Reunification  Democratic Party, there was continuous friction between No and  Kim, who was the DLP chairman, especially during the process of  selecting the party's standard bearer.    Seen from this viewpoint, Monday's meeting is a gesture for  reconciliation on the part of the current president.    Immediately following his inauguration, Kim defined the  so-called Dec. 12, 1979, affair as "a coup d'etat-like  incident," putting Chon in a tight position for leading a group  of lower-ranking Army officers against their superiors and  grabbing power.    Kim also ordered an investigation of the construction of the  Peace Dam by Chon's administration and possible irregularities  in the Yulgok military buildup program under No's administration.    In the process, many came to fear that a peaceful and  amicable transfer of power from one president to the next may be  impossible in this country, and the successor will always expose  the misrule and irregularities of his predecessor.    It was during this process that close friends Chon and No  became estranged, with Chon imposing exile on himself in a  remote Buddhist temple and harboring bitter feelings against No  for not protecting him and his administration from a public  outcry.    As for Kim, the president must realize that he can no longer  afford to cling to "past affairs" if his administration is to  march forward and begin to show the "tangible benefits" of  having civilian government to the people following a year of  reform and anti- corruption campaigns.    Kim must also realize that he now stands at the point where  he could and should recruit support and take advantage of "the  experience" of the former presidents for effective execution of  national policy.    Unless he shows the magnanimity by which to reconcile with  his erstwhile persecutors and have harmonious relations with  them, he will find it difficult to appeal to the people for  reconciliation and unity, especially within his own party.</p>

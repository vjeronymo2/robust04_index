			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Sinelnikov report: "Yet Another Change of Money </F> Looms in Georgia"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- According to figures from the State  Committee for Socioeconomic Information, the per capita cost of  a basket of consumer goods as of early April had reached 25.7  million coupons, while the subsistence minimum was 17.5 million.  At the same time, the minimum wage was still 50,000 coupons --  slightly more than 83 rubles.    These figures relate to early April, when the Georgian unit  was much higher. Since then it has fallen by another 250.  There is probably nowhere that the Russian ruble is valued so  much -- in Tbilisi, for instance, it sells for more than 600  coupons.    Today we can already say that the Georgian monetary unit is  dying. Having existed for just over a year, it has almost  ceased to have any meaning. Bread, flour, municipal services,  and transportation costs are fully subsidized by the state, an  800-gram loaf costs just over 1 ruble in Russian money, while a  trip on the subway costs just 1 kopek. Budget expenditure is  270 percent higher than revenue, and no end to hyperinflation is  yet in sight. In recent days the country's top financial and  economic leaders have been talking more and more often about the  need to immediately introduce a new national currency -- the  "lari." According to some reports, one tonne of this currency  is already stored in the republic's warehouses.</p>

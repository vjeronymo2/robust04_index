			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: New lyrics written for an old song - The shadow chancellor tells Philip Stephens about strategies to boost investment Mr Gordon Brown calls it the 'New Economics'. It is not new. But for his party the approach certainly is different. Last week saw the shadow chancellor join Mr Tony Blair in ditching the party's traditional assumption that higher spending and taxes would solve the economy's problems. Neither man will produce detailed tax tables this far ahead of a general election. But apart from the 'undeserving rich' (no-one is quite sure who they are, although the bosses of the newly privatised utilities seem one obvious choice), Mr Brown's message is that the nation's taxpayers can sleep soundly. Convinced that the break with the past has now been made, Mr Brown wants to move on to a more positive agenda - explaining what Labour would do rather than what it would not. The thread running through his efforts to present a credible strategy at the next general election is the diagnosis that under-investment is the key to the UK's economic weakness. In an interview with the Financial Times on the eve of today's conference debate on the economy, Mr Brown offered Labour's answer: a framework for the economy in which the productive base would be rebuilt by a government working with rather than against the private sector. The idea that Britain has for too long lived for the short term is hardly novel. Politicians and economists have spent much of the past 30 years telling us of the dangers of preferring today's consumption to tomorrow's investment. Nor is there anything new about the idea that the nation's education system is no match for that of the Japanese or the Germans; or that British companies often prefer hefty dividend payments to long-term expansion programmes. What has changed is Labour's prescription. State direction and ownership, like high spending and punitive taxes, Mr Brown insists, are no longer part of Labour's agenda. The message he wants the voters - and business - to take came in the first sentence of the interview: 'I think the key thing is for people to understand that Labour is setting aside the old conflicts between the public and private sectors. We see a partnership that is essential to the regeneration for the economy.' The Tories have failed because they have presided over an ever-shrinking productive base. For the same reason Labour could not solve the problems by pumping up demand. It would hit the same capacity constraints. The supply side rules in Mr Brown's 'New Economics'. The shadow chancellor is not offering a blueprint for the promised transformation. The details of proposals to expand training, change the culture of short-termism in the City and raise the level of industrial investment must await the deliberations of party's Economic Commission. But he sketched out the main elements of what amount to a series of carrots and sticks to influence industry: 'We are looking at the merits of an employer rebate/levy scheme to encourage training. We are looking at how we can re-gear industrial and regional incentives so that they have a far bigger component for investment in skills. We are looking at the idea of individual training accounts and at major reform of National Insurance in terms of the benefits people could expect for the same contributions.' There is more: a university for industry and the possibility of tax incentives to encourage pension funds and companies to enter into voluntary long-term investment arrangements which would ease the pressure for large dividends. Labour would tighten competition policy by introducing public-interest criteria for mergers and takeovers. It might form a development bank to help small companies. Alongside these proposals, Mr Brown is suggesting that the scope for partnerships between the public and private sectors to improve the nation's economic fabric could stretch well beyond traditional areas such as transport. Inner-city regeneration, training and defence industry diversification all look promising areas. It is easy to spot the sticks and carrots. Employers would have to pay the training levy. Rebates would depend on their performance in improving skills. The system would 'encourage people to do what they would otherwise consider doing themselves. It stops the good firms being undermined by the bad so there is a case for intervention.' Alongside this is the carrot provided by a plan to use the National Insurance system to provide individuals with training credits - credits which could be drawn while in work as well as between jobs. New competition rules fall into the stick category. A public-interest judgment on mergers and takeovers is 'very much part of our industrial strategy'. The problem is that 'Britain has too few successful companies'. But Mr Brown recognises the constraints on this particular assault. European Union rules limit freedom for action and: 'Of course we recognise also that there are many takeovers or mergers that are actually in the public interest.' There is also pressure on companies that are potential takeover targets to pay high dividends rather than re-invest more of their surpluses: 'I think it is true to say that Pounds 14 is invested for every Pounds 1 paid in dividends in Japan but only Pounds 3 sterling is invested for every Pounds 1 paid in dividends in Britain.' It is here that Mr Brown hints that Labour would keep stamp duty on share transactions. But another proposal - the encouragement of long-term investment agreements - would be on an entirely voluntary basis. If tax incentives pushed shareholders and company boards into taking a long-term view of their mutual interest, it would be money well spent. Sir David Walker suggested something along the same lines when he headed the Securities and Investments Board. The partnership theme returns, but this time it is between finance and industry. Overall it is not a strategy likely to bring the rank and file members to their feet during today's debate. To do that Mr Brown will return to more traditional themes such as boardroom greed. But Labour's 'new economics' is a departure. The party has come terms with capitalism and is considering how to make it work rather than dismantling it.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Pace of recovery in housing market slows in past weeks THE recovery in the UK housing market has slowed considerably since the beginning of May, sales figures from 15 of the country's largest house builders show. The figures, compiled by Housebuilders Federation, show that net reservations  - sales on which deposits have been paid, less cancellations  -rose by about 10 per cent during the first two weeks of this month compared with the corresponding weeks last year. Weekly sales in spring were running more than 35 per cent higher than last year. At one stage during a four-week period at the end of March and the beginning of April, net reservations were as much as 50 per cent higher than last year. Builders say it is foolish to judge the state of the market on just a few weeks' sales figures and add that poor weather this month may have dissuaded some people from visiting show homes. Nonetheless there is concern that some of the steam has gone out of the housing market revival. The rate of increase had begun to slide even before June. A slowdown in the housing market would provide further evidence of the fragility of consumer confidence in a weak economic recovery. Retail sales, according to government statistics, fell slightly in May. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, told a housing market conference organised by Nat West Securities last week that house sales traditionally slowed after the Easter holiday, but it seemed likely that recovery from now would be gradual. The Housebuilders Federation figures showed net reservations by house builders up by almost 30 per cent during the first 5 1/2 months of this year, in spite of the recent slowdown. Estate agents have also expressed concern that sales may be slowing. A survey of more than 100 English and Welsh estate agents published last week by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that recovery was being threatened by potential sellers delaying putting homes on the market in the hope that prices would rise.

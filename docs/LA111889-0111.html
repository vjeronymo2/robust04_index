			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GE WILL SPEND UP TO $10 BILLION TO REPURCHASE ITS OWN STOCK  </P> <P> General Electric Co., cash-rich and seeking to win further favor with  shareholders, said Friday that it plans to spend as much as $10 billion over  the next five years to repurchase its own stock.  </P> <P> The huge buyback is evidence that GE believes it is generating more than enough  cash to sustain growth and is a signal that, after years on the prowl, it is no  longer actively searching for a multibillion-dollar acquisition. The  manufacturing and financial services conglomerate also increased its dividend  15%, to 47 cents a share.  </P> <P> "We don't see a blockbuster acquisition ahead," John F. Welch Jr., GE's  chairman, told securities analysts at a meeting Friday afternoon. "We've  reached the conclusion that GE stock is the best investment we can make."  </P> <P> A $10-billion stock buy would reduce the cumulative value of GE's outstanding  shares by 18% and would probably increase the value of each share. In dollar  value, the buyback is the largest ever announced by a company, although the  five-year term of the repurchase is longer than most.  </P> <P> Michael Howe, an analyst with the Butcher &amp; Singer brokerage in  Philadelphia, also noted that a number of other companies have repurchased  larger portions of their stock market value; last year, General Signal bought  back stock worth more than 30% of the total, he said.  </P> <P> The buyback announcement had a predictable reaction on Wall Street, which bid  up GE stock $2 a share to a close of $59.50. Volume was 3.11 million shares.  The news generally gave a push to the stock market, where the Dow Jones  industrial index closed up 17 points.  </P> <P> However, GE attached several caveats to the buyback plan. Company officials  said "unfavorable economic conditions" or an unexpected acquisition might  change their plans.  </P> <P> But Welch stressed that the economy looks "solid." And only a very tempting  acquisition target -- such as RCA Corp., which GE bought in 1986 -- could  persuade the company to change its current thinking on takeovers, he added.  "We're not looking for new businesses," he said.  </P> <P> Since he took over GE in 1982, Welch has reshaped the world's 10th-largest  industrial corporation, trimming it from 100 sometimes-marginal operations to  14 businesses with strong positions in their markets. The businesses include  aircraft engines, financial services, medical imaging equipment, appliances,  lighting and broadcast television.  </P> <P> Welch has sold $19 billion worth of assets in this decade and purchased $16  billion worth, notably including RCA, with its NBC Television unit, and the  Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. investment firm. Earnings per share have been rising  at an annual rate of 7.6% a share, contrasted with 4.9% a year under Welch's  predecessor.  </P> <P> Even after GE reinvests about $6 billion a year in the company, its far-flung  operations generate another $2 billion in cash each year.  </P> <P> Analysts noted that the buyback would make GE look good to investors in several  ways. It should continue to help the stock price and will improve the  return-on-equity and return-on-investment ratios that Wall Street follows  closely, they said.  </P> <P> "Every chief executive considers the stock price a sort of report card, and  this should help Jack Welch's," said Linda M. Shuman, analyst with Prudential  Bache Securities. She predicted that the buyback might boost GE's per-share  growth by as much as 2% a year.  </P> <P> GE insisted that the buyback does not mean that it is dissatisfied with its  current stock price. But some analysts disagreed, contending that GE officials  have wished that Wall Street had a fuller appreciation of the company's  financial progress.  </P> <P> At Friday's closing price, the stock was trading at slightly under 14 times  expected 1989 earnings. By comparison, the average stock in the Standard &amp;  Poor's 500 stock index is now trading at about 13 times earnings.  </P> <P> Shuman also said the buyback would quiet the worries of investors who have  feared that GE might make a large acquisition that would dilute the value of  their shares.  </P> <P> Because of GE's aggressive acquisition program during this decade, the company  is constantly the subject of Wall Street takeover rumors. Welch noted, with  amusement and exasperation, that GE officials continued to receive phone calls  even after Friday's announcement inquiring whether GE planned to purchase MCA  Inc., the big entertainment company based in Universal City.  </P> <P> Analysts said GE's decision to turn its attention from major acquisitions may  reflect in part the run-up prices for many companies. It may also reflect the  fact that GE will be busy attending to the acquisitions and joint ventures it  has recently made.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, the company announced that it will spend $150 million to  purchase a Hungarian light-bulb company. Earlier this year, it announced  European joint ventures in the mobile communications, appliance and gas-turbine  businesses. Last year, GE paid $2.3 billion to acquire Borg-Warner Chemical  Co., based in Chicago.  </P> <P> GE said Friday that it will purchase the shares in the open market. It said  credit-rating agencies have assured the company that the buyback will not hurt  GE's current triple-A debt rating.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAJOR BUYBACKS  </P> <P> The 10 largest individual U.S. corporate stock buyback programs.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:3.10IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Amount  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> General Electric  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $10  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Atlantic Richfield  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Fe  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Southern Pacific  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.42  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tenneco Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Exxon Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.57  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> GTE Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Merck &amp; Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ford  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> IBM Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> E.I. du Pont  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> de Nemours  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: IDD Information Services.  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Personal View: Partnership can lead to social justice It is easy to dismiss notions of social justice as a smoke screen for government intervention, an excuse for politicians to meddle in things that do not concern them. But as the Commission on Social Justice will emphasise today when we present our strategy for work and welfare, social justice cannot be divorced from economic prosperity. The government has failed to realise this. It has followed the simple idea that the fewer the rules, the more prosperous we will be. Convinced that cheaper production is the key to competitiveness, it has single-mindedly set about destroying the laws and institutions that govern the market. As a result, the UK is spending more than Pounds 1bn a year supplementing low pay through family credit. This obsessive pursuit of a low-skills, low-investment strategy is doomed. Our future prosperity depends upon our ability to compete with high-skill economies rather than the low-wage economies of the developing and newly-industrialised nations. Successful UK companies already know this. They attach great importance to teamwork and co-operation. They practise high standards of human relations, offer good wages, pensions and working conditions, provide clear and effective communication, long-term commitment and reasonable protection against redundancy. In return they expect and receive a high degree of commitment, and increased productivity, from their staff and suppliers. But the workplace and the nature of work are changing. Traditional, low-skilled industries find it virtually impossible to compete with countries such as China where wages are as low as Dollars 1 a day. Intelligent European businesses recognise that the only way forward is to invest in innovation and modern technology to create value-added products that are affordable. A massive change in the skills of the workforce is needed to succeed in making this transformation. Business must also respond to the changes that have brought millions of women into the workplace and transformed family structures. We must welcome these changes and adapt to them rather than resist them. Working patterns must enable women and men to cope with the demands of the family. The Commission has set out recommendations to help business, individuals and government meet economic and social change head on. First we need an education revolution to provide the basis for economic progress and social justice by opening up learning opportunities to people in and out of work. We cannot return to the era of jobs for life, but we can ensure that people remain employable. This requires commitment from employers and individuals. All but the very smallest employers should plough a minimum proportion of payroll back into training their workforces - the best already do. People benefiting from higher education must be prepared to contribute to learning costs. We suggest ways of harnessing funds from government, employers and learners to help expand education and training. Second, life on the dole creates social division and economic waste. Unemployment is now a spectre that haunts the Treasury and City institutions as much as shipyard workers on the Tyne. The aim must be to get people - especially long-term unemployed - off welfare and into work. The Commission's strategy includes a modern, flexible social insurance system; benefit reforms to enable people to take up part-time work; support for the self-employed; and wage subsidies to get the long-term unemployed back into jobs. Third, only through having loyal and committed workers can employers keep pace with competition. But employers must be prepared to show commitment in return. This means fair rewards through a carefully set minimum wage, recognising and accommodating family responsibilities, and reducing the segregation between men's and women's work. The aspirations of the European Union's Social Chapter hold no fears for any responsible, progressive British company and the government should sign it. The UK cannot hope to prosper if it continues along the road of mindless deregulation. Ours must be a future of investment and partnership: investment in people, communities and enterprise, and partnership between business, individuals, communities and government. As an industrialist, I cannot envisage sustained business success for any company that refuses to accept the responsibilities of partnership.

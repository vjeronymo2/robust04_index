Ho Sam-su  (Democratic Liberal Party) this week and question 33 others  accused of involvement in the coup, prosecution officials said  on Monday.    The prosecution will ask Ho why and how he put then-Army  Chief of Staff Chong Sung-hwa under the custody of the Defense  Security Command and call in other former senior military  officers who took part in the apprehension.    The accused include U Kyong-yun, then-chief of the Criminal  Investigation Detachment (CID), Song Hwan-ok, then-provost  marshal general office's planning division chief, Choe Sok-nip,  then-33 [as received] provost marshal and Yi Chong-min,  then-provost marshal of the Army headquarters.    A group of Army officers led by Gen. Chon Tu-hwan allegedly  mutinied and took control of the Army on Dec. 12, 1979 amid  political uncertainties following the assassination of President  Pak Chong-hui on Oct. 26, 1979.    The group apprehended Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, Army chief of  staff and martial law commander, alleging that he had been  involved in the president's murder.    After the inauguration of the civilian government of  President Kim Yong-sam in February last year, Chong and 22  others filed suit in July against Chon and 34 others on charges  of treason, which is punishable by death.</p>

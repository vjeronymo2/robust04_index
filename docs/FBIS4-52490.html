			<p>BFN     [Text] Sydney, May 11 KYODO -- Australia plans to increase  its staff in the consulate general in Japan's No. 2 business  center at Osaka, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Wednesday  [11 May]. Three new staff, one officer from the Department of  Foreign Affairs and Trade, and two local employees, will be  added to the 31-strong staff at the consulate, Evans said.    Evans said trade and tourism between Osaka and the vicinity,  and Australia will expand following the opening of New Kansai  International Airport later this year.    "Freeing up those officers who are currently dealing in  consular and administrative work will enable them to do more  analysis and commerce related work, and liaise more with  authorities in Osaka," a department spokesman said.    "While Australia's emphasis is on boosting links with all of  Asia, we are not forgetting our traditional friends and  marketplace in Japan," he said.</p>

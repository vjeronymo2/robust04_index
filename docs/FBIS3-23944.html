			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Huseynbaba Selimov: "The War, The Authorities, </F> The Opposition And...The Public"]    [Text] A question often heard from our readers and  acquaintance is: "Could recent operations at the front mark an  important turning point in the war?" Sometimes conditions demand  that certain questions remain unanswered but, unfortunately,  Azerbaijan's public, which is used to viewing all questions from  the point of view of relations between the rulers and the  opposition views silence itself from the same point of view...    We said above that sometimes conditions demand that some  questions remain unanswered. Why?    First, because a word written or an idea addressed to a wide  audience creates a definite opinion and a certain behavior as a  consequence of this.    On one hand, the situation in the world is now such that to  boast of strength is inappropriate, and advertisement or  publicity of such efforts can only harm Azerbaijan; for more  than five years the Armenians have attacked, taken new  territories, driven hundreds of thousands of people from their  lands and homes and made them refugees, and during these same  five years the Armenians have turned to the world and said:  "Help us, they are destroying us!" There is no need to transfer  some positive qualities special to our nation (faithfulness,  pride, etc.) to politics because the behavioral rules of  politics are different...    They say that the triangle is the most perfect, strongest  figure. It is certain that politics resting on three points will  also be strong and that from this point of view one must also  view politics from its three points and determine if its  "strength coefficient" is adequate. If one of these points is  the ruling group, then the other two are the opposition and the  public. Let us begin with the public...  <H5>  1. What Does The Public Say? </H5>   In order to get an idea of this it is sufficient to examine  the results of a poll conducted in the last months of 1993.    Eighty-three percent of those queried demanded that no  status  be given the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, and 12.4 percent  mentioned the possibility of being satisfied with cultural  autonomy.    In resolving the problem, 35.2 percent preferred a military  solution, 47.6 percent a military-political solution, and just  11.2 percent saw the way out through talks.    It is natural that public opinion is not stable and that  these numbers could change by going up or down. But the result  is in front of our eyes: the feeling of no reconciliation is  strong among our people and this feeling can be further  strengthened through military operations. The ruling circles  must take this factor into consideration in their policy.  <H5>  2. The Opposition Is Not Impeded... </H5>   We are not going to engage in classifying the opposition in  Azerbaijan, but a cursory view of the political forces in  Azerbaijan brings out an interesting detail: there is a lack of  proportion between relations to the opposition forces and their  "security coefficient."    Essentially, traditional forces or, more correctly, forces  which the ruling circle considers to be in opposition to them,  do not make up the opposition of today. Leaders of opposition  political forces have often said that they have organized their  activities within the framework of the constitution and  democratic principles, and have stated that they are taking  Azerbaijan's military-political situation into consideration.  The opposition today is only engaged in healthy criticism; as  for the ruling circles, they must make the effort to make use of  this criticism. The opposition cannot not accept a shortcoming  of its own: a policy advanced on questions of war (in general,  policy) must not be based on "temporary advances" but must  advance a future-based policy by turning these into long-term,  durable results.  <H5>  3. Finally, The Government... </H5>   It is impossible to advance a policy on wartime issues  without clarifying the Armenian military-political doctrine  (with regard to Azerbaijan). What goals are the Armenians  keeping to in enlarging and widening its geography?    One: The Armenian side understands well that talks will only  be profitable and useful for their side by controlling an ever  larger territory and they are expanding the geography of the  conflict with this goal; they are trying to expand not only  outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, but of Karabakh as a  whole, and, by this, gain "territories which could be  compromised" in future talks; they also wish to build a security  zone around Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan must not forget this  side of the issue and try to guarantee a "useful geography" for  the talks.    Second: It is clear to everyone that Armenia is not only  engaged in its own goals but also in realizing Russia's  geopolitical plans. At one time many doubted that the Armenians  would advance in the direction of Azerbaijan's southern borders  and used the Iran factor as an argument. But the recent  development of events has shown that the Armenians did advance  toward the southern borders and met with no opposition. In our  opinion, there is a reason for this: a situation had to be  created wherein Azerbaijan stood before a dilemma. This dilemma  consisted of to whom to give "control" over the southern  borders: "Armenia" or Russia? From this point of view, although  our military efforts have not been contradicted by definite  "advances" in our relations with Russia, it is difficult to  speak of real results.    Azerbaijan was forced to define its own "security space." It  became a member of the CIS. And perhaps it is a result of this  that Azerbaijan's name (or the Transcaucasus, since Georgia is  also a member of the CIS) is not mentioned in the talks between  two superstates -- the talks are more about regions that have  remained outside of "security zones" such as the Baltic and  Eastern Europe. We have selected our own destiny...Now one road  remains: making use of contradictions within the CIS and, with  this objective, broadening some bilateral relations.    Third. It was claimed at one time in Armenian propaganda  that  the Armenian community in our republic did not have the  guarantees to "survive" in a totalitarian Azerbaijani state.  Thus, the fact that Azerbaijan's name was listed among countries  where freedom of speech was limited, human rights, etc., were  violated could pose an obstacle to Azerbaijan's war policy.  Unity between the ruling party and the opposition on the war  issue has exceptional importance, and it is even necessary to  proclaim and advertise this unity. Thus, it should refrain from  accusations against the opposition: it could be that an  irreconcilable relationship against opposition forces gives a  certain effect domestically (even if this were the case, it  would be impossible to attain longterm stability in this way),  but from outside, from abroad, a polarized Azerbaijan as a  political union lacks esteem; on the contrary, our "near abroad"  can use this kind of polarization skillfully.</p>

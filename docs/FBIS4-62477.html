			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Ostrovskaya report: "Catching Illegals from Abroad </F> in Maritime Kray"]    [Text] Vladivostok -- In just two days of the operation  code-named "Foreigner" in Maritime Kray, more than 200 violators  of passport and visa regulations have been apprehended from  China, Korea, Mongolia, and nearby foreign countries -- the  former Union republics.    Some 48 of them (mainly Chinese) had absolutely no reason to  be in our country. Consequently, they were swiftly put on buses  and sent to the Maritime Kray settlement of Pogranichnyy. From  there the indisciplined foreigners were expelled by rail, in a  reserved car. The Maritime Kray militia reported that the  expulsion went quietly and professionally.    Operation "Foreigner" will continue until 20 May. Apart from  Vladivostok, the hunt for violators of passport and visa  regulations will be carried out in Ussuriysk, Nakhodka, and in  border settlements through which tourists, Chinese "traders"  [chelnochniki], and other foreign guests enter the kray and,  from there, other parts of the country.    Violators of passport regulations are not always quietly  expelled. In the first two days of the operation six criminal  cases have been brought against foreigners. The charge for all  of them is the same -- [Article] No. 196 (forgery, and the sale  and use of deliberately forged documents). As a rule, the  document in question will be a Soviet passport. Just how simply  and openly these forgeries are carried out is shown by the case  of a certain Choe Ko-un, a DPRK citizen.    He traveled to Vladivostok and rented an apartment in the  city center, but under the name of Andrey Vyacheslavovich  Khodykin rather than Choe Ko-un. He explained at the  investigation that he had acquired our hammer-and-sickle  passport in Ussuriysk from some strangers, paying 200,000 rubles  for it. It seems that it is not just the Russian ruble that is  being devalued.... What prospect does Choe Ko-un face? If he  is lucky, a year's imprisonment; if not, two years.    Operation "Foreigner" is extensively under way on several  fronts. Hotels, hostels, and private apartments rented by  foreign guests are being raided. Conferences are being held  with the leaders of local tour firms. These people often fail  to monitor the tourists' return home.    As a result, more than 4,000 Chinese have entered Maritime  Kray as tourists since the start of the year, but only slightly  over 1,000 have returned. So the figures quoted at the start of  this article for the number of foreigners detained in the course  of the operation are truly just a drop in the bucket.    Judging by the results of a raid on a famous Chinese flea  market in Vladivostok, it is time to open a permanent  specialized militia detachment there. Thus, in just one raid,  forces from the Special Purpose Militia Detachment and several  rayon internal affairs departments arrested 80 Chinese without  the necessary documents. The task of permanent militia  monitoring is made easier by the conditions in the local trading  system -- the flea market is surrounded by a strong barbed-wire  cordon, and the territory allocated to it is minimal.    Nobody today knows what the correlation between the local,  Maritime Kray population and the foreigners is. No estimate at  all can be made of the number of the latter, because of the lack  of registration and records for people crossing the border. The  range of opinions about their arrival is just as great as the  difference between the actual and the officially registered  "foreign presence" in Maritime Kray.    All we know is that, in comparison with last year, "foreign"  crime in the kray has grown threefold. There are 7,000  foreigners officially registered -- and, therefore, living  legally -- in Vladivostok alone. The overwhelming majority of  them are Chinese. They work at 200 enterprises in the kray  center and observe the passport and visa formalities. By all  accounts, they will not be affected by Operation "Foreigner."</p>

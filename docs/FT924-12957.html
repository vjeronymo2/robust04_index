			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Lacroix: the man of mystery AS CHRISTIAN Lacroix is the man who put the fizz into haute couture, turning it back into a fashion force to be reckoned with, you might expect any book by him to be innovative. And Pieces of Pattern: Lacroix by Lacroix (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 32) does not disappoint - at least visually. As a piece of design in which Lacroix took a leading part, it is a succes fou, printed in sections as bright and clashing as one of his summer dresses. It is lavishly illustrated with collage-style photographs showing the eclectic cultural influences on the man, and his own sketches, both for collections and, in a cute monochrome style, of important memories, from 1960s hippies to his black-clad great-grandmother. It will become a work of reference for students seeking to understand the inspirations of this designer who leapt to prominence, apparently from nowhere, five years ago. But as a read it is unsatisfactory, the title is well-chosen because the Pieces do not add up. A series of autobiographical sketches explain the influences but do not illuminate either his character or background. The mystery remains, presumably intentionally.</p>

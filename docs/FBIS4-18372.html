			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, the practical significance of the  minority blocking vote in the EU [European Union] Council of  Ministers, which has until recently been strongly disputed  because of the membership negotiations of the EFTA [European  Free Trade Association] states, is being overestimated. In any  case, in the EU the principle of unanimity governed complex  matters, and the qualified majority vote was decisive for issues  concerning the internal market, Kinkel told the DDP/ADN news  agency in Nuremberg.    Moreover, the EU foreign ministers had undertaken to  reexamine the whole procedure, which has now been decided, in  1996. It had at any rate been right not to let the accession of  the Scandinavian countries and Austria collapse over this  matter, Kinkel said.    Kinkel rejected criticism from the CSU [Christian Social  Union]-led Bavarian Government to the effect that German  interests were not being represented at national and  international level as matter of factly as other countries. In  view of its past, Germany was being "viewed critically" as a  reunited country, Kinkel said. However, there was "no reason to  slink around on velvet paws." Germany had so far done well out  of its "policy of restraint."</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major warns of threat to economy THE STEEP fall in share prices that followed opinion polls indicating a strong Labour lead was used by Mr John Major yesterday to underline his warning that the economic consequences of a Labour administration would be calamitous. 'One rogue poll, a glimmer of thought that there might be a Labour government', and Pounds 1.3bn was wiped off share prices, he told Tory supporters in south London. He insisted that the recovery had begun, and that only the the possibility of a Labour win would stop it. There was, he said in a radio interview, 'clear anecdotal evidence, clear survey evidence', that the recovery had started, and he warned that Labour's readiness to contemplate inflation at the European average - currently 4.6 per cent compared with the UK's rate of 4.1 per cent - would add Pounds 2 1/2 bn to the costs of industry. Earlier, the Tory campaign had suffered a further jolt with the remarkable absence of Sir David English, the editor of the Daily Mail, from Mr Major's visit to the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition. Tory supporters were clearly taken aback by Sir David's non-appearance. He had been top of the list of invited guests, and party aides had said he would be present to greet Mr Major. A statement from Sir David's office said he had not been informed of the visit. His non-attendance follows an editorial last Saturday that was severely critical of the Tory campaign, although the newspaper has been one of the party's most effective supporters. The editorial commented that the prime minister and his team had just 11 days left to 'raise their game', and make clear to voters the choice between sound Conservative economic policies and Labour. 'If they do not do so, they will lose and they will deserve to lose,' it said. Sir David's statement said that Mr Major's visit had been arranged at the last moment for security reasons, and that information about it was kept strictly to Angex, the company organising the exhibition. 'He is, in fact, seeing the prime minister this week for a lengthy interview,' the statement ended. The apparent tensions in the relationship between the Tories and the Mail come after the row about the Labour political broadcast on health last week, when Tory central office gave only to the Daily Express, the Mail's middle-market rival, the name of the consultant in the case. In the afternoon, people who were able to 'Meet John Major' at an informal question and answer session in Tooting, south London, heard the prime minister warn that 'Labour can damage your wealth'. He contrasted the rise in living standards for the person on average earnings, taking account of inflation, under the Labour government of 1974-79 - by just Pounds 2 a week - with the rise of Pounds 68 a week since 1979.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PALMER WAXES NOSTALGIC ON FINAL BRITISH OPEN  </P> <P> Nostalgia abounds at the 11th U.S. Senior Open.  </P> <P> There are those aging heroes -- Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Lee  Trevino -- playing with all the old flair and flavor that did so much to raise  professional golf to new heights 25, 30, 35 years ago.  </P> <P> For Palmer, another confrontation with his old friends and golfing foes,  however, is a prelude to a sentimental journey that will close an important  part of his career.  </P> <P> His appearance at the Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, next month will be  his last in the British Open.  </P> <P> "Unless something happens that I don't know of, this will be my swan song" in  the British Open, Palmer said before teeing off today in the first round of the  Senior Open.  </P> <P> "It will be a sentimental journey back to St. Andrews, 30 years to the day that  I went to my first British Open Championship," Palmer said.  </P> <P> Palmer finished second to Australian Kel Nagle in his first British Open  appearance in 1960, then won the title the next two years.  </P> <P> "Winning those two British Opens was an important step for me, an important  part of my career, something I'll always cherish," he said.  </P> <P> "I'll have the same caddy I had 30 years ago. I'm sure we'll do a lot of  reminiscing, remembering old times, shots played 30 years ago.  </P> <P> "It isn't that I wouldn't like to continue playing the British Open; it isn't  that I don't still enjoy it," said Palmer, now 60.  </P> <P> "But it's time. I'm getting older. It's time I started concentrating more on  our Senior Tour."  </P> <P> And the Senior Tour, he said, just keeps getting better and better.  </P> <P> "Scores keep going down. They're almost at the level of the regular tour. The  competition is very good, very strong," he said.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us are surprised at the success of the Senior Tour, but a  lot of us are surprised that it has raised to such a magnitude in 10 short  years."  </P> <P> Palmer, who continues to have putting problems, said the Senior Open  championships for golf's over-50 set should follow the trend of the Senior  Tour.  </P> <P> "Typically in recent months, we've have some exceptionally low scoring. I think  you'll see some good scoring here, some very good rounds," he said.  </P> <P> A case in point, he said, was the record-setting, 27-under-par performance by  Nicklaus in the Senior TPC three weeks ago. Trevino was 21 under par in the  same tournament.  </P> <P> Trevino, who plays the Senior Tour on a full-time basis, has won five times  this season and finished second in his last two starts. Nicklaus has won two of  his three Senior Tour starts.  </P> <P> "They certainly have shown us how strong they can play," Palmer said. "But they  aren't the only ones in the field.  </P> <P> "There's the same guys who were there 30 years ago on the regular tour, Gary  (Player), (Bob) Charles, Chi Chi (Rodriguez). All can win. Orville Moody played  a helluva tournament last year at Latrobe and won this championship, and he's  capable of doing it again.  </P> <P> "And there are some others in the field you don't hear much about: Don Bies,  Charles Coody, George Archer. You don't want to overlook them.  </P> <P> "All that being said, you can't get away from Trevino and Nicklaus and the way  they've been playing."  </P> <P> And what about Arnold's chances?  </P> <P> "I hope I'm able to find something in my putting that hasn't been there for a  while, something that will give me a little more confidence," he said.  </P></p>

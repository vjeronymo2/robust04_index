Jean Bartel, Miss America 1943,  said she relies on lanolin for her skin. "You can buy it in a big jar at  Rexall, and it only costs about eight bucks." Mary Ann Mobley (1959) sees  surgery in her future: "One day I'll go to the plastic surgeon and tell him to  start at my feet and work his way up." As for 24-year-old Turner, a veterinary  student from Missouri, she confessed she never wears makeup at school and hangs  out in her blue jeans, sweat shirt and "Sylvester putty tat" slippers.  </P> <P> LAMBADA FIX: Tonight the new Cannon Pictures film "Lambada" opens. And if there  is anyone out there who thinks she simply cannot live another second without  one of those short and sassy twirly skirts and sexy little tops, then remember  this number: (212) 879-4810. It's the direct hot line to the Gilda Marx  boutique, home of the Lambada dresses made for the movie. Marx is taking custom  orders for the separates that retail for $30-$50 from dancers desperate to show  their stuff.  </P> <P> LOOK MOM, NO THIGHS: Ever wonder how fabulous you'd look if you could just drop  those extra pounds?

East Coast teens have been seen  wearing necklaces made from the package ribbon from designer boutiques. Their  favorites are Hermes, Chanel, Benetton and Christian Dior. In New York City the  girls have taken to asking for the ribbon gratis, but Listen learned that it is  in such short supply at the Chanel boutique in Beverly Hills that the store  can't spare any for customers who don't make purchases.

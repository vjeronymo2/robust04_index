			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Conrad Continental shows improvement Conrad Continental, the Manchester-based leisurewear and sports group, yesterday reported a virtual break-even in the second half of 1991. The pre-tax loss for the year emerged at Pounds 378,000 compared with a first half loss of Pounds 380,000 and with a loss of Pounds 680,000 for the whole of 1990. In a deal worth up to Pounds 750,000 Conrad is acquiring Matchwinner, a Glasgow-based supplier of replica strips and related products for sports clubs. Conrad expects to sign agreements to supply a further two clubs before the start of the 1992/3 season. Mr Bobby Charlton, former Manchester United and England international footballer and a director of Conrad, said that Conrad had a leading presence in worldwide sports coaching and promotion and this acquisition represents an opportunity to enhance this position. Turnover of continuing businesses for 1991 amounted to Pounds 7.86m, compared with Pounds 6.31m. Losses per share came out at 1.7p (3.51p) and again there is no dividend.</p>

But government help is needed to further adapt them to the  market economy, economists say.    A recent survey conducted by the Fixed Rural Observation  Post  Office (Fropo) under the Agricultural Ministry confirms this  view.    China set up fixed observation posts 10 years ago in 312  villages.    "The posts aim at collecting firsthand information for  decision- makers drafting rural policies," said Fropo director  Yu Zhan, the survey creator and one of the analyzers of the  report.    Fropo's survey covered 7,012 rural households in the 312  villages. All the questionnaires were filled out and returned.    The survey found 58 percent of Chinese farmers have more  decision-making power, allowing them to decide what crops to  plant, how many and how to plant.    Before the implementation of rural reform, the State told  farmers what to plant. It was the sole supplier of production  materials and monopolized the purchase of farm products.    Thirty-three per cent of the respondents said they have full  autonomy over the sales of their crops after fulfilling the  State quotas on grain and cotton purchases.    And farmers now buy most of their production materials from  the market, according to the survey.    In 1992, the average rural household spent 756 yuan ($87) on  production materials and 90 percent of the cash was spent in the  market.    The survey also found 61 percent of the households in favour  of diversified channels to get farm production materials. They  said that it would lower prices, increase product variety and  force State dealers to improve service.    In addition, the survey found that farmers have more  channels  to get production funds, instead of taking out loans from banks  and credit cooperatives alone.    In 1992, the average household borrowed 423 yuan ($49) for  production accounting for 21 percent of the cash needed. Of  that total, 185 yuan ($21), or 44 per cent of the money, came  from banks and credit co-operatives, and the rest came from  individual lenders.    The survey shows that households engaged solely in farming  borrowed the least. Their borrowings accounted for only 16 per  cent of the cash they needed in annual farm production.    Households which owned land but did not engage in farm  production borrowed the most. Their borrowings accounted for 38  percent of the cash they needed in their annual production.  Unlike other households they also paid interest to the lenders.    They usually lease the land to other farmers and start  private businesses of their own, in their hometowns or in urban  areas.    "The finding reveals that the appearance of non-agricultural  sectors has boosted fund circulation in the countryside and that  a rural financial market is emerging," Yu said.    Before the rural reform, farmers were not allowed to leave  the land to look for jobs elsewhere. But in recent years, an  increasing number of farmers are migrating from underdeveloped  regions to developed areas.    "Because China has more people and less arable land, it's  necessary for surplus farmers to shift to non-agricultural  industries or where they're needed. And rural-urban migration  may result in the formation of a rural labour market," said Zhao.    But farmers are not all accustomed to the market economy,  partly because of poor government guidance and service.    According to the survey, in 1992, 13.8 per cent of the  decision- makers in rural households were still illiterates,  41.5 per cent were elementary school graduates, 34.5 per cent  were junior high school graduates and 10 per cent were senior  high school graduates. Only 3.9 per cent of them received  vocational training.    Poor education and the deep-rooted influence of the planned  economy cause many farmers to respond slowly to the market  economy.    To help farmers enter the market, the government has to  offer  farmers timely, accurate information and to establish more  markets for farm products.    The survey shows that information is what farmers need most  in the current market economy.    "They do not know what may sell well on the market. This  often leads to stockpiles," said Yu.    According to the survey, in 1992, 38 per cent of crude  drugs,  36 per cent of oranges, 30 per cent of hemp, 17 per cent of  timber, 15 per cent of oil bearing crops and 13 per cent of corn  production were stockpiled because of the information shortage.    Because of backward transportation, inadequate warehouses  and  poor processing skills, many farmers have to sell their products  cheap locally.    Three hundred and six households which specialized in  transporting farm produce to other regions for sales complained  about too many roadblocks and wanton charges.</p>

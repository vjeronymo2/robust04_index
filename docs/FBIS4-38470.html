			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian Communists have made  yet another attempt to torpedo the Russian president's six  decrees aimed at deepening economic reforms.    On the whole yesterday's situation repeated. Valentin  Martemiyanov, deputy from the faction of Communists, again  proposed to consider "the president's anti-constitutional  decrees". This time more deputies than yesterday voted for his  proposal but still the number of votes was not enough to include  this issue in the agenda of a plenary meeting of the session.    Representatives of the parliamentary lobby believe that the  opposition will continue attempts to impede the implementation  of Boris Yeltsin's decrees.</p>

Tretyakova, T.M. Avdeyeva, and L.S. </F> Voronenko, Southers Scientific Research Institute of Marine  Fishing and Oceanography, Kerch; UDC 628.394.6:57/59]    [Abstract] Dumping of anthropogenic materials including  many toxic and mutagenic ones into the Kerch Straight, one of  the most biologically productive areas of the Black Sea region,  not only disrupts benthic biocoenoses, mussel banks, and  traditional paths of fish migration but also causes a problem of  contamination. The worst offenders are fine-disperse particles  of contaminated soil, mainly aleurite and pelite. It therefore  has been necessary to monitor the toxicity of the Kerch Straight  ecosystem. Until 1989 this was done in shallow water on the  Savenko bank or in an experimental dump site. Since then  materials are being sampled in the mussel yard near cape Tuzla.  During the 1989-90 period samples were taken, among others, for  the purpose of determining the contamination of mollusks by  organic chlorine compounds: 1),2)  (_a_,_g_)-hexachlorocyclohexane, 3) DDT with its metabolites  and  polychlorobiphenyls. The specimens were analyzed by the method  of gas-liquid chromatography in a ``Yanako'' G-180 F.E.  instrument. During the March-April 1989 period of slow  physiological mussel activity and low phytoplankton vegetation  intensity the ratio of maximum to minimum pesticide  concentrations in water and in mussel clusters was found to be  most stable, owing to slowness of fermentation and of  biochemical reactions in mollusks. No polychlorobiphenyls were  found in the water during that period, evidently due to the  effective action of DDT combined with fast cementation and  subsequent fast sedimentation of particles. During the  March-August 1990 period of massive soil dumping the  concentrations of those compounds in both surface and bottom  layers in three sampling sites were respectively: 1) 0.041 and  0.044 mg/liter, 2) 0.026 and 0.027 mg/liter, 3) 0.020 and 0.024  mg/liter. The absence of polychlorobiphenyls facilitates massive  accumulation of insoluble organic chlorine compounds and their  adsorption by particles suspended in deeper water. Their spatial  overall distribution of organic chlorine indicates that they do  not spread far to the north into shallow shelf water. Figures 2;  tables 1; references 6.</p>

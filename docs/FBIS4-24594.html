			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Ding Baozhong: "Sino-Malaysian Friendly Ties </F> Reach New Level"]    [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 31 (XINHUA) -- China and Malaysia  are reaping the fruits of common efforts to forge friendship and  cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations on  May 31, 1974.    As the Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir put it,  links between the two countries stretched a long way back, but  it is only over the last two decades that the bilateral  relationship has reached a new level of understanding and  cooperation.    "In the last five years or so, bilateral relations have  increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation," he  added.    The visits by the state and government leaders to each  other's country deepened mutual understanding and trust and  pushed the relations into a new stage of all-round development.    Earlier this month, Mahathir visited China for the third  time. During the visit he met with President Jiang Zemin and  Prime Minister Li Peng respectively, exchanging views on the  bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern.    Since Mahathir's first visit to China in 1985, the two  governments have signed ten agreements including those on trade,  aviation, marine transportation, investment guarantee, avoidance  of double taxation, establishment of the joint economic and  trade commission, information and science and technology.    Two-way trade has been recording a double-digit growth since  1987 with 1993 seeing a 21 percent increase to 1.79 billion U.S.  dollars from 1.475 billion U.S. dollars in 1992. China has  stood as one of the biggest buyers of palm oil of Malaysia, the  world's largest producer.    Two-way investment has covered a wide range of industries  with a considerable expansion in volume and is moving toward  internationalized cooperation.    Incomplete statistics show that the number of Malaysians  travelling to China rose from 11,200 in 1989 to 125,200 in 1993  while the number of the Chinese touring Malaysia surged from  9,000 in 1990 to 85,000 in 1993.    Last year the two governments agreed to set up  consulates-general in each other's country. The Malaysian  Consulate-General in Guangzhou started business by the end of  last year while the Chinese one will be opened in Kuching,  Sarawak soon.    "On many major international issues, we are delighted to see  that our two countries share extensive common understanding and  have been maintaining good cooperation. We highly value the  Malaysian Government for its upholding justice and speaking out  to safeguard the rights and interests of the developing  countries in the international affairs and for actively  promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of  this region," Chinese Ambassador Qian Jinchang said recently.    "We have full confidence in the future development of the  bilateral relationship. We believe that the development of  long- term, stable and friendly relations between China and  Malaysia on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence,  is not only in conformity with the fundamental interests of our  two peoples, but also beneficial to the peace, stability and  development of this region," he added.</p>

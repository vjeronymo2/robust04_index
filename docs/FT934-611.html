			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's cotton output forecast at 500,000 tonnes Brazil's 1994-95 cotton output is forecast at 500,000 tonnes, up 40,000 tonnes from the current 1993-94 projection of 460,000 tonnes, according to a US agricultural attache, reports Reuter from Washington. The projection is based on estimated area increases in the two largest Center-South region states of Parana and Sao Paulo, the attache wrote in a field report and filed from Sao Paulo. Prices are expected to increase in 1994 and encourage producers to increase the area. Production in the north-east region is forecast to repeat the 1993-94 level of 50,000 tonnes, restricted by dry weather, boll weevil infestations and limited and expensive producer credit.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses cut back sharply as bonds rally - Market report A dramatic turnround in the government bond market helped UK equities rally strongly yesterday from a severe setback in early trading. The final hour of trading saw London outperform a general recovery by markets in France and Germany as some confidence was regained in the prospects for interest rate cuts in Europe. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 22.5 down at 3,248.1, having fallen to 3,195.7 at the height of the trading drama. Bargain hunting by the institutions and short-covering by marketmakers helped the share price rally in London which was also encouraged by a steadier trend on Wall Street in early dealings. Although somewhat more confident on European interest rate prospects, traders remained nervous of a further tightening of credit policy by the US Federal Reserve. Equity prices were hit hard at the beginning of the session when European bond markets collapsed on news that German M3 money supply had soared by more than 20 per cent in January - far above the worst of market forecasts and a serious blow to interest rate hopes. The Footsie plunged, driven down by widening discounts on stock index futures. By mid-morning, the Footsie was nearly 75 points down. The surge in German money supply was seen as threatening chances of a further cut in rates by the Bundesbank, and raised fears that inflation may be on the march again in Europe. The market rallied when the Footsie 3,200 mark was pierced, but recovery was very slight as London saw that the Standard &amp; Poor's futures contract was signalling a weak start on Wall Street. New York duly came in lower and extended its fall to around 50 Dow points in early trading. But London appeared to have already disengaged itself from the Dow average to some extent even before the US bond and equity markets rallied. By the London close, when the Dow's drop had been cut to 22 points following publication of economic data, and London bonds had staged their powerful recovery, UK stocks looked surprisingly confident. Stock index futures extended the recovery in later, unofficial, trading, holding out the prospect of a firm opening in equities today. The rally was focused on the blue chip stocks, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left to languish at a closing level of 3,901.8, a loss of 42.8 on the day. Once again, trading volume, as measured by the Seaq network, was modest, at 763m shares compared with 720.8m on Tuesday. Selling pressure has not been heavy in equities during the latest market setback, although some securities houses are believed to have suffered heavy losses in gilt-edged securities. There have been signs this week that the institutions have picked up cheap stock in the equity market. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.73bn on Tuesday, well at the higher end of daily averages. James Capel, London's largest agency broker, repeated its view that equities should be bought, drawing parallels with market experience in the 1980s and pointing out that shares did well then in spite of rises in bond rates because earnings recovered. At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Albert Edwards said that, while London had much to fear in the short term from further tightening by the US Federal Reserve Board, it was still likely that rates would be reduced in Europe in order to stimulate economic recovery.</p>

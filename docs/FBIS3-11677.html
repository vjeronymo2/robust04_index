			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The legislative wings in Congress support the  Democratic Action [AD] proposal for the discussion of a special  powers law that will allow the national Executive Branch to  issue decrees on tax laws that are before the Legislative Branch.    With the exception of the Radical Cause Party and National  Convergence, which are studying the AD proposal, the various  legislative wings feel the special powers law will help us gain  time in coping with the economic crisis, so long as the scope of  the special powers law covers all solutions.    [Begin recording] [Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Gustavo  Marquez] We believe that given the country's emergency situation  as a result of the crisis in public finances and the treasury,  it is fully justified to grant these powers to President Caldera  so he will urgently issue the tax laws -- with which we are all  familiar inasmuch as those drafts were presented to Congress  --so it will be possible to significantly reduce the fiscal  deficit.    [Social Action Party Deputy Nelson Chitty La Roche] That is  the only reason AD and the rest of the country should be  interested in expediting that process. In other words, we need  to gain time. But I do not know if we have gained much time  with the banking law, the stamp tax, and the judicial tariffs  law, all of which were issued through the special powers granted  to former President Velasquez. All of those measures are now  being studied and will probably be modified and revised.  Consequently, there are various issues that we must think about  and decide upon. First we must consider the urgency of the  legislation, something we do not deny. On the other hand,  Congress can provide the best treatment a law needs. The  Executive Branch is not meant to legislate in general but to  implement laws.    [AD Deputy Pedro Tabata Guzman] The government has  introduced  a package of tax or fiscal measures known as the Sosa Plan. We  must carefully study the many laws included in the plan, which  could take no less than 60 or 90 days. Therefore, given the  thorough analysis that this law package requires and the urgent  requirement the government has for a legal instrument -- a very  responsible instrument -- and after having spoken with all  political forces, we submit for the consideration of the Chamber  a special powers law that will allow the government to act  rapidly and find a solution to the huge problems that all  Venezuelans face. [end recording]    The various representatives of the parliamentarian wings  said  they were surprised at AD's proposal of a draft special powers  law.</p>

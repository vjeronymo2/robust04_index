It's down to minor details."  </P> <P> Canseco would not comment on the specific figure or the length of the deal, but  when asked if he would be the highest-paid player in the game, he said, "That  should be the obvious."  </P> <P> The highest-paid player in baseball currently is Don Mattingly, who has a  $19.6-million, five-year deal with the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> Canseco's representatives were asking for more than $23 million over five  years.  </P> <P> A's General Manager Sandy Alderson could not be reached for comment, and  Canseco's agent, Dennis Gilbert of Beverly Hills, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Jeff Borris, who works for Gilbert, was with Canseco in Oakland Friday. Borris  said the two sides had been negotiating while Canseco was on the disabled list.  "They negotiated in good faith during his injury," Borris said. "That was very  classy of them."  </P> <P> Canseco, 25, is currently playing with a one-year, $2 million contract. He is  eligible to become a free agent after the 1991 season.  </P> <P> After taking batting practice Wednesday and Thursday at Oakland Coliseum,  Canseco looked impressive Friday night, hitting more than a dozen balls deep  into the bleachers.  </P> <P> "My timing is still off, but the last round I really got loose," Canseco said.  </P> <P> The slugger hit 20 home runs with 50 runs batted in while batting .320 in 52  games before being placed on the disabled list with back problems.  </P> <P> He spent three nights in a hospital, where he was placed in traction, after  checking in at the suggestion of team officials. Canseco said he's had back  problems most of his life.  </P></p>

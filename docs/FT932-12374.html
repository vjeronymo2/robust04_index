			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Greek exporters fear heavy losses NORTHERN Greek exporters claimed yesterday they will face heavy losses as a result of losing access to transit routes through Serbia with the tightening of United Nations sanctions. The government said Greece intended to seek compensation from both the UN and the EC for sanctions-related losses. At present, about 40 per cent of exports from northern Greece to the European Community, the country's main trading partner, are carried by truck through Macedonia and southern Serbia, then through Hungary and the Czech republic, an official from the Exporters' Association of Northern Greece said. Trucks will now have to follow a longer route to Hungary through Bulgaria and Romania, taking 24 hours longer and adding up to 20 per cent to freight costs, the official said. Moreover, imports of raw materials for northern Greek industry, will also be affected. About 1,600 trucks used to arrive every week in Thessalonika, the region's industrial centre, after transiting through Serbia. Although some exporters started shipping goods by ferry from western Greece to Italy after conflict broke out in the former Yugoslavia in mid-1991, more than 20,000 Greek trucks used the route through Serbia last year. The ferry route is mainly used by exporters based in southern Greece.</p>

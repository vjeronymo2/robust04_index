			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY COLLEGE PROFITS AT THE FREE-THROW LINE  </P> <P> In its 107-101 Western State Conference victory over visiting Ventura on  Saturday night, Valley College might as well have pitched a tent at the  free-throw line.  </P> <P> The Monarchs went there 44 times, converting 32 shots, to remain undefeated in  the WSC with a 6-0 record.  </P> <P> Ventura fell to 4-2 in the WSC and 17-8 overall.  </P> <P> Valley (15-8), which forced 26 Ventura turnovers, led comfortably at halftime,  60-43, and built a 92-67 advantage with 6 minutes, 31 seconds to play. But the  Monarchs, who didn't score a basket the final eight minutes, couldn't stand the  prosperity.  </P> <P> Ventura, led by center Lester Neal (25 points and 12 rebounds) and forward Leo  Parker (16 points), went on a 25-4 run to cut Valley's lead to 96-92 with 1:50  remaining.  </P> <P> The Monarchs committed 13 second-half turnovers, most of them during Ventura's  surge.  </P> <P> Valley, which had 11 less field goals than Ventura in the second half, shot 18  free throws in the final 4:42, converting 14 of them.  </P> <P> Reserve guard Eric McDaniels was six of seven from the line down the stretch  for Valley, Rick Garrick was two of two, Shawn DeLaittre was three of four, and  Andre Harrell, who scored a game-high 28 points, was three of five.  </P> <P> "Their pressure got to us," said DeLaittre, who finished with 22 points, eight  rebounds and a cut lip courtesy of an errant Pirate elbow.  </P> <P> "I remember back when I played at Simi Valley High, we blew a 25-point lead  against Bishop Gorman and they beat us. That was going through my mind."  </P> <P> Harrell scored 17 points in the first half when Valley went on a 26-11 run over  the final eight minutes to break open a close game.  </P> <P> Steve Ward came off the bench for 12 first-half points for the Monarchs but  played little in the second half as Coach Jim Stephens chose to keep him on the  bench.  </P> <P> Shelton Boykin (14 points) and Garrick (10, all in the second half) also scored  in double figures for Valley, and Cliff Barnes added 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> Terrence Lamb and Chris Hantgin had 16 and 15 points for Ventura.  </P></p>

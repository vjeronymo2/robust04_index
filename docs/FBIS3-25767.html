Chief Secretary for the CP Dr. Lem Theron says it seems as  though the American contribution is directed at giving  assistance to the ANC [African National Congress]-SACP [South  African Communist Party] alliance so as to subject whites within  the SADF to the authority of the ANC-SACP blacks in a process of  blatant racist affirmative action.    The CP requests all military personnel who are to be  subjected to this degrading and humiliating action to see the  American advisers for what they really are as there is no merit  for their so-called expertise regarding racial integration. Dr.  Theron said the U.S. is an excellent example of a country where  racial integration has failed. Since the 1960's, the U.S. has  been trying -- with its "melting pot" [preceding two words in  English] approach -- to unite all races and cultures in one big  American society.    These efforts have failed dismally despite forced blackening  of white schools through active integration of blacks in the  civil service through affirmative action and others, such as the  dishing out of significant roles to blacks in movies.    Despite all their efforts, the natural tendency for races to  associate with their own has led to the phenomenon where blacks  and other ethnic groups have demonstrated -- in the course of  time -- preference for association with their own people by  spontaneously establishing black and own culture-dominated  schools.    There are currently 18 black-dominated universities in the  U.S.A. which give priority to black students.    According to Dr. Theron, the black caucus in the U.S.A's  House of Representatives is damning evidence against forced  racial integration.</p>

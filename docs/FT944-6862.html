			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Auditors oppose disclosure of 'letter' Company auditors and managers believe that publication of the 'management letter' would improve corporate governance - yet most auditors do not want to disclose the contents of the letter, says a survey published today. The 'management letter' allows auditors to advise management on accounting methods, internal controls and ways to improve efficiency. It is never disclosed to shareholders, in spite of their technical role in being ultimately responsible for the appointment of the auditor. The survey, by the department of accounting and financial management at the University of Essex, was based on interviews with 105 top auditors and 181 managers at the top 100 listed companies. Auditors, asked to score the benefits of publication between one for 'none', and five for 'great extent' gave an average figure of 3.12 in terms of improving shareholders' assessment of management competence. However, 63 per cent of auditors rejected suggestions that they should formally report on company procedures in their audit report. Professor Michael Sherer of the University of Essex said: 'It is somewhat ironic that whilst auditors are appointed by shareholders to monitor the activities of management, shareholders have little means of evaluating how effectively auditors are performing their monitoring task.' Mr Gerry Acher, head of audit at accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said although he had not studied the research he felt management letters were of little use to shareholders. He said: 'It would be like buying a car and being given a technical assessment of the fuel-burning qualities of the vehicle.' The Usefulness of Management Letters. ACCA, PO Box 66, Glasgow, G41 1BS.

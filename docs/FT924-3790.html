			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / A final foreign fray: The US military venture in Somalia For the fourth and surely last time on President George Bush's watch, American soldiers are being sent in numbers overseas on a specific military mission. But Somalia is different from its predecessors in Panama, the Gulf and northern Iraq, though it bears some resemblance in purpose to Operation Provide Comfort 18 months ago, which sought to protect the Kurds from Saddam Hussein. It is different mostly in that it was unexpected. It is not easy to piece together how and why the Bush administration decided on the eve of Thanksgiving last week that the US military should be despatched to Somalia to ensure that humanitarian relief supplies got through. The first contingent of 1,800 Marines out of a United Nations-authorised force that might run to 20,000-plus were already off the coast yesterday. There is no dissent from the obvious - that this was George Bush's decision. It may best be seen as the final act of a humiliated president, no longer grubbing for votes, anxious to go out on a high note, and persuaded that a Somali operation was militarily manageable where a Bosnian one was not. It is instructive that nobody else has tried to claim responsibility, and the president, having conceded he felt adrift after his election defeat and grieving over the death of his mother, appears energised again. It was unexpected mostly because there was no extraordinary discernible pressure on the administration to act in a country where no vital US interest is even remotely at stake. Congress was in post-election recess and while some graphic US press reports on the suffering in Somalia filled the news void in the interregnum between the Bush and Clinton governments, they were by no means comparable to those which helped bring about the Kurdish effort. Only yesterday did the heavyweight television anchormen start landing in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. The administration itself seemed in pure lame duck mode. White House daily briefings had virtually ceased to exist, James Baker, Mr Bush's eminence grise in so many things, has not been seen for a month and the State Department's morale was further laid low by the disgrace of its involvement in the rifling of Mr Clinton's passport files. There were no overt hints that the Defence Department had revised its long-standing aversion to open-ended and under-prepared military ventures. The Clinton transition team was still in its formative phase and barely in a position to make suggestions or come to conclusions. In any event, the president-elect had made it clear that until his inauguration, Mr Bush was in charge. Nor were there great external pressures for involvement in Somalia. Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, had set in motion Security Council deliberations about precisely what could be done about the unfolding humanitarian tragedy, but his leverage in Washington is limited. Other leading western powers had been conspicuously cautious, another contrast with the Kurdish venture in which Mr John Major, the British prime minister, had taken such a lead. The relief agencies, concerned for the safety of their own personnel on the ground, seemed ambivalent about the wisdom of military intervention, even though they reported that perhaps only 20 per cent of relief supplies were being delivered to those who desperately needed them. There are theories that it was the State Department, traditionally more interventionist than the Pentagon, intent on restoring its reputation and free of Mr Baker's tutelage, took the critical initiative. Certainly the policy paper which Mr Bush ultimately approved last week was principally drafted by Mr Frank Wisner, the under-secretary for international security affairs. But at least one cabinet member intimately involved in the process and now with no particular axe to grind flatly denies that Foggy Bottom took the lead. The military high command did undertake a fresh risk analysis of Somalia. It has been a practical rule of thumb of the maximum force doctrine of General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, that whatever troop deployment might be considered necessary to do the job needs to be multiplied by five to ensure success. The Pentagon still insists, and has got its way, that US forces answer to US, not UN, commanders. It is also considered critical that whatever the US engagement, its duration must be defined as carefully as possible. Mr Dick Cheney, the secretary of defence, talks freely of the necessity of handing over authority to the 'blue helmets' (the UN) as soon as the current threat to relief supplies is neutralised. Of imponderable, but perhaps significant, impact were external inputs into these deliberations, for example those of Mr Fred Cuny, who runs a consulting firm, Intertect, out of Dallas, Texas. He has often been described as the Red Adair of the relief business, a hard-nosed freelance troubleshooter familiar with regular and irregular military capabilities. He is now back in Somalia but he told Mr Paul Wolfowitz, head of the Defence Department's policy planning, and anybody else who would listen in Washington in the middle of last month, that the Somali gangs holding relief supplies hostage were simply no threat to a high-tech military. He estimated that a US force of perhaps 3,500 men would be sufficient for the immediate task at hand. But Mr Cuny does not pull the sort of weight here that all high-level doors open to him. In this transitional and Baker-free vaccuum, he was much helped by the old resident foreign policy establishment, mostly now out of government, though it certainly includes Mr Wisner and Mr Wolfowitz. A leading, discreet role was undoubtedly played by Mr Morton Abramowitz, the veteran diplomat who now runs the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, where he is emphasising contemporary humanitarian issues. He has friends all over town and in the media and some say that it was he who made sure Mr Cuny's views were received in the right circles, including the foreign policy columnists of The New York Times. Thus, only belatedly, has the wider political Washington begun to wonder if this latest military venture is wise and if Mr Bush's hope that it can be concluded by the time Mr Clinton takes office next month is realistic. Mr John Murtha, of the House appropriations committee, has raised the congressional flag of warning, which the president sought to calm by briefing the Capitol Hill leadership yesterday morning. Any number of old Africa hands, such as Mr Chester Crocker, formerly of the State Department, have spoken of the complexities of forging a necessary political resolution in Somalia. This is, of course, beyond the brief of the US forces. It will not necessarily be beyond the brief of the next US administration.</p>

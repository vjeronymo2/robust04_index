			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Video delivery system garners interest in Japan A NUMBER of significant Japanese companies are expressing interest in a revolutionary new system of delivering feature films direct to the home. Electronic video hire could turn out to be a powerful rival to both satellite subscription film channels and the local video store. Mr William Kraven, an American entrepreneur and founder of EMC2 - Entertainment Made Convenient - is hoping to get his business off the ground in Japan and then move to joint ventures in the UK and other European countries. Under the EMC2 proposal, a customer would be able to order a film and have it downloaded to a special receiver in five minutes. Using the capacity of six satellite channels, 200 different feature films could be delivered electronically to customers across a continent. 'We don't see ourselves as being in the movie rental business. We are in the digital distribution business,' said Mr Kraven, who emphasised that the technology - digital compression - already exists to turn his venture into a reality. Mr Kraven, who has been working on the idea for more than three years, is currently in negotiations with Bandi, the large Japanese toy company; NTT, the national telecommunications organisation; and several leading Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers. Sanwa Bank has also expressed interest and has introduced Mr Kraven to other potential investors in Japan. In the UK, where EMC2 hopes to set up a joint venture operation, the company is represented by Mr Roy Warman and Mr Terry Bannister, both former joint chief executives of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Communications, the advertising agency group. To take part in electronic video hire, customers would need a special receiver costing around Pounds 300, although Mr Kraven hopes the necessary electronics eventually will be included in video recorders. Customers would then call either a freephone number or use a keypad to order the film of their choice from a catalogue. 'Unlike the video store, we will never be out of stock of the most popular films,' says Mr Kraven, who hopes to launch his service in Japan in 1994.</p>

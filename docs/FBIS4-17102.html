			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Iosin report: "Serbs Inflict Cruel Blow on Russian </F> Diplomacy's Prestige"]    [Text] The continuation of the Serbian offensive against  the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, which is expected to fall at any  moment, is the most serious defeat for Russian diplomacy in  recent times and leaves few hopes for a peaceful settlement of  the Bosnian crisis. The efforts of Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin, who tried to persuade  the Serbs not to enter into confrontation with the world  community and to end the siege of the city, declared a "safe  area" by the United Nations, have proved to be in vain.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic have not fulfilled a single one of the promises  which they lavished on Russian diplomats. And now it is too  late to discover whether Belgrade deliberately misled Kozyrev  and Churkin, or whether the political leadership have lost  control of the Bosnian Serb troops, which now obey only General  Ratko Mladic, dubbed in Russian diplomatic circles "the Serbian  Makashov" [general prominent in October coup attempt].    Addressing journalists on his return from Bosnia, Vitaliy  Churkin looked extremely disappointed. Never before have such  hardline words against the Serbs been heard from his lips. He  called on the Russian authorities to break off all contacts with  the Bosnian Serbs, who, in his words, were using Moscow's  intercession as a cover, and were simply stalling for time:  "The Bosnian Serbs should understand that in Russia they are  dealing with a great power, and not a banana republic. Russia  must decide whether to allow a group of extremists to exploit  the policy of a great country to achieve their goals. Our  answer is unequivocal -- `Never.'"    "If the Bosnian Serbs fire just one more salvo against  Gorazde, a huge crisis will erupt which will plunge the Serbian  people into catastrophe," Churkin warned, intimating that in the  prevailing situation there can be no question of lifting  international sanctions against Yugoslavia.    And although on Tuesday morning Anatoliy Krasikov, leader of  President Yeltsin's press service, tried to soften the impact of  Churkin's words, calling his assessment "a personal view," it is  hard to imagine that recent events will have no influence  whatever on the policy of Russian diplomacy in the Balkans.  Damage has been inflicted on the prestige not only of Churkin  and Kozyrev, but on that of Yeltsin himself: The world has seen  that even the Serbs -- "our historical allies and brothers in  the faith" -- have disregard Moscow's opinion.    Hopes for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian crisis remain  very limited. UN General Secretary Butrus-Ghali has requested  that NATO use its aircraft to defend the Muslim enclaves in  Bosnia, and U.S. President Bill Clinton held a conference with  his advisers 19 April, examining the possibilities of a military  operation against the Serbs. And although Yuliy Vorontsov,  Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations, again  opposed air strikes without prior consultations in the Security  Council, no one supported Moscow.    There is a growing conviction in the West that, now that the  Bosnian Serbs have demonstrated how easily they break their  commitments, it is hardly possible to bank on dialogue with them.    The easing of sanctions against Belgrade, which only  recently  seemed entirely realistic, is postponed indefinitely: Where are  the guarantees that, as soon as sanctions are lifted, the  Serbian authorities will not return to their previous policy?  In that case the international community would be left  powerless. In order to punish Yugoslavia again, Russia's  support is essential, which can practically be ruled out in view  of the changes which have occurred in our political life in the  past year.    Contradictory reports are coming from the region of Gorazde.  According to the testimony of UN and International Red Cross  spokesmen, the city is "effectively taken." If news agencies  are to be believed, Gorazde's death throes are continuing; the  Serbs are subjecting the enclave to mass bombardment, but have  not yet established control over it.    If the reports that the city has not yet been taken are  confirmed, in the opinion of IZVESTIYA's interlocutors in the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in that case, the Serbs  still have a last chance to avoid a NATO air strike and at least  partially recover Moscow's trust -- by calling an immediate  cease-fire and withdrawing their troops from the besieged city.    If this does not happen, all the signs suggest that Russia  will in no way be able to help either Radovan Karadzic or his  soldiers...</p>

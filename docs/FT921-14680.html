			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Arts: The Bells - Riverside Studios After his first night triumph in The Bells at the Lyceum in 1871, Henry Irving was asked by his wife on the way home to Fulham: 'Are you going to go on making a fool of yourself like this all your life?' Whereupon, the family history goes, Irving descended from the carriage, at Hyde Park, never went home, nor spoke to his wife, again. Over the years Britain's first actor-knight performed the leading role in The Bells more than 800 times and was still performing it almost the night before he died in 1905. Afterwards, the role passed to his elder son, H B Irving, who went on playing it to some acclaim until the end of the First World War. That information is drawn from a fascinating book, Henry Irving and The Bells, published by the Manchester University Press in 1980. Some of the history is worth bearing in mind if you contemplate seeing a new version of the piece by Daryl Runswick from the Green Light Music Theatre at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. For The Bells is full of paradoxes. Although thought of as a quintessential bit of British theatre history because of the association with Irving, it is not an English play. The original version was called Le Juif Polonais and was first performed in Paris just before the Franco-Prussian War. The action is set in Alsace. Several versions quickly appeared in London: it was a drunken journalist/lawyer named Leopold Lewis who turned the original into the more English-sounding The Bells which was to be the making of Irving. The bells are those of a snow-sleigh, not the church. It is also questionable how far the piece can be accurately described as a play. There was always a good deal of music in it, including an overture. That was partly the fashion of the time: somewhere between opera and drama. The music for The Bells was written by Etienne Singla who had produced the score for Le Juif Polonais and was brought to London to conduct the first Irving performance. The piece has no great or even long speeches. It lasted no more than 90 minutes, the same as the new version at the Riverside. It is about a man who committed a murder for money, became rich and respected thereafter, and remained unsuspected. The psychological drama is about the guilt in his own mind. Exactly 15 years later, it catches up with him. There is no more to it than that. Irving must have made his mark more by his presence and gestures than by any of the lines he had to speak. It was said from the first night onwards that it was a one-part play. The version at the Riverside, directed by Stephen Langridge, is certainly not that. It may even claim to be more opera than drama, though even that is debatable. There were times when I was reminded of Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw, but the music is never quite assertive enough for long enough for the music to take over. Only towards the end does it become dominant. Apart from the singing, it is confined to clarinet, cello and piano. Appropriately, however, the tiny chamber orchestra sits in the pit. Yet none of those comments should detract from the pleasure of seeing this production. The Bells in any form is a haunting work and the Riverside is a haunting theatre. The production has at least two alphas: the tight use of gauze behind which the stage action and the singing takes place and which makes the performance more ghostly; and the brilliant use of taped half-heard conversation during the wedding reception. Nothing is ever overdone. Mathias, the villain-hero, is played and sung by Philip Langridge, the father of Stephen, the director. Philip is not Irving, but nor is he meant to be. This is a sub-Brittanesque gloss on an old favourite. Nevertheless, the magic still works.</p>

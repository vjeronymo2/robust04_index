			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Williams makes Pounds 40m sale to management: The first fruits of a strategy change Williams Holdings, the once acquisitive conglomerate which has been seeking a more appropriate role in the sober 1990s, yesterday took the first real step towards refocusing its businesses. The group announced the sale of part of its engineering division to venture capital-backed management for Pounds 40.3m. It is selling six businesses to Cortworth, including Newage Transmissions purchased for Pounds 20m in 1987. Williams will retain Fairey Engineering, the military bridge engineer. The disposal had been expected since Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, outlined a strategy in September of focusing on building products, and fire and safety. A sale of the electronics division is also expected, although not imminently. Williams will provide Cortworth with substantial backing as part of the disposal agreement. This includes reinvesting Pounds 15m of the consideration in deep discount loan notes, which roll up interest, and a Pounds 3m credit support. The company will also retain an involvement in Cortworth through a deferred consideration. Depending on Cortworth's performance, the deferred element could take the form of an equity stake of up to 25 per cent upon flotation or a cash payment in the event of a trade sale. The potential value of this has been estimated at Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m. Analysts welcomed the disposal as a sign that Williams was getting to grips with its transition from a conglomerate to a more focused group of businesses. They also estimated that this would reduce year-end gearing from about 45 per cent to 35-40 per cent. However, some remained sceptical about progress, given the structure of the deal and the retention of Fairey Engineering. 'If it was such an attractive deal, it is surprising they did not exit altogether,' said one. 'And why not get terms with a loan which gives cash interest?' Mr Rudd said the deal allowed Williams' shareholders to benefit from any recovery. 'These are good businesses, but not necessarily for Williams,' he said. 'They are better owned by other people.' The businesses being sold contributed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6m, marginally ahead of last year, and sales of Pounds 46m for the 11 months to November 26. Net assets stood at Pounds 38.5m. However, Williams would incur a Pounds 17m exceptional loss on the transaction after writing off goodwill which had previously been charged to reserves. The management buy-out team is led by Mr Bill McMurray, head of Williams' engineering division. Cortworth's non-executive chairman will be Mr Roger Pinnington, former chief executive of Royal Ordnance. He was also formerly chairman of Telfos and Blackwood Hodge. The management will hold 28.6 per cent of Cortworth, while NatWest Ventures will have 49 per cent and Barclays the balance. Lex, Page 12</p>

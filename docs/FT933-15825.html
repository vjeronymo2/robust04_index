			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: The same people will do the same jobs - Potential effects of the Lords rebellion on the BR sell-off BRITISH RAIL may not have an unblemished reputation as a railway operator, but it knows more about running trains than any other organisation in the country. Would it not be odd then to prevent it from bidding for franchises after privatisation? This straightforward argument lies behind Monday night's parliamentary rebellion in which Conservative peers joined opposition parties to subvert a central tenet of the government's privatisation plans. The Department of Transport's position since rail privatisation was mooted a year ago has been that allowing BR to compete for franchises would undermine the point of privatisation - to move the operation of passenger services into the private sector. Barely six weeks ago Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, fought off a backbench rebellion on the issue as the Railways Bill passed through the Commons. But now an embarrassing defeat in the Lords has resulted in the addition of a clause to the bill that would allow BR to become a franchisee. The amendment was proposed by Lord Peyton of Yeovil, a former Conservative transport minister, who argued that it would provide a better measure of continuity during the privatisation process than the government had proposed. Peers were left in little doubt about the government's strength of feeling about the proposal when Lord Caithness, the government's transport spokesman in the Lords, argued that it would 'undermine the whole franchising process'. The government's fear is that if BR were allowed to join in the bidding, the franchises might never pass into the private sector - for at least five reasons: BR's inside knowledge of the financial performance and potential of its passenger services would give it an unfair advantage over the private sector in pitching its bid. As a government-owned body, BR would have access to capital at much lower rates of interest than the private sector and would not need to generate such high rates of return. BR's breadth of operations would enable it to submit artificially low bids for routes by cross-subsidising them with revenues from other services. BR could always undercut private-sector rivals on price in the knowledge that, if the numbers failed to add up at the end of the year, it could go to the government and ask for a bigger subsidy. The management/employee buy-out teams now considering bids would be severely constrained from pressing ahead by the notion of competing with their employers. Some support for these reasons comes from Sweden where the government has also started to open its railway services to private-sector competition but allows Swedish State Railways to join in the bidding. The process is still at an early stage and only regional and local services have been opened to competition, but experience so far has shown that nearly every passenger service has gone to the state railway company because the private sector cannot beat it on price. In Britain the government's view is that the debate over BR's participation in the privatisation process is unnecessary because it is based on a false premise: that BR's knowledge and expertise would be lost if it ceased to become a train operator. In fact, surprisingly little may change when private-sector franchisees take over services. Most of the same people will carry on doing most of the same jobs. It will be rather like a corporate takeover, where new management takes over at the top but most of the rest of the workforce stays the same. One company interested in taking over some services - Badger Rail, a division of the bus operator Badgerline - says: 'What we can bring along is organisational skills, marketing skills, and some private enterprise flair to it all, so we end up working in conjunction with BR's in-house expertise to make a better job of the whole thing.' Mr Philip Snowden, Badger Rail's managing director, did not attempt to disguise his concern over the latest turn of events in parliament: 'Certainly we would have to consider very carefully whether we were still interested in passenger service franchising if BR as an organisation were allowed to bid.' Other would-be franchisees felt confident the government would have the offending clause removed from the bill when it returns to the Commons after the summer break. Also, as one optimistically observed, it would not be the end of privatisation if BR were allowed to bid: all the government would need to do would be to tell the franchising director that BR should never, under any circumstances, win.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE: Building permits for single-family homes in the county are at  their lowest level since 1986, but builders aren't panicking. . . . Permits are  down 28% from 1988 and 14% from 1987, but last year's figures may have been  boosted by concern that a slow-growth initiative would pass, a building  industry spokesman says.

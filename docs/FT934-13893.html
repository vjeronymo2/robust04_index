			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Italian government ready to rein in intelligence services ITALY'S intelligence services are to be reorganised under a single authority, controlled directly by the prime minister. This was the outcome of a special meeting called on Monday evening by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of the senior ministers, defence chiefs and heads of the intelligence services. The meeting had been prompted by mounting evidence that elements of Italy's intelligence community were linked to organised crime and had been behind acts of terrorism. Legislation outlining the new authority is expected to be submitted to parliament in the form of a decree by the end of the month. The two principal existing agencies - Sisde (domestic intelligence) and Sismi (military intelligence) - will disappear. They will be replaced by two revamped organisations whose responsibilities will be split between domestic and foreign intelligence activities. However, direct ministerial responsibility will remain as it was with Sisde and Sismi - the Interior Ministry will supervise domestic intelligence, the Defence Ministry the foreign (and national security) side. Recruitment is due to be by exam and the previously large covert budgets are expected to be curtailed. The intelligence services were last restructured in 1977. Parliament and the prime minister have exercised negligible monitoring powers. Despite repeated scandals, and known links with right-wing extremists, the P2 Masonic lodge and elements of the Mafia, the intelligence services have remained a law unto themselves. The question now is the likely behaviour of the large numbers of intelligence personnel being made redundant. Many commentators believe the fears of these people who risk losing their jobs and their immunity has been behind the recent wave of bombings, coup rumours and campaigns of misinformation.</p>

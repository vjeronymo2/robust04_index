			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi  Hong-ku said on Friday an economic sanction against North Korea  would be unavoidable unless there is a change in Pyongyang's  attitude with regard to the nuclear question.    "I understand the concrete time and method of a sanction  will  be determined after the U.N. Security Council studied a report  from Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA)."    Yi, concurrent national unification minister, made the  remarks at a working luncheon with the members of the foreign  policy, unification and security subcommittee of the ruling  Democratic Liberal Party's special committee for the buildup of  international competitiveness.    He indicated that even if China were shy of taking part in a  sanction, Seoul and its major allies could mount an effective  sanction.    "China's particpation in an international sanction is  desirable," Yi said. "But, it is obvious that even if China does  not take part, an economic sanction by South Korea and its major  allies like the United States and Japan would deal North Korea a  serious blow."</p>

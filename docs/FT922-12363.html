			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Co-op checkout staff win 6.8% rise ABOUT 30,000 checkout operators employed by the Co-operative Union are to receive a rise of 6.8 per cent after a review of wages aimed in part at eradicating alleged pay discrimination against women. The increase is part of a package for 70,000 shop, clerical, transport and catering workers which will add Pounds 50m to the Co-operative stores' pay bill in a full year. It is being recommended by Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. The proposed deal, which incorporates annual rises, provides a guaranteed basic minimum increase, excluding un-social hours payments, of Pounds 5 a week or 4.2 per cent, whichever is the higher, for all full-time adult workers. This compares with an inflation rate of 4 per cent. With the simultaneous introduction of a new grading structure for retail employees, most will receive bigger rises. The revision of the pay structure is similar to those by other retail employers including Tesco and J. Sainsbury. All have wanted to guard against claims from female employees that they do work of equal value to groups of predominantly male workers but are paid less. Other retailers paid out more following their reviews. However, most changed their grading structures at a time when inflation and pay settlement levels were higher. The rise takes the pay of the Co-op's checkout operators to Pounds 135.52 for a 39-hour week. When allowances for unsocial hours are stripped out this translates into an hourly rate Pounds 3.34. This is below the minimum wage of Pounds 3.40 an hour which the Labour party would have introduced from next year if it had won the general election. By next year, however, when the minimum wage would probably have been introduced, the Co-op rates will have risen above Pounds 3.40. Wages of clerical workers will rise from Pounds 135.61 to Pounds 141.31. Mr Frank Dugdale, chief industrial relations adviser of the Co-operative Employers' Association, said the package would keep workers in the mainstream of employment benefits in the high street.</p>

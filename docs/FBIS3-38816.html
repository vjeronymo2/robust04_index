For two days the  Liberal Party has debated and argued these points, and a short  time ago they made their decision. Mimmo Sacco reports.    [Sacco] Yes, now we can truly say goodbye to the old Italian  Liberal Party [PLI]. The party has changed its image and moves  are underway to turn it into a liberal federation. The decision  was a bitter one. It was passed this evening by a show of  hands. By the end of the vote there were signs of irritation  and agitation -- easy to understand since the stakes were high.    The intervention of [PLI Secretary Raffaele] Costa was  necessary to unblock the situation: An elected body will guide  the party during this transitional period until the congress  that is scheduled to take place mid-July.    The proposal put forward by De Luca -- that of direct  elections for the secretary of the congress -- was rejected. De  Luca himself had declared his intention of running for party  secretary, and he loudly proclaimed that the party was being  done away with.    As we have already said, the whole day was punctuated by  long  procedural matters, but the decision has now been made.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in </F> Tunis, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, from the in the  "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] We have with us over the phone lines  between Cairo and Tunis Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.  Mr. President, good morning to you and welcome to the Voice of  the Arabs.    ['Arafat] Good morning.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation you  met with recently propose anything new to you regarding the  peace process, especially after Security Council Resolution 904  was issued demanding protection for the Palestinians and  disarming the Israeli settlers?    ['Arafat] The delegation came to Tunis carrying a few  proposals from the Israeli Government, especially after the  draft resolution was issued in the Security Council which was  passed unanimously, despite some reservations expressed by the  American side on the subject of Jerusalem. The delegation put  forward the issue of international presence, but as you know,  unfortunately, their initial idea was to have international  presence in the form of the International Red Cross. I do not  want to say too much, but this was completely rejected. I do  not wish to devalue the Red Cross, but the Red Cross is there  already. It has always been present in the occupied territories  and is performing its duties very well. It has submitted many  reports condemning Israel for violating human rights and the  Fourth Geneva Convention. There are files and files on this  matter in Geneva.    What we want is a force, a force to protect... [pauses] The  Security Council resolution stipulates protecting, protecting,  protecting [preceding word in English], protecting the  Palestinians. Protecting the Palestinians cannot be done by  some employees of the International Red Cross. This is why we  insist on an effective international presence. This  international presence should be deployed quickly in Hebron. We  also want a force from the Palestinian police to be deployed in  Hebron quickly. Of course, the Israeli delegation has so far  not given us an answer on this topic. We are awaiting the final  response from it. It is possible that we will get the final  response from the Israeli Government tomorrow or the day after  in Cairo on the sidelines of the donor states' meeting which  will be held in Cairo on Thursday [24 March].    Our stand is clear and frank: We demand the implementation  of what has been agreed on and stipulated at the Security  Council. Israel must take actual measures. These measures must  be clear; they should first and foremost deal with the armed  settlers and how to disarm them. I can tell you for a fact and  very precisely that Article No. 2 of Resolution 904 asks Israel,  the occupying power, to continue to take and implement measures,  among which are the seizure of weapons with the objective of  preventing illegitimate acts of violence by the Israeli settlers.    The Security Council also calls for implementing measures to  protect and safeguard the Palestinian civilians throughout the  occupied Palestinian territories. These include temporary  international presence, which will be renewed every year like  all other international forces all over the world. This is a  matter stipulated in the Declaration of Principles.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation  propose the resumption of the peace talks with you?    ['Arafat] This will depend on their final reply. Will they  adhere to the UN Security Council resolution? Will the two  co-sponsors begin implementing the UN Security Council  resolution? Will the Israelis adopt effective measures to ensure  the non-repetition of new massacres, new frictions, and new  massacres? Therefore, we are awaiting their answer on Thursday,  God willing. We hope they will bring answers to these questions.  In addition, arrests of our people are continuing. They say  they have released 900 detainees. But in the meantime they have  arrested about 1,500 people in the past three weeks.    [Abu-al-Majd] You also met with Dennis Ross, the U.S.  coordinator of the peace process. Did you ask him to see to it  that the UN Security Council 904 is turned into real action at  the basic level? Did he propose to you anything from the U.S.  Administration for the protection of the Palestinians in the  occupied territories and for the resumption of the peace talks?    ['Arafat] In these talks we discussed how to implement the  UN Security Council resolution. We received some positive  replies upon which, we can say, we can build.    [Abu-al-Majd] What are these replies?    ['Arafat] International protection, for example. We support  this international protection. It is true that its form and  size have not been fully determined between us and the Israelis.  However, they agree on international protection and on the  implementation of UN Security Council 904 and the others  measures that must be taken at the basic level.    [Abu-al-Majd] Did the U.S. coordinator propose new ideas  regarding this protection?    ['Arafat] He proposed many things. I prefer not to mention  them until full measures are formulated, which our people will  see at the basic level and which will reassure them. These  measures will ensure their security and protection. These are  basic things for us. These measures will also ensure the safety  and security of our Islamic and Christian holy shrines.    [Abu-al-Majd] If the Israeli reply is not positive in light  of these developments, how do you view the peace process in the  coming phase?    ['Arafat] We should not anticipate events. We are  optimistic. This issue is no longer a Palestinian-Israeli issue.  After the UN Security Council resolution, it has become the  responsibility of the two cosponors to implement this  resolution. We must wait and see how this implementation will  take place. We should not anticipate events.    [Abu-al-Majd] Was Resolution 904 in harmony with the wishes  of the Palestinian people at this phase?    ['Arafat] Of course not. Do you think that any state can  issue any Security Council resolution it wants? We are not a  superpower. We, plus the Arab effort, the Islamic effort, the  nonaligned effort, and our friends' efforts, were barely able to  win this resolution. Nevertheless, as you have seen, the word  Jerusalem turned the world upside down. There were attempts  that lasted for weeks to persuade us to omit the world  Jerusalem. Nobody can omit Jerusalem, neither from our  conscience nor from our decisions. Whoever wants to veto, let  him veto. Therefore, this was our position. The resolution was  delayed because of this for weeks. The resolution was issued.  The resolution in itself was not bad. I cannot say we took  everything we wanted. However, the resolution was not bad. The  most important thing in it is the world consensus. The United  Nations is now responsible for this resolution through the two  cosponsors, namely the Russian Federation and the United States.    [Abu-al-Majd] Does the Israeli and U.S. rejection of  proposals made by Russia recently, that a new international  conference for peace in the Middle East along the Madrid  conference lines take place, mean that the Russian role has  started to diminish, or that Russia is also attempting to exert  some pressure on these negotiations? What could Russia propose  in the next stage?    ['Arafat] First of all, you should not forget that Russia is  one of the cosponsors of the Madrid peace process. At that  time, it was the Soviet Union and then it became the Russian  Federation. The Security Council resolution asks the cosponsors  of the conference, the Russian Federation and the United States,  to implement the aforementioned resolutions. Therefore, their  efforts are stipulated in the resolution. Undoubtedly, we  notice good and positive activity from Russia, and we welcome  this Russian activity.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, the Israeli housing minister  says that he is confident that negotiations between the  Palestinians and Israelis will resume soon despite the  difficulties. Where did the Israeli housing minister get his  optimism, given the current obstacles?    ['Arafat] [words indistinct] This minister, along with  eight other ministers, that is, half the Israeli cabinet,  support taking quick measures against the settlers in Hebron,  for example. Therefore, I told the delegation that came to visit  me here that half their cabinet is against the activities of the  settlers. It is not possible to allow such belligerence to  continue these days in cooperation with some political parties  in Israel. The whole world sees on their television sets what  the Israeli military patrols and the armed settlers are doing.    Today in Hebron, there was a tragedy. The houses of  Palestinians are being shelled with rockets in southern Hebron  under the pretext that there are two outlaws being chased. For  the sake of two people we destroy the whole town. This prompts  us to affirm that what is happening is collusion between the  Army and the armed settlers. Hebron has not yet bandaged its  wounds. It is still bleeding. And they go ahead and start this  fierce battle in it.    [Abu-al-Majd] Do you believe that given the situation now,  there is need for a meeting between you and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to resolve all these problems?    ['Arafat] I would like to meet with him, but we do not want  a meeting like the past ones in which we did not reach any  solutions. Are we supposed to add fuel to the fire? I am ready  to meet him, but a final decision should be made to accurately  and honestly implement what was agreed on and signed in the  White House in September of last year, and recently the Security  Council resolution that was issued a couple of days ago.    [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, how do you view the Egyptian  effort now at this stage to help set the Palestinian people on  the practical road to establishing their entity?    ['Arafat] I wish to thank my brother Husni Mubarak for his  patience with us and his concerted efforts, as well as the  efforts of his brothers in the Egyptian Government, including  the Foreign Ministry efforts and those of Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa. We cannot forget them. Our people are recording these  efforts with great love and appreciation, and we cannot forget  such efforts. It is not strange for Egypt to do this. The  relationship that links Egypt with Palestine is not a  superficial relationship. No. It is a strong relationship  which goes back through the ages historically, geographically,  politically, and religiously, with Jerusalem, the third holiest  Islamic shrine, the Prophet's destination in his night journey  from Mecca, and the cradle of Christ.    Therefore, once again, I thank President Mubarak and my  brothers in Egypt for their efforts on all levels. My people  will never forget their stands. Once again, I thank you from  the bottom of my heart.    [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, Palestinian President 'Arafat, what  do you wish to tell the steadfast Palestinian people in the  occupied Arab territories over the Voice of the Arabs?    ['Arafat] If God helps you, nobody can overcome you [Koranic  verse]. I wish to tell my people, be patient and trust in God.  I know that our people are a great people who cannot be shaken  by a conspiracy, nor can their determination, patience, belief,  or jihad be affected by a massacre. In fact, massacres only  increase their determination, strength, and persistence to  continue along their path. The Palestinian people have been  established on the political and geographic map of the region.  No one can reject these Palestinian people or the crucial  factor they constitute in the Middle East peace equation.    [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we  thank you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who was with  us over the telephone lines between Cairo and Tunis. Thank you  Mr. President.    ['Arafat] Thank you.</p>

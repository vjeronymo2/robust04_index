			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TOLEDO'S CITY MANAGER AGAIN GETS JOB OFFER  </P> <P> The Pasadena Board of Directors decided Monday to again offer the city  manager's post to Philip Hawkey, the Toledo, Ohio, city manager whose selection  two weeks ago caused an outcry among some Pasadena minorities.  </P> <P> Hawkey, 43, was named in a complaint filed last year by the Ohio Civil Rights  Commission against the city of Toledo.  </P> <P> The complaint focused on the firing of housing fund director Pete Culp, who  argued that he should have been permitted to take a demotion and remain with  the city.  </P> <P> Because of the objections raised locally, the Pasadena directors decided last  week to reconsider hiring Hawkey. After examining commission documents for  three hours in closed session Monday, the board concluded that the accusations  of racism were unfounded, said Mayor William Thomson.  </P> <P> Hawkey, in a telephone interview, said he plans to accept the job effective  June 18, pending the outcome of contract negotiations.  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / What's so funny about jewish humour?: Jewish comedians have hijacked America and the world. But what shapes them? Nigel Andrews goes to the fountainhead for answers COMEDY, next to sex, is the great human imponderable. Like sex, it is international, but everyone does it differently. And, like sex, its body language would be incomprehensible to a being from outer space. 'What are all these creatures doing heaving their shoulders and making loud, staccato, whinnying noises?' the alien would say, if stumbling on a comedy audience anywhere from Ohio to Osaka. There is, however, one form of humour to which we earthlings all seem to respond and which we would surely try out on a Martian if we wanted to lighten him up or persuade him that comedy can be a common language, making merry with common grievances. It is Jewish humour. Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Neil Simon, Mort Sahl, Jack Benny, Jackie Mason, Lenny Bruce, Jerry Lewis, Billy Crystal - Jewish comedians have hijacked American humour in the second half of this century. And since American comedy, in turn, has hijacked the world via television and cinema, Jewish humour could now be the most widely exposed on earth. Glance at those names again and then give me nine French comic writers or performers you know. Or nine Germans. Or even - staying in same-language America - nine Hispanic or black or white non-ethnic comedians of world fame. But if Jewish comedy has become a concept with brand recognition across the globe - as familiar as Greek tragedy or French cooking - what shaped it? And how much do today's Jewish comics recognise a kinship or common culture? During years of sleuthing round Hollywood and New York - moonlighting from official interview schedules, when given the chance, to buttonhole experts on the topic - I have uncovered two piquant facts. One: nearly all the Jewish humorists who rose after the war served their apprenticeship in the same early-1950s' live television era, and nearly all of them in the same show - the weekly comedy revue starring Sid Caesar. Two: these writers/actors/directors speak today as if they were brought up in the same family. Chatting about rivals' styles, or psycho-analysing each other from afar, they assume not just a shared folk history but shared hang-ups, foibles and phobias. For the first great property of Jewish humour is flamboyant complaint: the 'Oi vey' tradition. It is there in Woody Allen's fervent soliloquies of sexual or psychological failure. It is there in Simon's rueful microscope placed on life's daily accidents and frustrations. It is even there, if you listen, in the fevered spoof-defeatism of Brooks' account to me of how Jewish comics first colonised east coast America. 'There are two mountain ranges in New York state' (Brooks is behind his Hollywood desk, making big pictures with his hands and voice). 'One is the Adirondacks, but they were too high, too hard to climb. The Jews, who were unfit, couldn't get up them to build their big resort hotels. So, they climbed the smaller range - the Catskills - and built their hotels there. We comics would go there and perform, year in year out, and it became known as the Borscht Belt. It's how we all got started.' And it was. For further research, check Billy Crystal's brilliant Borscht Belt mock-biopic, Mr Saturday Night. We could, however, date the start of modern American-Jewish comedy earlier: to a time of historical crisis even more testing than climbing the Catskills. The Jewish comics all had their family roots in early-century eastern Europe. Although raised on a history and set of traditions that have nothing to do with comedy - pogroms, the Holocaust, mass emigration, religious dogma - they ended up sharing in a perverse collective will to be funny. Brooks claims the instinct is in their blood. 'In the old West, when the Red Indians attacked the cowboys, that night the cowboys would tell stories to amuse each other, to ward off anxiety. The same is true of any situation where there are hostile forces on the perimeter. In eastern Europe, there were these little shtetls - villages, ghettoes - and all around there were anti-Semites: Poles, Russians, later Nazis. The Jews would make jokes to keep up their spirits, to ward off the lunatic fears that would come at night.' No surprise, then, that Jewish humour is tinged with complaint, raillery and mock despair. Or that Allen, its greatest one-man band today, has kept turning out dark dramas between the comedies. For him, comedy and tragedy are 'two faces of the same thing. When something terrible happens, the comic muse will keep it at arm's length and deflect it, whereas the tragic muse will embrace it and work it through. But they're both about survival. They're both about coping with the unbearable.' This sense of laughter in the dark was audible in Jewish humour even when Allen began as a 21-year-old gag writer - on the Sid Caesar show. Round the table with him: fellow joke-spinners Brooks, Carl Reiner, Simon and Larry Gelbart, all unknown, all with nothing in common save an ancestral history of outrunning political persecutions. (Not many years before, their families would have tuned their radios to horror news from Dachau and Auschwitz). Caesar himself, now 70 and retired in Beverly Hills, says one feature of his show's humour - put together in semi-chaotic 'jam sessions' during which the Jewish wits swapped ideas over an NBC studio table - was its blithe relish for human calamity. 'One of our popular sketches was about an old couple who have a star in their window 'cos their son's in the service. There's a knock on the door; a telegram. 'We regret to inform you your son has been killed . . .' 'The woman starts to go upstairs, then she falls down, the old man tries to pick her up, he falls down' (Caesar's voice shifts into the husky, Brooklyn-accented comic overdrive of 40 years ago). 'The dog runs out the door and starts barking, a car hits it, people rush in. 'What can we do?' 'Pick hoir up'. 'No, pick him up'. 'No, you hold him and I'll pick hoir up'. 'No, you put hoir under him' . . . So, from a terrible dramatic situation, you have farce. He adds: 'I always say crying and laughing are the same emotion. You laugh too hard, you start to cry. You cry too hard, you get hysterical and start to laugh.' Caesar, though, belongs to a generation that resists the phrase itself - 'Jewish comedy' - perhaps for its whiff of the cultural ghetto. 'We'd do parodies of Thai movies or German movies in the show. We'd do a sketch in which my wife wrecks a car. Is that Jewish? Do only Jewish women wreck cars?" Another Jewish-born comedy veteran who rejects the label is Walter Matthau. 'I think it's 'Mexican' humour] No: what is Jewish humour? It's like saying 'Oh, you Italians are all the same, or you French.' How are they all the same?' And even Allen, the man who strews his movies with funny rabbis and verbal swipes at Hitler, suddenly seems seized with embarrassment or resentment when I ask him about 'Jewish' comedy. It is different with younger comics. The actor and film maker Albert Brooks, who has pushed his pixillated-paranoid heroes into comedies like Broadcast News (anxiety-prone anchorman) and Defending Your Life (car crash victim en route to next world), is convinced that his racial heritage - and its grim lessons in survival - underscore his stories. 'There's something in the Jewish experience, where more than half the population was incinerated, that goes straight into your genes,' says Brooks. 'Humour has become a way of living through that experience and defying it. Woody Allen and Mel Brooks, who are older than me and closer to that time, make jokes explicitly about Hitler. But even for someone like me who was born far from the war, you know - you know - that if, God forbid, it happened again and you're Jewish, you'd get it. You never forget that.' For the new generation of comics, godfathered by the extrovert shamelessness of Mel Brooks (the man whose original title for Spaceballs was 'Jews In Space'), to call themselves 'Jewish comedians' is a form of racial self-authentication. They rejoice that words like schtik have entered the common language: that scarce-translatable term for a pile-it-on, laugh-at-all-costs style of verbal humour that Brooks sees as central to Jewish comedy. 'Jewish people are very brave in their humour,' he says. 'There are no taboos. Even back in the shtetls, Jews would make jokes about anything. Typical gags would be to poke fun at people who stammered or were hunchbacks. There was no such thing as bad taste. If something was in bad taste, it just meant it was funnier than something in good taste.' So, if complaint is the bass line or ostinato of Jewish humour, its high notes and fortissimos are its acts of defiance in the face of taboo. Mel Brooks himself has led by example: witness the Nazi production number, 'Springtime for Hitler,' in The Producers that scandalised happy audiences back in the 1960s. But if we know - or think we know - what Jewish humour is about, where did it get the proselytising panache that pushed it round the world? From the same source, undoubtedly, from which Jewish history has drawn its energy for 3000 years. The Diaspora is the story of a race that, ever since the pharaohs, has been going out into the world to doorstep every other race ('Let me into your home and we can rail at life together'). Once the foot is over the threshold, pleas for hospitality are mixed with busking demands for a showcase for their talents. (One of those showcases became Hollywood). To get the showcase, let alone the hospitality, that talent has to combine its own special flavour with an ability to be all things to all men. No other race or nation has had this experience or imperative. Most national comedy is insular, even siege-minded: the geo-cultural equivalent of an in-joke between friends. The British go in for jokes about class, or hug the coast of parochial political satire, or betray their puritan heritage with nervous gigglings about sex or bodily functions (the Carry On films). The Germans, reared on bierkeller knockabout, seem incapable of making an exportable stage or screen comedy. Even the French have been guffawing for the past year at a film that, while smashing all domestic box-office records, has found almost no interested buyer in any other country. This is Les Visiteurs - I saw it in Paris last month - and on its whimsical tale of two medieval warriors time-crashing a modern town are pegged jokes about Relais-style restaurants, French shopping habits, provincial gendarmeries, and other matters likely to induce stony faces in a foreign audience. The success of Jewish comedy is down to the colonising zeal of Jewish culture. Even the rising black comics of America, Jewish comedy's closest modern rival, have yet to close the gap between a self-absorbed militancy that puts their racial grievances first, and a wide-appeal populism that risks going to the other extreme, tipping them into white man's territory. Try mentally re-casting any Eddie Murphy film with a white star and see if there is any significant difference. Jewish humour travels everywhere while keeping its genetic identity. In America, its adopted land, it has done so by an inspired, almost invisible colonising zeal. Yiddish theatres - of which New York has had its own English-speaking variant; Matthau began there - recreated and perpetuated shtetl life and types. And one of those types - the badkhn, or jester, who held forth irreverently at solemn occasions from weddings to funerals - is a direct ancestor of the Borscht Belt comedian, hired to abuse the rich and spread comic dismay at big Jewish hotels. At its sharp end, this American-Yiddish tradition of puncturing pomp and enthroning iconoclastic chaos begat Bruce and Sahl: satirical gadflies with no respect for the taboo subjects of their day (sex, death, politics, religion). However, at its broader end, it has produced the universal-passport Jewish comedy we know today. That of the Mel Brookses and Allens: people who turn 'Life is terrible' into a series of banana-skin encounters between man and his historical moment (Brooks) or man and his social or sexual auto-destruct tendencies (Allen). It is the comedy of satiric retaliation versus the comedy of masochism - a poignant echo of the choice of responses that have faced the Jewish people in this century. Is it better to fight the unfightable or capitulate to the inevitable? Jews are not the only people to find laughter in adversity, but Jewish history has made their comic response that much sharper, more omnivorous - and woe betide any 'tragic' subject that thinks itself too lofty to be caught by comedy's snapping teeth. As Simon says: 'I can't think of a humorous situation that does not involve some pain. I used to ask: 'What is a funny situation?' Now I ask: 'What is a sad situation and how can I make it funny'?'</p>

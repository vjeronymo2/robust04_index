			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Greek ex-ministers face inquiry The ruling Greek Socialist party yesterday proposed a parliamentary investigation into the former conservative prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, claiming he accepted a bribe of more than Dollars 22m (Pounds 15m) from privatisation of a cement company two years ago. In addition, the former finance minister, Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, now a member of the European Commission, and the former industry minister, Mr Andreas Andrianopoulos, are accused of breach of faith, overstepping the bounds of their duty and violating the law on responsibility of ministers for their part in the sale of the AGET-Heracles cement concern to Italian cement company Calcestruzzi. The proposal, signed by 42 of the 170 Socialist deputies in the 300-member parliament, is sure to be accepted in a vote within the next two weeks. A 20-member committee with deputies from all parties will then decide whether to indict the three, sending them to trial by a special high court. AP, Athens.</p>

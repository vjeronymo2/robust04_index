			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Undercurrents" section] </F>   [Text] A bill presented by the Executive Branch to the CCD  [Democratic Constituent Congress] seriously punishing the  cultivation of poppy has just suffered its first defeat in legal  experts' circles. According to the bill, the sentences range  between 12 and 20 years of imprisonment and there is no room for  procedural benefits. In the Andean Jurists Commission's (CAJ)  opinion, this openly contradicts the so-called "Fujimori thesis"  that was included in the 1991 penal code and no longer  classifies cultivation as a drug-trafficking crime. The  Executive Branch's bill intends to radically eradicate this  fairly new crop. The CAJ claims that if peasants raise this  crop, it will be because its price is competitive and not  because of fraudulent intention. The CAJ also claims that the  punishment will not be a deterrent as long as poverty in the  area prevails. The CAJ claims that the punishment might,  rather, contribute to increasing prices and cases of corruption  and abuse by producers, and an overwhelming growth in the prison  population.</p>

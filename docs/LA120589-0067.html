			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> After calling pollsters "flat-out ridiculous" for voting Kansas No. 4 last  week, Coach Roy Williams was apparently satisfied by the latest Associated  Press college basketball poll, which has his Jayhawks in the No. 2 spot.  </P> <P> "I still say it doesn't mean a thing now, but at the end of the season it might  mean something," Williams said.  </P> <P> Syracuse received 48 of the 63 first place-votes and 1,535 points after winning  four games in its first-ever week as a regular season No. 1 choice.  </P> <P> Kansas (6-0) had 17 first-place votes and 1,443 points, 18 more than Georgetown  (3-0), which remained No. 3.  </P> <P> Missouri and Nevada Las Vegas rounded out the top five and were followed by  Duke, Illinois, Michigan, Louisiana State and Arkansas.  </P></p>

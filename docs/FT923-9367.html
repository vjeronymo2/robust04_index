			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Earnings climb 20% at Stanbic STANDARD Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic), South Africa's second-largest banking group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent rise in earnings to 245 cents a share for the first half to June 30, from 204 cents a share a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg. Net profits rose 25 per cent to R259.2m (Dollars 96m) from R209m. Stanbic expects 'real earnings growth' in the second half because a liquid money market - resulting from both South Africa's recession and its drought  -should keep margins high. The group's loans, advances and acceptances declined during the first six months even though home loans rose by R1.27bn. The bank reduced its bad debt provisions by 10 per cent to R173m from R192.7m a year earlier, while its operating expenses rose 24 per cent to R608.3m from R492.5m over the same period.</p>

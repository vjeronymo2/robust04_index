			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Post Office support for sell-off rapped The Labour party yesterday attacked Post Office chiefs who announced that they backed government plans to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce to the private sector. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that yesterday's response from the Post Office to the government's green paper had 'more to do with the best interests of the board members than it has to do with the best interests of a public service Post Office'. He added: 'As in every other privatisation, I am sure the directors of the Post Office would do very well out of a sell-off. The same can't be said for the rest of the workforce or for the consumers.' Mr Hugh Dykes, one of the Tory MPs opposed to Post Office privatisation, also criticised the management's public stand. He said: 'The suspicion is bound to linger in the public mind that senior executives are not only in favour of full privatisation for what they perceive as genuine operational objectives, but also as an opportunity to reward themselves like some water company chiefs.' Mr Michael Heron, Post Office chairman, urged ministers to decide on the future of postal services as soon as possible after the consultation period on the green paper ended on September 30 and warned that the business could 'go into decline' if it did not secure commercial freedom. Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, denied that post offices were at risk of closure with the proposed move to 51 per cent private ownership. He accused opponents of 'scaremongering'. Under the proposed option, he said, post would continue to be delivered to every address from Monday to Saturday in a uniform tariff structure. Postal counters would remain in the public sector but be free to provide a wider range of services. The Post Office also sought to deny suggestions that privatisation would lead to higher prices. It said: 'When market forces are increasing and customers have more choice than ever before, it is in Royal Mail's commercial interests to keep a tight control on prices.' The UCW communications union accused the Post Office of 'irresponsibly ignoring the overwhelming views of their workforce, many major mail users and above all the British public'. Mr Derek Hodgson, UCW deputy general secretary, said: 'Commercial freedom for an integrated Post Office in the public sector is practical, popular and achievable. Other European postal administrations operate in this way.' The Department of Trade and Industry has commissioned audio-tape and braille versions of the green paper.

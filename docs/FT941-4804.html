			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil slides as Opec hopes fade Oil prices in London and New York slipped below psychological support levels yesterday as traders saw little scope for any decisive action from this month's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In London the benchmark Brent Blend for April fell below the Dollars 13 a barrel barrier to Dollars 12.99, just 9 cents above the five-year low of Dollars 12.90 reached last month. It later recovered in late trading to about Dollars 13.05. In New York the Nymex price for April crude fell at one point in early trading below Dollars 14 a barrel. A rollover of the present Opec production quota of 24.52m barrels a day was '. . . written into the price', according to Mr Lindsay Horne, a trader at the London branch of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank. He said it was 'intuitively wrong for the market to go into an Opec meeting below Dollars 13 a barrel, but the price could spike down to around Dollars 12 ahead of the meeting'. The market perception that Opec would simply roll over its present quota into the second quarter of the year was reinforced yesterday by news agency reports suggesting that Iran was worried that any Opec production cuts would be offset by sharply rising production from independent producers, such as the UK and Norway.</p>

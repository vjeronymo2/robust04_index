			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Rocard faces defeat at hands of a local hero: A leading Socialist's travails MR PIERRE Cardo makes a positive virtue out of the fact that he has no exciting views on national issues - but he has become a kind of national issue himself. For the latest polls predict that this 43-year-old Peugeot personnel manager, carrying the joint opposition colours of the Union pour la France (UPF), will deny Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialists' former prime minister and future presidential standard-bearer, re-election to his suburban Paris seat in three weeks. Defeat would not stop him running for the Elysee in 1995, says an undaunted Mr Rocard. But it would certainly bring him down to earth after his call last month for a 'big bang' to create a new centre-left movement. Scenting welcome trouble for a future opponent, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the ex-president who wants to regain the Elysee, was in Andresy this week to boost Mr Cardo's cause. Among the 12 other candidates contesting Mr Rocard's seat are two environmental candidates, the strongest of whom is Mrs Monique Le Saux, who was once a parliamentary assistant to the former premier. If in the first round on March 21 she wins 12.5 per cent of the vote - the minimum necessary to go on to contest second round on the March 28 - and if she does not explicitly pass her support to Mr Rocard, the latter is probably sunk. Such a three-way fight would give the Socialist leader only 36 per cent against 47 per cent for Mr Cardo, an opinion poll forecast this week. At a time of popular disillusion with national politicians, Mr Cardo is banking on his image as un homme du terrain - virtually the only view he expresses on a broader issue is to repeat the opposition of Mr Jacques Calvet, the head of Peugeot, to Japanese car imports. As mayor of Chanteloup-les-Vignes, once an economic blackspot, he portrays himself as rooted in the constituency's humdrum problems of jobs, crime and pollution. Re-establishing his local credentials is much harder for Mr Rocard, as he found even when addressing Socialist loyalists a couple of miles away from Mr Giscard d'Estaing's simultaneous rally in Andresy on Wednesday night. He vaunts a government promise to scrap the plan for a highway which would have split the constituency. Mr Cardo, for his part, believes this is Socialist temporising to save Mr Rocard's electoral skin. 'After the election, the (highway) battle will continue,' the opposition candidate says. The quick-witted Socialist fields questions on some local issues well, displaying considerable knowledge about Seine barge operators whose problems have had the personal attention of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader, in recent days. But on other questions he is passed notes by aides. The peculiar French system has pluses and minuses for Mr Rocard in this race. It has allowed him to keep, even as prime minister in 1988-91, a valuable local root in the post of mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. But even though he has won successive elections to this parliamentary seat of Yvelines since 1978, he has rarely worked as a deputy for it. French ministers have to hand their National Assembly seats to their elected 'suppleants' or substitutes, who inevitably then become better known on the ground. The constituency - part industry, part dormitory for commuters to Paris's service sector, part agriculture - is not natural Socialist territory. In a sense, that is a blessing for Mr Rocard. Average unemployment is just above 6 per cent, compared with the 10.5 per cent national level. But Mr Rocard knows jobs are the national preoccupation, and at his Andresy rally he pounds away at the 'new thinking' around which he wants to group the centre-left. One element of this is work-sharing, which Mr Rocard detects as a key emerging theme of the campaign. 'Instead of having 10 per cent of the workforce permanently out of a job, why not let everyone take 10 per cent off the time of their overall working life?' he says. 'The result in national output would be the same.' But people would have to accept less pay for less work, he insists. Work-sharing cannot be legislated, but must be negotiated by sector and by company. Employers and unions could also negotiate a solution to the state pension scheme's mess, he suggests. Mr Cardo, on the other hand, counts on voters preferring his practical record of reducing unemployment in Chanteloup from 25 to 15 per cent over the past eight years.</p>

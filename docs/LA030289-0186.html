			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> W. HOLLYWOOD OFFICIAL CRITICIZES PLAN TO RECRUIT DEPUTIES  </P> <P> City Councilman Steve Schulte this week labeled as "totally inadequate" a Los  Angeles County Sheriff's Department plan to improve its image in West  Hollywood's gay community by allowing the city to help recruit new sheriff's  deputies.  </P> <P> "I think it's a 3 on a scale of 10, and it's totally inadequate to address the  problem," Schulte said of the plan, which was made public last week.  </P> <P> "The inference is if you cast the net wide enough in West Hollywood, you're  bound to catch some (gays), but if you do, the department doesn't want to know  about it," he said. "That's not gay recruitment, and gay recruitment is what we  need."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Talks  </P> <P> The plan, worked out after months of private talks between representatives of  the Sheriff's Department and city officials, calls for the city to help  coordinate the recruitment and testing of prospective deputies in West  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Although Sheriff's Department officials deny that the plan is tacitly aimed at  increasing the number of gays in its ranks, West Hollywood officials have made  no secret that their interest in the arrangement hinges on the recruitment of  gays.  </P> <P> The plan represents a compromise after West Hollywood officials first asked  that the Sheriff's Department itself openly recruit gays and lesbians in a way  similar to that in which it recruits racial and ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> In addition, Sheriff Sherman Block last week gave city officials private  assurances that harassment of any gays already in the department will not be  tolerated should they choose to make their sexual orientation known.  </P> <P> Although city officials have praised the Sheriff's Department for its  crime-fighting abilities, gays have frequently complained to the City Council  of being harassed by deputies. Gay rights activists have decried the fact that  there are no acknowledged gays among the department's more than 7,000 deputies.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department provides police protection to West Hollywood -- where  an estimated 35% of the 37,000 residents are gay -- under a contract that  expires next year. About 120 deputies are assigned there.  </P> <P> In criticizing the plan, Schulte broke ranks with other city officials,  including City Manager Paul Brotzman and Councilman John Heilman, who have been  more favorable in their appraisal of it.  </P> <P> Brotzman called the arrangement "a real positive step in the right direction,"  and Heilman said that "while it obviously is not everything we wanted, it goes  a long way toward satisfying our concerns."  </P> <P> The arrangement marks the first time the Sheriff's Department has sought help  in recruiting from any of the 37 cities that it patrols.  </P> <P> The department has long stated that it does not discriminate against any group  in hiring, and a Sheriff's Department official this week reiterated that the  arrangement is not intended to target gays.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Preferential Treatment  </P> <P> "We are not going to target or in any other way manifest preferential treatment  based on sexual orientation," said Sheriff's Cmdr. Bill Baker who supervises  several sheriff's stations, including the one in West Hollywood.  </P> <P> But officials in West Hollywood, which pays the Sheriff's Department $8.5  million a year for police services, have acknowledged that if it was not for  complaints from the gay community about the department's hiring policies, the  talks would have never occurred.  </P> <P> As part of the arrangement, the city will place recruitment ads in gay  publications, subject to the department's approval of the ads, and with the  understanding that the ads will not be placed in publications that contain  sexually explicit material, Brotzman said.  </P> <P> "Our aim is going to be to get the word out throughout West Hollywood,  including the gay and lesbian community, that the Sheriff's Department is  looking for applicants and that it welcomes any qualified person to apply," he  said.  </P> <P> "To me, the fact that the department has chosen to recruit here, and has asked  us to cooperate with them in doing so, represents a real positive step in the  right direction toward addressing the perception in the gay community that  they've not been welcomed by the Sheriff's Department in the past."  </P> <P> Brotzman said he has received several calls from gays who were pleased with the  arrangement and who indicated an interest in applying for jobs as sheriff's  deputies.  </P> <P> However, a gay activist who participated in the talks with the Sheriff's  Department joined Schulte in voicing reservations about the plan.  </P> <P> "I feel the city's efforts, laudable as they are, may be for naught unless  there is strong support for the hiring of openly gay people as sheriff's  deputies, and I don't see that happening as part of this arrangement," said  Jean Conger, co-chairwoman of a city task force that last year recommended  changes in Sheriff's Department hiring policies.  </P> <P> Conger said she was "saddened and disappointed at the semantics of the  Sheriff's Department in not addressing the hiring of gays directly, even while  I'm hopeful that the city's effort for its part will have the effect of  targeting the gay community."  </P> <P> "The real proof of what this all means will be in what happens in the next  several months," she said.  </P> <P> Community activists were upset with the disclosure recently that of 22 formal  complaints of ill treatment by sheriff's deputies filed with West Hollywood  last year all but one was ruled by the Sheriff's Department to be  unsubstantiated. City officials said that a substantial number of the  complaints involved gays.  </P> <P> The disclosure followed two recent incidents that caused friction between the  Sheriff's Department and city officials.  </P> <P> Schulte complained that the arrest of a stockbroker and another man in a park  for lewd conduct violated an "unwritten agreement," established in 1984, that  plainclothes deputies would not be used to make such arrests.  </P> <P> But Capt. Rachel Burgess, who recently was placed in charge of the West  Hollywood sheriff's station, defended the arrests, citing citizen complaints  about sex acts in the park.  </P> <P> In the other incident, a West Hollywood hairdresser accused deputies of  abandoning him rather than taking him to a hospital after he and a companion  were attacked by "gay-bashers" on the street.  </P> <P> Deputies said the men refused help, and Burgess said the deputies "acted  appropriately."  </P></p>

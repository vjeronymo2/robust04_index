			<p>BFN     [Text] A short time ago, the cabinet endorsed the  recommendations in the Shamgar Commission's report. Yitzhaq  Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, will convene an  additional, wide-ranging cabinet meeting soon to discuss  proposals for implementing the report's recommendations. On  leaving the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said:    [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet unanimously adopted all  the recommendations in the report and undertook to implement  them in full. The cabinet believes the commission performed a  serious and responsible task, and the cabinet is committed to  implementing all the commission's findings. The commitment is  not only to the commission but primarily to the cabinet itself  and to proper government.    [Announcer] We now turn to our political correspondent Udi  Segal, who heard the prime minister's first reaction to the  Shamgar report a few minutes ago:    [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin has reacted for the first time  to the Shamgar Commission's conclusions. The prime minister was  asked for his response, after his initial opposition to the  establishment of an inquiry commission. Rabin said he does not  want to delve into the past. We then asked him whether in  today's reality, a similar massacre can be avoided. This is  what Rabin had to say:    [Begin Rabin recording] If a Jewish madman decides to open  fire on one of the thousand mosques in Judaea and Samaria or if  somebody opens fire in the streets of Hebron or anywhere else,  it could happen again. Theoretically, it could happen, but I  hope it will not. To the same extent, we cannot give  100-percent assurances that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  and Islamic Jihad murderers will not continue to attack  Israelis. We must vow to wage a war to the bitter end against  the murderers of Israelis and peace and, at the same time, take  action to impose the law on those Israeli settlers on the fringe  of society who call for illegal activities and carry them out.</p>

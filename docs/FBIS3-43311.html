Well, the other big money issue in Zimbabwe at  the moment is a debate over who controls the economy. Many  black business people complain that it is still controlled by a  handful of whites and Asians. These racial overtones have been  highlighted by outspoken speeches like the one by Vice President  Joshua Nkomo recently. Now, an advert has appeared in the  Sunday newspapers paid for by a local black businessman. The  open letter is pretty hard hitting against the non-black  business community and what it alleges is institutional racism  in the financial sector, as Rachel Rawlings reports:    [Begin Rawlings recording] According to the advert, today  over 99 percent of Zimbabwe's post independence economy remains  dangerously controlled and dominated by a mere 20,000 white and  Asian minority business community. The advert goes on to say,  what is more, some of our own black brothers and sisters in  positions of trust and responsibility run the serious risk of  being used as Uncle Toms by those who would wish to use them in  defense of institutionalized racism. It is in reply to an  advert placed in THE HERALD newspaper by the Bankers and Finance  Houses Associations of Zimbabwe, which tried to counter  allegations that banks were unwilling to lend to the black or  indigenous business community. Although many banking  institutions here are headed by black Zimbabweans, the advert  claims they have been subverted to the interests of the white  community, using the example of an extended simile: When you  have some coffee and when it is truly black and too strong, what  do you do? Of course you integrate it with white milk, you make  it weak. It used to be hot, now it becomes cold, it used to be  strong, now it becomes weak. This is how our black brothers as  Uncle Toms would have been rendered tame and lame by the  traditionally all white bankers associations, whose banks and  financial institutions continue to practice institutional racism  against majority indigenous owned businesses.    The advert advocates militant measures: We can't tolerate  any  more of this misallocation of our resources when our children  remain on the dump heap of unemployment. The people shall march  on these banks and financial institutions to demonstrate against  this continual indignity, wherever there are those who would  continue to ignore the just aspiration of the 10 million blacks.  The revolution toward indigenous economic empowerment can no  longer be stopped or delayed, just as it was impossible to stop  the Zimbabwe war of liberation. The advert comes at a time when  the president has promised government will implement measures to  help indigenous businesses and the government has issued a  directive that 80 percent of shares in Stanbic Bank, Zimbabwe,  should be owned by indigenous Zimbabweans. The strong words  will raise the temperature of an already acrimonious debate in  which race is playing an increasingly bitter part. [end  recording]</p>

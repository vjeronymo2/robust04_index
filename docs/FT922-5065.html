			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: French share in railway order for Bratislava BRATISLAVA, capital of the Slovak republic, has awarded a FFr3bn (Pounds 300m) contract to a consortium of two French companies and local partners to build a driverless commuter railway for the city, William Dawkins reports from Paris. Matra, the French transport and defence electronics group, will supply its Vehicule Automatic Leger (Val) system, first installed in Lille in 1983. Val has since been sold to Paris, for a link opened last year between Orly airport and the nearest regional rail station. A Val line is in use in Jacksonville, Florida, with others being built in Toulouse, Chicago and Taipei. Work on the Bratislava line starts at the end of this year and will be handled by a Franco-Slovak group led by Campenon Bernard, the French engineering company. Some 300 Slovak contractors will perform some 40 per cent of the work, including building and power supply. The 7.5km line, the first French infrastructure project in eastern Europe, will run under the Danube to link the two halves of the city, carrying 17,000 passengers an hour each way.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: UK misguided not to see need to counter competitive dangers Sir, Ian Davidson's point ('Manifesto of despair', October 19) on competition among EC member states to cut costs leading to 'pressure to cut out all forms at economic activity which are not immediately profitable' is a pertinent one. The other member states are all acutely aware of this danger. That is why they have agreed the social protocol annexed to the Maastricht treaty in order to lay down minimum social standards that cannot be undercut by states seeking to gain competitive advantage by devaluing social standards. The UK government did accept this argument when it comes to environmental standards, consumer protection, public health requirements and a host of other areas. It is a shame that, for reasons of misguided ideological doctrine, it was unable to sign up to the social dimension, which remains equally indispensable.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 1 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Steel Pipe  Factory recently moved out of Shanghai city proper, and a new  factory with an area a dozen times larger than the old one was  set up on the outskirts.    The old premises are now used for science and technology and  real estate development.    Moving industrial enterprises out of the city proper to make  room for service trades is now well under way in Shanghai.    At present, there are nearly 1,000 industrial transformation  programs oriented toward the Shanghai suburbs, and more than 200  new industrial areas are emerging there.    As one of China's most economically advanced cities,  Shanghai's real estate has obvious graded prices. For the 400  pieces of land already allowed to be leased, the lowest price in  the suburban area is 20 U.S. dollars per sq m, while the highest  in the city proper has reached 5,000 dollars per sq m.    Since the beginning of the 1990s Shanghai has planned to  divide the city into four functional areas -- a central trade  area, commercial and trade area, suburban industrial band and  second-grade market outskirts area, forming four concentric  circles.    In the past two years nearly 100 financial and trade  buildings have been set up in the center of the city, which  provide quick and concentrated services for both domestic and  foreign customers.    While secondary industry, in urgent need of funds for  technical transformation and low-priced land for expansion,  finds its location in the suburban areas.    Besides the factories, the residents in the old districts  and  government offices located in busy trade areas have also moved  out.    It is estimated that about 300,000 people have already moved  to new homes in the inner suburbs. And the number will increase  along with the city's development.    It is noteworthy that dozens of government departments will  move out of the waterside bund area and all the 37 buildings  there will be leased to domestic and foreign financial  institutions. Some government departments like the aviation  bureau have already moved out.    This area, crowded with government departments for over 40  years, may become a financial district just like that in New  York's Manhattan.</p>

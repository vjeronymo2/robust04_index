			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 17 Apr -- The coordination of  international assistance for Russian reforms, particularly the  problem of creating a multilateral agency to guarantee foreign  investment against non-commercial risks -- this and other issues  were discussed at a closed meeting held today in the Yusupov  Palace in St. Petersburg between Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and delegations from the Group of Seven  industrially developed Western countries and international  financial organizations.    Chernomyrdin noted at the meeting that the Russian  leadership  is firmly adhering to its policy of continuing the reforms and  sees no other way forward. We have come a long way in  implementing market transformations and one can already talk  about certain successes, the Russian prime minister said. In  the first place we have brought down inflation, and steadied it  at eight or nine percent a month.    Chernomyrdin thanked the Western partners for taking part in  the meeting. Taking part in the meeting on the Russian side  were Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, Central Bank  Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, Acting Finance Minister Sergey  Dubinin and other officials.</p>

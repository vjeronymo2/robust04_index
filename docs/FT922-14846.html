			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Bofors former chief deniesbribery for Indian order THE former main owner of the parent company of Swedish arms maker AB Bofors denied yesterday that the company had paid bribes to win a Dollars 1.3bn weapons order from India in 1986, Reuter reports from Stockholm. 'Nobel Industrier (Bofors's parent company) has not paid any bribes to Indian civil servants, nor politicians nor military,' Mr Erik Penser told a news conference. Nobel and Bofors had previously denied the charges, but yesterday's comment was the first time the reclusive financier had held a news conference. The scandal, which first surfaced in 1987, made headlines again on Tuesday when Mr Madhavsinh Solanki, the Indian foreign minister, resigned over charges that he had tried to cover up investigations into bribes made during the deal. India's prime minister at the time of the scandal, the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi, denied wrongdoing but the scandal was a factor in the defeat of his Congress party in 1989 elections. Mr Penser lost control of Nobel last year after his 66 per cent stake was seized by Nordbanken as collateral for loans.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Atomic authority reduces losses The Atomic Energy Authority managed to reduce its losses in its latest financial year as it prepared for privatisation. The Harwell-based company lost Pounds 10.7m in the year ending March 31, compared to a loss of Pounds 46.9m a year earlier. However, the results included large restructuring and reorganisation costs, without which the AEA made an operating profit of Pounds 22.1m, on a level with the previous year's Pounds 22.8m. Sir Anthony Cleaver, the chairman, said: 'In the past year we exceeded all our financial targets while also making the changes to our organisation which are essential for our future growth and development.' He said that the restructuring would cost a further 400 to 500 jobs. Sir Anthony stressed that the AEA had succeeded in developing new markets to replace the business now being run down by the government. Turnover with the private sector grew 35 per cent to Pounds 63.5m and overseas by almost 40 per cent to Pounds 66.5m. Recent contracts included deals with Smithkline Beecham, the European Space Agency and the Chernobyl clean-up campaign. The AEA was recently split into two main parts. AEA Technology, containing the science and engineering business, will be privatised, probably next year. It recently appointed a chief executive, and will soon select a marketing director. AEA Government Division will remain in public hands to oversee the decommissioning of the authority's many nuclear sites. Sir Anthony said that AEA Technology would be a Pounds 250m-a-year business capable of generating profits of Pounds 10m next year, and Pounds 20m the year after that. 'There's plenty of potential there. I think we could double its turnover in five to six years,' he said. He added that the company had a long way to go but was heading in the right direction.</p>

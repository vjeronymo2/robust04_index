			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh; issued </F> in Lome on 13 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] In view of the persisting political impasse in the  country and the confusion created following statements made by  certain political leaders, Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh  wants to make the following clarifications:    1. The outgoing prime minister tendered in his resignation  and that of his government on 21 March. The head of state  accepted the resignation and asked the prime minister to  continue conducting the daily affairs of state, which he has  been doing to date, to ensure continuity.    2. Like every Togolese, the prime minister deplored and  continues to deplore the difficulties the parliamentary majority  parties are encountering in agreeing on the appointment of a new  prime minister because this state of affairs is thwarting the  establishment of the new institutions that are much desired by  all.    3. It is proper to recall here the position of the  government which refrained from interfering in the electoral  disputes, in its concern for the absolute respect for the  Electoral Law. In fact, Article 189 of the Electoral Law  stipulates the following: Should the Supreme Court notice  serious irregularities in the elections that might taint their  sincerity and affect the global results, the court can annul the  elections. The government would then fix the date for new  elections which would take place within a month, at the latest,  after the date on which the Supreme Court announces its  decision. Clearly Togolese should know that it is not the  government that annuls elections. However, the government is  bound, in all circumstances, to respect the Electoral Law by  fixing a date for the new elections.    4. Consequently, Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh wants to  inform the concerned political leaders that as soon as they find  a prime minister, he is ready at all times to hand over the  baton of office to him.    5. After all the sacrifices made with the people, Prime  Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh reaffirms his faith in democracy  in Togo. He, however, refuses to play the role of a scapegoat.    Prime Minister Koffigoh also appeals to the parliamentary  majority party leaders to reach an agreement and to announce the  outcome of their consultations in the superior interest of the  Togolese people who have suffered far too much from demagogy and  partisan squabbles.</p>

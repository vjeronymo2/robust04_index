			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Optimism on global warming targets The UK is on course to meet international targets on curbing the risk of global warming because of the switch to electricity generated from gas rather than coal, a research group says today. The recession and new fuel taxes also play a part in enabling the UK to meet its commitments, Cambridge Econometrics says. The UK has pledged to bring emissions of carbon dioxide back to 1990 levels  -160m tonnes of carbon (mtC) - in the year 2000, a cut of about 6 per cent on projected levels. But the group is more pessimistic than the government about the impact of taxes on the growth in transport. It predicts that new motoring taxes will cut emissions by only 1.7 mtC, compared with the 2.5 mtC predicted by the government. It is more optimistic on the effect of value added tax on household fuel, however. It expects that it will cut 1.5 mtC from household emissions, and a further 1.7 mtC from related electricity generation. The group suggests that a carbon-energy tax of the kind proposed by the European Commission would be more environmentally effective than UK fiscal measures. The proposed European tax would hit households less hard than the imposition of value added tax on fuel, it says. The UK has opposed the tax, saying it would make industry internationally uncompetitive. UK Energy and the Environment. Cambridge Econometrics, Covent Garden, Cambridge CB1 2HS. By subscription.</p>

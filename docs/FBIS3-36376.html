The consignment  was valued at $4 million. ETA has reported that Estonia's  defense forces are now fully equipped with modern weapons.  Admittedly, an Army spokesman refused to say just what had  arrived and in what quantities.    A year ago the Estonian Government signed a secret contract  -- secret even to parliament -- with the firm of Taas [name as  transliterated] Israel Industries Ltd for the delivery of  weapons. Information reaching the press caused a stir among  opposition factions -- deputies demanded that the deal be  discussed, and the government was forced to offer an explanation.    The legislators are complaining that the weapons that have  been bought are not the best, and that the government overpaid  almost by 100 percent in signing such a major deal arbitrarily.  Prime Minister Mart Laar has been trying to show that the  reverse is the case. His main argument is that Western  countries have been refusing to deliver weapons to Estonia owing  to the unstable situation there, but Israel agreed. And the  Taas firm has supplied the weapons on credit -- until the year  2000. By late 1995 Israel will have delivered weapons worth $50  million. But, when interest payments are taken into account,  the total cost will be $60.4 million. Under the contract  Estonia will receive "Galil" assault rifles, "Negev" machine  guns, "Mini-Uzi" pistol-type machine guns, marksmen's rifles,  grenade launchers, 81-mm mortars, 106-mm guns, antiaircraft  guns, missiles, guided projectiles, and ammunition.    The Israeli weapons will be enough for the republic to have  12,000 men under arms. "When everything covered by the contract  has arrived, Estonia will be able to resist an aggressor for as  long as it takes until the international system of assistance  starts working," Reyn Khelme [name as transliterated], chairman  of the parliamentary Defense Commission, believes.    The problem of cartridges is also being resolved. The  assault rifles and machine guns meet NATO standards, so  ammunition can also be bought in Europe. The republic is  organizing its own cartridge production.    The arrival of the Israeli ship coincided with the opening  of  the hearing in Tallinn City Court of the suit brought against  the prime minister by State Assembly member Juri Toomepuu  [surname as transliterated]. A former U.S. Army colonel, a  veteran of the Vietnam and Korean Wars, commander of a "Green  Beret" unit, and now Estonian citizen, Toomepuu believes that  the head of government's deal with Taas has greatly damaged the  republic and himself personally as a taxpayer. The  parliamentarian puts his own material damages at 1,075 krooni  (around 140,000 rubles) and his personal damages at 10 million  krooni. We do not know whether the war veteran and weapons  expert will become an Estonian millionaire. The first court  hearing ended noncommittally -- the judge asked for additional  material. Judging by everything, the dogged colonel will yet do  some damage to the nerves of the government, which undertook to  arm the republic without consulting this highly experienced  serviceman....</p>

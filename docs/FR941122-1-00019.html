			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Standard Utility Allowances_7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history of the Leland Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Congressional Record, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  S10725, August 6, 1993 and House Report 103&hyph;213, p. 924, August 4, 1993) indicates Congressional intent that the excess shelter expense deduction be simple to administer and that the standard utility allowance facilitate, rather than hinder, program simplification. We have reviewed the regulations governing shelter expenses and utility standards to determine how they might be improved. As a result, we are proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2014(e)), Congress authorized use of a standard utility allowance (standard) in computing a household's excess shelter deduction to reduce the burden on State agencies and households of having to report, verify, and calculate actual utility costs. However, subsequent legislation and numerous regulatory revisions have resulted in increasingly complicated requirements for use of the standards. State agencies have complained that current regulations are confusing and, by their very complexity, defeat the purpose of using standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rules published October 17, 1978 (43 FR 47846, 47865&hyph;66) required State agencies to establish a standard utility allowance which households could include in claiming their shelter costs. Households that incurred costs for electricity and fuel for heating, cooling, or cooking were allowed to use the State agency's single utility standard which included these costs. Alternatively, States were allowed to develop separate standards for each utility. A household incurring a cost for any of these utilities was allowed the option of claiming actual costs or the standard in the calculation of benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To give State agencies more flexibility in operating the Program, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;253, (September 8, 1982, 96 Stat. 775&hyph;6), made use of a standard utility allowance a State agency option. In doing so, the use of the standard became more complex. Use of a single standard that included heating or cooling costs was restricted to those households that incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage. However, households in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> public  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> housing who were billed only for excess usage were prohibited from using this standard. These households were required to use actual expenses. The law also required State agencies to prorate the standard among separate households who lived together and shared heating or cooling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interim regulations implementing the provisions of Pub. L. 97&hyph;253 were issued on November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551) and made final on June 21, 1983 (48 FR 28190). (Readers may refer to the preambles of these regulations for a full explanation of the changes.) The rules implemented the prohibition against use of a heating or cooling standard by households in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> public <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  housing. In addition, the rules provided that renters in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> private <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  housing could receive the heating or cooling standard only if the amount of heating or cooling usage was established through a separate meter. Households not entitled to the heating or cooling standard could claim actual costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legislation governing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEA) program also has had an effect on use of the heating or cooling standard by households receiving LIHEA and further complicated this policy. The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981, Title XXVI, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, enacted August 13, 1981, (42 U.S.C. 8621,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) required State agencies to exclude LIHEA payments from income in assistance programs, including the Food Stamp Program. Under the food stamp rules, households that received direct LIHEA payments and still incurred a heating or cooling expense in excess of the LIHEA payments were allowed use of the heating or cooling standard. However, households that received LIHEA assistance in the form of vendor payments made to the energy provider were not entitled to the heating or cooling standard. Section 273.10(d)(1)(i) provided that any expense covered by an excluded reimbursement or vendor payment was not deductible. As early as 1981, lawsuits were filed challenging the Department's position on this issue.

Supp. 545 (S.D. Ind. 1985)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99&hyph;198 (December 23, 1985) amended the Food Stamp Act to provide that households which incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses over and above their LIHEA or similar energy assistance payments were entitled to receive a standard allowance for heating or cooling costs. In the context of entitlement to a heating or cooling standard, out-of-pocket expenses are those that exceed any energy assistance payments made to or on behalf of the household. The law allowed State agencies to develop two standard allowances including heating or cooling expenses: One standard for households that did not receive indirect energy assistance payments and a second standard for households that received indirect payments and incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses. (The preamble to regulations published May 21, 1986, 51 FR 18744, 18746, contains a complete explanation of the provisions.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments to the Food Stamp Act made by the Food Security Act of 1985 were nullified by the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;425 (September 30, 1986), which included a provision affecting the treatment of LIHEA payments in calculating an excess shelter expense deduction. Section 504(e) of that law provided that LIHEA payments must be treated consistently regardless of how the payments are distributed to the household and that the full amount of the payments was to be deemed expended by the household for heating or cooling expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final rule published February 23, 1987 (52 FR 5434) amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to require State agencies to consider energy expenses covered by LIHEA payments made to the energy supplier on behalf of the household (indirect payments) as deductible shelter expenses. State agencies were required to consider all households receiving LIHEA as eligible to claim the heating or cooling standard whether or not the household had any out-of-pocket expense. The rule eliminated a State agency's option to use a separate heating or cooling standard allowance for those households which received indirect LIHEA payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

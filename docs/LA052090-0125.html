			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING OUT OF BALLPARKS;  </P> <P> LITTLE LEAGUE: WITH 672 PLAYERS, THE MOORPARK YOUTH PROGRAM IS EXCEEDING THE  CAPACITY OF ITS DIAMONDS.  </P> <P> Moorpark's fast-growing Little League has just about run out of playing room.  </P> <P> The junior baseball program, the membership of which has jumped 25% in each of  the last three seasons, had to turn away a dozen players this year due to a  shortage of diamonds -- and, says league President Joe Bravo, that's just the  start of the squeeze play.  </P> <P> "Next year, it looks like we'll either have to turn down dozens of boys and  girls who want to play ball, or we'll have to split up and play our games in  different parts of town," Bravo said Saturday.  </P> <P> "A lot of parents would hate to see that happen. The logistics can be next to  impossible for a family that has children playing in more than one location."  </P> <P> Right now, there are 672 youngsters playing Little League ball in Moorpark.  They range in age from 6- and 7-year-olds playing T-Ball, in which the batter  hits the ball off a tee, to players as old as 15 in the senior-major division.  </P> <P> The problem, according to Bravo, whose association with Moorpark Little League  goes back to 1960, when he was a 10-year-old player, is that the current total  of 52 teams cannot be expanded at the league's fields at Chaparral Middle  School and across the street on the former site of Moorpark High School.  </P> <P> "We're using those fields all day Saturday and every weekday from 5 p.m. until  dark," he said. "There's no possible way we can get any more playing time on  them."  </P> <P> Saturday, Bravo and other league officials launched "Field of Dreams," a drive  to raise $50,000, which will help move them to a larger location. Among other  things, they plan to sell sweat shirts and T-shirts bearing logos designed by  Mike Bailey, a graphic artist whose son, Jackson, 6, is a member of the  Indians, a T-Ball team.  </P> <P> Thus far, the players' parents have received mixed signals from Moorpark  officials and others in their efforts to line up a new site.  </P> <P> "We've tried to get the City Council to promise us some reserved time on the  softball diamonds in a new 69-acre park that's on the drawing boards," said  Gary Anfang, league board member and chief umpire. "Personally, I think the  council is dragging its heals."  </P> <P> Bernardo M. Perez, a councilman who became the city's mayor Wednesday, said he  backs the league's request for using part of the new park, to be called Arroyo  Vista Community Park. "I would favor letting them set up some fences during the  season, so they could get more games in," he said. The park's first phase is  expected to be completed in two to three years.  </P> <P> Perez said he sympathizes with the league leaders' hopes to be allowed to lease  part of a Southern California Edison Co. right of way adjoining the park.  Combined with the park diamonds, this would give the league the 10 diamonds its  board members believe it needs.  </P> <P> But Christina Bradley, Edison's area manager for Moorpark and Simi Valley, said  company policy wouldn't permit allowing Little League to use the right of way.  </P> <P> "There are high-voltage lines over that area carrying 220,000 volts of power,"  she said. "We wouldn't allow what we call stationary use of the area. Don't  forget -- people keep talking about the big quake."  </P> <P> Bravo, however, noted that Edison has allowed Little Leaguers in Thousand Oaks  to set up diamonds under similar power lines.  </P> <P> Bravo said one of his chief concerns is prompted by reports that Chaparral  plans to increase the number of temporary classrooms that have already reduced  the space available to the league. "We've heard they're going to add to the  blacktop. We've also heard they're going to install a new track. If they did  that, it would wipe us out completely."  </P> <P> Mike Hopkins, Moorpark Unified School District building inspector, said no such  expansion is planned at the school. In fact, he said, the district hopes to  build a new middle school elsewhere in the city, which would relieve pressure  on Chaparral.  </P></p>

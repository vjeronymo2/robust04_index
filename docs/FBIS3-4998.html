But if South Korea and the United States do detect any sign  of aggression, they "are prepared to react decisively," Gary  Luck, commander of the UN Command, said before the Senate Armed  Services Committee.    Asked about deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea,  Luck answered that preparations have been completed to make the  action possible at any time. But Seoul is unlikely to approve  the Patriots' deployment unless the United Nations first imposes  sanctions on Pyongyang.    Luck, also commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces  Command, said he had recommended the Patriots be deployed at  last year's end. But the plan was suspended due to South Korean  concerns that it might provoke North Korea.    "Even its very name, the 'Democratic Peoples Republic of  Korea,' is a great lie," said Luck in describing the Stalinist  state. "North Korea is certainly not remotely democratic nor is  it a republic by any generally held definition."    While Pyongyang continues to "make all manner of bellicose  verbal threats," there is no sign of pending attack, according  to the commander.    "And you can be sure I am looking long and hard, with some  of  the best surveillance and warning systems and most skilled  military analysts in the world."    Despite its deteriorating economy and years of poor havests,  North Korea continues to mechanize its huge ground forces,  expand its already massive artillery formations, enhance its  special operations forces and upgrade its ballistic missile  arsenal. The biggest danger of war lies in "a serious  miscalculation" by North Korean leaders.    Only the "aging dictator" Kim Il-song knows whether an  attempt will be made to reunite the peninsula under his control.    "We cannot risk a miscalculation by the North," Luck told  the  Senate committee. "Their leaders must always know in their  hearts and minds that they could never win a war on the  peninsula or even be sure that their regime would remain in  power after a war."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francois Rijkmans in Kigali] </F>   [Text] The situation has suddenly become more tense in  Kigali. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], dominated by Tutsis,  has taken up firm positions between the airport and the town  center. According to some reports, a group of RPF fighters --  perhaps a few dozen soldiers -- has infiltrated to the south of  the town and established itself at the top of a hill. To the  north, the Front took up positions about 20 km from the capital  several days ago. Add to that the battalion of 600 Front  soldiers which has been in Kigali for several months as a result  of the peace agreements.    It seems this evening that the three groups have started to  join up. We are getting contradictory reports on the way in  which the regular troops are resisting the Front's advance.    One hundred and fifty French legionnaires have started for  home, leaving 350 French troops on the ground.    All the Belgians from the interior of the country have  already left. There are about 50 Europeans still in Kigali,  including five Belgians. Canadian and Italian planes have been  announced as coming to speed up the departures. The end of the  evacuations and the departure of French and Belgian troops could  be the signal for battle in Kigali.    The Belgian Embassy in Rwanda is closed this evening. The  ambassador is at the airport. All the Belgian UN peacekeeping  troops are concentrated at the airport. They will be given the  task of taking over from the French in protecting the airport.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Claire Remi: "HOOD Object-Oriented Programming </F> Method"]    [Text] HOOD is an object-oriented programming method  designed for project managers, quality control executives, and  programmers involved in major real or time-shared projects.  Prior knowledge of the application field has proved to be  essential for learning the method.    In the footsteps of the Ada language and of major military,  aeronautics and space programs, object-oriented methods of  analysis or programming have undergone extensive development.  The HOOD method (Hierarchical Object-Oriented Design), which is  today one of the programming standards with Merise and Sadt, was  conceived in 1987 in response to an international call for  proposals from ESA (European Space Agency). The solution  proposed by a consortium composed of Cisi Ingenierie, Matra  Espace, and CRI, was the one selected. HOOD, adopted by most  European software development projects for aeronautics and  space, is now expanding throughout all sectors of industry.  CNES, CEA, GDF, CNET, Dassault Systemes are among its users, as  well as universities (Toulouse, Pisa in Italy, and so on).    After years of successive use and updates, HOOD is now full  grown with version 3.1. It has become a complete text and  graphic method for guiding design through its stages; it  specifies related documents, takes into account the dynamic  factors of applications, supports the development of distributed  systems, and allows direct and reversible linkage to the  produced code. It makes it possible to represent a system as a  hierarchy of objects. As explained by OPL, a computer consulting  firm, "this combination (hierarchical design and the notion of  object), is the very heart of the method and makes it possible  to combine the most modern techniques (object-oriented design)  with industry requirements (subcontracts, validation of  integration, and so on)." A HOOD-designed system can be  implemented in classic languages like Ada or C, in  object-oriented languages like C++, or in reactive languages  like Esterel or Electre.  <H5>  Method Calls for Rules and Modeling </H5>   The goal of HOOD training is to learn to make efficient use  of the method while avoiding its traps; to ensure linking  between design and programming; to integrate both real time  constraints at the design stage, and distributed system problems  at the design level; and to identify and learn to use the  available development environments. This training usually  includes an introductory component to object-oriented design.  Jean-Pierre Rosen (Adalog) explains that "HOOD is a complete  method requiring two features: rules, and modeling. With the  many tools available on the market, the rules of the method can  be checked. On the other hand, there is no way to automate  modeling. It is therefore important to complete the course with  examples stressing the modeling component."    The HOOD method is often presented as part of more general  training courses on object-oriented analysis and design which  include other methods (Booch, Shlaer &amp; Mellor, Coad &amp;  Yourdon,  and so on), or in courses on the object approach, as is the case  with courses offered by Cap Sesa Institute. These training  courses are designed for those in charge of real-time  development who are looking for a method suited to their needs;  they are also designed for new HOOD users who want a clear  presentation of the method before tackling their development;  and they are designed for HOOD tool users aware that a sound  basic methodology is essential, as well as for quality control  managers wanting to acquire a good grasp of the method. The  Ada/HOOD course offered by Adalog concentrates on the  relationship between method and language; it makes it possible  for quality control managers, certification agencies, and  maintenance staffs to become qualified to check and correct  applications developed in Ada using the HOOD method.  <H5>  "Correct Positioning of the Method Within the Software's </H5> Life Cycle"    According to Michel Lai, director of Methods Quality Control  and in charge of object-oriented methods at Ingenia, "the HOOD  method fits within industrial efforts aimed at incorporating  software technologies, and within measures toward quality  assurance and control. The HOOD method is intended for engineers  already experienced in the profession and in the application  field that concern them. It is a downward hierarchy method  aiming to establish relationships between modules so as to  construct a software architecture. It is a tool for expressing  computer solutions within a logical and physical model. As with  any method, in the absence of a solid understanding, it is  possible to interpret a description based on boxes and arrows,  by distorting the process. It is necessary to correctly position  the method within the life cycle of the software: the HOOD  method concerns software design and the early stage of coding;  it deals only lightly with the analytic phase and not at all  with specification aspects. This positioning helps avoid  erroneous interpretations."</p>

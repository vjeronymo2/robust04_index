			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- Polish  President Lech Walesa, in his talks with President Vaclav Havel  tonight, said he was afraid of a special formula for Russia  within the Partnership for Peace plan, Pavel Seifter from  Havel's office told journalists.    He added that Walesa said this "special formula" for Russia  could be dangerous to Europe. Havel voiced a similar  apprehension, though not so strong as Walesa, Seifter said.    Walesa said he was satisfied with today's meeting. Reacting  to Hungarian President Arpad Goncz's invitation extended to the  seven Central European presidents to come to a similar meeting  to Hungary next year, Walesa said that he "will have" to invite  the presidents to the next meeting.</p>

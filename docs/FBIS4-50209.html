			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yang Dong (2799 2639)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Since the second  quarter of the year, public security organs across China, guided  by party committees and governments at various levels, have  launched a number of special projects aimed at cracking serious  crimes, so as to maintain social order and stability in summer.    It has been learned that, in their "crackdown" movement,  public security organs in various localities have insisted on  proceeding in the light of reality and in line with local  conditions, targeting conspicuous crimes throughout the  crackdown, and focusing rectification efforts on localities  where public order is in chaos. Beijing municipal public  security organ and such departments as industry and commerce,  and taxation have coordinated actions to crack down on producing  and selling fake invoices. Public security organs in Guangdong,  Fujian, Sichuan, and Liaoning have launched a fight aimed at  cracking the stealing and robbing of motor vehicles. Shaanxi  Province's public security organs have launched a fight against  robbing ancient tombs and smuggling cultural relics. Hebei,  Zhejiang, Fujian, and Gansu have launched a fight aimed at  cracking crime rings and evil forces in rural areas.  Heilongjiang Province has focused crackdown efforts on five  cities, including Harbin and Qiqihar, where the number of  criminal cases accounts for half of the province's total.  Tianjin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou have  taken actions to rectify disorder in the areas where public  order is in chaos.    Currently, preliminary results have been scored in  localities' "crackdown" fight. A number of influential cases  have been cracked and a number of serious criminal elements are  under arrest. Public security organs in Zhejiang and Anhui,  guided and coordinated by the Ministry of Public Security,  cracked the key murder and robbery case of Qiandao Lake and  arrested three criminal elements within a short time. Since the  launching of a fight against stealing and robbing motor vehicles  in April, Guangdong province's public security organs have  cracked 2,953 cases of the kind, arrested 2,496 criminal  elements, wiped out 497 crime rings, recovered 353 stolen motor  vehicles and 1,975 motorcycles, and destroyed 137 spots where  stolen motor vehicles are disposed of. During the first month  of its "Spring Offensive" campaign aimed at rectifying public  order, Hebei Province sent 1,310 work teams of 7,611 people;  tackled problems in 3,115 villages and towns, 1,289 public  places, 668 enterprises, and 167 sections of highways or  railways, where public order is bad; cracked 4,041 criminal  cases of all kinds; arrested 2,970 criminal elements; wiped out  265 crime rings; and seized stolen money and goods worth some  6.62 million yuan.</p>

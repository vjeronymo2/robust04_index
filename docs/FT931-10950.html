			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / People: Craig moves up at Northern Telecom The ripples from last month's unexpected changes at the top of Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications company, are spreading to Europe. Yesterday Nortel named its new European president and chief executive as Ian Craig, formerly the company's chief operating officer for the region. Scots-born Craig, 50, will take up his new appointment immediately. He has been with Nortel for 26 years and has held senior positions in marketing, sales and strategic planning as well as research and development. Yesterday he was flying to North America, no doubt to be briefed about his new responsibilities which include sales and marketing throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Since the acquisition of STC, the region contributes 17 per cent of the group's revenues. The reshuffle at Nortel was initiated by the sudden resignation as chief executive late last month of Paul Stern, the outspoken and colourful figure who led the company's drive to expand business outside North America. He has been replaced by Jean Monty, formerly head of Bell Canada. Meanwhile, Craig replaces Desmond Hudson who is returning to North America to take up an as-yet unexplained special assignment.</p>

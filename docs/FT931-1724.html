			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Observer: Trading places It sounds like the oft-criticised Association of British Insurers is the latest trade body to think that its problems would be solved if only it could find a strong, crusading director-general from outside the industry to fight its corner. Stung by one public relations upset after another, the ABI has retained headhunters to look for its first director-general. Presumably Mike Jones, the ABI's 49-year-old chief executive, who has been loyally peddling the industry line for the last 27 years, will be in the running for the job. But the preference is for an outsider, someone with political savvy, such as an ex-Treasury minister. John Maples, who lost his seat in the last election and failed to get selected for the Newbury by-election, might be a possibility. Pressure for creating a new top post at the ABI has come largely from a group of big composite insurers, like the Prudential, which feels that the industry needs someone who can present its case strongly to government as well as to the public. But the headache for any would-be DG is that the ABI has 450 members and draws its support from two insurance camps, general and life, which often have contradictory interests. It is just as important that any new DG can stand up to bullying from the likes of Mick Newmarch, the Pru's rumbustious boss, as from the Office of Fair Trading. Hard to imagine who would fit the bill given the ABI's current structure.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Books: Building castles in the air A VALLEY IN ITALY by Lisa St Aubin de Teran Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 224 pages There are people, I am told, who cast themselves off cruise-ships or harm themselves with knives if they hear the name Lisa St Aubin de Teran. For these folk, Lisa St Aubin de Teran is a literary tutti-frutti whose works, including seven novels, are a confection of unsurpassed exoticism, pseudiousness and feyness. Not me. I like exoticism. And I admire her work because it reminds me of high-quality chain-mail: vulnerable, seemingly, to the mace of brute criticism yet beautifully crafted when examined close up. A Valley In Italy is the story of one of her romantic obsessions: to discover, and rehabilitate, a castle or grand villa in which she could live. She had a mental picture of her ideal property which she had carried with her since schoolhood: a house so huge that that she could move from empty room to empty room without disturbing anyone. The only constant features in her dream image were 'a pillared loggia, a stone arch, a terracotta balustrade and a line of sentinel cypresses.' So far so mimsy. The business with the Villa Orsola - its Herculean reconstruction and the money it devours - will please anyone with a liking for homes and gardens on the grand scale; or anyone who loves Italy. When she got to grips with it, she discovered it was a ruin: no electricity, no water, no windows, no doors and a serious gap in the roof. But the charm of A Valley In Italy - its subtlety and sensuousness; the skill with which the author evokes the quality of Umbrian village life - ought to win it a far wider readership than the mimsy or ex-pat sets. She is extremely good on characters, not just important ones (the workmen, her children) but the walk-ons, such as Regina, the friendly yet powerfully-bicep'd proprietor of a village bar, who emerges, on being called, from a wine cellar, muttering something to a chicken she is holding by its feet. 'When we asked for cappuccino, she looked momentarily nonplussed. After a few seconds of deliberation, she casually knocked the chicken against a petrol pump beside us, tucked it under her arm to still its shuddering death throes and made her way up some stone steps to the first floor. Ten minutes later, she re-emerged with . . . two cups of cappuccino'. The villagers all help her, even though the author had been warned that Umbrians were bandits and peasants who never salted their food, couldn't cook, suffered from goitres, lived in huts and were prey to poverty, bears and wolves. Would-be travel writers could study, with great profit, the coiled energy with which she communicates, in just a few sentences, the way that the nearby city of Gubbio impressed itself upon her. For hours, until nightfall, she ran up and down Gubbio's hundreds of steps, growing heady with the wealth of sights, pictures, churches, frescoes. Finally, she leans against the cold stone of a balustrade and finds herself memorising the floor of the Piazza della Signoria 'lying in herring-boned obeisance' at the feet of the view across the plains to the mountains beyond. There should be more people in the world like Lisa St Aubin de Teran and fewer like - oh - Douglas Hurd (imagine him without shoes on, stooping to pick lilies). More exoticism. Greater oddness. Feyness now and then. This is a quietly splendid book.</p>

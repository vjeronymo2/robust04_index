			<p>BFN     [Text] Last night, the National Congress appointed the  Constitutional Compliance Commission [Comision de Cumplimiento  Constitucional] to monitor the investigation into the plot to  assassinate President Carlos Roberto Reina and establish the  motives behind it all.    Congress President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse explained  that he understands the concern of the opposition political  parties. They are annoyed because Lucio Izaguirre, President  Reina's private secretary, charged there were opposition plans  to destabilize the government. "This democracy is costing the  Honduran people dearly, particularly the political parties,  without whom there would be no state of law," he said. "To  generalize in such a way is improper and constitutes an attack  on the country's institutional structure. This is why we are  taking these charges seriously and instructing the  Constitutional Compliance Commission to stay abreast of the  trends this investigation may uncover," he said.    He said appropriate measures will be taken if, after  examining the results of the investigation, he finds reason  enough to believe that false accusations have been made that  could violate the state of law or damage the dignity of the  political parties. He also demanded the commission file a  detailed report to the congressional plenum, explaining how well  founded these charges are in order to reach the proper decisions.    The commission members are Jorge Roberto Maradiaga, Rodolfo  Irias Navas, Jose Raul Pineda Alvarado, Oscar Armando Avila  Banegas, Gautama Fonseca, Hector Ramon Trochez, and Luis German  Lagos.</p>

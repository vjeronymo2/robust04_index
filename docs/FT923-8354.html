			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pulled down by several sell programs Wall Street AMID confusing cross-currents from overseas stock and currency markets, US share prices eased slightly yesterday under the weight of several computer sell programs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.48 at 3,331.10. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down 0.52 at 418.90, while the Amex composite finished 0.33 lower at 388.08 and the Nasdaq composite down 1.54 at 571.60. Turnover on the NYSE was 175m shares. Once again declines in foreign markets overnight set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading. The vulnerability of the dollar, which needed fresh support from world central banks yesterday, also troubled US investors, although another fall in long-term bond yields, which now stand at their lowest levels for five years, provided some help to sentiment. Against such a confusing background, computer program trades provided the market with its direction. After one buy program had helped prices in early trading, a series of sell programs sent the Dow tumbling almost 20 points in mid-morning. The light volume exaggerated the effect of these programs on the major equity indices. Among individual stocks, Philip Morris fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 80 in active trading after the broking house, Kidder Peabody, lowered its investment rating from 'buy' to a 'hold' citing the stock's recent gains. One of the most actively traded stocks was McDonnell Douglas, which jumped another Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 40 3/4 in turnover of 1.1m shares after several broking houses upgraded the stock after Monday's announcement of a restructuring of the aerospace and defence group and on the news that McDonnell's Employee Stock Ownership Plan would be buying Dollars 50m of company stock in the open market. Various retailers released a mixed bag of second quarter results which produced some contrarian responses from investors. The Limited rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 20 1/8 , in spite of flat earnings, while JC Penney, which has risen steadily all year, fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 70 1/4 after reporting a big rise in net income to Dollars 80m. Wal-Mart, the biggest retailer in the US, recovered from early weakness to end up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 57 1/2 on news of a 21.5 per cent improvement in earnings to Dollars 420m. Canada TORONTO stocks closed steady in moderate trading which was boosted by a block trade of about 5.5m Geddes Resources rights. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 lost 4.11 points, or 0.12per cent, to 3,404.67. Declines led advances by 279 to 232 and volume of 28,883,000 shares was above the previous 16,742,000 shares. Trading value rose to CDollars 302.9m from CDollars 186.7m.</p>

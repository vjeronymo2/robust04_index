			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fire immediately threatens 2 of the 11 plant taxa (See Table 1) and poses a possible threat to 8 other taxa. Because Hawaii's native plants have evolved with only infrequent, naturally occurring episodes of fire (lava flows, infrequent lightning strikes), most species are not adapted to fire and are unable to recover well after recurring human-set fires. Alien plants are often more fire-adapted than native taxa and will quickly exploit suitable habitat after a fire (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Species that grow in dry and mesic vegetation communities (including all of the 11 plant taxa except the wet forest and shrubland species,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lobelia oahuensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) may be susceptible to accidentally or maliciously set fires, especially near areas of habitation from which fires could easily spread. In the past 14 or 15 years, approximately 8 to 10 fires occurred in conservation districts under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife in the low elevation slopes of the Koolau Mountains (Earl Pawn, State Division of Forestry and Wildlife, pers. comm., 1991). Although the fires were contained within small areas, the possibility remains for such fires to spread upslope into habitat occupied by the endangered species, especially during the dry summer months. Fires have been reported from dry and mesic regions in the Koolau Mountains, threatening  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperomannia arborescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chamaesyce deppeana <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (HHP 1991a, 1991f1). A fire in the vicinity of the population spread fueled by alien and naturalized grasses and brisk updrafts typical of the area, although the extent of the fire on Nuuanu Pali is not known.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the northern Koolau Mountains are mostly State or privately owned, large parcels are leased to the U.S. Army (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . 1985). Military training exercises and ground maneuvers are occasionally conducted in those areas, especially along the summit ridges and in various locations above Kahuku. Because of the steep terrain, training areas are restricted to foot travel; tanks and other off-road vehicles are not utilized. Vehicles are only used on roads or trails (Alton Kanno, Environmental Management Office, U.S. Army Support Command, Hawaii, pers. comm., 1991), but the potential for affecting one population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperomannia arborescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that grows along a jeep trail exists (HHP 1991f10). Trampling by ground troops associated with training activities could also affect other endangered species, including populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eugenia koolauensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hesperomannia arborescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lobelia oahuensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lycopodium nutans <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Melicope lydgatei <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tetraplasandra gymnocarpa <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that occur on land leased or owned by the Army (HHP 1991e3, 1991e8, 1991f1, 1991f10, 1991f17, 1991f20, 1991f21, 1991h4, 1991i9, 1991k4, 1991k6, 1991k9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

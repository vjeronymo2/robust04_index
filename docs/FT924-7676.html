			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Expatriate's lump sum I HAVE a question about the taxation of the lump sum paid to expatriates on retirement. I remained abroad on retirement on July 31 1991. My employer, a UK company, paid my lump sum after deducting income tax - as, it seems, it was required to do by law. Does this mean that I may expect to obtain a refund of the tax? Tax deducted by UK companies when making lump sum termination or commutation payments are recoverable by the employee only to the extent that he can show, by reference to Section 188 of the Taxes Act, that the true liability is less. There are de facto advantages which are sometimes gained when such payments are made to British employees of foreign companies overseas. Although there may be a liability under the legislation, the foreign company, being beyond the reach of British jurisdiction, cannot be required either to deduct tax or to declare the fact of the payment to the Inland Revenue which will, therefore, be unaware of it. The liability cannot be enforced against the individual either if he remains overseas. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

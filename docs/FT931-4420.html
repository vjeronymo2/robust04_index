			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Outdated Army tanks for sale PART OF the Army's outdated fleet of Chieftain tanks might be refitted for sale to Pakistan, defence officials said. Pakistan is considering buying up to 300 of the 850 Chieftains produced for the Army in the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to the magazine Jane's Defence Weekly. A consortium headed by GEC-Marconi is proposing an upgrade package for the tanks. Officials said any sale would probably be handled by private companies, which would buy the tanks from the Ministry of Defence. They confirmed that Pakistan was seen as a leading potential outlet.</p>

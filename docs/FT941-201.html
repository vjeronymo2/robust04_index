			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Japan's output 'disappointing' Japan's industrial production increased 0.2 per cent in February against the previous month. The figure, released by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday, disappointed economists who had expected an increase of between 0.8 per cent and 3 per cent. Miti forecast production would increase 4.7 per cent next month but fall 3.4 per cent in April, adding it was too early to say whether industrial output had hit bottom. The yen's continuing appreciation threatened demand and the direction demand was taking remained unclear. Mr Mike Naldrett, economist at stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, said production data tended to be distorted by the end of the March financial year when companies boosted output to increase sales. 'This is the sort of thing that happens in Japan in spring. It's impossible to judge whether the economy is on the move from one month,' Mr Naldrett said. 'Production is likely to be up in the first quarter, down in the second, and we'll really have to wait until the third quarter to know what's happening.' Transport output, primarily cars, was down 13.2 per cent, depressing the overall figures. This was partly because the sales tax on cars is due to be cut in April and manufacturers were anticipating a fall in demand until then. The small increase in industrial output in February compared with a 1 per cent rise in January. Shipments rose 1.2 per cent during February, while the inventory index dropped 1 per cent. Miti said inventories remained high. Continuing problems afflicting manufacturing industry were underlined yesterday when the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan announced that capital spending by Japanese companies had been cut by a record 6.5 per cent during the 1993 financial year. It forecast expenditure would fall another 4.2 per cent during 1994. The only sector increasing capital spending would be electronics, up 4.3 per cent, it said.</p>

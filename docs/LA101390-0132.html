			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 FIREFIGHTERS INJURED IN INDUSTRIAL BLAZE;  </P> <P> FIRE: SUNBIRD ENTERPRISES, A PATIO FURNITURE COMPANY, AND HP MARINE ARE HEAVILY  DAMAGED IN COSTA MESA.  </P> <P> Firefighters battled for more than four hours Friday morning to extinguish a  stubborn two-alarm blaze at a light industrial complex that raged through two  businesses and injured two firefighters.  </P> <P> The fire, reported at 5:11 a.m., destroyed three units in the low-slung  building in the 1700 block of Monrovia Avenue, Costa Mesa Fire Department  spokeswoman Susan Wood said.  </P> <P> "They've been pouring water on it all morning," said Wood as firefighters from  an engine company sprayed thousands of gallons of water on the smoldering ruins  and caved-in roof. "They can't get it to go out."  </P> <P> The fire appeared to have started in an end unit occupied by Sunbird  Enterprises, a patio furniture company. Wood said the cause of the fire had not  been determined.  </P> <P> The fire was difficult to put out because flames were feeding on tall stacks of  polyurethane foam padding used to stuff cushions, she said.  </P> <P> The fire spread to the adjoining business, HP Marine, before it was controlled  late in the morning.  </P> <P> Even then, fire officials worried that a section of the prefabricated  building's end wall might collapse. The concrete wall, partly separated from  the rest of the building, is supported by metal braces.  </P> <P> Firefighter Fred Seguin was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach for  observation when he complained of abdominal pain after being hit with a stream  of water, Wood said.  </P> <P> Firefighter Jeff Janzen was treated at the scene for a "tweaked knee."  </P> <P> Accurate damage estimates were not immediately available, Wood said, but she  noted that the patio furniture business was completely destroyed, while HP  Marine sustained heavy damage.  </P> <P> "It's trashed," Wood said about the patio furniture business that was in the  building's two end units. "There's nothing salvageable in there."  </P></p>

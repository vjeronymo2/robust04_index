			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Efrain Goldenberg Schreiber said the signing of the agreements  on the Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization (WTO),  which will mark the closing of the GATT conference of ministers  being held in Marrakech (Morocco), coincides with the  implementation of an exhaustive modernization process in Peru.    Goldenberg, who is attending the GATT conference of  ministers, which closes today in Marrakech, one of the main  Moroccan cities, said the WTO "is the corollary to the  liberalization policy advocated by Peru." He said the Peruvian  modernization process seeks to achieve social development  through the enforcement of an economic liberalization and  stability program. Goldenberg also stressed the policies for the  promotion of private investments, the changing role of the  state, the privatization of state companies, and the elimination  of all types of subsidies in Peru.    As for tariff commitments established within the framework  of  GATT, Goldenberg emphasized the Peruvian Government's decision  to offer a 30 percent tariff ceiling, one of the most attractive  in Latin America. The prime minister said Peru has opened its  doors to the world market by simplifying its tariff system and  by reducing its tariff levels to only two rates, 15 and 25  percent, and that the first of these rates is applied to 97  percent of Peruvian imports.    Regarding the relation between trade and the environment,  Goldenberg said Peru "is very concerned about safeguarding the  environment, but we do not want protectionist measures to be  concealed behind the enforcement of environmental measures."    As for the "social clause" that several European countries  have proposed to be included in the Uruguay Round agreements,  Goldenberg reasserted that although Peru is a member of the  International Labor Organization and a signatory of the majority  of agreements that safeguard labor rights, it views with concern  trends that in allegedly defending these principles seek to  promote new forms of protectionism that will distort  international trade. He said safeguarding both the environment  and labor rights were proposed for inclusion in the final text  of the Uruguay Round agreements, which will be signed today and  will establish the WTO, after four days of negotiations of  representatives from 120 countries.</p>

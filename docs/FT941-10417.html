			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese developer files for court protection Sanwa Tatemono, a Japanese property developer, has filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law with debts totalling Y124.3bn (Dollars 1.14bn), the largest financial failure in three months. The decision by the company, which does not have a stock exchange listing, will be a serious blow to its creditor banks, including Nippon Trust Bank (NTB), Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Sakura Bank. According to Teikoku Data Bank, the private credit research agency, NTB, the company's largest investor, has over Y30bn in loans and loan guarantees. The bank expects to write off the bulk of its loans to Sanwa, which is unrelated to Sanwa Bank, and intends to avoid falling into the red by covering the losses incurred with proceeds from stock sales. However, analysts fear such sales will depress NTB's unrealised gains on its stock portfolio.</p>

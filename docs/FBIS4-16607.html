			<p>BFN     [Text] An Azerbaijani sabotage group composed of Afghan  Mojahedins was eliminated near the Karabakh regional center of  Mardakert on 17 April, the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Headquarters  told INTERFAX.    The same sources said there had been about 20 Afghan  Mojahedins killed in the hostilities. They had been identified  by their particular ethnic clothing.    The losses of the Karabakh forces, which have opted for the  self-defense tactics are less significant than that suffered by  the Azerbaijani forces, Deputy Commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Army, Murad Petrosyan, told INTERFAX.    Petrosyan said the Karabakh Army had lost several dozen men  and the Azerbaijani party had lost about 600 men.    The Karabakh Army had also eliminated or seized fifteen  items  of armored equipment, including eight tanks and five armored  carrier vehicles, two 122-millimeter heavy machine-guns and two  howitzers.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pentos warning hits share price Shares in Pentos fell sharply yesterday after Sir Kit McMahon, the new chairman, warned that the specialist retailing group would incur a 'substantial' loss before tax and exceptional items this year and pass the final divid-end. In the wake of the warning the group's shares lost almost a quarter of their value and closed down 8 1/2 p at 26p, a nine-year low. Sir Kit, who replaced Mr Terry Maher as chairman early last month shortly after the group announced its first ever loss and passed its interim dividend, blamed the expected deficit on tough trading conditions and, in particular, losses at the Athena poster shops and increased interest costs. He added that 'substantial write-downs and charges will be necessary and will be taken as exceptional losses in the current year.' In addition, he said a full review of the group's accounting and disclosure policies had been undertaken as a result of which it was proposed, for example, that property profits, relating mainly to 'reverse premia', would be separately disclosed. The group's treatment of these upfront payments by landlords has been heavily criticised by some analysts. Yesterday, Sir Kit said reverse premia 'are not expected to be material in future years.' He said recent trading had 'not matched earlier expectations for the group as a whole.' Like-for-like sales at the flagship Dillons bookshops had continued to be 4 per cent up on last year, but despite an encouraging first-half performance at the Ryman stationery stores, second half sales were down 2 per cent on a comparable basis. Price cutting and fierce competition meant the Ryman computer shops were showing a 12 per cent decline in like-for-like second half sales. In addition, Athena's retail sales continued to run below last year, although there had been some improvement in the second half with UK sales down 2 per cent on a comparable basis. Furthermore, Athena's wholesale and overseas sales had been below expectations. As a result, Sir Kit said 'significant trading losses will be incurred at Athena for the year as a whole.' The trading statement also revealed that Mr Bill McGrath, the incoming chief executive who formally takes up his new job on January 1, had already begun work on improving the performance of Pentos and had initiated a full review of the group's strategic options.</p>

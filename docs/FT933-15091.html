			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Evered Bardon moves to reduce borrowings EVERED BARDON, the international building materials group, has been forced to reduce its Pounds 300m debt mountain with a Pounds 72m rights issue and a private placement of US loan notes worth Dollars 72m. Shares in Evered Bardon closed down 5p at 48p after it announced the 1-for-2 rights issue, priced at 40p per share. The group also said it would make an exceptional write-down of Pounds 60m in the value of Civil &amp; Marine, the sea-dredged aggregates business which was bought for Pounds 110m in 1990. Talks are being held with a prospective buyer, but the group said it was clear that the price achieved would be well below the current book value of the business. Mr William McGrath, finance director, said the proceeds of the rights issue and placing would reduce the group's gearing from 90 per cent to 60 per cent. The write-down on Civil &amp; Marine, which would be shown in the group's results to June, would have risked breaching existing loan covenants. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said that in spite of reduced costs and improved efficiency in all the group's operations, debt remained too high, and this had been constraining the business. The company, which will change its name to Bardon Group, reflecting its principal trading name in the UK and US, promised to maintain a 2p dividend for 1993. It also forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 300,000 in the six months to June 30, before the exceptional provision on Civil &amp; Marine. The present group is the result of a merger in 1991 of Bardon, which was controlled by Mr Tom's family, and Evered, run by the Abdullah brothers. Both companies had run up debts through expansion in the 1980s. Mr Tom said: 'In the last two years, we have concentrated on consolidating our position as a leading aggregates group in the UK and US, with substantial strategic reserves and significant regional market shares.' Bardon's workforce has been cut by 40 per cent to 2,000 people in the past two years, and the group said it was now highly operationally geared to both price and volume improvements. The group will try to further reduce its debt through disposals or joint ventures. It has raised Pounds 67m from disposals since the end of 1991 and said a number of additional small disposals were under discussion. Mr Tom said: 'There is no doubt that trading conditions in many of our markets are now improving, with Massachusetts, in particular, enjoying excellent levels of activity. 'Elsewhere in the group, the signs are encouraging and we are confident that we can look forward to greatly improved prospects as we move into 1994 and beyond.' See Lex</p>

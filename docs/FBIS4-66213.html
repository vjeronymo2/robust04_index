			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mao Meng (3029 5492): "From Contract </F> Responsibility System to Economy of Scale--Outline of the Reform  of Agriculture Toward Economy of Scale in the Suburban Districts  of Beijing"]    [Text] The reform of agriculture toward economy of scale in  the suburban districts of Beijing is a most heartening  development and has shown most gratifying achievements. At  present, 2,887 village cooperatives are conducting economies of  scale in different forms. They comprise 73.4 percent of all  villages in the suburban districts, and they cultivate over 3  million mu of grain-growing farmland, which is 73.1 percent of  the total grain-growing farmland. Economy of scale is also  gradually becoming widespread in orchards, animal husbandry, and  fisheries. Presently, all orchards together cover an area of 1.7  million mu, ponds for fish-farming 120,000 mu, and there are  also 1,034 modernized pig farms.  <H5>  Developments Toward Economy of Scale Agricultural Operations </H5>   Economy of scale agricultural operations started in the  suburban districts of Beijing with the transformation of soil  cultivation patterns, and from there branched out into other  areas of agriculture. The said transformation of soil  cultivation patterns occurred essentially in two phases; in the  initial stage of the reform, it was the output-related system of  contract responsibility, and later the system of specialized  contracts and economy of scale.    As early as 1978, some communes and production brigades in  Changping, Daxing, and other counties in the suburbs of Beijing  tried out the output-related system of contract responsibility.  In 1982, 84.2 percent of the basic accounting units in farm  production practiced the output-related contract responsibility  system. Later, on the basis of experiences so far gained, they  adopted the all-round responsibility system, and by 1983 the  crop-growing industry working large fields was to 71.1 percent  on the all-round contract responsibility system, which figure,  by 1985, had reached 96.9 percent. The various pursuits outside  of grain farming also one after the other adopted the contract  responsibility system. Most of the vegetable growing was  contracted out to specialized teams, some also for special job  performances or to individual households. Orchards were  generally worked under contract by specialized production  brigades or teams, or by specialized individual households.  Village production brigades in the mountainous and  semi-mountainous districts that mainly engaged in fruit  production generally subcontracted such cultivation to  individual households. Because of the strength of the former  collective economy in the suburban districts of Beijing, and  because of the extent of advanced production methods and  application of science and technology, there were still, at the  time when the output-related contract system was being promoted,  15 percent of the communes and production brigades that had not  contracted out any of their land to individual households,  because of the high level of their internal specialized division  of labor. They had rather made the specialized production  projects themselves--projects that had come about in the  division of labor and division of technologies in the former  collective economy--the objects of contractual undertakings. It  means that they merely transformed the organizational pattern,  which had been "so loudly acclaimed," and then developed one  step further the degree of specialization that had formerly  existed in the rural areas.    However, because the method of land distribution applied at  that time was one based on the number of heads, each rural  household got to cultivate only 5 to 6 mu of segmented and  fragmented lots of arable land. In addition huge changes had  occurred in the meantime in the setup of rural production in  Beijing. By 1985, the proportion of the secondary and tertiary  industries in the output value of the rural economy had reached  71 percent, and the proportion of nonagricultural manpower in  the rural economy had reached 53 percent. The development of  rural industrialization demanded a rapid improvement in  agricultural productivity, as it demanded a move toward economy  of scale and more intensive cultivation. On the other hand, the  system of egalitarian, dispersed family operations gave cause to  an increasingly serious trend in agriculture of peasants seeking  other, concurrent jobs. It led to a decline in enthusiasm for  grain growing among the peasants, to a reduction in input, and  to a decline in the quality of manpower devoted to agriculture.  It has also led to stagnation and fluctuations in agricultural  developments during the two years, 1985 and 1986. However, while  existing under the same conditions, a small number of township  brigades did not conduct egalitarian land distribution to  households, but rather practiced the specialized contractual  system, and thereby could maintain a steady increase in grain  production. For instance, the Nanhanji production brigade in the  Fangshan district was able to maintain for ten years,  consecutively since 1982, the same grain yield per mu, a state  of things which was highly enlightening to leading cadres of all  ranks.    To alleviate pressure on the government created by the  agricultural crisis and by the unbearable burden of huge  subsidies to the rural cooperative organizations, the suburban  districts of Beijing started, from the second half of 1985 on,  trials with econmy of scale management of farmland. On the  foundation that had been laid by leading cadres of all ranks, as  they reviewed what had occurred at the basic levels, also due to  the realities of the situation and accurately guided by the true  state of affairs, economy of scale attained very rapid  development. Computed for grain-growing fields in the plains,  the extent of economy of scale reached 16 percent in 1986, 31.6  percent in 1987, increased to 60 percent in 1988, and was all  along steadily maintained at around 70 percent after 1989. At  the same time, equal progress was made in economy of scale in  nonstaple food production, such as in fruit-tree farming, animal  husbandry, and fishery.    Throughout the process of promoting economy of scale in the  suburban districts of Beijing, attention has always been given  to integrate the policies of the central authorities and certain  basic principles of economy of scale with the specific  conditions faced by agriculture in the suburban districts of  Beijing. It was through exploration and practice that a specific  way was found for the modernization of such agricultural  pursuits that are suited to the special conditions of Beijing.  The specific methods and the understanding gained may be  summarized as follows:    1. Upholding the standards of productive forces. At all  times, from the output-related system of contract responsibility  to the economy of scale, and in whatever specific form, at  whatever time, and by whatever method economy of scale are being  promoted, the principle of always acting in the interest of  developing the productive forces must be upheld.    2. Upholding the principle of starting out from the  realities. Basing on the differing economic conditions and  different levels of development in different regions,  agricultural economy of scale have to be pursued at different  levels and in different forms. Where conditions are mature for  the purpose, economy of scale shall be pursued, and where  conditions are not yet ripe for such, one must refrain from  their introduction. Economy of scale must be pursued to the  extent that favorable conditions will permit.    3. Arousing enthusiasm in both in the collectives as well as  in the individuals involved. Desires and choices of the masses  must be respected, but attention must also be paid to taking  full advantage of the strength of collective forces in the  Beijing region and their great capacity for unified operations.  We must not miss the opportunity for effective guidance, we must  promote the concentration of landholdings, must conduct internal  adjustments and render internal services, so that economy of  scale will become the common desire and demand of leadership as  well as masses.    4. While upholding modernization as the objective, we must  give equally serious attention to economy of scale as well as to  intensive operations.    5. Successful experiences in economy of scale must be  promptly disseminated among all rural industries, to achieve a  harmonious development in all lines of agriculture and a benign  cycle in the economy.    The practical experiences of the last ten years allow us to  say that there have already formed the beginnings of a feasible  guidance-type policy in the suburban districts of Beijing. This  is an important precondition to ensure the healthy development  of economy of scale.  <H5>  Main Forms of Economy of Scale </H5>   Beijing is located on the northwestern border of the  North-China plain. It is to 38 percent flatland and to 62  percent mountainous. According to the level of productive forces  and of socioeconomic development, one may roughly divide the  area into three districts: the suburban district, the plains,  and the mountainous district. There are, however, some  differences within each of these districts, resulting in  differences also in the forms of economy of scale that apply to  each. The following are in broad outline the main forms of  economy of scale:    1. Collective farms (also called cooperative farms).    Generally speaking, they are most developed in the suburban  district and in the plains. In these districts, the readjustment  of production, social division of labor, shifts of manpower, as  well as capital accumulation and material equipment have reached  a comparatively high level of development, which facilitated the  introduction of intensive forms of operation with the employment  of much inanimate labor. Typical and representative forms of  these types may be seen in Dudian and Nanhanji villages in the  Fangshan district, in Zhangxinzhuang village of Tongxian county,  in Gaoliying village and Tianzhuzhen township in Shunyi County,  and in Dongdian village in Daxing county. Most of these farms  had been established with support from the village cooperative  organizations. Some villages had only one, some had several  farms. Their sizes were generally between 200 and 800 mu. A  lesser number had been established by the township  organizations, mainly with the backing of production service  organizations (agricultural companies, farm machinery stations,  production brigades, etc.), renting land from various villages  for unified cultivation, at sizes from between 1,000 to 4,000  mu. The contract forms of most collective farms were of a  two-stage type, namely farms contracting from the collectives  and the staff and workers contracting from the farms, but there  were also cases where farms contracted in a one-stage procedure  from the collectives. Township and village collectives provide  the farms with part of their means of production and certain  services, while the farms guarantee to fulfill their obligations  under the contract and to turn over a certain amount of  accumulations. These farms are essentially independent  accounting units, responsible for their own profits and losses,  and operate on businesslike principles; a few of them also  operate as cooperatives on the shareholding system. Internally,  they mainly operate with labor-production contracts, and the  relationship between peasant and soil is a very stable one. The  farms generally have unified control of income and expenditure,  their distribution is centralized and is using such methods as  computing salaries on the basis of production, by stages of  effective performance, or by benefits accruing, with additional  encouragement rewards. This form is characterized by sound  organization, relatively clear and definite economic relations,  and a very sensible operational mechanism. The special  characteristic of unified management in the operation of these  farms is clearly evident.    2. Specialized Production Brigades    When contracts are signed by households or labor as units  directly with the village commune-collective and these units  submit to unified management by the collective organization  (some of these being agricultural companies), it is primarily  important that the system of management, internally, be one of  separate accounting for each household, that contracts are  labor-performance related, and that each unit bears full  responsibility for its own profits and losses. This form  occurs mainly in intermediary areas where there is stable  employment and redeployment of manpower, and where, furthermore,  there is a tendency toward gradually moving toward collective  farming. This form of operations is based on family-run  operations, where there is one administrative level between  household and village, to strengthen the servicing and  administering of the different plots of land through centralized  contracting, and it will, as a consequence, effectively  integrate family-run operations and a more specialized  administration. The special characteristic of dual-level  management is clearly evident in this form.    Another form which is close to the specialized production  brigade type are the specialized villages and specialized  townships which, within the sphere of village and township  commune areas, have management contracts contracted for by  families, and where the village and township cooperative  organizations render production and marketing services and  engage in cultivation and breeding.    3. Specialized Farming Households    They mainly occur in areas where the collective economy has  not been well developed, where the development of  nonagricultural industries had been slow, and where agricultural  production has essentially remained at the level of traditional  family-run operations. Through the application of economy of  scale a development was set in motion as from "small and  complete" to "small and specialized," promoting "socialization"  of the division of specialized labor, which had been extant as a  potential in the family-run operations. The main form is one by  which the peasant as unit contracts from the village brigade  collective, where the peasants keep separate accounts, are  responsible for their own profits and losses, and at the same  time rely on the services provided by the cooperative management  service organization to accomplish their production processes.  This form is beneficial for a more concentrated and effective  use of the soil, beneficial for the adoption of advanced  production technologies, for speedier division of specialized  labor in agriculture, and it represents a further advance beyond  the family-run operations of the period of the "all-encompassing  contracts." Compared to the formerly mentioned two forms, in  this form the function of the peasant is clearer defined, but it  is still a dual-stage type of operation.    At present, the total grain-crop acreage in the suburban  districts under economy of scale management is 2,997,000 mu,  which is 73.7 percent of the area's total grain-crop acreage of  4,066,000 mu. Out of the grain-crop acreage under economy of  scale management, 43.9 percent are under farm management, namely  1,316,000 mu, now counting over 1,400 farms; 25.8 percent are  specialized brigade-operated, managing 773,000 mu of grain-crop  fields, and having around 1,400 specialized brigades; 30.3  percent are operated by specialized households, working 908,000  mu of grain-crop fields, with somewhat over 1,000 specialized  households. Among the above-mentioned three forms of operations  there are also a few that are operated as joint entities and  cooperatively on a shareholding basis.  <H5>  Remarkable Effect of Transformation to Economy of Scale </H5>   Promotion and continued perfection of economy of scale in  agriculture has brought about a thoroughgoing transformation and  very rapid development in collective agriculture in the suburban  districts of Beijing. It has caused new vigor and vitality to  shine forth and has at the same time conducted valuable  explorations toward the further development of a socialist  agriculture with Chinese characteristics. In concrete terms, its  achievements have been mainly in the following directions:    -- It prevented a contraction of agriculture and greatly  increased grain production. Economy of scale put an end to the  fluctuations in grain production and ensured a continuing  tendency of increases. In 1987 the total grain production for  the first time exceeded the 2.25 billion kg mark with a 4.87  percent increase over the preceding year. In 1988 another  increase of 3.35 percent was achieved with a yield of 520 kg per  mu. In 1992, total grain production was 2.819 billion kg with a  yield of 657.9 kg per mu, an increase of 30.2 percent and 42.1  percent, respectively, compared with 1986. Economy of scale have  made us see the potential and has raised our hopes for further  grain production increases.    -- It has led to increased input and to improvement of the  quality of agricultural equipment and technology. During the  period from 1985 to 1988, investments in agriculture by Beijing  Municipality and by its collectives has increased by over 200  million yuan. In Shunyi alone, one of the main grain producing  counties, investments in agriculture since the start of economy  of scale have always been around 50 million yuan per year, which  amounts to a total of over 300 million yuan. Increased  investment has resulted in better agricultural equipment. In  1988, there were 700 more wheat-harvesting combines, as compared  to 1986, and they were harvesting around 60 percent of the  summer wheat crop. By 1992, the total motive power used by  agricultural machinery in the suburban districts was 65.2  kilowatt per mu of grain fields, the rate of mechanical plowing  was 72 percent, the rate of mechanical seeding was 71 percent,  and the rate of mechanical harvesting was 51 percent. In the  plains, mechanization of grain production had essentially been  realized at a fairly rapid pace. In Shunyi County, mechanization  has been introduced for the whole process from seeding to  harvesting of both wheat and corn crops. All grain fields  throughout the county are essentially irrigated by water  sprinklers, which is a water-saving way of cultivating. At the  same time, developments of a breakthrough nature have also  occurred in the dissemination of new agricultural technologies  and their application, in the reform of the cropping system, as  also in intensive farming operations, and in the more scientific  nature of operations, promoting the modernization of  agricultural production.    -- In promoting the development of production in the various  different lines, it has increased the degree of specializations  to a very large extent. During the three-year period from 1986  to 1988, when economy of scale were rapidly introduced in the  suburban districts of Beijing, 400,000 mu of fruit-bearing trees  were newly added, 80,000 mu of farmland were added at the  vegetable bases in the outlying suburbs, and there has also been  a rapid increase in the various kinds of livestock and poultry.  The villages have further distanced themselves from the  small-scale production setup which had been combined with the  taking up of other, concurrent jobs. There has been an  accelerated adjustment of the manpower structure in the rural  areas, and an additional 93,000 persons were shifted and added  to the labor force of the secondary and tertiary industries.  Division of labor within agriculture has been comparatively  stable, and there has been an evident tendency toward  specialization in production.    -- It markedly improved productivity of the agricultural  labor force with the effect of initially improving profitability  in the agricultural economy. It brought increases in peasant  incomes and increases in agricultural accumulations, while the  logistics of agricultural development were also markedly  strengthened. Follow-up investigations have shown that labor  productivity in most farms on economy of scale in the suburban  districts of Beijing, and incomes of the labor force engaged in  farming, have all along been maintained at a relatively high  level. In 1992, grain production per unit of labor and income  per unit of labor have evidently been at a higher than average  level. Income per unit of labor has more or less been equal to  staff and workers' incomes in township and town enterprises.  Investigations over several consecutive years show: In 1988, the  average net income per mu in 635 farms investigated had reached  212 yuan; in 1989, out of 759 farms investigated, 734 farms,  i.e. 96 percent, were operating profitably. In 1990,  accumulations from 317 farms investigated reached 110 yuan per  mu. In the past, during the time of the household responsibility  system, the collectives had to pay a subsidy of 50 yuan for each  mu of land each year. After the introduction of economy of  scale, it is now possible to turn over to the collectives every  year 80 yuan for every mu of land as accumulation. Throughout  the county, grain production can provide almost 50 million yuan  as accumulation every year. Add to this the more than 100,000 mu  of land producing nonstaple foods and used in other economic  diversifications, the collectives can obtain every year from  agriculture over 60 million yuan in accumulations. Economy of  scale has had the effect of initially transforming agriculture  from a subsistence-type and welfare-type of pursuit into one of  profitability. It has brought new hope for resolving the  long-standing problems troubling agriculture, namely of very low  profits in agricultural production, the widening price scissors  as between industrial and agricultural products, and the slow  pace at which the peasantry evolves toward prosperity.    At present, the agricultural organizations operating on the  economy of scale principle in the suburban districts of Beijing  are now, responding to the demand for the establishment of  modernized enterprise systems, engaged in further explorations  in their progress. They will gradually mature into operational  entities working as business enterprises and will become an  important force in the move toward socialist market economy.</p>

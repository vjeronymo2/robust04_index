			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado] </F>   [Text] We had always been wary, and we said so at the time:  It is one thing to "offer" and quite another to "comply." We  were (and still are) in agreement that an authentic pacification  can only be achieved if the international community and the  United States keep their promises to the former combatants in a  timely manner. However, the fulfillment of promises made to the  negotiating parties seems far away.    The Peace Agreements were clear: Direct measures should be  adopted to guarantee the full exercise of the demobilized  personnel's civil and political rights when they moved from the  mountains and garrisons to the country's civilian life. This  implied the commitment of the United Nations, the U.S.  Government, and the so-called "friends of the secretary general"  to help ease the reentry of soldiers and guerrillas into  civilian life by giving them the means to be productive within a  totally legal framework. The government demobilized more than  30,000 soldiers prior to the scheduled timetable. The FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] also did its part  (or so it is believed) by dismantling its "guerrilla army"  (although we have always doubted that they dismantled their  "people's army."    However, it seems that others were the ones that failed. It  is a lesson we must not forget. The "offers" of aid were very  similar to an astute ambush by the United Nations on the  negotiating parties, which forced the latter to acquiesce "to  everything." Both the United Nations and the Bush  administration wanted to get rid of the Salvadoran problem  without caring that this nation would be torn by the senseless  criminal violence that would emerge from those agreements. Both  parties (government and guerrilla) made the mistake of putting  their faith in the United Nations and the international  community, which, of course, have helped in terms of minor  issues but have not confronted any problem in depth.    Two years and a few months have elapsed since "peace" came  to  El Salvador, and poverty is increasing among the myriad  demobilized and uprooted people who cannot acquire jobs, land,  or anything else. The paranoid attitude of these people makes  one's hair stand on end and threatens to prompt new outbreaks of  subversive violence. There is an organization of former  soldiers that has already seized the National Assembly with  everybody in it, including the president of the Republic. They  have come in significant numbers to the doors of the Defense  Ministry several times to demand war reparations.    On the side of the former guerrillas, it is no secret that  there are bands of armed former guerrillas in combat formation  and which are patrolling the north of Morazan and Chalatenango  (in the north and northeast sections of the country), or that  squads of former guerrillas are stationed in the Santa Ana  volcano (to the west), the most important coffee region in  Salvadoran territory.    These are not good omens for peace. The key point, however,  must be in the hands of somebody in the U.S. State Department.  Both the government and the former General Command of the FMLN  must speak plainly to the people. They should, if there are no  hidden designs, say that the ethical responsibility belongs to  the United Nations and the U.S. Government, which, on other  issues such as legal reforms, land distribution, and police  matters, continue to project their imperialist shadow to push  legislators against the wall.    The astute international policy of the new UN Secretary  General's Office and the Clinton administration is the one of  Pontius Pilate: They are washing their hands. Both apparently  are asserting with their attitude that this problem has been  handled by other people and that neither the United Nations nor  the United States can afford to keep these commitments at this  time.    The skepticism we originally voiced when criticizing the  Peace Agreements has turned into a reality: The Salvadoran  peace process has served to quiet the rifles and has allowed  "commanders" of the former guerrilla to reach very lofty  positions in national politics; nevertheless, regrettably, the  people with the lowest incomes on both sides are the ones who  have been sacrificed.    Nobody in El Salvador has the power to change this picture.  Perhaps, when the "contras" and the "recontras" get organized --  as is already being envisioned on the horizon -- the  international community will turn its eyes again to this poor  nation. But, for now, we can only wait for the new pressures  that will surely arise -- this, by what we can see, will occur  before the end of the year -- after the new government is sworn  in on 1 June.    The Salvadoran case is unique. Suddenly the "commanders" of  the Marxist insurgents are "very chummy" with the democratic  parties. There are 21 FMLN deputies who are living like small  bourgeoisie, enjoying the sweetness of the "exploitive"  capitalism that they once vowed to destroy. In only two years  of political participation, most of the rebel "command staff"  members are now wealthy businessmen.    In terms of the demobilized people, however, the situation  is  pathetic. Thousands are literally dying of hunger, and there is  an even greater number of refugees and uprooted people who have  not found sanctuary from their woes.    After 14 years, those people who once believed in "the  revolution" are poorer than before. The war destroyed their  humble homes, which admittedly were paltry, but, at least, they  owned them. Now they are nomads and cannot feed their children.  The same is true for hundreds of people who were uprooted by  the war and remain homeless.    If this is "the peace" promoted by the United Nations and  the  U.S. Government, we do not reject the possibility that -- in  less than a decade -- El Salvador will be entangled in strife  once again.</p>

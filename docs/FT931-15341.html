			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Sapin gives warning to speculators MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, yesterday warned speculators they would be making a 'big mistake' if they thought France's monetary policy would change in the coming months. At a dinner of the Group of Seven Council, a private think-tank that brings together policymakers from the industrial countries, Mr Sapin said Franco-German co-operation in defence of the franc was unflinching and operating under the best of conditions. He said the monetary authorities of both countries had reaffirmed their support for the franc-Mark parity. 'I can assure you they will take other measures should it prove necessary,' he said.' Franco-German co-operation is very close, it will grow deeper in the coming period; you will soon once again see some tangible signs of it.' Mr Sapin said that maintaining the franc's stability did not mean the government would not support economic activity. He pointed out that France had deliberately accepted an increase in its budgetary deficit to sustain the economy and had taken several measures, such as tax relief for companies, to help activity. 'We shall keep up that policy of selective support for a given sector, but in the framework of a global strategy we set for ourselves,' he said. He underlined that the strong franc policy enjoyed wide support in France and had drawn backing from 'all the major political figures in our country'. Mr Sapin, however, acknowledged that France was facing problems. Interest rates were 'too high' and the unemployment level was of concern. He said the European monetary system was not perfect. But this was why the European Community had to move on quickly towards a single currency and economic and monetary union.</p>

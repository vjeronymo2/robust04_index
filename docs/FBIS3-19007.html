Taking part in a debate here Thursday [10 March] evening,  Fabbri said he would not want it said in years to come that  Europe had been guilty of appeasement when faced with a  situation in the former Yugoslavia that smacked of the Middle  Ages and of the Nazi Holocaust, and the minister reiterated  Italy's readiness to send soldiers into Bosnia if the United  Nations advanced such a request and if all the factions in the  field agreed. For the moment, however, no such official request  had been forthcoming, he noted.    Fabbri said that the firmer stance taken by Europe had eased  the stranglehold on Sarajevo and halted the massacres underway  there and he was confident that peace prospects had been  enhanced.    Asked about possible reprisal action against bases on  Italian  soil, the defense minister said that the allied forces were able  to moniter both naval and air space and to throw up a virtually  impenetrable shield if the need arises. There is always a risk  of terrorist attacks but security has been bolstered at all the  bases, he added.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: ASG forges link with Danzas ASG, Sweden's second largest transport company, is forming an alliance with Danzas, the Swiss conglomerate, to create a European transport group with a SKr50bn (Dollars 8.9bn) annual turnover and 20,000-strong workforce. ASG will concentrate its activities in the Nordic region and take over Danzas's business in the area while turning over its own affairs elsewhere in the world to the Basle-based company. The alliance, which will come into being next year, will co-ordinate the marketing, product development and electronic data processing operations of the companies. They will be able to utilise each other's existing warehouse facilities. Up until now ASG worked with about 15 partners in different countries involving a variety of administrative regulations. Mr Bengt Jonsson, ASG's chief executive, said: 'Our own capital base is too small to carry out large acquisitions in the European market. At the same time the profit levels in most companies are too low and purchase prices too high. Our customers have no wish that ASG on principle should own a subsidiary outside the Nordic region.' Dr Bernd Menzinger, Danzas president, said that ASG was an 'ideal partner' in the light of the experience of ten years' co-operation in France. He said that the proposed alliance would bring together two 'equal' partners in their respective markets. ASG's German subsidiary will not be affected and its activities will continue as now. But the two companies hope to co-operate as much as possible in markets outside Europe such as the United States, Japan, Thailand and Australia.</p>

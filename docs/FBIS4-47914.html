			<p>BFN     [Text] Has Leonard Nyangoma, minister of the interior and  of security, been dismissed in Burundi, or did he resign, as was  originally believed? The question remains unanswered. As we  know, Nyangoma is a hard-liner of the Front for Democracy in  Burundi [Frodebu], and the government recently distanced itself  from his remarks. Muriel Pomponne put some questions to the  Burundi prime minister, and Anatole Kanyenkiko contented himself  with answering that he has not seen his interior minister for a  long time:    [Begin recording] [Kanyenkiko] The minister ended his  mission  on 25 April, and we note that he has not yet returned. This  situation is quite awkward because we do not know the reasons  for this delay.    [Pomponne] If Mr. Nyangoma has not returned, could he be  considered to have resigned?    [Kanyenkiko] I note that he is putting himself in the  position of deserting of his post, but I hope he does not go as  far as that. It is not a question of dismissal. The  government's policy combines a return to peace and security and  collaboration with all political partners and all authorities,  and if someone sets himself against this, then he is thwarting  the government's policy and the government's policy has to be  credible.    [Pomponne] Do you consider that Mr. Nyangoma has sometimes  gone against the government line?    [Kanyenkiko] Yes, as you will have noted in his remarks.    [Pomponne] Do you consider that he is one of the instigators  behind the armed militias in the northern regions of the capital?    [Kanyenkiko] With regard to this question, we leave it up to  the judicial system to shed light on this matter. All we can  tell you is that today the disarmament operation has borne fruit  in so far as Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke have become calm once  again and normal activities have resumed.

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia may review wheat monopoly THE Australian government indicated yesterday that the Wheat Board's export monopoly may be abolished if the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) are successful. Mr Simon Crean, primary industries minister, said the board's single-desk marketing system provided the best protection for farmers from the continuing export subsidies battle between the European Community and the US. He said immediate deregulation of export sales would expose individual sellers of Australian wheat to the danger of being 'picked off' in the 'corrupted' world market. However, Mr Crean said the government would review the monopoly if the Gatt negotiations led to a liberalisation of world trade in agricultural goods. Australian officials have suggested recently that agreement may be possible soon. The government has come under pressure to deregulate the wheat market from international grain traders and US farmers' organisations, which claim the board distorts trade by manipulating export prices.</p>

They were arrested along with eight protesters who demonstrated  outside the hotel while President Bush was inside speaking at a fund-raiser.  </P> <P> Conradt and Frischmuth declined to comment but six activists who met them in  jail said at a press conference Friday that the couple merely wanted to watch  the event.  </P></p>

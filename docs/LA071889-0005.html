			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Delivery drivers and warehouse workers at Laura Scudder's distribution centers  in Northern California went on strike after negotiations over a new three-year  contract collapsed. About 220 workers set up picket lines outside 15 of the  snack-food manufacturer's facilities from Visalia to the Oregon border and from  San Francisco to Reno, said Le Roy Salido, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters  Local 588 in Hayward. "It won't be a short strike because of the issues  involved," Salido said. The 2-month-old talks derailed in Pleasanton when  management offered a contract that would have taken away union benefits, Salido  said. Management's proposal would have frozen workers' salaries and pension  benefits, instituted a split workweek, and lowered drivers' commissions on  sales by 6%, Salido said. Company officials were unavailable.  </P></p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Management: Small firms stick to their own kind Most small businesses are not as well integrated into strong local networks of contacts as many people generally assume. They are far more likely to have good connections with other businesses in their own sector of industry or commerce, regardless of geographical location, according to a survey* by Kingston Polytechnic, writes Charles Batchelor. The survey, commissioned by Midland Bank, has implications not only for the way banks sell their services to the small business community, but also for the way other providers of advice and assistance approach this market. Both enterprise agencies and the more recently established Training and Enterprise Councils have problems reaching their local business communities. Contacts between small businesses and large local companies and public sector organisations are not particularly strong, the survey notes. Many large organisations do not stress local businesses in their purchasing policies. Neither small nor large businesses participate to any great extent in their local community or economy. Large companies which join their local chamber of commerce or other local bodies often do so out of a sense of noblesse oblige rather than any serious commitment. Most small business owners do not belong to any extensive local network of connections but maintain single relations with other businesses like spokes in a wheel with some of the 'spokes' reaching well beyond the local economy, the researchers say. Businesses are more likely to be linked with their counterparts in the same sector through trade associations, trade magazines, supplier networks, trade exhibitions and other groupings, the survey says. Sector-based networks are particularly well developed in industries such as car manufacture where large manufacturers depend on a wide range of components suppliers, and in long-established sectors such as the pub trade. Other, newer industries such as electronics and computer services do not have such high levels of trade association membership, however. The weakness of the local business network mirrors a decline in community life generally over the past 20 years and the ferocity of the past two recessions which have disturbed established economic patterns, the Kingston researchers conclude. Traditional industries have declined and the emergence of new service industries has destroyed many of the local webs of economic life, they say. *Small Firms and Local Economic Networks by J.

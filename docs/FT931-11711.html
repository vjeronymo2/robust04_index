			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Accounting rules force capital shift at British Land BRITISH LAND has exchanged one form of complex capital instrument for another in response to UK Accounting Standards Board proposals which would have threatened to increase the company's borrowings. The board has told holders of convertible bonds in a subsidiary that these will be exchanged for cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares at the end of March at a cost of up to Pounds 100,000. Holders of its 8.625 per cent bonds in British Land Company (Jersey) maturing in 2011 will receive preference shares of Pounds 1 each in British Land after 60 days' notice is complete. The action follows the Accounting Board's December issue of Fred 3, the exposure draft on capital instruments, which states convertible bonds must be classified as debt on the balance sheet. Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said the British Land board had always regarded the bonds as equity as they are convertible into shares, and that the exchange would maintain this definition and keep the company's gearing and interest cover low. Fred 3, in fact, classifies preference shares under a new category of non-equity shareholders' funds. The company was careful to say it regarded the bonds as 'being in the nature of equity capital'. The shares will be issued at a price of Pounds 1,000, equivalent to the nominal value of a bond, and redeemable at the same price. The gross dividend will be 8.625 per cent of the redemption, equivalent to the gross interest on the bond - or 6.469 per cent net dividend at current tax rates. The company said that shareholders approved the creation of the shares and 'appropriate alterations' to the company's articles of association at the last annual meeting.</p>

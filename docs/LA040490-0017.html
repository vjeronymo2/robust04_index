			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REP. SAVAGE PLAN TO CUT ISRAELI AID LOSES, 418-2  </P> <P> The House Tuesday inflicted a humiliating defeat on Rep. Gus Savage (D-Ill.),  who was recently accused of making anti-Semitic remarks, when he proposed  eliminating funds for resettlement of Soviet Jews in Israel.  </P> <P> Savage suffered one of the most lopsided losses in House history as his  colleagues rejected his amendment by a vote of 418 to 2.  </P> <P> "It was not a vote of confidence in Israel, it was a vote of overwhelming  no-confidence in Gus," said Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). Frank noted that all  but one of Savage's fellow black congressmen voted against the amendment.  </P> <P> One congressman urged that the House vote against the amendment not only  because it was wrong, but because it was sponsored by Savage.  </P> <P> As the votes mounted against him, Savage sat alone, occasionally smiling. He  laughed when one of his chief defenders, Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton),  also voted against the amendment. In the end, only Rep. George W. Crockett Jr.,  a black Democrat from Detroit, voted with Savage.  </P> <P> However, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.), who also is black, said the vote  reflected only the unpopularity of the amendment, not of Savage.  </P> <P> Three other amendments to cut foreign aid also were defeated overwhelmingly,  but in each case the proponents got dozens of votes. Even Rep. James A.  Trafficant Jr. (D-Ohio), a maverick who is frequently in a tiny minority, got  72 votes for an amendment to cut the foreign aid programs by 3%.  </P> <P> Savage met sharp criticism from many Democrats after he charged in a March 17  speech that his major opponent in a primary election was backed largely by  "Jewish money" given by people living outside the congressional district.  </P> <P> Speaker Thomas S. Foley and two high-ranking black lawmakers who endorsed  Savage's reelection were among those who denounced those remarks. House  Democratic Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania and Rep. Charles B. Rangel  (D-N.Y.), who appeared at the campaign rally with Savage, said they left before  he spoke but later called the remarks bigoted and offensive.  </P> <P> Savage accused the American Israel Public Affairs Committee of pouring money  into his district to try to defeat him in what he termed an "un-American"  tactic. He said that blacks cannot be racist and charged that he was a victim  of a conspiracy by white-owned news media.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, floor managers for the emergency appropriations bill heaped scorn  on Savage and his amendment to cut funds for Soviet Jews. Rep David R. Obey  (D-Wis.), chief Democratic sponsor of the appropriations bill, urged rejection  not only because of what the amendment would do, but also because Savage was  its author.  </P> <P> In a rare rebuff, Savage's colleagues also denied a roll call vote on a second  amendment that would have knocked out $400 million in loan guarantees for  housing for Jewish refugees in Israel. Savage protested that Israel, which  receives about $3 billion in U.S. aid each year, was getting too much money at  the expense of African countries and domestic programs to help the poor.  </P> <P> "Let's put the needs of America above the wants of Israel," Savage said in his  lonely appeal.  </P> <P> A thunderous chorus of no's, however, buried that proposal. Only Savage and  Crockett rose to seek a roll call vote -- 98 short of the required 100 members.  </P> <P> "Sit down! Sit down!" both Democrats and Republicans called out.  </P> <P> Savage demanded a roll call anyway, on grounds that a quorum was not present.  But the acting Speaker, Rep. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), brusquely rejected the  request, telling Savage there were enough members present to make a quorum.  </P> <P> Frustrated, Savage immediately walked off the floor and was not available for  comment on the crushing defeat of his amendment.  </P></p>

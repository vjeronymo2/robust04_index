			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU'S EXECUTION  </P> <P> The execution of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu illustrates the virtual  impossibility of due process being dispensed by a revolutionary tribunal. Had  the National Salvation Front conducted an open trial, one that required the  prosecution to prove its allegations, while allowing Ceausescu the right of a  legal defense, the verdict would have been the same, and so would his  well-deserved sentence.  </P> <P> Regardless of whether a kangaroo court or a constitutional court had passed  sentence on Ceausescu, he still would have taken his rightful place in history  along side the likes of Quisling, Laval, Stalin and Idi Amin. The problem with  Ceausescu's summary execution is, that like the French Revolution 200 years  ago, revolutionary justice provides the opportunity for a modern-day  Robespierre to emerge from the existing vacuum and begin another reign of  terror.  </P> <P> To this end, it is critical that Romanian nationwide elections be held within  the shortest possible time, and that the trials of Ceausescu's police state  traitors be postponed until a duly elected government is in place.  </P> <P> MICHAEL A. SCOTT  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

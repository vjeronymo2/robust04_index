			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Romania tiptoes along reform path: Privatisation has got off to a slow start ROMANIA'S official privatisation programme has only just completed its pilot phase two years after enactment of the privatisation law. State companies which dominate the economy and which have accumulated an inter-enterprise debt of about 1,900bn Lei (Dollars 2.3bn), equivalent to about 20 per cent of GDP, remain untouched. The fact that many large state enterprises are resisting reform has raised suspicions they are doing so with the sympathy, if not the support, of senior members of the government. The lack of political will to implement the privatisation programme and reform the state sector is a reason the government has been unable to sign a 1993 stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund. A successful outcome to the talks would have unlocked Dollars 3bn in aid pledged by G24 countries. Formal barriers to speedier structural reform and privatisation, such as the lack of a bankruptcy law and capital markets, still exist. But Romanian officials involved in the reform process cite a variety of informal barriers. Until recently, for example, the five directors of the State Ownership Fund (Sof), the body charged with valuing, restructuring and selling 6,200 companies by the year 2000, had to make do with sharing a single room. The Sof still has a staff of less than 100 operating out of a dingy Bucharest office building, having been rebuffed in its attempts to find more suitable accommodation in ministry premises. The delays to the official privatisation programme have not, however, prevented state property from finding its way into private hands. Directors and officials of state enterprises are barred from buying assets of state companies which can be sold at official auctions. But 'spontaneous' privatisations, whereby state assets are sold cheaply to private companies in which officials or their relations have an interest, is common, according to reformers. Mr Paul Miercan, general manager of the Sof, conceded that it was 'very difficult' to stop the 'moral degradation' taking place during Romania's patchy transition to a market economy. The scale of the problem is impossible to quantify, but he acknowledged that out of 72 companies sold by the Fund by mid-July, there were 'upwards of 20 cases' where irregularities were confirmed. Mr Aurelian Dochia, president of the National Agency for Privatisation, says the phenomenon of 'spontaneous' privatisation is 'one of the most important arguments' in favour of moving as quickly as possible in selling off the state companies. 'The substance of the state sector is being sucked into the private sector,' he says, 'with the possibility that only empty shells will remain.' Romania's fledgling class of private entrepreneurs complain that government policies encourage the inefficiency of the state sector at the expense of the country's overall economic health. Private companies say they cannot raise capital for new projects but that state banks, which handle 90 per cent of loans, are still lending to heavily indebted firms. With little pressure on state company managers to be profitable, they have not felt compelled to contract out work to new private businesses or to lease surplus production facilities or property. But statistical and anecdotal evidence suggests all is not gloomy for private businesses. Mr Mike Hicks, the Bucharest representative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, believes the momentum towards a market economy is unstoppable. 'Two years ago we were desperate to get involved with private sector projects, now we can't keep up with those being put forward.' Official figures to the end of June recorded 266,061 companies with private capital and 207,846 private entrepreneurs, a common structure for farmers who have benefited from the return of collectivised land. The private sector accounted for 40 per cent of retail sales in the first half of the year compared with 7.1 per cent in the same period in 1991. It also accounted for 44 per cent of services compared with 6.5 per cent in 1991. While statistics indicate that GDP in 1992 was less than Dollars 600 per head, officials acknowledge that there is a large black economy. The central bank believes the black market is driven by some Dollars 1bn in hard currency cash equivalent to 25-30 per cent of GDP. 'There is public discontent that some people are getting rich unfairly through corruption and deceit,' says Dr Petre Datculescu of Irsop, a Bucharest polling organisation. Yet Irsop surveys also show consistent public support for privatisation, and an acceptance of the social inequality which comes with a market economy, though about 25 per cent oppose market reforms. Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister in charge of reform, believes some opposition comes from a lack of transparency and valuation problems in the privatisation process. 'Once we open mass privatisation and establish a transparent procedure, maybe the attitude of the population will change,' he says.</p>

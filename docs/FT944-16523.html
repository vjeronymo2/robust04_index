			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Pounds 100m boost planned for retail centre Chelsfield, the property company led by Mr Elliott Bernerd, yesterday sought planning permission from Dudley Borough Council in the West Midlands to undertake a Pounds 100m expansion of the Merry Hill shopping centre. The 650,000 sq ft expansion at what is already one of the four largest shopping centres in Britain would be the biggest retail development in the UK since the property industry moved into recession during 1990. Its announcement follows declarations by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, that new shopping centres outside towns are unacceptable. He has reiterated the government's policy of sustaining the vitality of existing town centres. Merry Hill, on the west side of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation, was developed during the 1980s with the help of tax concessions. It is on land to which the government gave enterprise zone status after the closure of a steelworks. Chelsfield, the leading member of a consortium which bought Merry Hill from the receivers of Mountleigh, a failed property company, last year, is consolidating its control of the shopping centre. It is paying Pounds 27m to lift its stake in the consortium, MH Holdings, to 90 per cent from 50 per cent, and expects to buy the other 10 per cent next January. The seller is a group of private Saudi Arabian investors. Disclosure of the plans to expand the centre, which has 1.4m sq ft of shops, excluding retail warehouses, follows discussions between Chelsfield and the local authority, and reflects the assumption that planning permission will be granted. The council, which opposed the original development, fearing the loss of trade at the traditional centres of Dudley and Stourbridge, is supporting the expansion. The local authority's attitude to the development has changed for three reasons: The expansion, based on a new department store and extensive catering facilities, could provide 2,000 jobs. Chelsfield is establishing training facilities so that local residents can take up the jobs. The company has agreed to spend Pounds 8.25m on investment projects in the borough. This includes Pounds 1.5m on road improvements - access to Merry Hill through highly populated districts is difficult. Chelsfield yesterday sought to head off any objections by adopting Mr Gummer's line on opposition to out-of-town shopping centres. It argued that, with its adjacent hotel and office developments, the development is akin to a traditional town centre. It noted that Merry Hill is not on the edge of, but inside the conurbation and that 15 per cent of its 25m customers a year arrive on foot or on public transport. Further, Chelsfield said, expansion is directed more at persuading existing customers to stay longer than to attracting new visitors.</p>

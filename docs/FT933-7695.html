			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / France continues cautious rate cuts THE Bank of France yesterday continued its cautious repair of the damage caused by the European currency crisis by lowering overnight interest rates for the fourth time in 10 days. The rate was trimmed by half a point to 8.25 per cent. However, the bank left its key intervention rate at 6.75 per cent and also held the 5-10 day lending facility at 10 per cent. Economists suspect that the French are awaiting the outcome of next Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council. Although the franc has stabilised this week, the central bank's own financial position still shows the strain of the crisis. The bank yesterday disclosed only a slight reduction in the deficit on its foreign currency reserves, to FFr175bn in the week to August 12 from FFr188bn in the previous week. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, yesterday warned of the 'grave disruptions' which can occur on financial markets if high expectations of interest rate cuts are not fulfilled. In remarks reported by a German news agency, he said that the currency market upheaval of recent weeks 'should make it clear to everyone' what happens when markets are fed with unrealistic expectations. His comments appear targeted at the many German banks which are expecting a cut in the discount rate after next Thursday's Bundesbank meeting.</p>

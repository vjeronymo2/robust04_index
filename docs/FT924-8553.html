			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (2): Down in the dumps - UK landfillers face a tougher regime THE UK waste management industry will pass a watershed next March when disposal operators must decide whether to continue running their landfill sites. Those who prefer to surrender their licences will be able to avoid liability for any environmental problems that subsequently surface; those who don't, will be held responsible for a site until the end of its life or until it is sold. The new rules, which flow from the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, should weed out the cowboy operators. Not only will this begin to clean up the image of an industry that has long been tarnished by disreputable operators  -in theory, it should also reduce capacity, giving a shot in the arm to a sector that has fallen dramatically in investors' esteem. For quoted companies this respite from the effects of recession comes not a moment too soon. Having gone into the economic downturn with observers saying they would be recession proof (since there would always be a need to dispose of rubbish) many waste companies have reached this point in the cycle suffering from a severe mauling. Not only has the recession reduced the amount of industrial and household refuse, but many companies have chosen to store rather than dispose of the more expensive low volume, high value wastes, in order to conserve cash. And, perhaps as a result, the downturn in volumes has exposed over-ambitious and weak managements which moved too quickly in the late 1980s to acquire assets. In particular, the waste sector underestimated the depths to which the construction industry could sink in the UK, depriving companies of their bread and butter business. The malaise in the sector was typified by the profits warning from Leigh Interests in September. The shares which had been standing at 226p, have since fallen to 140p in spite of a claim by the chairman that second half profits would be substantially ahead of the first half. Likewise Caird Group, one of the more acquisitive groups in the late 1980s, suffered from a sharp increase in interest in its first half and has found trading conditions tougher since the interims. What is more, there has been an almost complete freeze in corporate activity in the UK. Tarmac, for example, has had no joy finding a buyer for its Econowaste subsidiary at Pounds 85m-Pounds 90m. It has already passed a target date when it wanted to have sold the subsidiary and may have to accept a much lower price. The industry is anxiously awaiting the sale as a signal about latest valuations of landfill. The one exception is Waste Management International, the UK quoted arm of Waste Management of the US, which has been quietly buying companies in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia. Like many City fads, however, the hype surrounding waste management companies was overdone when the sector was in favour. By the same token, the gloom now hanging over the sector may appear more impenetrable than it really is. Grounds for optimism include: the environmental legislation: over the next five years laws in Europe will inexorably tighten. They are already tightening in the UK as a result of the 1990 EPA; France has enacted a new comprehensive waste law which is likely to lead to the closure of 6,500 landfills; Italy is likely to put its first comprehensive waste law before parliament next year and will receive valuable support with the return to Rome of Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the former environment commissioner; Germany's rules are already in place. the new legislation from the Environmental Protection Agency is starting to bite, even though the UK EPA's birth was delayed. It has already increased the cost of disposal, particularly of the most toxic industrial wastes, and is reducing competition. Again, while some confusion exists over the requirements of European Community regulations and those arising from national and even local government regulators, the trend is clearly in the direction of favouring the supplier of high class services. the UK government's urgent wish for control of waste to pass into the hands of the private sector. While many local authorities may be better placed than outsiders to tender for business, there is nevertheless a strong move towards more basic waste management passing into private hands. the duty of care for waste which has already started to play into the hands of reputable operators. Companies producing waste are now responsible for ensuring that a licensed carrier handles his waste and that it ends up in a licensed landfill site. some of the enthusiasm for waste companies sprang from the expectation of higher landfill prices. Undoubtedly they will rise - the cost of disposal in the UK is a sixth of the cost in Germany. The question is when. Some observers say the UK disposal is cheaper than in continental Europe because we still allow co-disposal of liquids and solid waste, the so-called practice of dilute and disperse. A more accurate assessment would, however, suggest the UK is cheaper because it still has a large amount of licensed landfill. There are, however, some equally strong reasons for short-term pessimism about the future of the waste sector: some fund managers would not touch waste companies, even the most reputable, because of a fear of environmental liability; the cost of making new landfill is rising sharply. The application process is becoming longer and since lastApril new sites have had to ensure that proper precautions are taken to control liquid leaching and gas emission. This inevitably puts new operators - or operators of new sites - at a disadvantage compared with operators of older sites who do not need to recover the same investment costs. Some observers of the waste industry believe it could be five years before operators of old and new sites are competing on a level playing field. While the waste sector seems to be bound to resume growth, investors will need a long term view.</p>

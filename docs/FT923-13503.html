			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fund managers switch to bonds FUND managers are looking to increase their holdings in bonds, especially UK gilts, at the expense of equities, according to the July monthly survey by Smith New Court and Gallup. Managers planning to invest in UK gilts outnumbered those planning no such move by 32 per cent, the highest level for two years and double the June total. Interest in index-linked gilts, overseas bonds and deposits increased at a similar rate, the survey said. A balance of 10 per cent of managers said they would lift exposure to UK equities. This is the lowest figure this year, but the UK is still seen as more attractive than the US and Japan, where managers remain negative. However, forecasts for UK earnings-per-share growth have been marked down. Managers expect earnings to grow 6 per cent this year, compared with 9 per cent forecast last month. For 1993, forecasts have been cut from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. Dividends are expected to grow 3 per cent this year and 5 per cent next. Over the next 12 months, 86 per cent of institutions are optimistic about the FT-SE index compared with 72 per cent for continental European markets. Only 56 per cent are hopeful about Japan. A special question in the survey asked managers their favourite and least favourite sectors for the coming year. Health and household, water, industrial materials and banks were most favoured while contracting and construction, property and building materials found least support.</p>

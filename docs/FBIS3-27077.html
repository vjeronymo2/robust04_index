Although encouraged by the pace of the Serbs' latest pullout  of heavy artillery from Sarajevo, Pentagon Spokeswoman Kathleen  Delasky said the Serbs still had "a long way to go" to avoid the  threatened NATO air strikes.    Delasky confirmed that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry  and Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff John Shalikashvili would  join defense ministers of Britain, France, Italy and the  Netherlands for a NATO briefing on air strikes in Italy on  Sunday.    "The meeting also provides an opportunity to discuss steps  to  reinvigorate the peace plan," Delasky said.    Earlier today, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said the  Serbs had agreed to withdraw heavy weapons from Sarajevo  following a proposal that Russian troops would help enforce a  ceasefire in the city.    "We do think that war in Sarajevo is finally over," Karadzic  said.    At the White House, Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers gave a  measured  response to the development.    "If this means that the Serbs will comply with NATO's  decision then it is a positive step," Myers said. "We'll just  have to wait and see."</p>

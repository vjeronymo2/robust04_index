			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Solid increase in small business start-ups The continuing economic recovery is underlined by a solid rise in the rate of small-business formation in the first half of the year, according to Barclays Bank. About 226,900 new businesses were formed over the period, up 10 per cent on the first half of last year. For the first time since 1990 the level of start-ups rose in all regions. The rate of generation of new businesses suggests that the recovery may avoid the breakneck pace of new-company generation in the late 1980s. That proved unsustainable and was followed by sharp increases in the failure rate. The recovery in manufacturing start-ups was particularly strong, boosted by strong export demand and the strength of the domestic recovery, Barclays said. The retail sector accounted for a smaller share of start-ups than in the first half of last year. Small-business closures in the second quarter fell to 109,000, nearly 16 per cent below the rate of the same period last year. The north-west is leading the recovery in the small-business sector. More than 33,000 new businesses were formed in the first six months, a rise of 20 per cent. In Wales there was a 13 per cent increase. The south-east, with an 8 per cent increase in new business formation, formed the most businesses but its rate of increase was below the national average. The south-west, where the economy has been among the hardest hit, is showing signs of recovery for the first time since 1990. But its rate of formation was just 6 per cent.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Investigators defend raid on Volkswagen offices: State prosecutors shrug off charges of leak to media INVESTIGATORS who raided Volkswagen, the German carmaker, on Thursday in search of allegedly stolen data, yesterday appeared confident they had found material of help to them. 'The object of the search was at no time endangered,' even though the suspects might have known details of the swoop, said Mr Georg Nauth, spokesman for the Darmstadt state prosecutors' office. Investigators, backed up by 40 police, went in looking for papers and computer-stored data in connection with their investigations into allegations that material was stolen from VW's rival, Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, by former employees of the US group who defected to VW in March. According to Mr Nauth, the search was completed yesterday morning after officials had confiscated large volumes of documents and computer diskettes, along with around 30 stand-alone personal and laptop computers: 'In the light of their complexity, evaluation of these materials will demand a lot of time,' he said. Mr Nauth seemed unruffled by charges that information on the raid had been leaked. Three TV camera crews were waiting outside the VW main plant in Wolfsburg when the police arrived on Thursday morning. The usual VW press relations team, meanwhile, had been reinforced by employees from other divisions and subsidiaries. One spokesman said yesterday tips about the raid could be seen in the media; another was 'astonished' to see the camera crews at the factory gates. Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the group production director at the centre of the criminal investigation, carried on working unperturbed when investigators barged into his office. His house and those of three of his associates were being searched at the same time. 'The Darmstadt public prosecutors' office seems to have as many holes as a Swiss Cheese,' said Mr Uwe-Karsten Heye, spokesman for the government of Lower Saxony, VW's home state. However, the Lower Saxony government itself had been informed in advance of the action, led by officials from Hesse, who requested assistance from local police forces. In a bizarre twist, two men from the Frankfurt red-light district also appeared to have known about the impending raid. They were arrested on Tuesday night after telephoning VW with an offer to sell the company information for DM500,000. The company informed the police of 'attempted extortion' without discovering details of the information, a spokesman said. According to press reports, the two men had learnt about the raid from police officers they met at a Hesse shooting club. Mr Hans Wilhelm Gab, vice-president of GM Europe and a member of the Opel supervisory board, said the affair was a matter of 'questionnable behaviour' by individuals. 'In general our respect from VW and its employees is unchanged.' People's car overload, Page 6</p>

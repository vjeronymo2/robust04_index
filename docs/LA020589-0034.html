			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE ALL AROUND?  </P> <P> Watching stage critic Dan Sullivan and Mark Taper Forum executive Gordon  Davison duke it out in The Times is like watching two white guys go one on one  in basketball because they own the court (Sullivan's Jan. 8 "And a Humbug in a  Pear Tree" and Davison's Jan. 22 letter).  </P> <P> Come on, Calendar, aren't there any non-white reviewers on your staff? Does  Kevin Thomas have to review every Japanese film?  </P> <P> Come on, Gordon, are the only blacks on your staff the janitor and  receptionist? Why the white-only practice regarding directors, i.e. "Green  Card," "The Wash" and now "Sansei"? And "Dutch Landscape," which takes place in  South Africa but deals with a white family from Malibu yet?  </P> <P> Come on, guys, stop being so self-righteous. You're a joke to all Third World  Americans.  </P> <P> YOUNG HAN-CHONG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

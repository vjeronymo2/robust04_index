			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRANCE;  </P> <P> YOUTHS RIOT FOR 4TH STRAIGHT NIGHT  </P> <P> Rampaging youths torched a tobacco shop and a store in the shopping center of a  low-income suburb of Lyon, France, in the fourth straight night of unrest.  </P> <P> The violence was far less severe than on the three previous nights, however,  when hundreds of stone-throwing youths set fire to 20 buildings and burned two  dozen cars. The rioting was triggered by the weekend death of Thomas Claudio,  21, a passenger on a motorcycle that collided with a police patrol car. The  rioters blame police for the death.  </P></p>

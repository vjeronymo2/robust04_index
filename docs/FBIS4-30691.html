			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] plans to introduce a new export regulation system for  about 100 general-purpose items, including machinery and  materials, by the end of this year in an effort to prevent  proliferation of mass-destruction weapons such as nuclear arms.  Under the system, companies that plan to export general-purpose  goods to 20 countries considered to be areas of potential  conflict, including the DPRK (North Korea), have to obtain  permission from MITI if their exports come under MITI's  standards. Since there are growing concerns over proliferation  of weapons of mass-destruction following the collapse of the  Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM),  Japan will follow the example of European countries and the  United States in expanding export regulations to general-purpose  goods. MITI intends to revise the Export Trade Control  Ordinance as early as August, and to introduce the new system  after making it known to companies.    Among about 100 items subject to export regulations are:  computers; semiconductors; machinery, including low precision  machine tools; special metals such as zirconium and beryllium;  and carbon fiber. MITI is studying the possibility of  designating about 20 nations -- including North Korea, Iran,  Iraq, Libya, and former communist nations -- as being subject to  export regulations.    Standards to be adopted by MITI are mainly comprised of the  following three cases: 1) General-purpose goods are exported to  such facilities as nuclear power plants at which exported goods  may possibly be used to produce weapons; 2) companies themselves  are aware of the possibility that exported goods may be  transformed into weapons; and 3) even though companies judge  that there is no problem with exports, the government notices a  danger that exported goods could be transformed into weapons.  For example, in case a Japanese company -- which plans to  export semiconductors to Iraq -- is aware of the possibility  that its semiconductors may be used to produce weapons, it has  to submit an application to MITI for permission.    If all 100 items require permission to be exported,  companies  will have to bear a heavy burden and MITI will face difficulties  in examining many applications. For this reason, MITI has  decided to place emphasis of regulations on the possibility that  exported goods may be transformed into weapons. Nevertheless,  since export regulations will be applied to general-purpose  goods, companies need to strengthen their export control system.    Industrialized nations, including Japan, and other countries  have adopted international regulations on exports of  highly-precise machine tools and pathogenic bacteria which could  be directly used to produce weapons of mass-destruction such as  nuclear arms and missiles. However, because such goods as low  precision machine tools are also used to produce weapons, MITI  has decided to regulate exports of these general-purpose goods.    The United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have already  introduced a similar system. According to their system, if a  company "is aware that its exported goods will be used to  produce weapons of mass-destruction in the end, it is required  to get permission" to export them. This is called the "know  control" system. Although MITI has partially introduced the  "know control" system into its new system, it has made standards  of its system clearer than is the "know control" system by  designating importers as subject to export permission.</p>

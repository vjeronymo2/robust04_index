			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: SALES CONTRACT SHOULD SPECIFY ALL ITEMS INCLUDED IN  PURCHASE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I am still livid with rage at how we got swindled on the purchase of  our home, which closed about a month ago. The listing the realtor showed us  itemized the things that were included in the sale, such as stove,  refrigerator, washer and dryer. But we are not professional home buyers, so we  were not aware these items were not included on the purchase contract we signed  to buy the house. We just presumed everything which was on the listing sheet  would be included.  </P> <P> To our surprise, when we got the keys to the house, the seller had stripped the  house bare. She didn't even leave any light bulbs. It cost us over $4,000 to  replace the appliances and everything else the seller stole.  </P> <P> When we confronted the realtor, he said, "Well, you didn't say anything when we  wrote up the contract, so I presumed you had your own appliances." We talked to  our attorney and she said it is not worth the time and cost to sue the seller  because the legal fees would probably eat up most of what we might win. What  should we do?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Your attorney is correct that legal costs would eat up most of the  $4,000 you might win by suing the seller. But I hope you haven't forgotten the  realtor, who apparently misrepresented the home to you. If he implied that the  appliances were part of the sale price, by showing you the listing sheet, then  those appliances must be included.  </P> <P> The seller is correct that if you didn't itemize the personal property you  wanted included in the sale, then those items are not automatically part of the  sale of real estate. However, your leverage is with the realtor, who badly  goofed by not itemizing the appliances on the sales contract.  </P> <P> I suggest you put pressure on the agent to make things right. If he refuses to  do so, don't hesitate to let him know you will file a complaint for  misrepresentation and fraud with the state real estate commissioner.  </P> <P> It would be much cheaper for the realtor to pay you the $4,000 rather than to  risk losing his license. In addition, file a complaint with the local Board of  Realtors, which may discipline its wayward member.  </P> <P> Over-55 Home Sellers Have 2 Years to Decide  </P> <P> Q: My parents are considering buying a second home and possibly selling their  old home. They are well over 55 and qualify for the $125,000 home sale tax  exemption. But they are not sure if they want to sell their old home before  they try out living in their new home in a new town. Could they rent out their  old home for a while before they decide to sell it?  </P> <P> A: Yes. Let's review the Internal Revenue Code "over 55 rule." To qualify, the  home seller must be 55 or older on the day of sale, have owned and lived in the  principal residence any three of the five years before sale and never have used  this tax break before.  </P> <P> This means your parents can move out of their principal residence and rent out  their old home for up to two years while they try living in their second home.  </P> <P> Within the two years they can decide if they want to sell their former  residence and claim their $125,000 tax-free home sale profits even though it  was rented for up to two years. Ask your tax adviser to explain further.  </P> <P> Buyer in Trouble Without Written Pact  </P> <P> Q: About a year ago, my wife and I bought a vacant lot where we want to build  our dream home. We paid $10,000 down, and the seller carried back the balance  on a first mortgage. She said when we are ready to build she would consider  subordinating her loan to a new construction loan.  </P> <P> Now we are ready to start construction. We have the plans ready, the city has  issued the building permit and we arranged a construction loan. But our seller  says she doesn't want to subordinate her loan to make it a second mortgage to a  new first mortgage. How can we force her to honor her promise?  </P> <P> A: You should have gotten the seller's subordination agreement in writing. As  you know, if the seller subordinates her loan, it will become a second mortgage  behind the new first mortgage construction loan.  </P> <P> However, the statute of frauds requires subordination agreements and virtually  all other real estate contracts to be in writing to be legally enforceable. You  may wish to consult a real estate attorney, but don't get your hopes up.  </P> <P> Does Buyer or Seller Pay for Insurance?  </P> <P> Q: Many times you have recommended that property buyers obtain title insurance.  But you never say whether the buyer or seller should pay the premium. It seems  to me the seller should pay since it is the seller's problem to deliver good  title.  </P> <P> A: Everything is negotiable. However, local custom usually determines whether  the buyer or seller pays for title insurance. For example, in the county where  I live, the buyer usually pays for title insurance. But in the adjoining county  the seller customarily buys the title insurance. Although local custom usually  prevails, the buyer and seller can negotiate on who gets to pay for the title  insurance.  </P> <P> Both Homeowners Must Sign the Deed  </P> <P> Q: My father and I own a rental house. We listed it for sale with a realty  agent. While my father was away on vacation the agent brought an excellent  offer. After phoning my father, who agreed to accept the offer, I signed it.  But when the time came to sign the deed, he refused and said we should be  getting more for the house. Now the realty agent and the buyer threaten to sue  us if we don't deliver the deed. Can I sign the deed on behalf of my father?  </P> <P> A: Unless you hold a power of attorney signed by your father you have no right  to sign the deed on his behalf. By accepting that purchase offer alone, you  obligated yourself to sell the property. Although you signed in good faith, if  the realty agent sued you, you might be obligated for the sales commission. You  are in a very messy situation. If you can't persuade your father to sign the  deed, I suggest you consult a real estate attorney.  </P> <P> 'In-Law' Apartment May Not Be Legal  </P> <P> Q: I have seen several houses advertised for sale with an "in-law apartment."  Please explain what this means. Why don't they just say it is a two-family  duplex?  </P> <P> A: Advertising a house for sale with an "in-law apartment" is usually a  shorthand way of saying the house has an illegal apartment that could be  suitable for occupancy by a mother-in-law. Before you buy a house with an  in-law apartment, check with the city as to the apartment's legality. If you  plan to rent it, the city might force you to vacate it. Don't pay much extra  for such an illegal apartment.  </P> <P> Is Auction a Good Way to Sell a House?  </P> <P> Q: I have had my house listed for sale for two months with no purchase offers  so far. The realty agent says the market is slow in our town now. Last week, I  received in the mail a solicitation to auction my house. At first I thought it  was a joke. But then I called the company and found they are legitimate and  have had considerable success selling houses. What do you think of auctioning  my house?  </P> <P> A: Auctions are used primarily to sell distress property. Unless your home fits  into that situation I would avoid holding an auction. If you are not in a  situation where you absolutely must sell, I would forget about auctioning your  home.  </P> <P> Another problem with auctions is financing. If the auctioneer can offer  financing for prospective buyers, then you may want to reconsider. But most  auctioneers do not offer financing. As a result, many sales confirmed at real  estate auctions are never completed if the buyer cannot qualify for a new  mortgage.  </P> <P> A better alternative, if you are satisfied with your realty agent, is to renew  your listing for an additional 30 days. Get the agent's written promise to  actively market your house, such as with newspaper ads and weekend open houses.  If you are not satisfied with your realty agent, switch to a better agent when  you current listing expires.  </P> <P> Tax-Deferred Trades Are Alive and Well  </P> <P> Q: I have been unable to get any information if Congress changed the rules for  tax-deferred exchanges before they adjourned. I understand they were planning  on requiring exchanges to be limited to similar kinds of property and to  require a 1- or 2-year holding period after acquiring a property in the  exchange. Please clarify.  </P> <P> A: The good news is that Congress did not significantly change the tax-deferred  exchange rules. Fortunately, the "like kind" rule was not changed. You can  still trade, for example, land for buildings, apartments for commercial  property and a warehouse for a parking lot. Neither was any minimum time limit  set for holding property acquired in a tax-deferred change. However, exchanges  of foreign property were eliminated and new limitations were placed on trades  between relatives. Thankfully, tax-deferred exchanges survived Congress  relatively unchanged.  </P> <P> Sales Commission Split Leaves Little  </P> <P> Q: So many people read your columns in our area I wish you would explain to  home buyers and sellers how real estate sales commissions are split. As a  realty salesman, I am often asked to cut my commission. But when I politely  explain that I only receive about 25% of the total commission, the sellers back  off.  </P> <P> The commission seems big in dollar amounts but when it is split four ways  between my broker, myself, the other broker and the other salesperson there  isn't much commission to cut. Your help would be appreciated in explaining this  to the public.  </P> <P> A: In my opinion, the only time to cut the sales commission that the seller  agreed to pay to the realty agent occurs if the agent brings in a purchase  offer substantially below the asking price recommended by the agent. Then I  think the agent should share in the price reduction for misleading the seller  as to the attainable price.  </P> <P> To illustrate how sales commissions are split, suppose you sell a $100,000  house and earn a $6,000 gross sales commission. If the purchase offer was  obtained by an agent from another office, that firm receives $3,000 and your  firm receives $3,000. Each salesperson then usually receives half of the  broker's share, or $1,500, in this example.  </P> <P> How High a Deposit Can Seller Expect?  </P> <P> Q: We live in a rural area where there aren't many realty agents. The ones near  us aren't very good, so we have decided to sell our property without any agent.  As a percentage of the sales price, how large an earnest money deposit do you  think we can get?  </P> <P> A: In dollar amounts, $1,000 to $10,000 are typical earnest money deposits. As  a percentage of your home's sales price, you would be very lucky to get 5% to  10% at the time the purchase offer is made.  </P> <P> Include a Financial Contingency in Offer  </P> <P> Q: In a few months we will be ready to buy our first home. By then I should  receive the inheritance from my late mother. However, it will only give us a  down payment of about 10%. Although we have already talked with a S &amp; L  about getting a 90% mortgage and they are very encouraging, how can we be sure  we will actually get the loan when we need it?  </P> <P> A: Just include a mortgage finance contingency clause in your home purchase  offer. Be sure it is specific. For example, it might read "This purchase offer  is contingent upon property and buyer qualifying for a new 30-year first  mortgage of at least $100,000 with a fixed-interest rate not exceeding 9.75%  and a monthly principal and interest payment of not more than $859.16."  </P> <P> If the specified loan proves to be unavailable, then you can either accept the  best available loan or cancel the sale and get your earnest money deposit  refunded. Ask a real estate attorney to explain further.  </P> <P> When to Buy Foreclosed Property  </P> <P> Q: My wife and I would like to buy our first home. Recently, we attended a free  90-minute lecture at a local hotel about buying foreclosure houses. The speaker  made it sound so easy and profitable. But he was from out of town, selling his  $895 seminar, so he wasn't exactly impartial. Do you think it is wise to buy  foreclosed houses and how would we go about doing it?  </P> <P> A: Yes, you can make substantial profits buying foreclosed houses. I've bought  quite a few and they all turned out well. Done correctly, buying foreclosed  property is like paying the wholesale instead of retail price. However, in some  towns, such as Dallas and Houston, the market is glutted with foreclosed  houses, so it is very hard to make profits there.  </P> <P> There are three basic times to buy foreclosure houses: after the default notice  is recorded but before the foreclosure auction, at the foreclosure sale and if  there were no bidders, after the foreclosure sale when you can buy the REO  (real estate owned) from the foreclosing lender.  </P> <P> The advantage of buying before the auction is that you can sometimes pay the  defaulting owner a few thousand dollars for a quit-claim deed. However, this  usually doesn't work well if there are many mortgages on the property. But  buying at the foreclosure auction wipes out the junior loans. The drawback is  that you'll need cash to buy at the auction.  </P> <P> I prefer to buy after the auction, if there were no bidders, at a good price  from the foreclosing lender, who usually will finance the sale on attractive  terms such as 5% or 10% down payment. However, I stay away from VA and FHA  foreclosures because these houses are usually offered at full retail value.  </P> <P> Tax Pitfalls When Refinancing Home  </P> <P> Q: Did I understand your recent article correctly that if I refinance the  mortgage on my home to take out some tax-free cash, I can only deduct the  interest on an additional home-equity $100,000 maximum loan?  </P> <P> My first mortgage is paid down to about $18,652 and the house is worth at least  $200,000. My bank will loan me up to $150,000, which would net me around  $131,348. But are you telling me I can deduct interest only on $100,000  additional and I could not deduct itemized interest on $31,348?  </P> <P> A: I regret to report you understand the bleak picture perfectly. In 1986 and  1987, Congress reduced the maximum income tax rate but they also took away  important tax benefits, such as full deductibility of home mortgage interest.  </P> <P> It Makes Sense to to Lease Your Home  </P> <P> Q: Some time ago, you wrote that it makes sense to rent the home where I live,  but you also said I should own a rental house held for investment. You  suggested that a reader move out of his house, rent it to tenants, and then  rent a similar nearby house where he would live. Please clarify.  </P> <P> A: On an out-of-pocket basis, it is usually cheaper to rent a house than to own  that same house. In most communities, the reason is that rents are lower than  mortgage payments.  </P> <P> For example, I recently rented a house to a tenant for $1,500 per month. With a  10% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment on that same house, including  property taxes, would be about $2,600. But I have owned that house for many  years, so my payments are not that high.  </P> <P> My suggestion is to rent your home to tenants and move into the nicest rental  house you can afford. Perhaps you would enjoy one with a swimming pool, tennis  courts and four garages. You will be surprised how cheaply lavish mansions can  be rented. Another benefit is that the owner pays for the maintenance.  </P> <P> Even if you have a modest negative cash flow from renting your old home, after  computing the income tax savings from the loss and the depreciation deduction,  you should come out about even. However, you will be making a profit if the  house appreciates in market value.  </P> <P> I learned this concept from Jack Miller of Tampa and John Schaub of Sarasota,  Fla. But they are quick to emphasize that although renting the house where you  live makes financial sense, most people do not want to live in a home they are  not buying. This is the big hang-up to renting the residence where you now live  and owning other investment property to provide a cash-flow tax loss. I admit  that while this concept makes sense, I prefer living in a home I own.  </P> <P> Road Easement Has to Be in Writing  </P> <P> Q: Several months ago, I bought some rural land which adjoins property I  already own. When discussing the sale, the neighbor agreed to give me a road  easement over the land he still owns. This will save me from driving several  extra miles to get to the nearest town. However, in looking over the deed to  the land I bought I don't see anything about an easement. Should there be some  mention of the road easement?  </P> <P> A: Yes. You not only purchased the land but a road easement over the neighbor's  adjoining land which he retained. Your deed should describe the land you bought  plus the easement over the adjoining land, called the servient tenement.  Consult the person who handled the transaction, such as a real estate attorney,  title or escrow officer. I hope you bought an owner's title policy. If so, you  should be protected.  </P></p>

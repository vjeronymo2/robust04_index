			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Car output fall worst since 1974 THE Japanese car industry, which has been the leading force in the world industry for most of the last decade, suffered its worst month since 1974 last month, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association. Output in August fell by 12.7 per cent from the year before to 790,678 cars, the largest annual fall since 1974 at the height of the first oil shock when production plunged 16.3 per cent that August. Car makers are facing a problem of overcapacity as domestic demand dips and investments in new plant, which were planned during the boom of the late 1980s, come on stream. The stall in the industry casts a shadow over much of the rest of manufacturing. Production of passenger cars fell by 11.2 per cent to 595,826 units, the worst decline for five years. Larger models which had resisted the recession succumbed in August registering a 3 per cent fall. Mini-car production fell by 11.5 per cent to 45,158 units and truck production declined by 17.4 per cent to 190,932 units. Output at Honda and Nissan fell over 20 per cent. At Nissan a 25 per cent drop in domestic sales and a 16 per cent drop in exports was only slightly offset by a 7 per cent increase in overseas production. Toyota contained the cut in its production to 12.4 per cent and Suzuki Motors raised output largely because production last year was at an unusually low level.</p>

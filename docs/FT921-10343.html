			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Tory MPs attack Labour's plans to re-define PSBR TORY frontbenchers yesterday sought to exploit uncertainty about Labour's plans for re-defining the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the wake of the apparent climbdown over capital receipts by Mr Clive Soley, the party's housing spokesman. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour was claiming to have 'discovered the political philosopher's stone'. The capital receipts had already been counted as negative public expenditure, he said. 'If the spending has to be made, the money has to be raised, and no amount of creative accounting will obscure that fact.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, turned his guns on Mr John Prescott, his opposite number in the shadow cabinet, who he said had 'recently dismissed the prevailing Treasury rules on public borrowing as 'stupid''. Labour's transport spokesman claimed to have the backing of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, to change those rules, Mr Rifkind continued. 'The travelling public are entitled to an explanation. They need to know whether this really is agreed Labour policy, or just another example of a promise made 'on the hoof'.' Mr Prescott's office confirmed that he had secured clearance from the party leadership for two specific Treasury rule changes, in connection with a proposal to allow British Rail to lease badly needed commuter trains for Network SouthEast. The changes would ease restrictions on the sources of British Rail's borrowings.</p>

The Hornets, formerly No. 1 in the  state, fell out of the Top 20 after losing to Cerritos last week.  </P> <P> The Warriors took over No. 1 after last week's victory over Orange Coast, which  gave them a nine-game winning streak.

Valley in Saturday's 1 p.m. Western State  Conference game. The Cougars are 2-0 and in the state's Top 20 after shutting  out West L.A. last week. Valley is 0-2 after losses to Moorpark and Mt. San  Antonio College.  </P> <P> The Cougars will go with Craig Manigo at quarterback. The freshman completed 13  of 18 attempts for 181 yards and three touchdowns against West L.A. Southwest's  defense last week limited West L.A. to 69 yards total offense.  </P> <P> Unranked Harbor (1-1) is home against No. 18 Bakersfield in Saturday's 7:30  p.m. WSC match-up. The Seahawks are coming off a 40-13 loss to Santa Monica and  Bakersfield is 1-0-1 after tying Glendale 19-19 last week. IRENE GARCIA  </P></p>

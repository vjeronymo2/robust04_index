			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONATION TO L.A. CENTRAL LIBRARY  </P> <P> Your editorial "Central Library: Check It Out" (Nov. 30) is in itself a "rather  fabulous gift" to the many of us who labor to provide quality library services.  </P> <P> The librarians in Los Angeles County join with you in applauding the Mark Taper  Foundation's farsighted gift to Los Angeles Public Library's Central Library  and to the citizens of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Three things emerge immediately from the content of your editorial. First,  learning is an ongoing process and libraries are "ongoing learning  laboratories." Second, library services extend far beyond the business of  loaning out books and in fact embrace what has been called the Information Age.  Third, learning and libraries can be, and are, "simply for the joy of  learning."  </P> <P> I would like to take this opportunity to remind readers there are 30 other  public library jurisdictions operating in Los Angeles County, and I would  encourage your readers to consider the multiplicity of worthy gift giving  opportunities that remain unexplored.  </P> <P> CAROL E. MOSS, Chairman of the Board, L. A. County Public Library Foundation  </P></p>

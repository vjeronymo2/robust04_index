			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS PROPOSE ENROLLMENT TASK FORCE  </P> <P> Glendale school officials have proposed forming a task force to investigate the  continued rapid growth in the district's student population.  </P> <P> In a report to the Board of Education Tuesday, Assistant Supt. David Kanthak,  who is expected to head the task force, suggested seeking "acceptable  alternatives" to deal with projected enrollment increases.  </P> <P> Among the alternatives to be studied are a year-round class schedule,  enrollment caps and enhanced programs.  </P> <P> Since December, 1986, enrollment has increased from 19,779 to 22,641, or 14.5%,  according to a district report. A city housing report released last month  predicted that 2,696 students will enter the already crowded system in the next  five years, an increase of 11.9%. District Supt. Robert Sanchis proposed the  Futures' Task Force at Tuesday night's Board of Education meeting. The board is  expected to formally adopt the proposal next month.  </P> <P> "In schools where existing alternatives -- such as consolidation and  construction -- have all been exhausted and there is continued enrollment, then  yes, year-round is a strong possibility," Sanchis said Wednesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Wide Support'  </P> <P> He added that "there appears to be wide support for year-round at the state  level" and that financial incentives have been offered to schools that  participate in such programs.  </P> <P> Task force members will be selected after the program is formally approved,  Kanthak said. The board is scheduled to consider the task force at its first  meeting in July, and the group is expected to begin operating Sept. 19.  </P> <P> The district has consolidated programs and classrooms, created temporary  classrooms, built new facilities and changed student attendance boundaries to  deal with crowding. "Just about anything more than what we're doing now would  have to be considered drastic," Kanthak said.  </P> <P> The school board voted in February to shift ninth-grade classes from two junior  high schools to Hoover High School by September, 1991. The district will spend  $4 million to build additional classrooms, but the switch will significantly  ease crowding at the two junior high schools.  </P> <P> District spokesman Vic Pallos said district administrators have shown more  interest in changing current procedures -- the Hoover shift is an example --  than in going to a year-round schedule.  </P> <P> "That would be an option that the committee would want to look into," Pallos  said.  </P> <P> The task force, to be made up of parents, teachers, administrators and  community leaders, will list possible alternatives, their advantages and  disadvantages and projected costs. The task force is scheduled to submit its  findings to the board in February.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva and Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Text] Sofia, June 28 (BTA) -- The leadership of the two  major parliamentary forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party  (BSP) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) -- discussed the  current political situation at their regular sessions today.  Later on their leaders spoke before journalists of possible  early elections.    The SDS has been insisting on early general elections for  almost 18 months. The Socialists declared themselves for early  parliamentary elections at their latest congress.  Representatives of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and  Freedoms (DPS), on the mandate of which the incumbent cabinet  was formed, have also mentioned early elections this autumn.  However, these elections have not been scheduled yet. On June  26 President Zhelyu Zhelev repeated his proposal to the  political forces to reach an agreement on the date of the  elections, which according to him, should be held this autumn.  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has also proposed an agreement  between the political forces on early elections. The idea for  an agreement between the political forces on the holding of  elections was also launched last Sunday in an interview with BSP  deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov.    Before the elections it is necessary to tackle urgent tasks  such as the launching of mass privatization, completion of the  work of the liquidation councils (liquidating the former  cooperative farms and returning the land to its former owners),  normalization of Bulgaria's international finance and economic  positions and guaranteeing this country's internal and external  security, BSP leader Zhan Videnov said today. We should also  decide on the withdrawal of the government and the giving up of  the mandates of the parliamentary forces to form a new cabinet  within this parliament, which would be obligatory for the  faction of the Socialists too. It is also necessary to prepare  the elections from a purely legal point of view -- amendments to  the constitution if necessary, amendments to the electoral law  and the laws on local government, Videnov said.    According to SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, there are  considerable differences between the stand of the SDS and the  other political forces on the issue of early parliamentary  elections. "Last Tuesday the SDS committed itself to early  elections as a political force," Dimitrov stressed. According  to him, it is not enough for leaders, including Socialists, to  express their personal views in favour of early elections. The  decision of the supreme SDS leadership of last Tuesday entails  commitments which should be undertaken by all political forces  insisting on early elections. According to the SDS, the  political forces should commit themselves to no-confidence in  the cabinet of Lyuben Berov, to giving up their mandate for  forming a new cabinet within the framework of the incumbent  parliament and to opposing any attempts to form such a cabinet.    The leadership of the SDS and the DPS or part of them are  insincere in their call for early parliamentary elections, BSP  leader Zhan Videnov said today. By way of illustration he cited  the draft of Prime Minister Berov of a framework agreement  between the political forces providing for elections in the  autumn of 1994, which according to him was spoilt by the DPS,  and the preconditions and tactical schemes leading to elections  set by SDS leaders during the negotiations held with the SDS  last week at the request of the BSP. The BSP is seeking  prospects for a left-of-centre agreement on pre-elections and  post-elections actions, Videnov recalled.    An official agreement between parliamentary and  extraparliamentary forces on early elections and the accession  to this agreement of state institutions would confirm the  attitude of the different political formations on early  elections this autumn, BSP deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov said at  today's press conference. "I believe that such a proposal would  help us verify the sincerity of all who have shown an attitude  to early elections," he said. In an interview for today's issue  of DEMOKRATSIYA SDS leader Filip Dimitrov says that what matters  is not the word agreement but party commitment. "I have learnt  from experience that an agreement may be full of traps, such as  for example certain laws which will have to be passed," Dimitrov  said.</p>

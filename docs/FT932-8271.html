			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US worries hit London share prices A FRISSON of nervousness over US interest rates ran through the London stock market yesterday afternoon, helping to undermine confidence which had been boosted at first by favourable reports on retail sales from the Confederation of British Industry. An early gain of 11 points on the Footsie was cut back after official statistics for March showed a fall of 0.3 per cent in domestic manufacturing output and of 1.3 per cent in industrial production. This cast a shadow over the progress of the economic recovery implied by the CBI report. Equities had also been helped at the opening of trading by favourable corporate trading reports. Results from British Airways were overshadowed by the expected rights issue which, at Pounds 442m, was a shade smaller than the market had been expecting. Profits and dividend from Marks and Spencer, the premium high street retailer, were well received and, although the shares turned down later, traders rejected market gossip of a possible rights issue. The UK economic data unsettled equities, which were soon given further downward impetus from the stock index futures, where the June Footsie contract dipped to a discount to fair value for much of the session. With the institutions clearly taking a reserved attitude - retail business only just cleared the Pounds 1bn mark on Monday - shares extended their losses. However, the more significant blow to the market came when London traders caught the hint of New York worries that the revived concern over inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. With hopes of a rate cut at today's Bundesbank meeting also fading fast, the UK market fell more than 12 points to a day's low of 2,845.9. London's unhappiness was pressed home by an early decline of 16 points in New York's Dow Industrial Average. At the close the FT-SE 100 Index, sustained by a rally in stock index futures, was down 10.8 on the day at 2,847.3. Although Seaq volume increased to 633.4m shares from the previous day's 533.8m, traders stressed that genuine customer business remained relatively poor. Continued activity among the second line issues brought a gain of 5.2 to 3,151.2 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which earlier mounted another challenge to its previous peak of 3,154.7. Non-Footsie trades made up only about 56 per cent of the day's total, however, reflecting the concentration on a heavy list of blue chip profits announcements. London strategists put the best face possible on yesterday's market performance, but admitted that uncertainty over the pace of the economic recovery in the UK has been joined by worries over the outlook in continental Europe and in the US. Warnings of competitive strains in the food industry from BSN, of France, unsettled Unilever and some other food industry issues - although these factors were counterbalanced by renewed hints of impending acquisition moves. Nor did confirmation of British Airways' funding move, and firm rejection of any such plans by Allied-Lyons, remove the market's fears that it could be hit by further rights issues on top of the BT III sale and a heavy funding programme in the gilt-edged market.</p>

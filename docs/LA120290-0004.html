			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> EFFORT TO HALT PIRACY OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS REVS UP AGAIN  </P> <P> The possibility of legislation prohibiting the pirating of industrial designs  has sparked a hot debate between automobile manufacturers and the independent  parts and service industry even before Congress kicks the new session into  drive.  </P> <P> The proposed Industrial Design Anti-Piracy Act, which has been stalled for  several years in Congress, would impose a 10-year design copyright on nearly  every design that is original and distinctive. It is intended to bridge the gap  between the artistic nature of current copyright law and the functional nature  of patent protection.  </P> <P> The bill's powerful co-sponsors, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt  (D-Mo.) and House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) have said they are  not sure when they will reintroduce the measure. But both have expressed a  continuing interest in it.  </P> <P> "It is time that the United States act to stem the losses in export sales and  jobs that result from inadequate intellectual property protection and product  counterfeiting by our trading partners," Michel said.  </P> <P> Manufacturers say they support the legislation because it would protect their  long-term investment in the development and design of specific parts and  protect consumers by guaranteeing high-quality and safe parts. Auto  manufacturers say that they are interested only in exterior parts made from  sheet metal, such as hoods, fenders and doors.  </P> <P> "Current law does not adequately protect the auto makers' investment," said  Kenneth W. Myers, parts and service marketing manager at Ford Motor Co.  "Copyright law focuses on objects that are purely artistic, while the patent  law system focuses on the mechanical aspects of an object. Neither adequately  protects industrial designs."  </P> <P> Pure bunk, say the "aftermarket" service and parts people. They contend that,  because it is getting more difficult for manufacturers to make a profit from  the sale of cars, they are trying to legislate a sure portion of the  $135-billion parts and service aftermarket.  </P> <P> This side of the debate is also concerned that the bill is vague enough to  cover interior parts, too.  </P> <P> "The Automotive Parts &amp; Accessories Assn. is extremely concerned that the  broad scope of design protection legislation being considered will provide the  new car manufacturers with a 10-year, government-protected monopoly over the  production and distribution of a wide array of replacement and add-on parts for  vehicles," said Julian C. Morris, the group's president. "The anti-piracy  premise of this bill is little more than an attempt by the car companies to  grab the market share they have lost through the years in a competitive  market."  </P> <P> In fact, Project 2000, a long-range, strategic planning effort by the National  Automobile Dealers Assn. has recommended to dealers nationwide that they pursue  the service and parts aftermarkets because of declining profits from new-car  sales.  </P> <P> "Our problem is that we have the same size pie but more players," said Allan  Wilbur, NADA's executive director of public affairs. "In the next few years,  the areas for greater emphasis should be on service, parts and, when possible,  the finance and insurance business."  </P> <P> Added Wilbur: "Small-town dealers already know this. If they don't give good  service, they don't survive. But 80% of the cars sold nationwide are sold by  only 20% of the dealers."  </P> <P> Much of the debate was initiated by the insurance industry when it began  encouraging the use of less expensive parts rather than those made by the  original manufacturers. The aftermarket proponents still wrap themselves in the  consumer side of the issue, saying affordability, convenience and competition  are at stake.  </P> <P> But the manufacturers respond that safety, quality and fairness are on their  side.  </P> <P> "It is hard for American manufacturers to compete with the inexpensive,  imitation parts made abroad," said Anne Carlson of the Motor Vehicle  Manufacturers Assn. "Many of these companies are using ungalvanized steel that  rusts prematurely and they are making copies of a copy, so that they don't fit  properly. At the same time, they have lower labor costs and few of the  environmental laws that we have to work with here."  </P> <P> All parts, regardless of where they are manufactured, have to live up to the  same standards, countered Linda Hoffman, vice president of government affairs  for the parts and accessories organization. "They say they're talking about  design, but invariably it has something to do with getting the advantage over  their competition in the marketplace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> FDIC Plan Would Have Banks Purchase Stock  </P> <P> Late this month or early next, the Bush Administration will propose measures to  strengthen the deposit insurance fund for the nation's banks and remove  Depression-era restrictions on banking activities. In doing so, it will signal  the official start of a lengthy and important debate in Congress over the  future of banking.  </P> <P> In a time-honored Washington tradition, the Administration has floated one of  its ideas as a trial balloon, and reaction has been predictably divided.  </P> <P> Leaked last week was word of a proposal to bolster the ailing Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp. fund by requiring banks to buy preferred stock from the agency.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the FDIC quickly confirmed the report as accurate and pointed  out that it was one of several ideas being discussed.  </P> <P> Banks would have to buy the stock in proportion to their deposits, the same way  they pay for FDIC insurance. Officials have discussed mandating stock purchases  ranging from 50 cents per $100 of deposits to $1 per $100. The plan would raise  $14 billion to $28 billion for the insurance fund.  </P> <P> As a sweetener for the banks, they would receive market-rate interest on the  stock and could count it as part of the capital they are required to have on  hand to meet federal standards. But that hasn't removed all the bad taste.  </P> <P> Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., banking consultant, was quick to blast the  concept as a thinly disguised tax that would damage healthy banks.  </P> <P> "In effect, the safe drivers of the banking world are paying higher and higher  deposit insurance premiums because the regulatory process has done a miserable  job of catching banking's drunken drivers," said Ely.  </P> <P> But the banking industry was not so fast to condemn the proposal.  </P> <P> "I don't know that banks are necessarily going to oppose this," said Joe Belew,  president of the Consumer Bankers Assn., which represents the nation's smaller  banks.  </P> <P> "They are terribly worried about any move toward a premium increase because  profitability is hurting so much in the industry. They are equally concerned  about that there not be a taxpayer bailout. This plan has some attractive  aspects."  </P> <P> But Belew and others see the proposal as only the first in a series of measures  and issues that will dominate the banking agenda in Congress in the coming  session.  </P></p>

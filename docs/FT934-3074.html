			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dusty answer for plastic card fraud The latest way of preventing plastic card fraud involves littering the card with dust particles during the production process. Developed by Inkode of Virginia, Washington, and marketed by NBS, of Byfleet, Surrey, the process involves dropping tiny quartz rods, each with a reflective coating, into the plastic. Although invisible to the human eye, the randomly distributed particles can be 'seen' by radio signals emitted from a scanner. Because the distribution of the particles is unique to each card, the identity of the card can be verified by passing it within 30 metres of the radio transmitter. Inkode: US, 703 276 8000. NBS: UK, 0932 354242.</p>

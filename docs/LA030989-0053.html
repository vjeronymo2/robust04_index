			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORT KEEPS WINE LOVERS AT BAY;  </P> <P> GREAT VINTAGES TAKE TIME, BUT OTHER VARIETIES RIPE NOW  </P> <P> Port works wonders to chase away a chill, but wine lovers know that you can't  pick just any Port in a storm.  </P> <P> Vintage Port is the rarest of all Ports, made in only the best years, aged in  wood for two years (occasionally as long as 2 1/2 years) and then aged in the  bottle for eons. Great vintages of Port, such as 1963 or 1977, produce wines of  such immense fruit and quality that it takes literally decades before they  smooth out and become truly harmonious.  </P> <P> I have stashed in my cellar a number of bottles of '63 Portuguese Ports that I  have monitored over the years. Few of them are truly drinkable today; most need  more cellar age. And they were produced a quarter century ago. Not long ago I  tasted the legendary 1931 Quinta do Noval, one of the greatest vintage Ports  ever produced. It wasn't at its peak yet!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fine Wine Takes Time  </P> <P> This may explain the story of a wine-making couple I know who are both Port  lovers. Both are in the early 50s.  </P> <P> "We hadn't bought any of the '77s," he said, "so we went down to our local shop  and asked the merchant which ones we should buy."  </P> <P> "And he asked us how old we were," she said. "I am not a kid, I told him.  </P> <P> "And he said, 'Look, folks, unless you're buying the '77s for your  grandchildren, forget them and buy some tawnies.' "  </P> <P> That's a message that many Port lovers give to newcomers to the game. Vintage  Ports can be great, but they take great patience. And for that reason, tawny  Ports can be a better buy. First, they're much cheaper, not to mention the fact  that you don't have to lay them in your cellar until heck freezes over. Tawny  Ports provide a grand accompaniment for savories because they are lighter than  most vintage Ports and have a patina of age the day you buy the bottle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Great Deal of Patience  </P> <P> Aged in wood at least six years, tawny Ports are often blended with some mature  Port and some younger stock, giving the wine a fruity quality and an older,  more wizened character.  </P> <P> One of my favorites over the years has been a Port called Fonseca Bin 27 (about  $15) that has quite a bit of fruit, and usually offers a slightly chocolatey  taste. Another reasonably priced tawny Port is Smith Woodhouse Rare Tawny  ($13).  </P> <P> At the upper levels of this category, Graham's 10-year-old and 30-year-old  tawnies ($19 and $52, respectively) are remarkable and very complex older Ports  without any of the harshness associated with vintage Port. The latter is a Port  that was aged in barrel for 30 years, about as long as any tawny you'll find.  </P> <P> Because of the great length of time it takes to get a vintage Port mature, the  various producers in Portugal have developed a whole range of styles aimed at  making Ports you can drink sooner. (As the Port shippers say, these other wines  are intended to give you something you can drink while you are waiting for your  vintage Ports to mature.)  </P> <P> One such type of Port with the style of a vintage but without the need to age  the wine very long is called Vintage Character Port, and a few of those exist  in the market, such as Dow's, which sells for about $30 a bottle.  </P> <P> Another attempt to make a vintage wine without quite the aging requirements of  a true vintage Port is the single-quinta (vineyard) wine of an "off" year. In  some vintages (such as 1976 and 1978) when quality isn't as high as in a true  vintage year, some producers make a single-year wine more or less like a  vintage Port from single vineyards.  </P> <P> Graham often releases off-year single-vineyard wines from its Malvedos  vineyard, and the 1976 and 1978 Malvedos wines from Graham (about $30 each) are  currently available. Both are charming wines, heavier than a tawny, but not  quite as deep and complex as a classic vintage. Single-quinta wines usually are  at their peak in 10 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Late-Bottled Vintage  </P> <P> Another class of Port intended to emulate the quality level of vintage Port but  without demanding that the consumer stash the stuff for half a lifetime is  designated LBV. This stands for late-bottled vintage and designates a Port that  was made from a single vintage, but aged longer than a vintage Port in barrel  -- usually three to six years.  </P> <P> In effect, this is a lesser-wood-aged tawny, but with some of the vintage  qualities. (It is sometimes seen with the most confusing phrase "Port of the  Vintage 19XX." This is not true Vintage Port, but the phrase sort of indicates  that it is.)  </P> <P> Ruby Port is an attempt to retain the fresh fruit quality of the wine without  adding a lot of flavor from wood aging, and ruby Ports can be fun with savories  too. However, I prefer them only as a contrast, or served with a light dessert.  </P> <P> Quady and J.W. Morris make some of California's most consistent vintage and  non-vintage Ports. Quady's vintage wines appear to require the same amount of  aging as good Portuguese Ports. (A 1977 Quady, tasted some months ago, was  still remarkably young and vivacious.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleasing California Ports  </P> <P> Other California producers make Ports that can be very pleasing and work with  savories too. Three vintage Ports now on store shelves are 1980 Christian  Brothers, 1982 Burgess and 1985 Beringer, all well-made and complex, needing a  bit more time in bottle. Harder to find and closer to the Portuguese model is a  Port called St. Amant, made from traditional Portuguese varieties.  </P> <P> Many other California wineries make tawny Ports that sell for a lot less and  usually are good consistent values, though a lot of what says "Port" on the  label is little more than sweet wine, lacking much character. We tried the  Gallo Livingston Tawny ($4) and found it somewhat syrupy and heavy, but clean  and drinkable.  </P> <P> Another alternative is Australian Port. Some of the latest imports in Port from  Australia are exciting wines and good values.  </P> <P> To test a broad range of Ports from California and Portugal, we selected 10  currently available Ports at random from various wine shops and sampled them to  determine their general qualities. They are listed here in the order in which  they were tasted, and ranked for quality on a five-point scale. Prices are  those we actually paid.  </P> <P> Paul Masson Rare Souzao Cuvee 301S ($7.69): The wine in the familiar  heart-shaped bottle is not the same wine it once was. In years past, it was  truly tawny in color and paler in overall mouth feel. This tasting showed the  wine to be fairly heavy and dense, with a slight pruny, syrupy finish. Nicely  made, but not very elegant.  </P> <P> Ficklin (bottled in 1987) ($9.35): Tawny/pale in color with some fruit, but a  bit thin, lacking in depth. Well made, but short in the aftertaste.  </P> <P> Warre's Warrior ($6.50/half bottle): This reliable Port always offers good  richness. It is pale with red highlights; good fruit, but fairly subtle. A  slight pepperiness in the taste makes for a fairly complex wine.  </P> <P> Llords and Elwood Ancient Proverb ($5.47): Slightly Sherried and pruny, this  longtime favorite in California has good flavor and richness for the money. Not  classic Port, but nice dessert wine.  </P> <P> Sandeman Fine Ruby Port ($5.49): The only true Ruby Port in our tasting, it  showed classic ruby aroma of cherries and currants, with a hint of apples  tossed in for interest. This Port is light and fresh and clearly not a good  match for sharper savories. Better served with apples and pears, or a pear  tart.  </P> <P> Quady Port of the Vintage 1981 ($7.99): An overripe, Zinfandel-ish sort of  aroma is big, bold and tannic. Made like a vintage wine, but lacking the  overall fruit. Good wine in a bigger, full-bodied style.  </P> <P> Graham Late Bottled 1981 ($7.95/half bottle): One of the stars of the tasting,  this most complex wine had marvelous fruit and richness and wasn't as harsh in  the mouth as some. A superior wine.  </P> <P> Dow's 1972 Reserve ($16.95): This is a single-year tawny that was aged seven  years in cask. It had a true tawny color, fairly pale, but was very complex and  smooth. Lacking in youthful fruit (it is, after all, 16 years old), the wine  was silky and refined.  </P> <P> Fonseca Late Bottled 1983 ($16.49): Another tawny type from a single vintage,  this very dark, deep-colored wine has a huge, rich, potent aroma of fruit and a  slight leathery quality. In the mouth, it's potent and peppery, a grand match  for very sharp cheeses. It's more like a young vintage Port than a tawny.  </P> <P> Warre's Nimrod 20-Year-Old ($15.99): A classic well-aged tawny that is pale  bronze in color (little if any red color is left), but with a complex Sherry,  spice and nutmeg character. Very appealing wine because of its utter smoothness  and finesse.  </P> <P> Those who are interested in true vintage Port with some bottle age and are  willing to pay the price to get it may still be able to order some of the  better wines from the great 1970 and 1975 vintages at about $75 to $100 a  bottle. Ask your merchant to tell you what's available (some wholesalers still  stock older Ports and can order them for you).  </P></p>

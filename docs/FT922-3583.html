			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fokker, Dasa closer to accord on transfer deal FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, say they have made progress in negotiations over a transfer of a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch company in return for fresh funds to finance the development of new aircraft. After talks in Amsterdam, the two sides reaffirmed that Fokker would be the 'lead company' in the regional aircraft segment. However they also underscored that Dasa would have 'industrial leadership' of the overall partnership. This formula, which accords leadership roles to both companies, is emerging as the most promising way to get around Dutch sensitivity to the transfer of one of the country's premier industrial companies into foreign ownership. The talks, which began in March, have been hampered by a seeming difference in interpretation of Fokker's role in a future European aeroplane-building consortium. The controversy has fanned national sentiment in the Netherlands against the proposed deal. The two companies said the talks would be concluded before the summer holidays. The Dutch government, which owns 32 per cent of Fokker, is prepared to see a majority of Fokker's shares pass into German hands, but it is keen to secure guarantees about the company's future.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: President of Ito-Yokado resigns over scandal MR MASATOSHI Ito, president of Ito-Yokado, the leading Japanese supermarket retailer which controls Southland of the US, resigned yesterday in an attempt to end a widening scandal involving illegal cash payments to gangsters. Ito-Yokado, hailed as a fast-growing retailer which rewarded investors with high dividend payout ratios, had previously denied links with gangster, but Mr Ito, the group's founder, yesterday announced his resignation, accepting responsibility. Ito-Yokado has looked for international expansion, and took a controlling stake in Southland, the Dallas-based convenience store chain. The resignation follows the arrest of three company officials last week for breaking the commercial code by allegedly paying more than Y20m (Dollars 163,000) to gangsters to ensure order at the company's annual shareholders' meeting last May. At the press conference, Mr Ito denied reports alleging payments were made through a bank account belonging to his wife. In Japan, disrupting shareholders' meetings is seen by gangsters as an easy source of income with some companies paying them off in advance. The resignation has also caused embarrassment for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which last month made an award to Ito-Yokado for increasing payouts to individual investors. The company has raised its dividend for the past 10 consecutive years. Yesterday the exchange said it would not retract its decision, but added the company would not be eligible for the award next year. His successor is Mr Toshifumi Suzuki, the 59-year-old vice-president and president of Seven-Eleven Japan, the convenience store chain affiliated with Ito-Yokado. Mr Ito will leave his posts as chairman at Seven-Eleven and Denny's Japan, the restaurant unit.</p>

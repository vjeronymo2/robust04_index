According to sources from the Ministry of Finance, the  half-year- term bonds will carry an annual interest rate of 9.8  per cent and the interest will be counted starting January 25.    The annual interest rate for the one-year treasury bonds  will  be 11.9 per cent. The interest will be counted as of February 7.    Meanwhile, the paperless bonds are also expected to be  traded  on the Shanghai Securities Exchange after the conclusion of the  issuance, which will be January 30 for the half-year bonds and  February 7 for the one year.    Underwriters of the bonds are securities companies, trust  and  investment companies and banks.    Paperless treasury bonds refer to transactions conducted  entirely through computer systems.    Such bonds generally are sold to institutional buyers and  individual investors who plan big investments in this field.    Officials said most of the buyers of this year's paperless  treasury bonds will be banks and other financial organizations.  However, other institutions and individuals who want to buy at  least 10,000 yuan ($1,149) worth of treasury bonds can also  purchase the bonds through under writers.    China began to issue paperless treasury bonds in 1991 on an  experimental basis. In that year, a total of 1.1 billion yuan  ($126.4 million) treasury bonds were issued.    Last year, China issued 3.6 billion yuan ($413.8 million) in  five-year paperless treasury bonds.    Officials from the Ministry of Finance said the issuance of  paperless treasury bonds represents one of the important  measures the ministry took this year to reform the issuance of  treasury bonds.    He also said a certain amount in paper treasury bonds will  be  issued within the year to meet the demand of individual  investors.    The paper treasury bonds will carry interest rates higher  than bank deposits of the same term.    In other developments, Wei Wenyuan, General Manager of the  Shanghai Securities Exchange, said the exchange will be built to  be the country's only paperless trading and clearing centre.    He said Shanghai will make special efforts to develop the  treasury bond market this year to make the exchange not only the  country's biggest stock market but also the biggest treasury  bonds market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the event the Baltic countries or Latvia join the  Partnership for Peace program and a real danger from Russia  threatens its security, NATO will not only have consultations  with the Baltic countries but will try to influence Russia to  cease its aggressive activity, the delegation of the Latvian  Defense Ministry was told today in Brussels by (Dick Zandie),  spokesmen for the political affairs department.    (Zandie) added that there are virtually no such threats from  Russia in reality, and that much would be done for Latvia's  security by Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace  program. In (Zandie's) view, cooperation with Russia would also  be good for NATO. At NATO headquarters today, the Latvian  Defense Ministry delegation met with two other NATO spokesmen.  During the meeting they mainly discussed European security  problems and the involvement of NATO in solving them.</p>

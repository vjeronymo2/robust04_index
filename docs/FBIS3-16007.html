			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 09, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima  (parliament) Defense and Interior Affairs Committee set up a  working party Wednesday [9 March] to investigate into the record  of the country's Interior Ministry.    The group is authorized to check the methods of staffing  because police often lack proper knowledge of the Latvian  language. The lawfullness of non-service engagements of police  with public structures and funds will be another field for  inspection.    Deputies will also examine whether the ministry uses budget  resources reasonably and purposefully.    The committee formed the group because it wants to help tidy  up the ministry's structures, committee head Ivars Silars told  BNS.    The parliament must follow the observance of law in police  units which employ many "chance people whose sense of stately  responsibility is minimal," said Silars.    Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis also welcomed the move,  Silars noted. The group includes all members of the Defense and  Interior Affairs' Committee but Kristovskis, Defense Minister  Valdis Pavlovskis and Defense Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary  Andris Ligotnis.</p>

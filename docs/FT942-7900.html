			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Dutchman speaks out for a federal Europe - Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the European parliament Mr Laurens Jan Brinkhorst looks set to bring a reformist and unashamedly federalist Dutch voice to the European parliament, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Director-general of the European Commission's environment department for the past seven years, Mr Brinkhorst says he wants to swap his executive role for a frontline place in what he describes as 'the battle for Europe'. He is campaigning as No 2 on the party list for D66, a left-of-centre Dutch party that was one of the main victors of the general election three weeks ago. If elected, Mr Brinkhorst says he will stand up for a 'transparent, democratic Europe' withstanding the tendency for 'the nation state (to be) on the rise again'. Before his stint as one of the most influential civil servants in Brussels, Mr Brinkhorst was the EU's ambassador to Japan. At the start of his career, he taught European law at Dutch universities before being elected to the Dutch parliament in the mid-1970s. He now says he wants to serve in the Strasbourg assembly as a means of propounding ideas on the future of Europe. He argues that Europe is incapable of dealing with such cross-border issues as immigration and drugs, as well as the war in Bosnia, because it is still structured too much along national lines. He has no objections to being described as a 'federalist'. But he adds: 'That does not mean that I want a centralised state with centralised authority.' He has a good chance of playing a high-profile role in the next parliament. D66, founded in 1966 as a party dedicated to reforming politics, doubled its seats in the Dutch parliament to 24 in the May general election, giving it more than one-sixth of all seats. If the same voting pattern holds true for the European election, D66 may win five out of the Netherlands' 31 European seats. Mr Brinkhorst believes the European parliament's agenda can be too broad. 'I think the parliament would do well to concentrate on a few main themes.' One of these, in his view, is deepening the European Union rather than simply enlarging it to admit new members. Another priority is integrating national and European politics. In line with D66's reformist policies, the party has proposed in the Netherlands that MEPs be given the right to speak, though not to vote, when European affairs are discussed in committee stage in the Dutch parliament. This would help the national parliament get a grip on what is happening at the European level. But Mr Brinkhorst is well aware that the proposal is controversial. 'Some MPs definitely see it as an assault on their prerogatives.'</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> AVOID LARGE BILL: REDO SHOWER PAN YOURSELF  </P> <P> One of the most common repair problems in homes more than 15 years old is  leakage from a stall shower that results from cracks between the tiles or  defects in the waterproof material built up under the base tiles of the shower,  commonly called the "shower pan."  </P> <P> Most homeowners find themselves facing a repair bill for replacing the shower  pan of at least $750, and often much more if wall tiles need replacement as  well.  </P> <P> If you have been told that you need a shower pan or suspect you have a leak,  you may be able to fix it yourself in less than an hour, even if you are all  thumbs. Follow these simple steps:  </P> <P> Start by cleaning the shower with a scouring pad so that it is absolutely  spotless. Any soap residue or mildew stains must be removed completely. Let it  dry thoroughly for 36 hours.  </P> <P> From any paint or hardware store, buy a cartridge of clear silicone sealant.  Use G.E. Silicone II (which is almost odorless), Red Devil, Elmers, Dap or Dow  Corning. Also, buy a caulking gun for about $2.  </P> <P> Read and follow the basic safety instructions on the product, then insert the  cartridge into the gun and cut the tip of the cartridge nozzle about  three-eighth of an inch from the point. Insert a long nail into the hole to  puncture the inner seal.  </P> <P> Place the tip of the cartridge where the floor and wall tiles join at a grout  line. Gently squeeze the activator of the gun to force the silicone sealant  from the tip at a steady rate while moving the gun slowly across the grout  joint.  </P> <P> Continue applying a line of silicone about one-quarter-inch wide around the  entire base of the shower. Smooth the material into the grout with your index  finger, making sure there are no uneven or rough spots and that the grout is  completely covered. Wipe the material off your finger with a rag.  </P> <P> Repeat this procedure at every other grout joint in the shower where tile  surfaces join at an angle. Also, seal around the plumbing fixtures, soap holder  and at the tile-enclosure joint.  </P> <P> Now comes the key to successfully sealing the shower against leakage. Across  every grout line between the tiles themselves on the base of the shower and up  the walls about 30 inches, apply a thin coat of silicone sealant. Again, smooth  the material with a finger so that coverage is complete, and that's it!  </P> <P> Let the shower dry overnight before using it. Monitor the success of your work  by carefully observing plaster damage on walls near the shower for dampness or  further deterioration.  </P> <P> Sometimes a point of reference on the damaged plaster is helpful. Draw a pencil  line around the damaged area so you can tell if any new problems develop  outside the original line. Continue checking the plaster for three to four  weeks.  </P> <P> If water damage or moisture has been found under the house below the shower,  have the sub-area reinspected after one month of regular use of the shower.  </P> <P> If no further wall damage is seen, and if the sub-area of the house below the  shower is dry, you can presume that your efforts have paid off. If, however,  some moisture is still present or damage to the walls is continuing, don't give  up yet.  </P> <P> It is possible that tile is leaking at a point higher on the wall than 30  inches, and you should seal the remaining wall tiles up to 60 inches around the  shower.  </P> <P> When this process is successful, as it is most of the time, it saves a big  expense and major inconvenience.  </P> <P> Remember, though, that because of normal wear and shifting and settling of all  wood frame structures, new cracks may appear in the tile or grout and the  silicone may have to be touched up. As a rule, it should be inspected every  other month.  </P> <P> Prolong the life of the silicone sealant, though, by using only mild,  abrasive-free cleaning products in the shower.  </P></p>

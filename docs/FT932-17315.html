			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Sir Alastair plays the final hand in a giant game of poker - Andrew Taylor and Robert Peston examine who should pay for the soaring cost of a railway system linking England and France THE final hand in what Sir Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, likes to describe as a giant game of poker is being played. At stake is who should pay for the soaring cost of installing a railway system into the already completed tunnels which link terminals at Folkestone in Kent and Sangatte in northern France. The protagonists in this unfortunate game are Eurotunnel, led by the combative Sir Alastair, and Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction companies contracted to design and build the project. Transmanche, which has already been paid extra for building the tunnels and terminals, is seeking to increase the price it is paid for installing the fixed equipment. The work, priced originally at Pounds 620m at 1985 prices under a lump sum contract, was subsequently increased to Pounds 720m following variations to the contract. Transmanche says the cost has now risen to Pounds 1.4bn and wants to be paid in full. It blames Eurotunnel for the way in which it has introduced contract variations and design changes and says it will make no profit on the job. Eurotunnel last year offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn for the works, of which Pounds 900m was to be in cash and Pounds 300m in shares or some form of quasi equity. Contractors, themselves under pressure because of recession in the British and French construction industries, criticised conditions which prohibited them from immediately turning this paper into much needed cash. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman of Taylor Woodrow, the British construction group and a Transmanche shareholder, said on Tuesday: 'The Channel tunnel is a very difficult owner which frankly does not have the money to pay for what it is committed to do. We are not anxious to take equity. If we do, we want it to be saleable within a reasonable period of time and not something that will only benefit our grandchildren.' Both sides badly need an agreement. Eurotunnel cannot afford any further delay in the tunnel's opening date, which would severely damage revenue projections and increase the amount of extra cash it would need to raise from shareholders. Contractors need to settle because they could face a serious drain on their own depleted cash resources if they have to start funding the contract out of their own pockets. They also could face claims for damages if they fail to complete the contract on time. Both believe they hold the cards necessary to force a victory. Eurotunnel's confidence is based on: The fact that Transmanche shareholders, in the absence of a settlement, will have to start funding some of the cost themselves or stop work leaving them open to claims for damages. The construction companies could face claims for damages anyway, under the terms of the contract, if work is not completed by August 15. Damages could reach Pounds 240m in a full year. Conversely, says Sir Alastair, contractors will receive a payment of Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m on completion. The ability of contractors to damage the project, he says, has been lessened with the bulk of construction already completed. The first full size train ran through the tunnel on March 12. An arbitration ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce means that Transmanche will not be able to wrap up its demands for extra payments in an all-embracing claim but will have to justify individual elements separately. This will be difficult to do and could restrict the amount of money contractors receive to no more than Pounds 900m at 1985 prices, says Sir Alastair. He also argues that contractors, in the absence of a settlement, would be required by their auditors to make substantial provisions against potential losses on the contract when they announce their next annual results. Not surprisingly, British and French contractors perceive it differently. They see their strengths and Eurotunnel's weaknesses as: Contractors will need to co-operate closely with Eurotunnel during the commissioning and testing of the railway if the project's opening is not to be delayed even further. The disputes panel, established under the contract, is expected to rule on the dispute later this year. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, another Transmanche shareholder, says: 'The panel's decision is binding. If it finds in our favour, Eurotunnel physically will have to hand the money over while any appeal is considered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which could take some time.' Transmanche, as part of its claim, is seeking time extensions for the work of up to a year which, if successful, would inhibit Eurotunnel's ability to levy damages for late completion. It says that the recent arbitration ruling by the ICC was procedural and would have no bearing on the size and outcome of its claim, which was already being considered on a case-by-case basis by the disputes panel. Some Transmanche shareholders are already making provisions within their cash flow to fund the works while the conflict rolls on. Eurotunnel, meanwhile, is sticking to its planned opening date of December 15, although it says its could be either side of Christmas. Senior executives at Transmanche say privately that the opening cannot occur until March next year at the earliest and could be delayed until the summer. The eventual opening date may depend upon what settlement can be reached between Eurotunnel and Transmanche.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Afrikaners bury standard-bearer of apartheid: Old certainties are gone, with no new certainties emerging YESTERDAY in Pretoria, the Afrikaner capital, the white tribe gathered to bury one of the last standard-bearers of apartheid, Mr Andries Treurnicht, academic and theologian, right-wing politician and champion of Afrikanerdom. It was a subdued gathering, a manifestation of the confused and depressed state of Afrikaners, many of whom still cling to the teachings of the generation of Afrikaner churchmen epitomised by Mr Treurnicht, who died of heart failure last Thursday aged 72: that the Bible ordains apartheid, and that to violate it is to go against the will of God. In the Dutch Reformed Church and in nearby Church square, perched on folding chairs around the statue of Afrikanerdom's greatest hero, Paul Kruger, president of the 19th century Boer republic of the Transvaal, some 3,000 prayed for their departed leader. But their bowed heads seemed to symbolise more than religious devotion: old certainties were being buried, while no new certainties had emerged to take their place. 'He was the one that could save the Afrikaner,' said a bearded man ruefully, as he walked in sombre procession to the grave, in a cemetery where Mr Treurnicht's mentor, Hendrik Verwoerd, architect of apartheid, is also buried. 'We have got the muscles, we have got the belief, and we have got the Bible  -that's the most important thing,' said another mourner, carrying the four-colour flag of the oldTransvaal republic. For him, the God of Abraham had decreed racial mixing a sin, whatever has been done by the 'new' Afrikaners of Mr F W de Klerk's government to cleanse the statute book of racial discrimination. For these mourners were honouring a man whose ideology was intellectually powerful, although hideously flawed: last of a generation of conservatives who saw apartheid as a religion. They are left with leaders of a wholly different type: fanatics like Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, senior official of Mr Treurnicht's Conservative Party, who is expected soon to be charged in connection with the murder of black activist Mr Chris Hani; and Mr Eugene Terre'blanche, leader of the paramilitary Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement). Dressed in the 1960s fashions which still predominate in Pretoria, the matrons of Afrikanerdom standing beside husbands sang the anthem of the white tribe of Africa: Die Stem (the call). But it was a flat performance, with nothing like the passion and anger which suffused the anthem sung at the graveside of Mr Hani: Go Well, Umkhonto, militant hymn to a fallen warrior. Next to 100,000 black mourners filled with righteous fury, the scant 3,000 baffled souls who mourned Mr Treurnicht yesterday seemed only pitiful: they know they have lost the battle, but have yet to come to terms with the peace.</p>

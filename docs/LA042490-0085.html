			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAFFIC SLOWS FOR HARBOR FREEWAY PROJECT;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THERE WERE NO MAJOR TIE-UPS DUE TO START OF CONSTRUCTION FOR  BUS AND VAN DECK. BUT AN AFTERNOON ACCIDENT AND DRIZZLE FOULED THINGS UP.  </P> <P> Traffic on the Harbor Freeway was turned into a commuter's nightmare Monday  afternoon by an injury accident and the start of construction on a $55-million  overhead deck for the crowded roadway.  </P> <P> All morning, northbound traffic was slow-and-go because the heavy construction  work in the freeway's median, between Slauson Avenue and Martin Luther King  Boulevard, was attracting gawkers, but there were no major tie-ups, as had been  predicted.  </P> <P> Then -- as a giant crane began lowering a 70-ton steel casing into the first  foundation hole near 51st Street -- it started to drizzle, slowing northbound  traffic even more.  </P> <P> By 2 p.m., traffic on the southbound lanes also had slowed to a crawl through  the construction area because of an unrelated major injury accident near  Manchester Avenue, two miles south of the construction site.  </P> <P> It took nearly an hour for the crane to lift the 80-foot-long steel cage into  vertical position and drop it down the eight-foot-wide foundation hole. During  this time, traffic inched past, but once the cage was out of sight, things  returned to slow-and-go.  </P> <P> But despite the afternoon's congestion, California Department of Transportation  officials were pleased that the first day of work on the Harbor Transitway  Project had gone so smoothly. It will take several months to erect the 50 huge  Y-shaped pillars that will support the elevated bus and van pool transitway,  they said.  </P> <P> Some of Caltrans' own engineers had recommended against attempting to work  during daylight because moving the huge steel casings and the reinforcing steel  cages would "create havoc with the freeway traffic" and present a safety hazard  if one of the giant steel cages broke loose and fell across traffic lanes.  </P> <P> But top Caltrans officials rejected that recommendation and announced that the  contractor would be allowed to work during the day. They said the California  Highway Patrol would run traffic breaks whenever there was a chance that the  work could endanger motorists.  </P> <P> The original start date for the 2.6-mile decking phase of the project had been  April 16. But irate transportation experts from the city of Los Angeles, Mayor  Tom Bradley and Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) vigorously  protested the idea of shutting down the freeway at any time during daylight  hours.  </P> <P> Caltrans junked the traffic break idea and decided to go ahead without stopping  traffic during the daytime.  </P> <P> "This is the first real work in the median and we had some concerns about  working in such a tight area," said Dan Goble, Caltrans construction chief.  "The goal is to do the work without disrupting traffic too much . . . (and)  this morning's operation went smoothly."  </P> <P> Tom Conner, assistant general manager of the city transportation department,  agreed that traffic seemed to flow as well as could be expected Monday. There  seemed to be no extra cars on the nearby city streets, he said.  </P></p>

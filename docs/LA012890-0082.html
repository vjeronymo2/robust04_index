			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DISPATCHER KNOWS ADDRESS RIGHT OFF  </P> <P> Fire dispatcher Cornelia McDonough said she instantly knew the address of a  burning home when a man called to report a white house on fire at 16th and  Utica streets.  </P> <P> "I never dreamed I would have to send the fire trucks to my own house," she  said.  </P> <P> The fire last week heavily damaged most of the family's property and killed the  family dog.  </P> <P> "It was hurtful," McDonough said. "Tzar had been with us for 12 years. He was  part of the family. We all loved him."  </P> <P> McDonough remained on duty and took several more calls from her neighbors about  the fire before she was replaced.  </P> <P> Experience allowed her to remain composed while dispatching trucks to her own  home, she said.  </P> <P> "If I hadn't had the job of dispatcher so long, I might have become  hysterical," she said. "But when you are around this sort of thing all the time  -- dealing with people in emergency situations -- you learn to put your own  feelings on hold and just do your job."  </P></p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal paper brings SA back to market The first international equity offering for a South African company since the recent elections - Dollars 68m of N shares for Anglovaal - was three times oversubscribed. S. G. Warburg, the UK investment bank which was bookrunner for the underwriting group, described it as 'a landmark issue that bodes well for South Africa's future in the international capital markets'. Mr Basil Hersov, chairman of Anglovaal, a diversified industrial and mining group, said the placing 'has shown that premier institutions in Europe and the US are not just interested in learning more about the South Africa story but are also willing to take the step to invest'. About half the demand for the shares came from the US. In Europe the biggest demand came from fund managers in London and Edinburgh, said Mr Oliver Baring, a director of Warburg. French and other continental European investors were also interested. Mr Baring said Anglovaal was a good choice to open the South African market because it offered investors a broad range of interests under proven management. 'For many investors this was their first chance to buy a significant holding of South African stock since the political situation obliged them to divest in the 1980s,' he pointed out. The Anglovaal shares, to be listed in South Africa and London, were priced at Dollars 27.33 each share or American depositary receipt, which, when translated at the rand exchange rate at the time of pricing, represented R129. This compared with a closing bid price on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange of R130.</p>

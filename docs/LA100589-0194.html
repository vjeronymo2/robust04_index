			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY ASKS EXTENSION ON LAUREL ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> City officials have asked the county to extend for a month the deadline for  public comment on the Laguna Laurel planned community.  </P> <P> The public has until Oct. 14 to submit written arguments on the lengthly  environmental impact report that was released last month as part of plans to  transform a 2,105-acre rural canyon area along Laguna Canyon Road into a  3,200-home community.  </P> <P> City officials and community environmentalists have voiced strong opposition to  the project, which would be in the heart of the Laguna Greenbelt, a series of  rocky hills and canyons that surround the city.  </P> <P> City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said city officials want the extension so they  can study the voluminous impact report for possible legal action to block the  project, which is in the final stages of the permit process.  </P> <P> Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said that the  board is considering the request but that it will probably be denied.  </P> <P> He said, however, that a 15-day extension will most likely be approved.  </P> <P> After the deadline passes, the county Planning Commission is scheduled to  consider written arguments and schedule public hearings.  </P> <P> City officials have requested that the county hold one of the public hearings  in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> In another action, the City Council ordered that its staff erect a sign along  the proposed site to point out to motorists where the planned community would  be.  </P> <P> The council is also sponsoring a public walk through Laguna Canyon at 9 a.m.  Nov. 11.  </P></p>

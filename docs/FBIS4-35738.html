			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian  minister of planning and international cooperation, has accused  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of violating the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and said Rabin is  "bad-tempered."    Following his meeting with Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today, Sha'th said: We will not budge an  inch from our demand that Jerusalem be the Palestinian state's  eternal capital.    Sha'th criticized the Israeli authorities' closure of the  Gaza Strip, regarding this act as a violation of the clauses of  the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in form and substance.    He added: We are doing our utmost to implement the agreement  and avoid the Israeli authorities' provocations in the Jericho  area.    Addressing Rabin, Sha'th said the Palestinians will not  accept errors or tolerate them under any circumstances.    Sha'th urged the Arab League and Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to  continue their backing for the Palestinian National Authority  and the PLO. He remarked that the Palestinians need help for the  next five years, particularly in the political and economic  spheres.    Sha'th said he discussed with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid the Arab  League's role in the coming days. He specified this role as  moving on three fronts, involving in the first place continued  Arab backing for the Palestinians' legitimate rights, overcoming  any hurdles obstructing the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli Agreement, and assistance in handling the  still inscrutable Israeli position.    He added that Palestine is the only Arab country that  suffers  a total occupation of its territory, noting that Gaza and  Jericho are a first step but the remaining Palestinian  territories are still occupied.    Sha'th said the second front involves greater financial  assistance from the Arab funds and the third is political and  media backing for the Palestinian issue at international forums.    He announced that the negotiations with Israel will be  resumed very soon.</p>

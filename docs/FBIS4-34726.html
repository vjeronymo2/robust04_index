			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Government  reaffirmed today that the territories of Easter Island, a  Chilean possession of 160 square km located 3,600 km west of the  continent, whose inhabitants have been on indefinite strike  since 20 June, belong to the state.    The islanders, who make up a population of 2,800 people,  sued  the Chilean Government for the return of their land, which was  declared state property in 1933. They also want the electoral  law reformed to give them a deputy and a senator to represent  them in Congress.    The National Resources Ministry said today that "according  to  our legislation, and this has been recognized, the State of  Chile owns the territories that make up Easter Island."    Interior Minister German Correa said in Santiago that not  everyone in that community was on strike. He announced that an  official of the Regional Development Undersecretariat will  travel to the island in the next few days to examine the on-site  situation and report to officials.    About 18 months ago a group of islanders took over the  airfield at Mataveri Airport for several days, demanding more  flights of Lan-Chile, which is the only airline that flies to  the island, and protesting an airfare hike. This situation was  resolved with the mediation of Interior Ministry Under Secretary  Belisario Velasco.    Easter Island, which lives from tourism thanks to the 867  "moais" or giant statues spread over its territory, became  famous last year during the filming of the picture "Rapa Nui" by  U.S. actor Kevin Costner, who came to the island to direct the  film, in which 300 islanders worked as extras.</p>

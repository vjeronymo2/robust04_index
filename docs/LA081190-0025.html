			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM AT 11 . . . BUT RARELY ANY GOLF  </P> <P> I don't care who you are, anyone can join the Junior Golf Assn. or many U.S.  Golf Assn. golf clubs and get to play on the most private clubs where many  tournaments are held. I believe a private club is for people who want to be  together: Leave them alone.  </P> <P> The media are blowing this Shoal Creek situation way out of proportion compared  to other urgent needs, that is, to educate young blacks so that they can get  better jobs and economically have their own private clubs.  </P> <P> SANDY COHEN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

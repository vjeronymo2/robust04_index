			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, as a result of this allocation of Board membership, the realignment of districts or reapportionment of membership between Districts 1 and 2 on the basis of changes in production and importation would no longer be necessary. Such realignment or reapportionment would be inconsistent with the 1993 Act. Therefore, any references to such realignment or reapportionment would be removed from &sect;&sect;1212.18, 1212.30, and 1212.40 of the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reducing the size of the Board affects the current requirements for a quorum and the number of trustees which would be designated if the program were to be terminated. Therefore, this action would revise &sect;1212.37 of the Order to decrease from six to four the number of members needed to constitute a quorum at Board meetings and change the number of trustees designated in &sect;1212.84 of the Order from five to four.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1993 Act requires the appointments of the current Board members to be terminated. New appointments would then be made by the Secretary. The 1993 Act also specifies that the initial Board members under the amended Order would serve initial terms of office of 30 months. This change is directly related to the provision of the 1993 Act which delays the deadline for the initial referendum until 30 months after the date on which the collection of assessments begin under the amended Order. We are also proposing a conforming change in &sect;1212.67 of the Order pursuant to the 1993 provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide administrative continuity during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 months prior to the initial continuance referendum, the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office. The 1990 Act provided for the staggering of the terms of office of the initial Board members. Although staggered terms of office are generally desirable, this created a situation where 30 percent or more of the Board's membership could change prior to the initial referendum. In contrast, the 1993 Act provides that the initial Board members under the amended Order serve 30-month concurrent terms of office and that staggered terms be reinstituted after the referendum if the program continues. The purpose of this change is to minimize the organizational uncertainties associated with Board member turnover and to facilitate organizational continuity during the period prior to the initial referendum. Therefore, this action would also amend section 1212.34 of the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All written comments received in response to this publication by the date specified herein will be considered prior to any finalization of the proposed amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1212  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Advertising, Limes, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 1212 is proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1212_LIME RESEARCH, PROMOTION, AND CONSUMER INFORMATION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

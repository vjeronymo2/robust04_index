			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acatos Pounds 27m alliance with US agribusiness group Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oil and fat manufacturer, is forming a strategic relationship with Archer Daniels Midland, the US agribusiness group which supplies A&amp;H's biggest refinery in London's Docklands. ADM is injecting Pounds 27m into A&amp;H through buying 9.5m new shares in the UK group, representing 22.5 per cent of its enlarged equity. A&amp;H is also forming a 50-50 joint venture with the US group to build and operate an edible oil refinery and bottling and canning plant beside ADM's existing oil seed crushing plant at Erith in Kent. A&amp;H is the biggest supplier of own-label food oils and margarine in the UK, with about a 30 per market share. The new investment will enable it to become one of the lowest cost producers in Europe. It has long wanted to link with an international company as a step to expanding beyond the UK, and this is an objective the ADM link would achieve, said Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman and chief executive. ADM is one of the largest agricultural products companies in the world with 165 operating plants. Some Pounds 14m of the subscription proceeds will be used to pay for A&amp;H's share of the costs of building the refinery and the bottling and canning plant and for the redevelopment of A&amp;H's existing facilities to concentrate hard oil refining at Orchard Place, in London's Docklands. A further Pounds 10m will be used for the construction of the new packing factory at Orchard Place. ADM is subscribing for shares at 288p, the level at which they closed before the deal was first flagged in August. A&amp;H's shares yesterday closed 1p lower at 289p. A&amp;H also announced that agreement has been reached for a reconstruction of the 38 per cent shareholding in the group currently controlled by Acatos Limited, a private company which owns the shares previously owned by Mr Hutcheson, his family and other parties. A&amp;H will acquire the entire share capital of Acatos in exchange for new shares in the group. After the reconstruction and ADM's subscription, the Hutcheson family trusts will own 17.7 per cent of the group's enlarged share equity and Mr Hutcheson will own 8.3 per cent.</p>

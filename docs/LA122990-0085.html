			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: A BREAK FROM A CAREER AS A PSYCHO: A 'NORMAL' ROLE FOR BRAD DOURIF  </P> <P> Since his Oscar-nominated turn as mental patient Billy in 1975's "One Flew Over  the Cuckoo's Nest," Brad Dourif has made a career playing offbeat characters.  </P> <P> He was a psycho anarchist in "Ragtime," a psycho bigot in "Mississippi  Burning," and a psycho inhabited by the devil in "The Exorcist III." He also  was the voice of the psycho doll Chucky in "Child's Play" and "Child's Play 2."  </P> <P> Dourif finally gets to play a regular guy in "Hidden Agenda," the acclaimed  political thriller set in Belfast, Northern Ireland. "It was nice to be chosen  to do that -- play someone normal. For some reason they wanted me."  </P> <P> Dourif portrays American attorney Paul Sullivan, a member of the International  League for Civil Liberties, who is murdered when he meets a man who has  damaging evidence against the British.  </P> <P> "We shot for three days in Northern Ireland," he says. "I was impressed by a  lot of things there."  </P> <P> Especially the graffiti art. "It is the the most impressive I have ever seen,"  Dourif says. "Murals cover both sides of buildings. Some had writing on them.  It was pretty esoteric."  </P> <P> "Hidden Agenda" marks the fourth film in which Dourif has appeared this year.  "They (movies) come in spurts," he says. "There was a point I was doing three  movies at the same time. It was pretty intense."  </P> <P> Dourif doesn't think "Hidden Agenda" will change his image: "Sooner or later, I  will do something that somebody will take a chance on me. You have to teach the  industry."  </P> <P> Now 40, Dourif says that he wasn't ready for the success of "Cuckoo's Nest":  "It certainly changed my career and my life enormously. But I wasn't prepared.  It scared me a lot. I didn't have a good time. I didn't know how to handle it.  Some people are really equipped to be successful and some are not. Now, I would  be delighted."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/6/1994 -- The Romanian  Foreign Ministry welcomes the Russian Federation's decision to  join in the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] scheme and  appreciates this political act to be a significant contribution  to the consolidation of a climate of security and stability,  told a news conference the Foreign Ministry spokesman on 22 June.    From this angle, the Romanian diplomat added, the Foreign  Ministry has made some points in connection with certain  statements regarding the granting to the Russian Federation of a  special status within the Partnership for Peace: the  discriminatory character of the partnership was to Romania the  main argument to accept this initiative.    "Our country", the spokesman added, "along with the other  states, is aware of the importance of the Russian Federation's  role in ensuring stability and security in Europe and considers  it natural that the relation of cooperation between the NATO and  Russia should materialize in an individual, substantive and  comprehensive program of partnership that should reflect  Russia's status, importance, ability and wish to help in  attaining the partnership participants' common objectives.  However, this relation must not alter the prime requisite of  equality among the states participating in the partnership. In  this context, the Romanian Foreign Ministry considers that the  specific contribution the Russian Federation can make to  security and stability in Europe, by developing constructive  relations with the North-Atlantic Alliance can be fully  reflected in the Partnership for Peace."    As announced by the Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs of Romania, the premier of the State Council of the  People's Republic of China, Li Peng, will be on an official  visit in Romania over 9-12 July to examine with the host country  the present stage and the prospects for the development of the  friendship and cooperation relations between China and Romania,  and to sign a number of documents, such as the joint declaration  on the friendship and cooperation relations between Romania and  the People's republic of China, economic, commercial and  cultural agreements.    Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu will be in Warsaw on 23  and  24 June for an official visit, and on 28 June he will be in  London for a working visit in Great Britain.</p>

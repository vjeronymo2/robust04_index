			<p>BFN     [Text] A second plane landed in Belgium with refugees from  Rwanda this morning around 0730 [0530 GMT]. It carried more  than 200 refugees, most of them Belgian, as well as 10 Rwandans  and around 20 Dutch. All of the passengers were transported to  the military hospital in Neder-Over-Heembeek, where they were  welcomed by Princess Astrid. A third plane with 400 refugees is  expected to arrive this afternoon around 1515. Nearly 450  Belgians have returned from Rwanda thus far. Last night a first  plane arrived with 200 evacuees, while 12 Belgians reached the  country last night via Koln and seven others via Paris.    According to the Army's information service, the rescue  operation is generally proceeding as planned. The evacuation  normally should last three to four days. The paratroopers are  concentrating today on Kigali, where a few hundred Belgians are  waiting to be evacuated. The operation is being hampered,  however, by gangs, mainly composed of Rwandan Army soldiers,  engaged in looting and killing. Meanwhile, rebels of the  Rwandan Patriotic Front reportedly are approaching the capital.  All together some 1,000 Belgians remain in Rwanda, but it is  not clear how many of those want to be evacuated.</p>

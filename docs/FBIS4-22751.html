			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martins Kibilds: "`Accord' to Split into Two </F> Factions"]    [Text] Riga, March 18. Today, the board of the People's  Accord Party, which had been led by Janis Jurkans, adopted a  resolution on the creation of separate Saeima factions.  Saturday, the other "Accord" group of deputies -- the Economists  Union, led by Edvins Kide, will hold a founding meeting, which  will likewise resolve to create its faction.    Next week, J.Jurkans and his followers will sign a statement  announcing the formation of the faction and present it to the  Saeima Board of Officers. Accordingly, already next week, in  place of the current faction Accord for Latvia, there will be  two independent factions in the Saeima.    The People's Accord Party (PAP) faction will have four  deputies -- J. Jurkans (faction chairman), Ludmila Kuprijanova,  Igors Bukovskis and Andris Ameriks. The founding document of the  Economists Union (EU) faction was signed by seven deputies -- E.  Kide (chairman of the former Accord faction and, apparently, of  the new faction), Vilnis Bresis, Irene Folkmane, Juris Janeks,  Janis Lucans, Leonards Stass, and Jevgenijs Zascerinskis. Two  deputies -- Ernests Jurkans and Eriks Kaza, who, in their  voting, have not infrequently shown their support for the ruling  coalition, have not joined with any of the potential factions  for now, but if they do join, it will probably be the PAP.    The first signs of a split in the election union of Accord  for Latvia -- Rebirth of the Economy, which shortened its name  in the Saeima to Accord for Latvia (AL), were already evident in  the fall of last year.    Differences in the viewpoints of the factions did not permit  the formation of a unified political party, although the AL  deputies promised that they would remained united at least in  the Saeima. Even though both sides are still keeping alive the  idea of the formation of a united voting bloc, which would be  permissible in accordance with the Saeima's rules of order,  neither of the sides is exhibiting any particular enthusiasm.    "We could create something similar to the National bloc, but  we can already see that the effect of such a bloc is doubtful,"  admitted J. Jurkans in a conversation with DIENA. When the other  leader -- E. Kide, was asked whether the formation of the bloc  was a reality, he told DIENA: "We will take a look at the other  side's position. At present, such a development is not out of  the question".    The main reasons for the split according to J. Jurkans were  the other side's inconsistent policies, the realization of the  pre-election program, and he was particularly embittered about  E. Kide joining the ruling coalition in the projected  citizenship law. E. Kide, in turn, is more at ease and feels  that there are no main differences in opinion between PAP and  EU, although their programs differ primarily in "nuances". He  does admit, however, that these "nuances" do not permit the  Accord unity to exist.    Despite the split of the third largest faction in the  Saeima,  which is the first largest since the election, the overall  political picture in the parliament will not change -- and both  J. Jurkans and E. Kide are in agreement on this. Neither of the  new factions sees any reason to change its present viewpoint and  show more favor towards the ruling coalition.</p>

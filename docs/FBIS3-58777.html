At the meeting, all participants agreed that  Turkey -- as a European country -- needs to get closer to the  continent's political, economic, security and defense structure.    The British and German foreign ministers met at the Foreign  Ministry this morning. The talks continued over luncheon as  well. [passage omitted]    Foreign Ministers Hikmet Cetin, Hurd, and Kinkel held a  joint  news conference after the tripartite meeting.    Cetin said furthering bilateral relations was discussed and  views were exchanged on international and regional issues at  this first meeting, which is part of the consultative mechanisms  that have been set up. He added all participants shared the  view that Turkey -- as a European country -- needs to get closer  to the continent's political, economic, security and defense  structure. The post-cold war reality was discussed and Cetin  added that they have realized that the initial optimistic  expectations have not materialized. He continued:    [Begin Cetin recording] The most prominent examples are the  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Balkans and the problems  between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Caucasus. We, therefore,  assessed the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the developments in  the Balkans. We assessed what we can do to solve the problems  in the Caucasus and the problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia.  We assessed how Armenia can withdraw from Azerbaijani territory  and the problem can be solved through peaceful means as soon as  possible. We further assessed that this problem should be  solved within the framework of the Minsk group. [end recording]    Cetin said Turkey is fighting against terror within the  framework of democracy and the laws, adding that the visiting  ministers were told of Turkey's determination on the issue. He  noted that Turkey is at a turning point in its struggle against  terror and that the support to be extended by its European  friends is most important.    Speaking at the news conference, Hurd said Turkey's  importance and role in the international arena has increased in  recent years. Noting that Turkey has significant experience in  the region, Hurd added that they found the opportunity to  benefit from this experience during the talks. He noted that  Turkey's political, economic and security relations with Europe  were discussed at the talks, stressing that a rapprochement  among the policies of the participants was achieved.    Kinkel said Turkey constitutes a bridge between Europe and  Asia and the Christian and Muslim worlds. Pointing out that  this role increases the importance of the rapprochement between  Turkey and Europe, Kinkel added that his country is extending  every possible support on the issue.    In reply to a question by a Turkish Radio and Television  correspondent on establishing an independent state in northern  Iraq, Kinkel said: We do not want any change in the region. We  are not in favor of border changes. We are in favor of Iraq's  territorial integrity and the preservation of the current border.</p>

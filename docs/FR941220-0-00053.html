This determination is based upon the best available biological information. When the Service first learned of the occurrence of the undescribed Cherokee darter, a narrowly distributed and potentially imperilled fish in the Etowah River system, a survey was funded to determine its status. That survey was initiated during the fall of 1989. The following summer, the Etowah darter was determined to be a distinct and highly localized species, and the survey continued for both darters until 1992. When information was obtained on the population status and distribution of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter sufficient to support federal listing of these species, a rule was proposed to afford them protection under the Act. The timing of the proposed rule to list these two fishes was therefore coincidental with any proposed construction projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters questioned the extent of the status survey for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter and the possibility that other area streams may harbor populations of these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From the fall of 1989 to summer 1992, a survey of the Etowah River system was funded by the Service to determine the population status and total distribution of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter (see response to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above). A total of 146 collections at 141 sites throughout the Etowah River system were made for these two fish. Although sites outside the Etowah River system were not surveyed for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, the Service believes that the fish faunas in surrounding drainages are adequately known to assure that these two darters are not present. The discovery of additional populations of one or both species within the Etowah River system is possible. However, based on the extensive status survey conducted for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, the Service believes no further surveys are warranted before listing these species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters were concerned with the potential economic impact that this listing proposal might have on completion of the proposed Yellow Creek Reservoir project, and one commenter had the same concerns regarding the proposed Atlanta beltway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is required by the Act to use the best available biological information in the assessment of determining whether Federal protection under the Act is warranted for a species. The economic impacts resulting from endangered species protection are not to be considered when proposing to list a species under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species (see the ``Available Conservation Measures'' section of this rule and the response to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> below). The Corps has consulted with the Service regarding the potential effects this federally permitted reservoir project might have on the amber darter, which occurs in the Etowah River mainstem both upstream and downstream of the Yellow Creek confluence. The County conducted a study addressing issues pertaining to the amber darter and its habitat and has made modifications to the dam that should minimize any impacts upon this federally endangered fish. The Service is currently in conference with the Corps regarding the dam's potential impacts upon the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. As mentioned elsewhere (see response to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above), the habitat requirements of the Etowah darter are similar to that of the amber darter. The design changes of the proposed dam that addressed the amber darter may possibly also protect the Etowah darter and its habitat. However, the Cherokee darter, which has a population in Yellow Creek very near the dam site, has different environmental requirements. The County has proven that it was willing to work with the Corps and the Service in addressing issues related to the amber darter. The Service commends these efforts by the County, and is confident that a similar agreement can be reached for Cherokee darter issues. The Service's Brunswick, Georgia, Field Office is currently working with the Corps and County to resolve specific issues relating to the Cherokee darter. Additionally, for the proposed Atlanta beltway project, the Federal Highway Administration must consult with the Service's Brunswick Field Office regarding potential impacts to the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter during the planning and construction phases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested the Service prepare a ``takings analysis'' under Executive Order 12630 that assesses the impacts of the listing of the Cherokee darter and the Etowah darter on private property rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Attorney General has issued guidelines to the Department of the Interior (Department) on the implementation of Executive Order 12630: Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights. Under these guidelines, a special rule applies when an agency within the Department is required by law to act solely upon specified criteria that leave the agency no discretion. In enacting the Act, Congress required the Department to list species based solely upon scientific and commercial data indicating whether they are in danger of extinction. The Service is prohibited by law from withholding a listing based on concerns regarding economic impact and is required to act, with appropriate public notice, under strict time tables. Any failure to comply may subject the agency to legal action. Accordingly, the provisions of the Attorney General's guidelines relating to nondiscretionary actions clearly are applicable to the determination of threatened status for the Cherokee darter and endangered status for the Etowah darter, and Taking Implication Assessments under Executive Order 12630 cannot be considered in making this administrative decision. Since the Act precludes consideration of economic factors during the listing process, the Service's policy is to not consider taking implications at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

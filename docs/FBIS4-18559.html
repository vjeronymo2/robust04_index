			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivier Provost: "Arms Exports: Substantial </F> Drop Likely in 1994"]    [Text] French weapons exports totaled 45 billion French  francs [Fr] in 1993, a figure close to the 1992 record. This  year, however, the government fears that such exports may fall  to Fr30 billion.    The official figure for French weapons exports in 1993 has  not been disclosed yet. Reliable sources estimate it to be  "approximately Fr45 billion." In 1992, Fr50 billion worth of  French weapons were sold abroad, the best performance since  1984. Last year's figure includes the Fr21 billion in revenues  from the sale of 390 Leclerc tanks (GIAT [Industrial Group for  Ground Wepons] Industries) and 46 tow trucks to the United Arab  Emirates in February. Another Fr2.8 billion came from the sale  of 17 Cougar helicopters to the Netherlands and another 20 to  Turkey [Cougars are made by Eurocopter, which is owned by  Aerospatiale (70 percent) and DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] (30  percent)]. A number of smaller contracts made up the balance.  <H5>  Due to a Number of Diplomatic Choices </H5>   However, the government takes small comfort in this  relatively satisfactory performance, as it believes the current  year may turn out to be a very disappointing one. According to  an expert, the initial hope of seeing French sales reach the  Fr60-billion mark by year end has now been superseded by a more  pessimistic forecast: that of a final figure hovering around an  abysmal Fr30 billion. This is due to a number of diplomatic  choices, such as the defense agreement entered into with Israel  in the midst of the international talks on the occupied  territories, which is said to have infuriated Arab countries.  Another such choice is Paris' decision to turn its back to  Taiwan in the hope of regaining China's favors.    To this must be added some rumored commercial blunders on  the  part of France, among others the underestimation of competition  and weak financial arrangements.    On 17 November 1993, French Defense Minister Francois  Leotard  stated the following in an interview with LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES:  "I think we should exceed 1992's figure of Fr50 billion in 1994  and possibly even in 1995." In early January, Mr. Leotard's  ministry still saw things in this light. Today, such rather  overoptimistic hopes have been deflated. In Sweden, the Leclerc  tank has lost out to Germany's Leopard (Krauss Maffei) in a bid  for 120 units worth Fr4.3 billion.    Matra's Mica missile is in danger of being sidelined by the  American Amraam missile and British Aerospace's Active Skyflash  in the race to provide Stockholm with 500 airborne missile worth  Fr2.8 billion. In Pakistan, as part of a competition for three  submarines worth Fr3.5 billion, Sweden's Kockums corporation is  proving a dangerous competitor for France's shipbuilding  industry. Abu Dhabi still has not bought the 10 or so Mirage  2000-5 fighter aircraft Dassault thought it would, and Pakistan  has bought no additional aircraft either. Saudi Arabia may well  postpone until 1995 payment of all or part of the Fr9 billion  relating to the three large maintenance contracts it recently  entered into with France; and it has not yet decided to purchase  the three French antiaircraft frigates worth Fr20 billion.    Last, Taiwan is now keeping its distance [following the  rapprochement with the PRC], although the island was expected to  purchase weapon systems worth Fr10 billion for its six  French-made frigates, as well as 300 armored vehicles made by  Renault Vehicules Industriels (Fr1.2 billion), and Fr2.5  billion's worth of Roland missiles (jointly made by Aerospatiale  and DASA), not to mention another 60 Mirage aircraft in a more  distant future.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ricardo chief quits after pressure from directors MR ROGER Smedley has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Ricardo International, the engineering design group, after pressure from non-executive directors. He will be receiving compensation, although the amount is yet to be negotiated. The company stressed that Mr Smedley's departure did not reflect any worsening in group trading, which was satisfactory, although conditions were difficult. Mr Christopher Ross, who joined the group in November 1990 and heads one of the main subsidiaries, will take over as chief executive. Sir Philip Foreman, a non-executive director for the past six years, is the new chairman. Mr Matthew Thorne, recruited in May 1991, remains as finance director. Mr Ross and Mr Thorne said yesterday that there had been concern over Mr Smedley combining the two roles, and differences of view over the direction of the company had arisen. Mr Smedley became executive chairman in 1990, when Ricardo merged with SAC International, the company which he co-founded in 1961. He was appointed chief executive in July last year, but the combination of the roles had not worked, Ricardo said. Rather than attempt to split the roles again a clean break was agreed. Mr Smedley, 57, has a three-year contract at an annual Pounds 108,000. However, it is thought his compensation will be less than three times his salary. The group now has two executive and two non-executive directors. Further appointments will be made in due course.</p>

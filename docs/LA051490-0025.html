			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> It's a Fake!: Some art connoisseurs in Canada's New Brunswick province are  red-faced after finding out that their prized pieces are fakes.  </P> <P> Gregg Robert Galbraith pleaded guilty to peddling as many as 200 forgeries to  unsuspecting buyers, including the New Brunswick Museum, over a three-year  period. Police said Galbraith bought paintings by unknown artists at sales in  Montreal and Toronto for about $85, then forged the signatures or initials of  celebrated maritime artists such as A. Y. Jackson, Jack Humphrey and Violet  Gillett. He then sold the paintings through two reputable auctioneers for as  much $3,420 each, netting $88,035 on the scam.GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

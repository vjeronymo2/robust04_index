			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Ishaq al-Farhan, secretary general of the  Islamic Action Front [IAF], has denied any link between the  Islamic movement and the weapons and explosives that the  newspapers said were found recently by the security forces in a  village in al-Karak Governorate.    Answering a question by AKHIR KHABAR on the link between the  weapons and the Muslim Brotherhood, Dr. al-Farhan said: You can  ask the Muslim Brotherhood about this.    But, he added: This is silly, making connections between  what is taking place and the Islamic movement. Those who fight  to protect the nation's unity do not seek to divide it from  within.    He said: We have not ruled out the involvement of the Mosad  [Israeli intelligence service] or the anti-Islamic forces, which  are trying to shake our national unity and undermine the bridges  of confidence on which basis we have been serving the homeland  and nation for decades.    He also said: We spoke to officials and explained our open  position toward these issues. Everyone knows the movement's  Islamic, nationalist, and pan-Arab positions.    Recent press reports on the al-Karak weapons cache cited a  link between the Islamic Centers Society, one of the most  important Muslim Brotherhood establishments, and the weapons  that were discovered.</p>

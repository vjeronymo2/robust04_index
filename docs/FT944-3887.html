			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: The elixir of Modena - 'In an attic holy of holies, the full-blooded aroma revived me' Modena, less than 40km north-west of Bologna, is extraordinarily rich. The personal wealth of its inhabitants has earned it the soubriquet 'mink city'. This is Luciano Pavarotti's home town. The Ferrari factory is nearby. The place fizzes with fashion shops, tottering high heels, couture and indeed with fur coats. But Modena is also a university town and the coffee bars buzz as much with animated student discussion as with society chatter. Some streets are colonnaded, there are little squares and spacious squares, peaceful gardens and an 11th-century cathedral of great beauty. Gastronomically, Modena exhibits signs of gutsy extravagance. Favourite local specialities include two of Emilia's richest and stickiest pork products - cotechino, a boiling sausage laced with gelatinous pork rind, and zampone, stuffed pigs' trotters. Both make wonderful winter warmers served with pulses and maybe a zabaglione sauce flavoured with that other great local creation - balsamic vinegar. Real balsamic vinegar is labelled tradizionale to distinguish it from the offerings of commerce, which can only hint at the remarkable character of the real thing. It may be 70 years old and will probably have lost two-thirds of its volume in the making. Made from the cooked must of sweet Trebbiano grapes, mixed with strong wine vinegar, it is aged at length in attics where hot summers evaporate it and cold winters help to clarify it, using a succession of barrels made from different woods for subtle extra fragrance. High in an attic holy of holies, the full-blooded aroma of it revived me from climbing the stairs. The texture was as heavy as molasses. The complex, velvety, sweet-sour taste exploded in my mouth, filled it and lingered dramatically. Just one whiff, just one lick of a drop laid on my forefinger made me understand what all the fuss is about and why one might be asked to pay up to Pounds 60 for a small phial of it.</p>

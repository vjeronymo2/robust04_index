			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW DEAL FELL APART;  </P> <P> UEBERROTH'S STRIKEOUT AT EASTERN  </P> <P> It was 8:55 a.m. on April 10, and Peter Ueberroth hadn't slept all night. But  as he arrived at National Airport, he wore a smile because he thought he had  just pulled off one of the most dramatic business deals in U.S. history.  </P> <P> He bought a ticket on the Pan Am shuttle to New York's LaGuardia Airport. He  had only a raincoat over his shoulder, a small, blue canvas tote bag and the  clothes on his back, including his lucky red and gray tie.  </P> <P> "Where are you going after New York -- back to Washington or out to  California?" Ueberroth was asked as he rode up an escalator to the boarding  gate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confident Reply  </P> <P> "No," he said confidently. "I'll be going to Miami."  </P> <P> Miami is the headquarters of bankrupt, strikebound Eastern Airlines, and  Ueberroth had just spent the night hammering out arrangements to become its new  owner. He planned to fly down that afternoon and celebrate with its  hard-pressed employees.  </P> <P> But as soon as the former baseball commissioner got to New York, someone threw  him a curve ball -- one that not even he could hit.  </P> <P> In the end, the profound distrust that had built up over the years between  Eastern's managers and its workers proved impossible to overcome, even with a  bankruptcy judge swinging a club and a bona fide hero of the 1980s rushing to  the rescue. And Ueberroth's private doubts about the airline ultimately blocked  a last-ditch compromise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Array of the Elite  </P> <P> More than just another corporate buyout, the Eastern-Ueberroth drama was an  especially rich tale whose cast of characters came to include a remarkable  array of America's political, corporate, and sports elite.  </P> <P> And its collapse had implications that went well beyond the pocketbooks of the  airline's shareholders. At the least, it meant that the vast majority of  Eastern's fleet of airplanes would remain grounded for weeks to come as one of  the most important strikes of the decade dragged on.  </P> <P> The deal's demise also dashed the hopes of thousands of striking, picketing or  laid-off employees that they would soon be back to work as part owners of  Eastern. And it increased the risk that the venerable airline would vanish  altogether, its pieces sold off one by one.  </P> <P> Ueberroth's plan to buy Eastern was a captivating one. It would have joined the  highly successful engineer of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, a man who went on  to restore power and direction to the office of baseball commissioner, with a  history-laden airline mired in one of the nation's most bitter labor-management  disputes since World War II.  </P> <P> A cartoon in the newspaper USA Today depicted Ueberroth as Superman swooping in  to carry the beleaguered airline to safety.  </P> <P> So what happened?  </P> <P> Little of the episode took place in public, but several of the key participants  agreed to tell the story, in many cases on the condition that they not be  identified.  </P> <P> The story had its roots in a previous era at Eastern that ended in early 1986,  when the airline's unions ousted Frank Borman, the former astronaut who was  Eastern's chairman, enabling Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. to buy Eastern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> March 4 Walkout  </P> <P> Since then, Lorenzo and Eastern's unions have been perpetually at war. The  battles culminated in a March 4 walkout by the machinists that has been honored  by the pilots and flight attendants, grounding 90% of Eastern's flights.  </P> <P> Likewise, Ueberroth's flirtation with Eastern goes back a couple of years to  the day when, Lorenzo says, he tried to hire Ueberroth to run the airline. But  apparently, Ueberroth had bigger things in mind. As his baseball job wound  down, Ueberroth met several of Eastern's union leaders at his office in  November. Nothing came directly of the meeting except that Ueberroth handed out  some autographed World Series baseballs.  </P> <P> But during the first week in March, at baseball meetings in Ft. Lauderdale, he  discussed Eastern with Carl Pohlad, the owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball  club and a member of Texas Air's board. Pohlad had been prodding Lorenzo to  sell Eastern and was a fan of Ueberroth.  </P> <P> On March 14, Ueberroth called his good friend and golfing partner, J. Thomas  Talbot, who lives in Newport Beach. Talbot, 53, and Ueberroth, 51, had been  friends for a decade and both men had plenty of travel industry experience.  </P> <P> "Come to New York," implored Ueberroth, who had only 17 more days as the czar  of major league baseball. Talbot was on the next plane.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cast of Specialists  </P> <P> Ueberroth also lined up a cast of specialists that included attorney Robert J.  Rosenberg, an expert on bringing companies out of bankruptcy, and ex-pilot and  Pan Am vice-chairman Martin Shugrue, who had the twin virtues of being a pilots  union member and having once been fired by Lorenzo.  </P> <P> The next morning, Ueberroth -- still baseball commissioner -- and Talbot went  to Texas Air Corp.'s Rockefeller Center offices for the first of several days  of meetings in which Ueberroth shuttled between Texas Air and the baseball  commissioner's office five blocks away in mid-town Manhattan.  </P> <P> A Ueberroth confidant likened the talks to a scene from a "Sesame Street" story  where one of the characters, Bert, is trying to get his friend Ernie to take a  bath:  </P> <P> "Ernie keeps asking for more things to be put in the tub before he'll take a  bath . . . a duck, a boat. . . . He'd say he was ready, then it would be one  more thing. . . . It was the same with Lorenzo. It was always one more thing.  Peter was angry and frustrated in this period." Lorenzo declined to discuss the  negotiations.  </P> <P> At one point, Ueberroth got some unsolicited advice on the deal from an old  friend, Beverly Hills junk bond king Michael Milken.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keep Talks Alive  </P> <P> Several times, baseball owner Pohlad had to intervene to keep talks alive. One  such occasion was when Ueberroth's $464-million offer was exceeded by Chicago  hotel magnate Jay A. Pritzker, said a Ueberroth associate.  </P> <P> "We're history," said a disgusted Ueberroth, declaring the deal was kaput. He  spent his last day as baseball commissioner on March 31 and returned with  Talbot to Newport Beach to play golf.  </P> <P> Pohlad tracked them down and persuaded them to return to New York for more  talks by telling them the Pritzker offer was soft.  </P> <P> The deal headed toward the ditch again on April 5, leading Pohlad to initiate a  90-minute one-on-one meeting of Lorenzo and Ueberroth at the Boardroom, a  private lunch club on Park Avenue. This time they got the deal buttoned up.  </P> <P> At a hastily called press conference at the Summit Hotel April 6, it was  announced to the world that Ueberroth would pay $463.9 million for the ailing  carrier and the employes would own one-third of his new company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1 Billion in Concessions  </P> <P> But the deal was subject to Ueberroth's ability to bring back by midnight on  April 11 an agreement with Eastern's three unions that was satisfactory to him  and to Lorenzo -- namely, about $1 billion in wage and benefit concessions over  five years.  </P> <P> The talks moved to Washington, where Ueberroth and Talbot had an informal  get-together with the key union leaders and their aides at Gary's, a favorite  restaurant of a machinists leader. Several unionists came away from the  gathering with the feeling that they knew considerably more about Eastern than  Ueberroth and Talbot did. They were right.  </P> <P> The Californians had a recent cram course on the carrier, while the unionists  had been living and breathing Eastern's books and operations for years. In  fact, the unions had been attempting to find a buyer for Eastern for some time  and tried to entice Carl C. Icahn, TWA's chairman, to buy it. The company had  lost more than $500 million in two years.  </P> <P> The unions' search for a buyer showed not only how much they despised Lorenzo,  but how the unions had redefined their roles in recent years.  </P> <P> These were not the heavy-handed men of movie newsreels of the 1930s. Many of  them wore gray suits. And the pilots and machinists employed sophisticated  financial advisers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ran Chrysler Bailout  </P> <P> They included Farrell Kuper-smith, an impeccably dressed managing partner at  Touche Ross, the big accounting firm; Brian Freeman, a fast-talking  Harvard-educated lawyer who ran President Jimmy Carter's Chrysler bailout  program, and Randy Barber, Dartmouth-educated, cowboy-booted co-author of a  1978 book about how unions could increase their power through more adroit use  of their pension funds.  </P> <P> But in addition to expert partisans in the Lorenzo, Ueberroth and union camps,  there was an indirect but powerful third party to the talks: federal Judge  Burton R. Lifland, who has handled the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case Eastern filed  five days after the strike started.  </P> <P> A bombastic sort in the courtroom who had handled such major bankruptcies as  Manville Corp. and LTV Corp., Lifland had declared Eastern Airlines a "national  asset" that needed to be saved. To that end, he named 60-year-old David I.  Shapiro as a special examiner in the case.  </P> <P> On Friday, April 7, the day after Ueberroth's deal was announced in New York,  many of the key players convened in the offices of the machinists union on  Connecticut Avenue in Washington. Shapiro took control.  </P> <P> "Shapiro was in a way like Patton," said one union source.  </P> <P> A Brooklyn native, Shapiro had started practicing law 40 years ago in a small  office above a delicatessen on New York's Upper West Side. His early clients  included prostitutes, union members and hundreds of citizens accused of  disloyalty during the McCarthy era. Today, he is a senior partner in a  high-powered Washington law firm whose other partners include Leonard Garment,  counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon and one-time National Security  Adviser Robert C. McFarlane.  </P> <P> Judge Lifland said he wanted a "head banger" to get Eastern flying again, and  the brawny Shapiro filled the bill. He gave the unions 2 1/2 days to reach an  agreement with Ueberroth, touching off a round-the-clock bargaining session  among several dozen negotiators from the three unions, the bankruptcy court and  the Ueberroth camp.  </P> <P> Though Ueberroth was promising something the unions had wanted for years --  part-ownership of Eastern -- the union leaders had their doubts about the  smooth-talking former travel agent.  </P> <P> Primarily, they weren't sure if Ueberroth's plan was economically viable. They  were concerned that it would burden Eastern with too much debt and that he was  giving away too many valuable assets to Texas Air.  </P> <P> Others noted that Lorenzo had once tried to hire Ueberroth and that he was the  only potential purchaser Lorenzo had been willing to deal with, while  stiff-arming Icahn. To some, Ueberroth was Lorenzo's "designated hitter" and  that made them nervous. However, as time went on the unions increasingly  trusted Ueberroth.  </P> <P> And as soon as the meetings started Friday in Washington, Shapiro made it clear  there was "a deal out there and we had to accept it," one union source said.  "He also said we had to forget about Icahn." Shapiro also warned the unions  about tinkering with the Ueberroth-Lorenzo deal because that might prompt  Lorenzo "to walk away from the deal."  </P> <P> On Saturday, Ueberroth flew off to Beverly Hills to speak at Drexel Burnham's  elaborate annual "junk bond" conference while the bargainers met at machinists  headquarters in Washington. Ueberroth returned that night in time to pick up  the dinner tab at Gary's.  </P> <P> On Sunday morning, Shapiro locked them all in his warren-like law offices until  6 a.m. Monday. To avoid leaks, he banned phone calls unless a secretary  listened in. Deli food was brought in for lunch, Chinese for dinner.  </P> <P> While an accord was being hammered out on hundreds of complex matters, a  simpler -- but more emotional and ultimately pivotal -- issue could only be  resolved by Judge Lifland. That was the question of who would run Eastern  between the time a deal was struck and the transaction was finally closed,  which could take months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lorenzo Ouster Demanded  </P> <P> The union leaders demanded that Lorenzo be ousted immediately -- a move that  the court could accomplish by naming a trustee to temporarily run the airline.  </P> <P> Looking back at the long weekend in Washington, the unionists say Shapiro gave  them the impression that they would not have to go back to work under Lorenzo.  That was critical. In fact, they called this a no-compromise "deal point."  </P> <P> Indeed, Harry Jones, the top New York bankruptcy court official, was at the  sessions and drafted the paper work for the appointment of a trustee to run  Eastern.  </P> <P> Shapiro himself that weekend phoned George P. Shultz, the former secretary of  state, to ask if he would act as the trustee. Shultz begged off. He not only  didn't want to leave California but is a director of Boeing Co., one of  Eastern's creditors.  </P> <P> Then Shapiro called Frank C. Carlucci, the former secretary of defense, and he  accepted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Poison Pill' Scheme  </P> <P> The unions showed their distrust of Lorenzo by devising a "poison pill" scheme  in which they agreed to about $16.6 million a month in wage concessions  earmarked for an escrow account -- savings that Eastern could only keep if the  airline were sold.  </P> <P> By 6 a.m. Monday, Ueberroth had the deal with Lorenzo and his deal with the  unions.  </P> <P> Exhausted but elated, the 30 weary warriors left Shapiro's office to shower and  head off to the Pan Am shuttle for the flight to New York and a hearing before  Judge Lifland.  </P> <P> As Ueberroth left the building, he discovered that a tow-truck operator was  about to haul away the illegally parked car of machinists adviser Randy Barber.  </P> <P> "If I promise to bring major league baseball back to Washington, will you let  the guy's car go?" Ueberroth asked. The trucker recognized him, smiled, took  Barber's car off the towing jack and drove away.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Positive Feelings  </P> <P> It was this sort of gesture, and the positive feelings that the public seemed  to have about Ueberroth, that made the unions think the partnership could work.  </P> <P> When Ueberroth arrived at the check-in counter for the Pan Am shuttle, the  ticket agent recognized him and asked: "Why are you leaving baseball?"  </P> <P> "I have 26,000 airline employees to put back to work," responded a smiling  Ueberroth.  </P> <P> He wore the same lucky red and gray tie he had on a few months ago when major  league baseball signed its rich television contract with CBS.  </P> <P> The plane was jammed with sleepy bargainers. Ueberroth was cramped between  machinists leader Charlie Bryan and pilots leader Jack Bavis. Sitting in the  back row were Shapiro and Carlucci, who was going to be named the trustee.  </P> <P> Or was he?  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Script' in Works  </P> <P> One union source said there was "a script" for what was to happen in court,  including testimony by Bavis, Bryan and flight attendants leader Mary Jane  Barry that they would not return to work for Lorenzo.  </P> <P> Early that morning, Harvey R. Miller, Eastern's chief bankruptcy attorney, got  a phone call from Joel Zweibel, lead lawyer for Eastern's 15-member creditors  committee. Zweibel had just learned about the plan to name a trustee and passed  the information on to Miller.  </P> <P> Miller hit the roof.  </P> <P> A senior partner at New York's Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, Miller, 56, is on  everyone's list of the nation's top bankruptcy lawyers. He handled the biggest  one to date -- Texaco's. He is considered so good that if any big company were  even contemplating bankruptcy they would retain him just to make sure he  doesn't represent the other side.  </P> <P> And Miller was having no part of a trustee. Indeed, it is quite unusual for a  trustee to be appointed in a Chapter 11 case. It would amount to wresting  control of a company away from the owner before it is even sold. There has to  be a showing of gross mismanagement, fraud or conflict of interest.  </P> <P> Yet some unionists say they heard Lifland tell Shapiro on the telephone over  the weekend that he would agree to name the trustee.  </P> <P> "You don't bring Frank Carlucci to New York on spec," said a source close to  Ueberroth. "You bring him because there's a job for him to do."  </P> <P> The source added: "Either Shapiro overestimated Lifland or he underestimated  Harvey Miller." Another key source says Shapiro was "misled by the court,  betrayed by the court." Neither Shapiro or Lifland would comment.  </P> <P> In any case, Miller made clear to Lifland that if he put a trustee in charge of  Eastern he would face a lengthy court battle, further delaying Eastern's return  to the skies.  </P> <P> In a move that shocked the unions and Ueberroth, the judge declined to appoint  a trustee.  </P> <P> Carlucci, who had expected to be a key player in reviving Eastern, spent the  day kibitzing with strangers in a courthouse library before being sent home to  Washington when it became clear that his services would not be needed.  </P> <P> The scramble for a compromise consumed the next 24 hours. Ueberroth was willing  to drop the trustee idea if he were appointed co-chairman of Eastern in the  interim, but that didn't satisfy the unions because Lorenzo would retain power.  </P> <P> "We will not go back to work for Frank Lorenzo under any circumstances,"  proclaimed Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union.  </P> <P> While the unions have been criticized for being intractable on the point, they  were willing to back off on appointment of a trustee if the deal was closed in  10 days, much quicker than normal. As a practical matter, this would mean that  Lorenzo would be out before they returned to work.  </P> <P> But Ueberroth wouldn't agree to this proposal, fearing he might discover --  after closing the deal in haste -- that Eastern was in worse shape than he knew  at the time.  </P> <P> Tempers grew short as the outlook darkened. Lifland attempted to lighten the  mood by making some popcorn in a machine in his chambers and passing it out to  the bargainers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disclosure to Press  </P> <P> It was at this unpromising moment that Ueberroth disclosed to the press his  agreement with the unions of the night before, triggering some unwarranted glee  among Eastern's work force. In fact, the deal was in perilous condition.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, negotiations resumed the following morning at the Vista  International Hotel, near the courthouse. At one point Miller suggested to  Rosenberg, one of Ueberroth's lawyers, that the sale price would be lowered $90  million if Ueberroth agreed to a quick closing.  </P> <P> By the time Rosenberg came back with a "no" from his client, Miller discovered  that others had become aware of the offer. Infuriated, he grabbed the much  smaller Rosenberg by the knot of his necktie, loudly called him a "twerp," and  told him to never quote him again.  </P> <P> The situation didn't improve once the two sides returned to the courthouse. The  judge shouted at Miller behind closed doors: "Dammit, Harvey, if you want the  planes in the air, all you have to do is sign the paper!"  </P> <P> Moments later, as Shapiro tried to get Miller's attention in a courtroom  hallway, Miller glared at him and declared: "Shove it, David!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stalked Out of Chambers  </P> <P> Early in the evening, Lorenzo arrived for a final session with Ueberroth and  the judge. But at 9:20 p.m., the normally unflappable Ueberroth stalked out of  the judge's chambers and refused a plea to return. Lorenzo left separately. An  arbitrary midnight deadline set by the Lorenzo and Ueberroth camps passed.  </P> <P> A few minutes after midnight, one of Ueberroth's associates, reached by phone,  told The Times, "The deal is dead."  </P> <P> The next morning, fruitless talks had resumed at the courthouse when one Willy  Censor appeared on the 6th floor. A self-described 62-year-old diamond merchant  with a flowing beard and three children in tow, Censor announced that he wanted  to buy Eastern and had access to $250 million in cash.  </P> <P> Asked why he would want to buy such a troubled company, he retorted, "Why don't  you ask Ueberroth that?"  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the real participants couldn't even agree on whether to hold a news  conference announcing the collapse of the deal. The judge tried to head it off,  still hopeful that the sale could be salvaged. Ueberroth said he wouldn't  participate if Eastern attacked the unions again. The terms were agreed on and  it took place at the Dorset Hotel on 54th Street. Lorenzo was elsewhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gained 'Greatest Respect'  </P> <P> Ueberroth and Phil Bakes, Eastern's president, said nice things about one  another. Ueberroth said he had gained "the greatest respect" for the union  leaders. Meanwhile, Eastern security guards had kept union leaders out of the  press conference and threatened to arrest Barry, the flight attendants leader,  after she managed to get in.  </P> <P> Afterward, Ueberroth slowly made his way out of the hotel, shaking hands with  several union leaders and walking past diamond merchant Censor who was hanging  around. Outside on the street, strangers shouted greetings at him: "How ya  doin', Pete?" "Go get 'em Peter!" But as Ueberroth crossed 5th Avenue and  headed east past a Gucci shop, he knew that unless a miracle occurred he would  have to find another challenge. Eastern would not be his.  </P> <P> Related Story: Business, Page 2  </P></p>

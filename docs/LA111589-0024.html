			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> It was another setback for the Church of the Most High Goddess.  </P> <P> High Priestess Mary Ellen Tracy and her husband, Wilbur, were arrested on  pandering charges Tuesday after a woman undercover officer applied for a job at  the so-called sex church in the Silver Lake area, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Doug  Nelson said.  </P> <P> The Canyon Country couple had been free on bail pending an appeal of their  September conviction on prostitution charges. Mary Tracy claimed at the time  that one of the church rituals is for male "worshipers" to have sex with her in  exchange for monetary "sacrifices" in excess of $100.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Alan Vanderpool said Tuesday that he overheard  Wilbur Tracy brag to the undercover officer, who was wearing a hidden  microphone, that the church was well known, thanks to television.  </P> <P> TV reporters, Tracy explained, "always call during the sweeps" period, when the  size of the stations' audiences are measured in order to set their advertising  rates.  </P> <P> No film at 11.  </P> <P> You may have read in The Times that some businessmen linked to King Fahd of  Saudi Arabia headed a group that secretly acquired a major stake in leases on  public land in Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Certainly, they picked a spot with an appropriate name.  </P> <P> After all, Marina del Rey roughly translates as "The King's Harbor."  </P> <P> Who says there's no night life in downtown L.A.? Certainly not the three  black-clad daredevils who scaled an office building under construction on  Figueroa Street and then tried to parachute to the bottom.  </P> <P> Witnesses reported that two of the jumpers floated all the way down, police  said. But a third hit some trees and landed around the corner on a fourth-floor  patio of the First Los Angeles Bank building on Wilshire Boulevard at about  1:30 a.m. Tuesday.  </P> <P> Whatever, that parachutist apparently opted to descend the final floors the  slow way.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Ted Matthews said: "We found a trail of leaves leading to the fire  escape."  </P> <P> Had the Grinch struck in Northridge?  </P> <P> There it was -- a "For Sale" sign plastered on the side of a "Santa and Live  Reindeer" trailer in a vacant lot.  </P> <P> Actually, it was some surplus equipment owned by a Christmas tree company that  displays live deer at some locations.  </P> <P> Santa's still got his sleigh.  </P> <P> Anyone looking for some light entertainment might consider the following  seminars open to the public at Caltech this week:  </P> <P> Today: "Studies on Retinal Proteins: Visual Transduction, Photoaxis and  Bleaching Adaptation."  </P> <P> Thursday: "Murine Developmental Control Genes."  </P> <P> Friday: "Multi-Cellular Motion in Enclosures With Lateral Heating."  </P> <P> The last, by the way, is not a reference to driving on the freeway.  </P> <P> As far as we know.  </P></p>

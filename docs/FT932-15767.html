			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / NUT may boycott all school tests THE NATIONAL Union of Teachers, the largest of the teaching unions, yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Mr John Patten, education secretary, to withdraw controversial school tests by announcing that it was considering boycotting all the school tests this summer. At the start of its annual conference in Brighton, the union said that its executive had agreed to a union vote today on whether to hold a ballot for a complete boycott. It also warned that unless Mr Patten radically reformed the testing system, the union was likely to support a further boycott in the following year. If the NUT goes ahead with a boycott this summer, it presents a serious challenge to Mr Patten's plans to hold school tests for 14-year-olds this summer in subjects like English and technology, and may also affect similar tests for seven and 11-year-olds. The second largest teaching union, the NASUWT, has already announced a boycott of the English tests for 14-year-olds. The more moderate union, the ATL, announced at its own conference this week that it would also ballot its members over a boycott in spite of an announcement by Mr Patten that he was planning an urgent review of the national curriculum and the testing system. Speaking at an NUT briefing yesterday, Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, predicted that if, as expected, his members supported the ballot and the boycott, Mr Patten would be forced to back down. 'There has been plenty of evidence over the last few months of government U-turns. I predict the secretary of state will have to accept the logic of the situation and abandon the tests,' he said. He added: 'If the review is to be meaningful there can be no educationally sound reason for holding this summer's tests.'</p>

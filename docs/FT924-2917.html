			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Observer: Pre-tax profits The race is on among top US executives to beat the higher personal income taxes promised by President-elect Bill Clinton. And who do you suppose figures high among the Wall Street whizz-bangs who stand to benefit from their employers' willingness to let them cash in early? None other than Robert Rubin, the Goldman Sachs co-chairman who is a top Clinton aide and expected to be named - possibly today - as the new White House economic security adviser. Goldman Sachs has joined others on the Street such as Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers, in swiftly confirming their response to the prospect of tax hikes. They have given their executives the option of taking 1992 bonuses before year-end, instead of the normal payout early in the new year. The rush to forestall the Internal Revenue Service began a week ago with Michael Eisner, chairman of The Walt Disney Company, deciding to exercise stock options now that could yield nearly Dollars 200m. As well as executives and bankers, though, the queue to cash in includes lawyers, actors and even sports figures. An example is pitcher David Cone of the Kansas City Royals baseball team who, as part of a new Dollars 15m three-year deal, has been given Dollars 9m up-front.</p>

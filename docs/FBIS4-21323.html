			<p>BFN     [Text] Szczecin, 19 Apr -- Nearly 100 kg of smuggled  cocaine with a "market" value of nearly 100 million German marks  was incinerated on 19 April at a facility of the Pomeranian  department of the Border Guard in Szczecin. This was reported  by Major Wlodzimierz Warchol of the Pomeranian department of the  Border Guard.    The drugs were incinerated by order of the Szczecin  provincial court, in cooperation with pharmaceutical authorities.    The cocaine, probably originating from South America, was  seized by the border guards this April. It had been brought  into Gdansk aboard a ship which has not yet been identified, and  was to have been transported to Holland through Germany.    The drugs were found in an automobile being used, according  to investigators, by a 48-year-old Greek, Thomas M., traveling  on a forged Dutch passport. He is currently being tried by the  Szczecin provincial court.</p>

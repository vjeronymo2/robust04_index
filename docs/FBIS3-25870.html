Whereas the Hong Kong issue is also an urgent  one, and the government should all the more derive a policy as  soon as possible, and inform industrial and commercial circles  at an early date so that they can make preparations.    Ku Chen-fu pointed out that based on the future economic  policy of Taiwan, establishing an Asia-Pacific operation center  and a special free trade zone is now a fixed direction; on this  premise, the issue of direct flights between both sides of the  strait cannot be always avoided, and preliminary planning should  be done. He also said that the issue of direct flights between  the two sides of the strait is not merely an economic issue, but  should be considered together with planning for Hong Kong and an  Asia-Pacific operations base.    In addition, regarding the Hong Kong issue, Ku Chen-fu said  that Hong Kong is currently the cite of entrepot trade between  Taiwan and the mainland, and that due to the importance of Hong  Kong's position, Taiwan's future policy toward Hong Kong, as  well as other relevant measures, are very important matters, and  industrial and commercial circles must be allowed to understand  them two or three years ahead of promulgation so they can make  preparations.</p>

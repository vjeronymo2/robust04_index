			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: For damask, read Denny THE MOST indelible memory of many a festivity is the crumpled array of stained napkins, red wine and gravy usually being the worst culprits. There comes a point when no amount of laundering will erase those telltale brown blobs and replacements are the only answer. But where to find them? Everywhere you turn, from department store to speciality shop, there are fancy versions: lace-edge, hand-stitched - and expensive. What few of them can be bothered to stock is good, old-fashioned, fine-quality and unfussy plain damask linen. The place to head for is P. Denny, in the heart of London's Soho. A long-standing chef and restaurant supplier (established in 1923), Denny is used to restaurants demanding three dozen waiters' cloths 'sharpish.' Here you can find basic kitchen and dining-room linen ranging from the humble oven cloth to starched table napery and brocade waiters' waistcoats, all at exceptionally low prices. What is more, Denny runs a mail-order service, both in the UK and internationally. The invoices carry the company logo of a saluting bell-boy and sum-up the shop's atmosphere perfectly. Denny is worth a visit just to see the shop fittings. Glazed window cupboards, installed when it was built, are still in service, decked out with statuesque chefs in chequered trousers and neckties. The original mahogany and brass glazed counters display boxes of brightly-coloured silk cuff knots (Pounds 4.95), Eton St George artificial silk armbands (Pounds 2.15), collar studs (35p) and a range of bow ties (Pounds 3.95). If what you want is working linen that will not be turned into a limp rag after the first wash, Denny has a vast range that time has revealed can withstand the rigours of a hotel kitchen and dining-room. It ought, therefore, to do more than just survive yours. A white damask tablecloth can be ordered in various sizes to fit most domestic dining tables. An average-sized cloth, 90 in by 54 in, costs Pounds 18.25. White damask napkins are only Pounds 1.80 each. If you are tired of tea-cloths that seem to absorb only enough moisture to dry one tumbler, Denny sells an excellent linen glass cloth (Pounds 2.35) and the heaviest-duty oven cloth I have ever seen for just Pounds 5.45. If you need to kit-out a chef, Denny is where you should find what you need (in Paris, chefs' kits are all the rage among the trendy youth, who head for La Samaritaine to buy their little white or blue-and-white checked chefs' jackets to wear over their leggings). A double-breasted chef's jacket will give the man of the house an authoritative presence, even if his culinary skill extends only to whipping up scrambled egg. The traditional chef's toque (Pounds 2.85), that sits surprisingly snugly on the head, is an excellent fun birthday present. For messy cooks, for whom spillage is all part of the creativity, the caterers' chef aprons are sturdy protectors: starched white cotton waist-to-floor wrap-arounds with tie straps are Pounds 3.10, while the traditional striped butchers' aprons in blue, green or red are Pounds 4.75 (with pocket). And to keep the whole ensemble in shape, Denny even supplies sock suspenders, each pair boxed individually for just Pounds 3.25. P. Denny &amp; Co., 39 Old Compton Street, London W1V 6NP.

Forty-seven United Nations military and civilian personnel  were diagnosed HIV positive in Cambodia, but UNTAC's chief  medical officer Colonel Dr. Peter Fraps claims the real number  of HIV cases contracted in Cambodia could run as high as 150.    "I know that there are some nations where each soldier  repatriated is tested and I know that they find a lot of  positive cases," Dr. Fraps said.    "I know that there are contingents that had up to now five  or  eight cases of HIV in-country, and I heard in the meantime they  found an additional ten cases when they tested the soldiers at  home."    "I think the figure will be much higher than the 47 we found  here. I can just guess and I would say up to 150. But this is  just a rough idea."    When the number of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) being  diagnosed among United Nations personnel began to skyrocket  towards the end of last year, finally peaking at 666 for the  month of December, Dr. Fraps decided something had to be done.  An AIDS awareness campaign was launched involving videos and  booklets, more than a quarter of a million condoms were  distributed to UNTAC personnel and compulsory HIV testing on all  patients suffering from a sexually transmitted disease was  introduced.    "We had people come five, six or seven times with a sexually  transmitted disease," Dr. Fraps said.    The German medics then began an AIDS education campaign  among  prostitutes and the local population as part of their civic  action program, but when they offered free HIV tests the World  Health Organizsation stepped in and asked for it to end as there  were no trained AIDS counselors in Cambodia and it was regarded  irresponsible to tell people they had a life-threatening disease  if you could not provide adequate counseling. Dr. Fraps agreed  and the testing was stopped. In February this year counselors  were trained and now local HIV victims are told of their  condition.    He also issued a directive in September last year that all  patients with serious injuries undergo HIV tests as a measure of  protection for the German doctors performing surgeries.    "You can say we did everything, but you cannot change the  mentality and this is the problem," he said.    "When we had the first cases of HIV in September/October  1992, I asked headquarters in New York -- the medical director  -- what the U.N.'s policy is. I asked specifically what to do  with HIV positives here in the mission area and I did it twice  and I never received an answer, therefore I pursued the policy  of many armies: That a soldier who is found positive will not  be dismissed, although he can be dismissed if he asks for it --  that's the policy in the German army."    "As long as he is HIV positive and has no symptoms -- no  pain  -- he will stay in the army."    Although Dr. Fraps admits he really wanted all HIV positive  UNTAC personnel repatriate for the safety of their colleagues  who might unwittingly administer first aid to them in an  emergency situation and contract the disease themselves, no HIV  positive UNTAC employee was repatriated before their time.    Dr. Fraps said former Eastern bloc countries figured high on  the sexually transmitted disease file and blamed this partly on  ignorance and the new-found freedom of soldiers from these  countries.    While the number of UNTAC employees reporting in with STD  was always high, Dr. Fraps believes still more cases went  unreported because the victims were afraid of being repatriated,  or as in the case of one contingent STD, statistics for its  soldiers were altered before any reports were sent to the Phnom  Penh headquarters.    "The opinion was, because I was talking with someone from  this contingent, that it shouldn't be interesting for  headquarters how many cases of sexually transmitted diseases  they had and it's absolutely not necessary to talk with them  about HIV."    Dr. Fraps added that other countries like Bangladesh, India,  and Pakistan seemed to have a "national policy" of reporting a  much lower STD rate than they actually had.    "And you have no means as chief medical officer to make  pressure, it's impossible," he said.    "I think there should be an open handling of these things  because everybody is concerned it's a worldwide problem, and  therefore to hide cases is absolutely stupid and it's dangerous."    "For many of the soldiers here it was an event that was to  be  seen under monetary viewpoints. They earned a lot of money for  staying here one year, or six months, or eighteen months. Each  of the soldiers got more money for staying here than in his home  country.    "Most of these soldiers were coming from third-world  countries, some of them were earning ten times more than in  their home countries, therefore the policy of each soldier was  to stay as long as possible in this mission area. And if you  know that commanders in some nations said "If you are treated  for a sexually transmitted disease you will be sent home", then  you can imagine what happended. Many cases didn't see the  doctor, just to avoid the situation that they would be sent  home, because this was the promise of the commander," Dr. Fraps  explained.    More than 5,000 treatments were provided to UNTAC personnel  suffering from STD during this mission. But Dr. Fraps estimates  another 1,500 cases went unreported.    About 3,000 HIV tests were conducted on UN personnel while  serving in Cambodia.    Dr. Fraps readily admits UNTAC personnel have probably  helped  spread the HIV virus in Cambodia, but he is adamant that UNTAC  is not responsible for the HIV virus in Cambodia and he is  backed up by other health experts in Phnom Penh.    "We have soldiers in the mission area from countries where  HIV is epidemic therefore it's absolutely likely that soldiers  coming from these countries contributed to the contamination in  the area. Also we had a lot of personnel going to Thailand on  holiday, and it's also possible there was contamination caused  by sexual intercourse with Thai prostitutes."    "But it is absolutely not true that Cambodia before this  mission had no problems with HIV or they had no problems  concerning sexually transmitted diseases."    "It's not fair to say that due to this UNTAC mission the  first contamination came to Cambodia."    Following Dr. Fraps education campaign efforts and the end  of the UNTAC mission, the number of reported cases of sexually  transmitted diseases among UN personnel is on the decline. In  July 284 cases were reported, in August it was down to 177. The  average age of HIV victims in UNTAC is 25.    Dr. Fraps would like to see the United Nations implement  compulsory HIV testing for all soldiers going on future  missions. He said all nations should have a mission preparation  course that discusses how to avoid contracting STD and HIV. He  also thinks UN headquarters should require all countries to  report all HIV cases believed to have been contracted in  Cambodia, including those found on repatriation, to aid policy  planning for future missions.</p>

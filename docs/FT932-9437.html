			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (4): Coming in from the cold - There are hopes of a new era of conciliation for Marseille LONG ago Julius Caesar, ruler of the Roman Empire, was waging war against Pompey. The city of Marseille, forced to choose between the two camps, plumped for Pompey. 'We chose the wrong side,' says Mr Jean Pellegrino, deputy chief executive of Marseille city council. 'Caesar defeated Pompey and sent his soldiers to wreak revenge on Marseille. The city was destroyed.' Mr Pellegrino, like many others involved in the politics of modern Marseille, suspects that the theme of political isolation still haunts the city today. Marseille's socialist city council was shunned by the Gaullist governments of the 1960s and 1970s. The city stayed out in the cold during the socialist administrations of the 1980s when Mr Robert Vigouroux, the iconoclastic socialist mayor clashed with the party establishment in the Bouches-du-Rhones region. After the conservative landslide in this spring's legislative elections, Mr Vigouroux is trying to rebuild links with the region and with Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government in the hope that the change in the French political climate will herald a new era of conciliation for Marseille. The city has undoubtedly suffered from its political isolation. It missed out both on the industrial initiatives of the Pompidou presidency in early 1970s and from the socialists' decentralisation policy in the 1980s. It is instructive that Marseille is one of the few major French cities without access to the high-speed TGV rail network. The TGV link comes on stream in three years. Marseille is also the victim of its own history. The city, which traces its roots to 600BC when it was founded by the Greeks, flourished during the French empire when it was the fulcrum for trade between France and its North African colonies. The colonial trade withered when the empire dispersed in the post-war period. The port fell into decline, as did the factories that had been making goods to sell to the colonies. The last Marseille soapworks closed three years ago. The city's problems were aggravated in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the arrival of 200,000 pieds noirs immigrants from the old colonies, all searching for housing and jobs. Marseille slipped into decline. Businesses left the city to move to the tax-efficient enterprise zones on its fringes. The pieds noirs left, too. The population fell by 30,000 between 1974 and 1982 and by 80,000 over the next 10 years. The city, which once had nearly 1m inhabitants, is now reduced to 800,000. The situation has been made worse by the the quarrels among local politicians, and their disputes with Bouches-du-Rhone colleagues, notably Mr Bernard Tapie, the businessman and former minister who chairs the Olympique Marseille football club. There is also the omnipresent threat of racial tension fuelled by the high rate of joblessness which, at 19 per cent, is almost twice the national average and reaches 30 per cent in the most deprived areas of the city. The picturesque, but peeling, facades along the waterfront symbolise the city's problems. Even the Mafia has fled. The main figures in Cote d'Azur crime have moved on to richer pickings in Nice. 'We've come to the end of two cycles of historic change - the arrival of the pieds noirs and the decline of the colonial trade,' says Mr Pellegrino. 'I hope we are now at the start of a new cycle.' There are some positive signs. Mr Vigouroux has managed to soothe the racial tension in the city. The Gulf War was seen as a litmus test. The mayor took pre-emptive action by inviting all the city's religious leaders to the Hotel de Ville at the start of the conflict. This display of solidarity seemed to work. Marseille did not experience one instance of racial hostility during the war. The calmer racial climate is also reflected in the fading support for the extreme right-wing National Front which peaked during the 1988 elections when it received 23 per cent of the votes. Its share slipped to less than 20 per cent in this spring's poll. The centre-right swept the board, winning five of the city's seven parliamentary seats from the left, leaving the socialists and communists with one seat each. The city has also made some progress in resolving its financial problems. Marseille incurred heavy debts during the late 1980s, mainly due to the FFr4bn bill for two subway lines and a water treatment station. The council has since cut costs and delegated to the private sector some projects, such as the construction of an underground roadway. The level of debt has already fallen from FFr11bn to FFr9bn. Marseille is now in the throes of implementing an economic regeneration strategy. Mr Jean Clavier, head of economic development, has identified a number of measures, such as more flexible planning policies, to try to dissuade companies from leaving the city. He also hopes Marseille will be able 'to build on its historic strengths' in medicine and the port to attract new investment. This is a difficult time to engineer an economic revival. The French economy is in a delicate state and interest rates are still too high, despite the recent reductions, for companies to feel confident about sanctioning new investment. The strong franc could discourage foreign companies from setting up in France. There is also, of course, tough competition for inward investment from other cities. But local officials are cheered by the more conciliatory political mood. 'At last there is a real will to forget political differences and to build a new consensus for Marseille,' says Mr Clavier. 'After all, the city needs it.'</p>

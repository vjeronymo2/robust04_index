			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Kinkel: tailor-made for foreign ministry MR KLAUS KINKEL, German Justice Minister and now nominated in a Bonn palace coup as foreign minister, has had a technocratic career in government almost tailor-made for the job. What he lacks is political experience. If he orchestrated the coup last night against Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer, the first choice for foreign minister not only of their own Free Democratic Party (FDP) leadership, but also of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the present incumbent, then he is learning fast. He was selected last night by the parliamentary group of the FDP by 63 votes to 25, instead of Mrs Schwaetzer, thanks to a back-bench revolt against the leadership. The irony is that Mr Kinkel has been if anything more of a protege of Mr Genscher for more than 20 years than Mrs Schwaetzer. A soft-spoken Swabian from Metzingen in the south-west state of Baden-Wurttemberg, he was first spotted by the former FDP leader as a young lawyer in the Interior Ministry in 1970. He was rapidly promoted by Mr Genscher, then interior minister, to be his personal assistant, and then the head of his personal office. When Mr Genscher transferred to the Foreign Office in 1974, he took Mr Kinkel with him to continue running his office. Then he promoted him to run the ministry's prestigious planning staff. In 1979 he became head of the BND, the troubled German intelligence service, again with the recommendation and blessing of Mr Genscher. There he is credited with quietly and competently restoring the morale in a service undermined by spy scandals. In 1982 he came back into mainstream government as state secretary in the Justice Ministry, and only became a fully-fledged politician after the last election in 1990, when he was immediately promoted justice minister. Yet he had already made his name not merely as a cool crisis manager in the ministry. He also defused the hunger strike by Red Army Faction terrorists in 1989, negotiating a deal with them in prison. It is only in the past year that he has emerged as a potential leader in the FDP, a party desperately casting round to find a successor to the old generation of Mr Genscher and his long-time colleague, Mr Otto Lambsdorff. In contrast to his colleague Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the outspoken and publicity-conscious economics minister, Mr Kinkel is cool and pragmatic. It could be just what the party, and the Foreign Office, needs.</p>

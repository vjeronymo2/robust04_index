			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Applicants also request an exemption under sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act from section 17(a) of the Act, which prohibits certain purchases and sales of securities between investment companies and their affiliated persons. Because the Blended Funds may individually own more than 5% of individual Portfolios and also may be deemed to be under common control with Core Trust, the Blended Funds and Core Trust may be deemed to be affiliated persons of one another. Purchases by the Blended Funds of shares of Core Trust or sales by Core Trust of their shares to the Blended Funds could be deemed to be principal transactions by affiliated persons under section 17(a). Similarly, the initial in-kind contributions by the Blended Funds of certain of their portfolio securities to the Portfolios in exchange for shares of the Portfolios and any possible subsequent redemptions in-kind by the Portfolios could likewise be deemed to be principal transactions by affiliated persons under section 17(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Under section 17(b), the SEC shall issue an order exempting a proposed transaction from section 17(a) if (a) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any persons concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Section 17(b) applies only to individual proposed transactions. However, the SEC frequently has used its authority under section 6(c) to exempt series of transactions that otherwise met the standards of section 17(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Applicants believe that the terms of the proposed transactions are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching. The consideration paid and received for the sale and redemption of shares of the Portfolios will be based on the net asset value of those Portfolios. Similarly, the consideration paid and received for the Blended Funds' contribution of portfolio securities to Core Trust or for any subsequent in-kind redemptions will be based on the fair market value of those securities. The proposed transactions are also consistent with the policies of each fund. The investment of assets of the Blended Funds in shares of Core Trust and the issuance of shares of Core Trust will be effected in accordance with each Blended Funds' investment restrictions and will be consistent with its policies as set forth in each Blended Funds' registration statement. Applicants also believe that the proposed transactions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Section 17(d) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in which such investment company is a joint, or joint and several, participant with such person in contravention of SEC rules and regulations. Rule 17d&hyph;1 promulgated under the Act provides that no joint transaction may be consummated without prior SEC approval. To the extent the proposed arrangement is considered a joint enterprise or joint arrangement, applicants believe that it is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act because the purpose of the proposed arrangement is to provide an efficient vehicle for the Blended Funds to invest in international, small company, and S&amp;P 500 Index securities. In addition, the Blended Funds and Core Trust will not participate in this arrangement on a basis that is different or less advantageous than the participants that are not investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the exemptions they request may be conditioned on the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Bank will waive its advisory fee for serving as investment adviser to the Small Company and Index Portfolios of Core Trust and will reimburse the International Portfolio of Core Trust the amount of the advisory fee the Portfolio pays to Schroder. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

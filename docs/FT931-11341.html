			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / People: Witt - expanding with Slimma Tim Dewhirst, great grandson of Isaac Dewhirst - the Yorkshire merchant who gave Marks and Spencer its first big break - has been made executive chairman of the Dewhirst Group, the oldest supplier to Britain's premier high street retailer. The promotion of the 39-year-old Dewhirst is part of a management reshuffle which includes the appointment of the first chief executive from outside the Dewhirst family - 39-year-old David Witt. Witt (right), who only joined Dewhirst in September 1991, has a big company background, and his swift promotion to chief executive is a sign that the family-controlled firm is keen to strengthen its management. Having worked for UDS Tailoring in the 1970s he joined Slimma in 1979 and rose to be a main board director of its parent Tootal at the time of the Coats Viyella takeover. Dewhirst is famous more for its M&amp;S connections than its recent performance. Isaac Dewhirst lent Michael Marks Pounds 5 to get his business started in the 1880s, and although he turned down Marks' subsequent offer of a partnership, put him in touch with his cashier - Thomas Spencer. Today, Marks and Spencer has a market value of Pounds 8.6bn, while Dewhirst is capitalised at less than Pounds 70m and is reliant on M&amp;S for 80 per cent of its business. The combination of steady margin erosion in the 1980s and heavy dependence on menswear fashions has meant that it has not always done as well as some long-established M&amp;S suppliers. Two years ago it had to cut its dividend for the first time in its history. However, its fortunes appear to have turned with the 1991 acquisition of Slimma. Not only did it bring in new management led by Witt, but it reduced the company's reliance on the fickle menswear market. Its shares have more than doubled since the rights issue to pay for Slimma. Dewhirst takes over from Anthony Vice, former financial journalist and Rothschild merchant banker, who has been keeping the chairman's seat warm for him since 1988. Vice remains on the board as does James Dewhirst, who has relinquished his role as non-executive vice chairman.</p>

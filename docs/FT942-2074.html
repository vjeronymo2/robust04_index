			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Low orders push JFB into the red Low order books pushed Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the specialist engineering group, into the red at the interim stage, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 842,000 to March 31 against profits of Pounds 2.07m last time. Turnover rose from Pounds 63.3m to Pounds 64.7m while operating profits fell from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 177,000. The Firth Rixson Division - which includes alloys and castings - saw profits halve to Pounds 749,000 (Pounds 1.55m) on turnover up from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 44m. The light engineering division incurred operating losses of Pounds 219,000 (profits Pounds 1.71m) on sales down from Pounds 24.4m to Pounds 20.7m. Mr George Hardie, joint group managing director, said JFB appeared to be 'turning the corner after a most difficult 18 months'. Although margins remained depressed at Firth Rixson, order levels in the rings and forgings businesses had improved. Mr Hardie said there were plans to sell companies in the light engineering division as part of the group's efforts to focus on core activities, particularly rings and forgings. He said he did not anticipate further lay-offs following the 10 per cent cut in the workforce, net of the US acquisition, in the last 12 months. The interim dividend is passed (1p). Losses per share of 0.9p compared with earnings of 0.8p.</p>

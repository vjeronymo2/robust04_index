			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Technology: Blank cheque for the thinking chip Synaptics, a Silicon Valley pioneer in the field of neural network chips, has developed the first commercial application of its futuristic technology; an electronic 'retina' that can read the numbers printed on the bottom of cheques in order to verify that customers have enough money in their account to cover the transaction. Neural networks - computers that mimic the functions of the human brain - have long been the subject of learned papers and scientific experiments. Bringing neural technology out of the laboratory and into the commercial world has proved almost as big a challenge as creating a 'thinking machine'. Synaptics was founded in 1986 by two authorities on chip design; Carver Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and Federico Faggin, who designed the first microprocessor. In collaboration with VeriFone, a leading supplier of transaction automation systems used to verify credit and debit cards, Synaptics has designed a chip for an automatic cheque reader which speeds up transactions by improving accuracy. The device can instantly recognise the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) symbols printed at the bottom of cheques. In theory, this long line of digits is supposed to adhere to standards that make it readable by less sophisticated magnetic systems. In reality, however, cheque printers do not always live up to precise specifications. Ink density and printing pressure create wide variations, and the alignment of the paper may also be imperfect. People can still read them, but machines cannot. Typical cheque reader systems, used by financial institutions, cost as much as 100 times more and score about 80 per cent accuracy. They require a cheque to be passed carefully through the system at a pre-determined speed and angle by a motorised system. In contrast, the neural system can be used at the point of sale, enabling customers or sales clerks to swipe a cheque through the reader and still achieve accuracy of 99.6 per cent, according to tests conducted by independent researchers SRI International. According to Faggin, Synaptics chief executive, the cheque reader is just the beginning. 'The neural chip represents a tiny fraction of what we'll eventually be able to do with neural networks. As neural technology evolves and becomes more generally available, the applications expand until the imagination becomes the only limit.' The same electronic vision tech-nology used in the cheque reader might also be used to recognise handwriting or thumbprints, or to detect counterfeit money. With these types of 'perceptive' chips, any type of pattern recognition, whether it be identifying documents or graphical images, can be implemented faster and more accurately than with conventional computers. Speech recognition, in which neural network chips mimic human hearing functions, and robotics, where the chips control sensory motor functions, are likely applications in the long term. In the shorter term, VeriFone hopes to use the neural chip as the basis of a cash recognition system which can read bank notes. This will reduce mistakes at the point of sale and help to eliminate pilfering by keeping track of the amount of money that has changed hands. While pushing forward the frontiers of computer science, Synaptic's founders do not expect to displace conventional digital devices. Instead, they see 'intuitive' computers being coupled with the high-speed processing power of 'logical' computers to capture the best of both worlds.</p>

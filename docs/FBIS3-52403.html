He was received by Foreign  Minister Faris Buwayz, who had just returned from Damascus, and  British Ambassador May Fay Geraldine Forte and senior embassy  staff.    The delegation accompanying the British secretary includes  Senior Adviser Robert John Sowers, Charles Richard Stag, and  Robert Nicola [names as heard].    Secretary Hurd will hold talks with his Lebanese counterpart  at the Foreign Ministry. He will later head to B'abda Palace to  meet with President Ilyas al-Hirawi. Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Nabih Birri and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri will  attend the meeting, in addition to Minister Buwayz.    Hurd said that there is no cause for alarm over the possible  collapse of the peace process. He believes that no one wants to  go back to the state of anarchy and lack of accord.

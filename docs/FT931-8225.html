			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Brussels fends off criticism of banana import regime THE European Commission yesterday launched a vigorous defence of its new banana import regime in response to a wave of criticism from Latin American producers and Germany, the EC's largest banana consumer. Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said the agreement would generally mean lower or stable prices in the EC and guaranteed protection for Community banana growers and generous support for the traditional African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) producers. Germany and the Benelux countries opposed last week's deal which set an EC quota for Latin and Central American (dollar-zone) banana-producing countries of 2m tonnes, effective from July 1, at a duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 82.60) per tonne. Bananas above the 2m quota face a duty of Ecu850 per tonne. Germany plans to lodge a formal complaint at the EC Court of Justice in Luxembourg, claiming the deal approved by qualified majority infringes its banana protocol under the 1957 Treaty of Rome. Mr Steichen said the EC had a 'blatant need' to introduce a Community quota for dollar-zone bananas now that the single European market was in force. Otherwise the EC would have to reimpose controls at national borders. He also dismissed Latin American charges that the agreement amounted to a cocaine cartel licence as it would encourage banana farmers in Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and elsewhere to turn to other products for income. The import restrictions come at a time when many Latin American countries have made considerable investments to increase banana production. Mr Steichen stressed the quota could be revised upward to take account of EC demand, and said it was intolerable for the EC's good faith on this pledge to be challenged. He also gave short shrift to arguments that the new quota failed to take into account the upsurge in demand for bananas, particularly in eastern Germany. He added the Commission was examining the close similarity between prices in quota-free Germany and the Benelux countries, which had a 20 per cent tariff. A similar dispute involving Germany has erupted over European Commission efforts to impose a Community quota on cheap imports of items such as toys and textiles from China, North Korea and Vietnam.</p>

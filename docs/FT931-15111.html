			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Club Med drops 15% to Dollars 25.8m in US CLUB Med Inc, the US subsidiary of Club Mediterranee, the French leisure group, saw net profits fall 15 per cent to Dollars 25.8m in the year to October 31 because of the sluggish US holiday market. The poor performance of the US subsidiary was one of the main problems faced by Club Mediterranee last year. Club Med Inc, which is 72 per cent owned by its French parent company, was hit by competitive market conditions and the price war among US airlines. Turnover fell to Dollars 516.42m from Dollars 518.71m in its last financial year, while pre-tax profits fell by 13 per cent to Dollars 27.56m from Dollars 31.83m The US company recovered in the final quarter when net profits rose by 64 per cent to Dollars 3.89m from Dollars 2.37m on stable turnover of Dollars 113.9m. Club Mediterranee last month announced it had returned to the black in its last financial year, in spite of the problems of its US business. The French group mustered net profits of FFr160m (Dollars 29.62m) in the year to October 31 against a FFr17m loss in the previous year.</p>

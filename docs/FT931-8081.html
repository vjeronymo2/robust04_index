			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: A market with the wind in its sales - Michael Skapinker analyses the growth in cruising holidays and finds travel companies forging ahead to their next frontier / Cruising THE FIRST time I saw a group of cruisers, they were disembarking on the Greek island of Hydra. Mostly elderly Americans, they spent an hour or two in the jewellery shops and then went back on board. I thought it was a peculiar way to spend a holiday. The number of holidaymakers who disagree increases by the year. In North American, 1.4m people took cruises in 1980. Last year, the figure reached an estimated 4.4m. The UK, the world's second biggest cruise market, is far smaller. But the 200,000 UK residents who went on cruises last year were a substantial increase on the 115,000 who did so in 1980. The large UK travel companies believe they can almost quadruple the number of British cruise takers by the end of the century. After building an industry which every year takes 11m package tourists by air to resorts in the Mediterranean and further afield, British travel companies regard cruising as their next frontier. They believe that a generation jaded by Majorca and Florida is ready to try something new. By the end of the century, Thomas Cook, the travel agents' chain, predicts that 750,000 Britons will be cruising each year. It thinks the worldwide figure will be 10m. Lunn Poly, Britain's biggest chain of travel agents, sold about 15,000 cruises in 1992. This is a tiny proportion of the 1.7m holidays Lunn Poly sold overall, but the company's cruise sales for this summer are already 144 per cent up on last year. About two-thirds of Lunn Poly's cruise customers fly to Florida or another North American hopping-off point and take a boat bound for the Caribbean. The Caribbean is the most popular UK cruise destination and the one which companies like Lunn Poly regard as their natural market. Cruisers in the Caribbean tend to be younger than those who take a cruise from a UK port. Caribbean cruisers regard their ship as a floating hotel, which has the advantage of allowing them to wake up at a different island every few days, instead of being stuck in the same place for two weeks. They are more interested in having a casino or discotheque on board than a guest lecturer. Andy Allwood, Lunn Poly's spokesman, puts it this way: 'The last thing fly-cruisers who go to the Caribbean want is to be surrounded by water. They want to be able to see an island wherever they are. The cruiser who leaves from a UK port is a traditional cruiser - Home Counties, crusty colonels set in their ways, people who like hierarchy, officers and ranks and all that. Some of that market is people who like being at sea. They like the idea of being on a ship surrounded by water,' he says, somewhat incredulously. As I said, Lunn Poly is aiming at the Caribbean market. There are plenty of people taking cruises from UK ports, and they are not all crusty colonels. The Cunard Line says bookings for cruises from the UK to the Mediterranean are up 20 per cent on last year. The company says that bookings on the QE2 are particularly healthy. A 110-day world cruise on the QE2 in a cabin with its own lounge and private balcony can cost Pounds 80,000. But it is possible to take a QE2 cruise for less than Pounds 300. That will give you two nights on board and take you from Southampton to Brest, Cork and back to Southampton. Not everyone in the cruise industry is happy about the level of bookings. Sissie Chan, marketing director of Swan Hellenic, part of the P&amp;O group, says she expects to have a difficult year. Swan Hellenic cruises, on the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and European rivers, last for two weeks and cost an average of Pounds 2,500. Most of the company's customers are retired and wealthy. The company is trying to lower its age profile, by which it means attracting people in their 50s, rather than the under 40s who are going to the Caribbean. Swan Hellenic never really recovered after the Gulf War. The recession has hurt, particularly as the company's retired customers suffer, rather than benefit, from low interest rates. What all the cruises offer is security. There is not the worry about changing hotels every few days and moving your luggage. If you go sailing on the Cunard Countess in the Caribbean, for example, all you do is turn up at the airport with your luggage. The next time you see it is on board. But the variety of cruises on offer makes it essential to choose the right one. Once on board, there is no way off. Although the large travel agency chains are keen to increase their cruise business, they handle a relatively small proportion of current bookings. This is in sharp contrast to the air charter package market, where the large chains play a more dominant part. Industry officials estimate that about 25 per cent of bookings are made directly with the companies. About 60 per cent of the rest are handled by independent travel agents. Although the industry has worked hard to improve travel agency employees' knowledge of cruising, it is still a specialised business. When Thomas Cook carried out a survey four years ago, it discovered that most of its cruise business was coming through about 50 of its outlets which had decided to concentrate on cruising. Because you are stuck with your fellow passengers and the opportunities to wander off on your own are limited, it is vital you book through an agent that specialises in cruises. Eric Flounders, Cunard's spokesman, says: 'There are some ships, not ours, which are like Butlins afloat. If you didn't want that and you ended up on it, you'd be miserable.'</p>

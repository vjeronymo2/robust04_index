			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SOVIETS SEEK DEFICIT CURE  </P> <P> A top Soviet economist asserted that the Soviet Union can eliminate its  $162-billion budget deficit in two or three years by trimming expenditures and  concentrating on quick-profit ventures. Leonid Abalkin, director of the  Economics Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that erasing the  red ink is essential to remedy shortages of consumer goods plaguing the nation.  He said the Soviet state should support businesses that make a quick profit and  stop financing businesses that won't turn a profit for years. He said $32  billion could be saved by closing bad businesses and calling off expensive  construction projects and other huge outlays. A recent government report said  that one in 10 Soviet enterprises lost money in 1988.  </P></p>

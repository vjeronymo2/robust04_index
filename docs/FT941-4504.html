			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Banker's interest rates warning Rising long-term interest rates in Japan threaten to have an adverse impact on the domestic economy, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the country's central bank said yesterday, writes Paul Abrahams. His comments followed the decision on Tuesday by the Industrial Bank of Japan to raise its long-term prime-lending rate by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 per cent. Mr Mieno said the Bank of Japan had no intention of intervening to influence long-term rates and would leave the matter to the markets. He pointed out, however, that long-term rates were linked to short-term rates, and that the bank would continue to make appropriate short-term adjustments as necessary.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Philips Given that the market had hoped there would be no more bad news from Philips, yesterday's 18 per cent drop in the share price was perhaps an understandable reaction to the profits warning. The question is whether the market over-reacted. On a negative reading, Philips' protracted restructuring programme has done little to reduce the group's vulnerability to leaner competitors in consumer electronics. Moreover, any dent in its recovery has implications for its ability to resume dividend payments. On this view, the shares are best avoided until the extent of the damage becomes clearer when second-quarter figures are revealed in August. Arguably, a more persuasive interpretation is that, while the consumer electronics market has become even more competitive, Philips' wider recovery effort is scarcely off the rails. The management's assumption was that consumer business would stabilise after price falls in the first quarter. Instead, May saw further pressure on prices, particularly in Europe. Hence, yesterday's warning about the second-quarter performance. As today's results from Nokia Data should show, Philips has not been suffering alone. Even Sony has already felt pain. It is indeed rational for investors to calculate that Philips will probably not have the mettle to pay a dividend if earnings are lower this year. Doubtless they will also remember that any payment would always be nominal. Despite yesterday's fall, those who backed the shares for recovery may reflect that the long-term odds remain in their favour.</p>

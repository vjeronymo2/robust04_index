			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Cardoso's poll lead slips Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, front-runner in Brazil's presidential election, has seen his lead slip slightly in opinion polls, increasing the chances of a second-round run-off with his nearest rival. Under Brazil's election rules, a candidate only wins in the first round if he polls more votes than all his competitors combined. According to a Gallup poll published yesterday in the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper, Mr Cardoso's support has slipped 2 points to 41.1 per cent. He is still well ahead of his main rival, the left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who polled 20.6 per cent. Mr Cardoso's fall means his margin of victory over all the candidates has fallen from 6.3 points earlier this month to 3.3 points. This is within the poll's 4-point margin of error, suggesting Mr Cardoso's first-round victory on October 3 is no longer assured. He still remains clear favourite to win in a second round set for mid-November. His fall appears to be a result of combined criticism by the other candidates, which has led to an increase in the number of undecided voters.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Shell to pay L238bn for rest of Italian venture Royal Dutch/Shell is to strengthen its presence in Italy by buying the half-share of the MonteShell petroleum joint venture which belongs to Edison, the energy subsidiary of the Montedison industrial group. Shell Italia, the Anglo-Dutch group's Italian subsidiary, is to pay L238bn (Dollars 152m) for total control of the refining, transport, storage and distribution operations of MonteShell, which was formed in 1987. MonteShell operates 2,200 service stations across Italy, and has a 7.6 per cent share of the Italian market. The two companies said yesterday that they had reached agreement on the sale, which should be completed early next year. The price will be fixed after MonteShell reports its 1994 results. It is the second big deal struck by Montedison and Shell in the past year. The Italian company is restructuring following its near-collapse in 1993, while Shell is pursuing a programme of expansion in Italy. In December 1993, the two companies agreed to form a Dollars 3bn plastics joint venture, known as Montell, which would be the world's largest polypropylene manufacturer. The deal is still awaiting approval by US regulators. Under the terms of the preliminary agreement on MonteShell, Edison will pay MonteShell L58bn to retain a 50 per cent stake in its liquid gas operations and in some industrial activities near Trieste. It is believed that Shell and Edison will also try to sell these operations in due course. Montedison and its financial holding company Ferruzzi have been pursuing a divestment programme since last December in an attempt to reduce debt. Yesterday, Montedison said that the proceeds of the MonteShell sale would be reinvested to help develop the group's energy sector. Edison is the biggest of Italy's private energy producers and could benefit from a liberalisation of the sector after the privatisation of Enel, the state-owned electricity company, next year. Shell used to own a substantial network of service stations in Italy, but sold them to Eni, the state energy and chemicals group, in 1973, pulling out of the Italian petroleum products market. It bought the small Conoco petrol operation in northern Italy in 1979.</p>

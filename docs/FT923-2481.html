			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Risk of further damage to confidence is heightened - Banking BANKERS were yesterday crossing fingers in the hope that the rise in base lending rates would be reversed in the near future. Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster, the UK's second-biggest bank, said confidence would be damaged and the risk of an economic 'slump' that might seriously damage banks and building societies had been increased. British banks already had record levels of bad debt, mostly as a result of small and medium-size companies running into financial difficulties. Most banks believed losses on loans would continue at a high rate, even without any increase in interest rates. NatWest therefore wants the government to announce measures aimed at stimulating particularly weak sectors of the economy. such as construction. Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, the biggest UK bank, supported the decision to raise interest rates rather than devalue the pound. 'Devaluation would lead to a rise in interest rates and inflation,' he said. 'The pound is not overvalued against European currencies.' A senior executive at another bank said: 'We should have left the ERM and floated. Fifteen 15 per cent base rates are not tenable for long.' Mr Wanless said economic conditions might deteriorate rapidly if rates remained at the increased level for more than a couple of months. He predicted that consumers and businesses would be more cautious in their spending plans whatever happened to interest rates.</p>

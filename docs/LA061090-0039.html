			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  </P> <P> Once again, Mikhail Gorbachev dazzled America. We are fascinated with him  because he represents to us what we wish our politicians were -- a spontaneous,  pragmatic, straight-talking, press-the-flesh leader who deals with issues.  </P> <P> Instead, we have bred a bunch of well-paid stuffed shirts who worry more about  reelection and personal gain than they do about the real problems facing this  nation.  </P> <P> MARTIN OSTRYE  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

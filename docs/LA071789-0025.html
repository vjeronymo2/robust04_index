			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> FLORICANTO CELEBRATES MEXICAN CULTURAL IDENTITY  </P> <P> Whether known as Floricanto Dance Theater or Danza Floricanto U.S.A. (its new  name), Gemma Sandoval's home-grown, mom-and-pop folklorico company can both  celebrate cultural identity for the Mexican-American community and charm  outsiders with its energy and color.  </P> <P> What it cannot do is rival the great state-supported Mexican ensembles in scale  and professionalism -- but, unfortunately, it keeps on trying.  </P> <P> Instead of capitalizing on intimacy, dancer personality or connection to the  material, Floricanto's performance at the Santa Monica College Amphitheater on  Saturday locked its 16 hard-working dancers into formal group patterns with an  emphasis on unison footwork.  </P> <P> That footwork often looked well drilled, but the dancers' obvious strain  throughout the evening proved too high a price. Only in the loose, comic solos  of the "Lindo Guerrero" suite and a few passages elsewhere did Floricanto  suggest the sense of people dancing for their own pleasure, rather than a corps  assigned mass presentational effects.  </P> <P> The most sustained exception: the "La Guacamaya" sequence in the Veracruz suite  where the men swooped past the women, removing their hats, and the women kept  turning their heads to find them. Only when focused on one another (rather than  the audience) and executing expressive movement (rather than arbitrary  routines), do Floricanto dancers seem free, relaxed, in command. Who can blame  them? Who really wants to go through life as the third peon from the right?  </P> <P> If Sandoval's spoken introductions are often more interesting than her dances,  it's simply because they reveal purposes and contexts missing from what we're  shown, a deeper and more complex Floricanto that she's chosen to leave  offstage. A pity. She could make a daring contribution by giving us folklorico  purged of empty spectacle -- Jalisco and Veracuz suites that take us to the  heart of these regional styles and invite us to perceive Mexican dancers as  individuals.  </P> <P> Certainly the example of the innovative, accomplished Mariachi Mexicapan ought  to inspire her. Besides providing vibrant accompaniments, this stylish  eight-member group held the stage alone with specialties that expressed Mexican  tradition in a distinctively American manner.LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

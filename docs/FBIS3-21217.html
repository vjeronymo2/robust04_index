			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Dowa Mining Co., Ltd. (Dowa Mining), has  successfully developed magnesium that is 99.9999 percent (6N or  six-nine) pure. Previously the highest purity confirmed with  magnesium had been 99.99 percent (4N). Thus, Dowa Mining was  able to reduce the amount of impurities to 1/100th of the  previously purest metal. Dowa Mining achieved the feat by  ingeniously modifying its own metal purification method and by  developing the necessary purification facility by itself.  Knowing that high-purity magnesium can help improve the  performance of the blue semiconductor laser that is under  development by electric machine makers, Dowa Mining plans to  broadly distribute samples of the new metal.    As one can surmise from the fact that magnesium has been  used  for photographic flash, magnesium is highly reactive with air.  Thus, it is more difficult to produce highly pure magnesium than  to produce other high-purity metals. That is the reason  4N-purity magnesium had previously been the purest possible.    Dowa Mining first designed its own purification facility  with  a new material to minimize the opportunity for magnesium to  react with air, and it optimized temperature conditions for  magnesium purification. Furthermore, Dowa Mining made use of  previously known metal purification technologies, such as zone  melting, chlorides, distillation and electrolysis, as well as  added the production technology for gallium arsenide, a compound  semiconductor, and developed the new purification method to  achieve the 6N purity for magnesium.    High-purity magnesium is used with zinc and selenium in the  clad layer of the blue semiconductor laser. The blue  semiconductor laser has been in the limelight as a  next-generation product that major electric machine makers have  been trying to develop. Today, the laser is not yet completely  developed, as it can emit light only at a low temperature, and  intermittently.    The new, 6N magnesium is expected to improve the performance  of the semiconductor laser. In addition, the high-purity metal  provides the additional advantage of permitting laser developers  to concentrate only on design improvement without worrying about  any flaws in the material.    Dowa Mining intends to sell samples of this purest magnesium  at &yen;30,000 per gram, and the aggressive sales activities  will be coordinated with the sales of 6N-pure zinc and selenium.</p>

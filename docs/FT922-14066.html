			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Angry voice of the north By becoming the biggest party in Milan, the second-biggest in northern Italy and the fourth-largest nationwide, Mr Umberto Bossi's Lombard League is the clear winner from the polls, writes Haig Simonian. Yet, in spite of its rise to prominence with 55 newly elected deputies, compared with one in the previous parliament, much about the League remains shadowy. Its policies are vague. As a protest movement, the bulk of its platform is devoted to attacking the political establishment. Devolution for Italy's rich north takes pride of place. 'An end to Roman robbers' and 'Closer to Europe than to Rome' are two of the League's emotive slogans. Fighting organised crime, the second part of the League's message, dovetails conveniently with the first. The governing parties' growing dependence on southern votes and their alleged links with criminal organisations play strongly on traditional northern prejudices. According to the League, the governing parties have habitually 'squandered' hard-working and honest northern taxpayers' money on wasteful, vote-gathering schemes in the south. The League's message has struck a chord with a broad spectrum of voters in the north. Although middle-class in the main, supporters of Mr Bossi range from blue collar workers to successful private businessmen. Support from industry, however, has been restricted to small and medium-sized businesses. Although big business broadly approves of Mr Bossi's calls for change, his populism has been hard for the country's industrial barons to swallow. The League's newly elected deputies are a diverse group. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, elected to the senate, parliament's upper house, from the small town of Treviglio, is an accountant. Mr Luigi Roveda, elected from nearby Lecco, runs a small company. The challenge now facing Mr Bossi is to prevent the movement from suffering the fate of so many other protest groups and breaking apart under the strain of electoral success and the need to devise coherent policies. The party must also try to develop a stronger national appeal. Mr Bossi's conception of a devolved Italy based on regional groupings in the north, centre and south foundered on the poor results of the affiliated leagues in central and southern Italy. Their minimal showing may explain why Mr Bossi fell short of his target of 10 per cent of the national vote. His biggest problem will be coping with success. Organisationally, the party is stretched. Mr Bossi is its only figure of national standing and finances are limited. The League will now have to build the apparatus of a large political party. Such an achievement will not be easy. As one sceptical party member, emerging from his battered Peugeot, said last night. 'If someone gives me a Mercedes, I have to know how to use it.' That is the test now facing Mr Bossi.</p>

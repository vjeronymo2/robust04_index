			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BEACHES STILL CLOSED FOR REPAIRS;  </P> <P> OIL SPILL: TASK FORCE SAYS CLEANUP COULD TAKE ANOTHER WEEK. PUBLIC-PRIVATE TASK  FORCE SETS TOUGH NEW STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET BEFORE THE PUBLIC IS ALLOWED  BACK IN CONTAMINATED AREAS.  </P> <P> A task force of public and private officials said Saturday that it may take at  least another week before beaches closed by the Feb. 7 oil spill can be  reopened.  </P> <P> Although the task force reached agreement on what level of oil and other  hydrocarbons found on the beaches will allow their reopening, officials said  that water and ground testing probably will not begin until March 7, when the  cleanup effort is expected to be completed.  </P> <P> Under new guidelines set by the task force, average concentrations of less than  100 parts per million total hydrocarbons taken from ground and water sampling  must be met before officials will allow the beaches to reopen, said Huntington  Beach Fire Battalion Chief Dennis Groat.  </P> <P> Officials agreed on those guidelines at a meeting of the interagency Post  Clean-up and Health Risk Evaluation Committee, composed of representatives from  city, county, and state agencies and British Petroleum.  </P> <P> "Once tests are conducted, we should know the results within 24 to 30 hours,"  Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said.  </P> <P> The guidelines are based on a standard set by the Orange County health  department, which allows hydrocarbons in a concentration of 100 parts per  million in residential areas.  </P> <P> Chuck Webster, a spokesman for British Petroleum, the owner of the spilled oil,  said company environmental officers who attended Saturday's meeting agreed to  the new guidelines, "which seemed reasonable, given the potential health risk  involved."  </P> <P> "I think we have arrived upon a system that will allow that type of testing to  move forward. We were a part of the process from the beginning," Webster said.  </P> <P> Cleanup costs for British Petroleum have increased to $13 million as a result  of the 394,000-gallon spill from the ruptured tanker American Trader, Webster  said.  </P> <P> About a 10-mile stretch of shoreline from Bolsa Chica State Beach to the  Newport Pier still remains closed, frustrating many beach-goers.  </P> <P> Brent Moreland, 18, of Orange and his brother, Ron, 22, said they woke up  Saturday, looked outside at the sunny day and immediately headed for Huntington  Beach, forgetting about the spill.  </P> <P> After being turned away, as were others, Brent muttered: "Tell them to hurry up  and fix the oil spill. I can't believe it."  </P> <P> In Huntington Beach, all city and state beach parking lots will be closed. The  bike path, however, will be open from Warner Avenue near Bolsa Chica to Beach  boulevards. But the path will remain closed from Beach Boulevard to the Santa  Ana River jetties.  </P> <P> In Newport Beach, the pedestrian boardwalk will be open, but the beach side of  the walkway will be cordoned off to prevent anyone from going onto the sand.  </P> <P> Ground and water tests by Med-Tox Associates, an Anaheim-based contractor hired  by Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, were to be conducted Saturday. However,  residual oil believed to have been loosened as a result of morning high tides  forced postponement of the testing, Mays said.  </P> <P> "We were all set to get an answer today (Saturday), but we couldn't even test,"  Mays said.  </P> <P> Groat explained that immediately after the spill, "we had extremely high tides,  depositing oil up high on Bolsa Chica rocks, the Huntington Beach Pier and  Newport Beach jetties and pier. Even though it looked clean, recent high tides  produced fluctuations again. So, all the rocky areas are now being cleaned and  we have to get that washed free of oil before any testing can be done."  </P> <P> As a result, part of the cleanup army of 450 people will spray rocky shorelines  during the next week with the same high-pressure, hot-water cleansing machines  used to clean up the oil-polluted shoreline in the Prince William Sound area in  Alaska following the Exxon Valdez spill. Those areas will include the Santa Ana  River jetty, Bolsa Chica bluffs, and the Newport Beach jetties  </P> <P> "The idea is to blast the oil from the rocks, then collect it and remove it  from the environment," British Petroleum's Webster said. "We've had difficulty  with removing oil from the Santa Ana jetties because of all the nooks and  crannies."  </P> <P> Webster said British Petroleum brought in eight of the high-pressure units,  which shoot water heated to 170 degrees, from Alaska late Friday. Four of the  units were in use Saturday at the mouth of the Santa Ana River, where  biologists reported, for the first time, a sheen of oil residue had entered the  Huntington Beach wetlands earlier in the week.  </P> <P> Although county officials have rebuilt a 15-foot-high earthen dike to block  oil-fouled high tides from reaching the 25-acre marsh near the river mouth,  about 100 feet of the marsh may have already been damaged.  </P> <P> Webster said county bulldozers were to blame for building the dike by dredging  oil-soaked sand from the river bottom, but others involved in the cleanup noted  that efforts to determine the source of the sheen has been inconclusive. County  officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Cleanup crews are taking added precautions by lowering temperatures below 90  degrees on the pressurized hoses in the area of the Newport Beach jetties to  protect crabs, starfish and other marine life among the rocks.  </P> <P> As a member of the intra-agency Post Cleanup and Health Risk Evaluation  Committee that met Saturday, Battalion Chief Groat said that in the past,  polluted beaches were reopened based on a "physical" rule of thumb.  </P> <P> "Past practice was just a physical and visual test," Groat said. "If you can  see it, feel it or smell it, then the beaches remained closed. There were no  set guidelines, not in state law or federal regulations pertaining to the  reopening of beaches."  </P> <P> But after the meeting, Groat and other officials said they reached a standard  of cleanliness that was based on other hydrocarbons and the toxic properties of  crude oil.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, heavy surf that was expected to bring four- to five-foot breakers  during the weekend failed to materialize and kept crowds to a minimum, said  Steve Seim, a Huntington Beach marine safety officer.  </P> <P> "We've had only a few people come down to the beach, but if I were a surfer  this would be the last place I would go out at," Seim said.  </P> <P> Business was slow for Vickie Siemon, 36, of Huntington Beach, who was selling  T-shirts emblazoned with a dead bird and the phrase "No Apology Accepted.  Huntington Beach Oil Spill Feb. 7, 1990."  </P> <P> Mike Sowden, 60, was visiting friends in Huntington Beach with his wife, Betty,  also 60. The Pennsylvania natives learned of the oil spill when they were told  of the beach ban while walking on the sands at the Huntington City Beach.  </P> <P> Gaynell Raynaud, 28, on the other hand, knew of the spill. The El Toro woman  brought her two children, Jessica, 9, and Ryan, 6, to Huntington City Beach to  educate them about environmental destruction.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to see the real thing," Ryan said.  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael Ashcraft contributed to this report.  </P></p>

According to Borowski, the measures implemented by Waldemar  Pawlak's government are proof of its left-wing nature. "The  attitude to the issue of participation of the state in economic  life is also a social-democratic element," the deputy prime  minister said. He also emphasized that "a transition from a  liberal to a left-wing government is not easy because this is  the first such transformation attempt in any Central European  country."    Borowski rejected the accusations, mainly from UP Chairman  Ryszard Bugaj, that there is a continuation of the monetarist  policy, and that he maintained a "small budget" and "the  privatisation principle." "This budget slows down certain  trends but does not overcome them; we have to continue the  privatization process because the state cannot manage 6,000  companies," Borowski said.    The deputy prime minister also disagreed with Sejm Deputy  Wieslawa Ziolkowska, who said that this year's budget does not  bring Poland closer to the European Union [EU]. According to  Borowski the situation is just the opposite because the budget  is aimed at curbing inflation, which is one of the conditions  for membership in the EU.    At the meeting Borowski listened to papers delivered by  several dozen academics on social policy and economic issues.</p>

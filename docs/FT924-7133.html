			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maverick Clark is used to speaking his mind MR ALAN Clark, the former defence and trade minister who last night was at the centre of the arms-to-Iraq controversy, is used to being cast as a maverick. In government he was not afraid to speak his mind - sometimes to the alarm of senior ministers. Mr Clark, 64, is a rich, unpredictable and sardonic man who lives in a castle. When asked for his comment on the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to ask for an inquiry into his Matrix Churchill trail evidence, he replied in typical brashness: 'Haven't got any.' The government is aware that, should more be uncovered in the arms-to-Iraq affair, it could become harder to distance the role of Mr Clark from ministers still in office. He was a trade and industry minister from 1986 to 1989, during the ceasefire in the Iraq/Iran war. Although it is now clear from documents in the Matrix Churchill trial that the government was re-interpreting the guidelines on exports to both countries, Mr Clark told parliament in April 1989 that there were 'no plans to change the current restrictions on the export of arms to Iraq which impose an embargo on the export of lethal equipment.' He added: 'The guidelines are kept under review in the light of developments in the situation there.' Mr Clark dropped a bombshell in court earlier this month by admitting he advised Matrix Churchill and other British toolmakers to draw up specifications emphasising peaceful rather than military applications. The court heard this evidence was 'inconsistent' with his earlier statements to Customs and Excise investigators. It led to an admission by Customs that it could no longer sustain a case against three former directors of the Coventry machine-tool maker. Discussing his advice to the machine tool-makers in court, Mr Clark said it involved 'our old friend economical.' 'Economical with the truth?', Mr Geoffrey Robertson, QC for one of the directors responded. 'With the actualite',' Mr Clark replied. He said it was not misleading or dishonest to have made such a suggestion and did not amount to a tip-off. It was a case of 'Whitehall cosmetics' to keep the records ambiguous. He denied he showed companies how best to circumvent government guidelines on arms exports to Iraq, but said he thought the government's guidelines were 'tiresome and intrusive'. He added it was in Britain's best interests for the Iran-Iraq war to continue as long as possible. It was not the only occasion in which he has been disarmingly frank. Last year, in the New Statesman magazine, he nominated 'Love in the time of Cholera' as his favourite book of the year because: 'For anyone who has been in love. . . this is the book. . . It illustrates the utter dominance of the female.' In his last comments in the Commons before retiring from politics at the general election, Mr Clark admitted to MPs that 'I have had idiosyncratic, some would say tendentious, moments of behaviour which have always been treated with great tolerance by the House'.</p>

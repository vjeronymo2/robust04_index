			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Feb (PL) -- In allusion to a group of  persons who entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana, a spokesman  for the Cuban Foreign Ministry reiterated that entering  embassies is not an acceptable way of leaving Cuba and that  those who do so are on the mistaken path.    We will not allow this method to be adopted by those intent  on leaving the country and entering a diplomatic mission cannot  be a privilege or safe conduct for emigration, the spokesman  added.    It was learned that four men, two women, and a two-year-old  girl entered the Belgian Embassy on 26 January.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba  has not changed its policy and reiterated that there are  emigration laws that allow any citizen to travel abroad, as long  as he has received a visa and paid for the transportation.    The spokesman added that those who knowingly, thoughtlessly,  or out of ignorance or naivete enter an embassy are impairing  the security of the diplomatic mission.    We have cooperated with the Belgian authorities to the  extent  that we are allowed and if this matter was not handled earlier  by the Cuban authorities -- even though the media have been  reporting on the issue since yesterday -- it was because the  Belgian authorities requested discretion, the spokesman said.    We were not going to go back on our word, the spokesman  added, but for some reason unknown to us the Belgian Embassy  officials issued a communique.    According to the spokesman, the citizens must leave the  diplomatic mission voluntarily, return to their homes, and  undertake the normal steps to leave the country, even if they  have a visa.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that entering the  Belgian  Embassy will not represent an impediment to or a privilege for  others who are requesting visas.    The spokesman added that only one of the persons in the  embassy had served time for common crimes and was out on parole.  He added that the others have no criminal background nor are  they being persecuted for political reasons.    In 1990 four persons entered the Belgian Embassy in Havana  with the same purpose. They also had to leave the site without  achieving their goal.</p>

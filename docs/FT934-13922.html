			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Bermuda (8): Ping-pong balls a thing of the past - Patrick Harverson follows the rapid developments that have swept the stock market FROM ping-pong balls and local stocks to high technology trading, international company listings and multi-million dollar equity issues in five years? Improbable as it sounds, many members of Bermuda's business community believe the local stock exchange can travel this rapid growth path. For the moment, the Bermuda stock exchange (BSE) remains a tiny market for mostly local company stocks. Only 28 companies are listed on the exchange, with a total market capitalisation of about Dollars 1bn. On average, roughly Dollars 750,000 worth of business is done during the daily hour-long trading session. But these modest figures belie the extent of the changes that have swept the BSE this past year. It began in November 1992, when the Bermuda Stock Exchange Act incorporated the exchange and gave the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) responsibility for supervision. That was followed in February of this year by the replacement of the old 'ping-pong ball' system whereby the island's three banks used to draw lots using numbered ping-pong balls to determine the order of the weekly trading session - with daily trading and stock prices listed on Reuter screens. Then, earlier this summer, the three banks which run the exchange - the Bank of Bermuda, the Bank of Butterfield and Bermuda Commercial Bank - began writing new membership rules. The final draft of the new rules, which will allow other firms to participate in the market, have been handed to the BMA, and are scheduled to be approved within a few weeks. The last steps in the process will be to complete the writing of new rules covering company listings and to finish a review of trading practices. William Dolan, manager of the Bank of Bermuda's private banking department and current chairman of the BSE, says these two steps should be completed by next year. Although the banks will argue that modernisation of the BSE has been their aim for several years, competition posed by a new over-the-counter (OTC) market that quickly drew business away from the cumbersome BSE proved an important motivating factor. The new OTC market was the brainchild of Joe Taussig and Jeffrey Conyers, who run the brokerage firm First Bermuda Securities. They set up the OTC market, with the approval of the authorities, in May last year. 'We took that view that Bermudians would trade more if you gave them the opportunity,' says Mr Conyers. Previously, all orders had to go through the three banks. The OTC market allowed investors to buy and sell stocks through First Bermuda. Volume took off once the OTC other investment management firms on the island started using it, says Mr Taussig. 'In the month of April, before Jeff started this, the average volume was less than one million dollars of shares a month. We've had million-dollar days now.' He claims the off-exchange business now accounts for more than 50 per cent of the entire Bermuda equity market. The OTC market, however, suffers in comparison to the BSE in a crucial respect - stamp duty is no longer levied on transactions executed on the BSE, while there is no such exemption for off-exchange trading, much to the frustration of First Bermuda. As Mr Taussig explains: 'When it turned out that stocks traded off the exchange were subject to stamp duty, which is a huge disadvantage for us, we of course said: 'Let's join the exchange.' We've asked to join, but they won't less us join. They're still studying it.' First Bermuda, and other firms such as Lines Overseas Management which trade on the OTC market, argue that the banks are fearful of the competition that non-bank membership would represent. The banks deny the charge, although the BSE chairman admits that stamp duty remains a 'contentious' issue. He says: 'We at the exchange felt that we should not exclude the other parties, because they'd view that as the big boys cutting them out. But the government has taken the position that this is the Bermuda Stock Exchange Act, and any transactions that gain the benefit of exemption from stamp duties must be conducted on the exchange. 'So that's forced First Bermuda Securities, etcetera, to come through banks to place their trades, which they are understandably upset about.' The issue, however, should be resolved soon when the new membership rules are approved by the BMA, and the likes of First Bermuda and Lines Overseas Management join the BSE. Yet an expanded membership would only be the first step toward making the BSE a market of more than only local interest - listing rules and new trading practices still have to be drawn up. Malcolm Williams, general manager of the BMA, says that the BMA and the banks are working hard to put the framework in place that would attract international companies to the BSE. Only four non-Bermuda companies are currently listed. He says: 'Look at the Jardine Mathiesons, the Exels, the Centre Res. We have lot of household names on this island. We have provided them with a very suitable place to operate, and I believe if we provide them with a very suitable stock exchange, then, as they are using Bermuda, they will also use the Bermuda stock exchange.' It would be a natural step for some of the island's big international insurance companies to list on the BSE, says Mr Dolan. 'If you look at the Oslo stock market, that's the biggest capital market for the shipping industry. We should focus in on the insurance industry here and actually do the listings and underwritings from Bermuda. ACE, Exel, Mid Ocean Re, Mutual Risk have had IPOs, and they've all been done from New York. I think there's considerable capacity to do those issues from here in Bermuda.' Then there are the hundreds of mutual funds operating out of Bermuda - many of them could list on the exchange. Even more exciting to Bermudians is the possibility that Hong Kong companies, particularly those already incorporated on the island, might use the BSE as some form of safe haven to insure against any problems when China gains political control of the colony in 1997. Audette Exel, head of Bermuda Commercial Bank's international business, says: 'The top 50 per cent of the Hong Kong stock exchange are actually Bermuda companies. Having spent four years in Hong Kong, it's my belief that if they had the opportunity to list here, they would. So in terms of mutual funds and Hong Kong, you have a market that's just waiting to list.' Other visionaries see the BSE playing a role as a base for transactions in an even wider range of international securities - debt as well as equity. 'Geographical location is the key to Bermuda,' says finance minister Mr Saul. 'This is where all the interest is coming from the Far East. You can work throughout the day there, and then have work done for you at night during the day here. That's where the exchange could be useful.' But this is all heady stuff, and the BSE has to learn to walk before trying to run. The lack of a modern clearing system is one obvious weakness. Without one, international securities firms would not execute trades on the BSE. It is a chicken-and-egg situation, admits Mr Taussig. 'You only place the orders when you think you can get it done. But if you don't get it done, nobody will place the orders.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      BERMUDA STOCK EXCHANGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BSE Index based at 1,000 Feb 23 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Close as of September 10 1993                    1161.46 High 1993                                        1121.36 Low 1993                                          944.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Listed common stocks (excluding mutual funds)      Value as of September 10 1993                     (Bermudian Dollars)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banking/finance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bank of Bermuda                                    22.63 Bank of Butterfield                                28.13 Bermuda Commercial Bank                            13.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Broadcasting  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bermuda Broadcasting Co                             5.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Consumer Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bermuda Aviation Services                           3.50 Bermuda Bakery                                     17.25 Bermuda Computer Services                          14.75 Devonshire Industries                               9.50 Kentucky Fried Chicken                             32.00 Long Botham Boats                                   8.50 Masters                                             9.00 SAL                                                 5.00 Solar Enterprises                                   4.25 Stevedoring Services                                4.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Insurance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argus Insurance                                    11.00 Bermuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance                     0.50 BF&amp;M                                                9.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Newspaper/printing  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bermuda Press Holdings                              9.50 Bermuda Sun                                         5.50 Island Press                                        5.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Utilities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BELCO                                              19.88 Bermuda Telephone Co                               40.00 Watlington Water Works                              na  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Bermuda  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

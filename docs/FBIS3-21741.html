			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ignacio Gutierrez A.] </F>   [Text] A 56-kg shipment of a synthetic drug known as  "crystal" (worth over $600,000) was seized yesterday in  Mexicali, Baja California, by personnel from the Office of the  Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], who also arrested two  presumed drug dealers.    The institution of federal justice warned that this drug is  a  toxic substance 400 times more potent than cocaine, producing  addiction when first consumed. Within a short time, it also  causes irreversible damage and inevitable death to those using  it.    According to reports submitted to the Federal Judicial  Police  chief, Adrian Carrera, the drug, derived from amphetamines and  other chemical substances, was discovered by the federal agents  at this area's international airport.    Based on investigations conducted for some time, it was  learned that a purchase and sale operation involving the fatal  narcotic was to take place at the airport. Therefore, an  operation was mounted a week ago, bringing results yesterday.    The drugs were in that airport's baggage department and,  when  they were located, the PGR agents merely waited for the owners  to show up.    Yesterday, Joaquin Montano Moreno and Enrique Moreno Sanchez  appeared to claim the aforementioned packages. When they were  caught, they could not explain the presence of the drugs, and  hence were placed at the disposal of the agent from the Federal  Public Prosecutor's Office, as persons presumed guilty of crimes  against health. The drugs presumably were to be sent to the  United States.    It is known that the product called "crystal," like other  synthetic drugs such as "ice" and "crack," is being processed in  clandestine laboratories from amphetamines. It is often sold at  a relatively low price, owing to its small production cost.  Nevertheless, it is highly toxic, causing fatal damage to the  human body.</p>

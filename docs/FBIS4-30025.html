			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, two terrorists belonging to the BRN  [Barisan Revolution Nasional] Group -- Mr. Takariya Bunae, 30,  and Mr. Doloying Totanyong -- both natives of Pattani Province,  surrendered to Mr. Banyat Chanthasena, provincial governor of  Yala, so as to participate in the national development program.    On this occasion, the governor of Yala congratulated the two  persons for having admitted their faults and for deciding to  become good citizens so that they can live with their families  and earn an honest living. He also said that the government  authorities are willing to give fair treatment to those who  surrender and will try to find ways to enable them to lead  peaceful lives in society.    The two who surrendered had lived in the jungle for two  years  and all the time had had to escape government officials. Due to  heavy suppression by government authorities in every locality,  they therefore contacted officials concerned for their  submission.    Moreover, the two men disclosed that at present terrorists  are scattered in different places after fleeing attacks by  government officials.    The Yala provincial governor gave some money to the two  national developers as a morale-boosting gesture.</p>

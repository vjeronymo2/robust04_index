			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Kravchuk in move for wider power UKRAINE was plunged into a constitutional crisis yesterday when President Leonid Kravchuk asked parliament to make him head of government, a position currently held by the prime minister. In response Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma offered to resign. The president's unexpected bid for greater power came as parliament considered the prime minister's own request, made earlier this week, for an extended remit in order to implement economic reform. The conservative parliament had looked set to meet Mr Kuchma's demands, thereby facilitating greater reform, but the president's proposal could now block that process. Mr Kuchma this week called on parliament to extend his power to rule the economy by decree and asked for control over the central bank and state privatisation body. Mr Kravchuk had been expected to back the prime minister's plea, but he surprised deputies yesterday with his request to amend the constitution to make the president the head of all executive structures in Ukraine. The presidential option is attractive to deputies because he has promised not to restrict their authority to pass economic legislation. Deputies are expected to vote on both the president's and the prime minister's proposals today. If the president wins, as most predict, Ukraine's stalled economic reforms could face a further setback. A senior cabinet minister, who said he would also offer to quit if the prime minister went, said that if the president took charge of the government he was likely to bring back the ex-Communist old guard forced out when Mr Kuchma took office last autumn. In that event he forecast policies which would to push Ukraine into hyperinflation within the next six months. Presidential advisers, however, deny this, saying Mr Kravchuk, who has carefully side-stepped economic issues during his first 18 months in office, will pursue radical reforms. 'Mr Kuchma's government said it was pro-reform,' said one, 'but actually its policies were conservative.' After a week of rapid reversals, some deputies are advocating a third option. Mr Volodymyr Iavorivsky urged president and prime minister to work together, suggesting that Mr Kuchma accept the job of vice-president responsible for the economy. However, the prime minister is understood to have rejected such an option. The political uncertainty is likely to be a setback for the International Monetary Fund delegation currently in Kiev. It arrived earlier this week to begin what both sides hoped would be conclusive talks on granting Ukraine access to the IMF's newly created transitional lending facility.</p>

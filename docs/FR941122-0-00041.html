			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be approved, the designation of a compensating unit, of course, must meet the requirements in the January 11, 1993 regulations for reduced utilization plans as well as the additional requirement imposed in today's final revised rule. After determining that a particular proposed compensating unit meets all these upfront requirements, the Agency will approve the designation and allocate allowances for the unit. The Agency will not conduct any end-of-year review of the need for the compensating unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a designated representative of a Phase I unit has no Phase II unit that will provide compensating generation and that meets all the upfront requirements for designation, the designated representative will not be required to submit a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. The allowance surrender provisions in &sect;&sect;72.91 and 72.92 will continue to apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. End-of-Year Review of the Need for Compensating Units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the rejected option (Option 1 in the November 18, 1993 proposal), units would have been allowed to remain as compensating units and would have retained allocated allowances only where the compensating units were actually needed to account for reduced utilization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60959&hyph;60961. The Agency proposed in Option 1 to modify the reduced utilization provisions by granting upfront approval of a reduced utilization plan with compensating units but making approval contingent on an end-of-year determination by the Administrator that each compensating unit was needed for the year. A unit designated as a compensating unit would have become a Phase I unit and would have been allocated allowances upon upfront approval of the reduced utilization plan. However, a compensating unit would not have been allowed to transfer allowances allocated for any given year in Phase I unless and until an end-of-year determination of need was made for that unit for that year. If the unit was not shown to be needed, the unit would have been retroactively de-designated for the year and the allowances allocated for the year would have been deducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Option 1, a unit could be deemed, in the end-of-year review, to be needed as a compensating unit only for years in which: the Phase I unit actually had utilization below baseline; the Phase I units in the initial Phase I unit's dispatch system actually had total net utilization below the sum of their baselines after taking account of all sulfur-generation acquired by the dispatch system; and the proposed compensating unit actually provided compensating generation to that dispatch system. Further, the Administrator would determine how much compensating generation each compensating unit proposed for any Phase I unit potentially could have provided. The only compensating unit designations that would be allowed for any Phase I units in the dispatch system would be designations of compensating units whose potential excess generation would have been necessary to meet the potential need for compensating generation for the dispatch system as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is rejecting Option 1 because Option 2 is a simpler approach that ensures that, consistent with title IV and Congressional intent, compensating units cannot be used to create excess, new allowances. In contrast to Option 2, Option 1 would require designated representatives to make complicated end-of-year demonstrations of need, summarized above, and EPA to review and evaluate those demonstrations. Trading of allowances allocated to compensating units would be inhibited in that such trading would be barred pending completion of the Agency's review. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Further, while Option 1 would reduce the number of compensating units and thus the total amount of excess, new allowances that they could create, that option would not entirely eliminate the problem: those compensating units meeting the requirements of Option 1 could still create some excess, new allowances. Finally, the vast majority of commenters supported the use of Option 2 over Option 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Because the Agency is rejecting all the limitations, discussed in the November 18, 1993 proposal, on the trading of allowances allocated to compensating or substitution units, the Agency has decided not to adopt any revisions to &sect;73.52 in the Allowance System rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Reporting and Allowance Surrender  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The November 18, 1993 proposal included a number of changes _both substantive and nonsubstantive changes_to &sect;&sect;72.43 and 72.91 concerning reporting and allowance surrender requirements. 58 FR 60961-60962 (describing these changes). These changes are included in the final revised rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

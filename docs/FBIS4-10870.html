			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Stanley Muschett, president of the Panamanian </F> Commission for Justice, Peace, and National Reconciliation, at  the Santa Maria La Antigua University in Panama City -- live]    [Text] Good evening to all television viewers and radio  listeners. Just as we announced, the Justice and Peace  Commission prepared a preliminary statement in which it stated  its position regarding the president's actions on Thursday, 14  April. This position was a preliminary one in compliance with  the regulations of the permanent consultative body. The  permanent consultative body, created under the auspices of the  electoral ethical agreement, is made up of the representatives  of the political parties that signed the agreement under the  presidency of the Justice and Peace Commission.    We brought this position, this preliminary statement, before  the consultative body with the intention of reaching a  collective position. After the meeting, where I must recognize  that the efforts were to enrich the document, I must also point  out that the statement we are making now is an exclusive  statement by the Justice and Peace Commission, because a  collective statement was not reached among all the members of  the permanent consultative body according to the regulation. I  am going to read the statement and once I finish, I will make  some observations.    Statement by the Justice and Peace Commission: As for the  appearance of the president of the Republic in a national  network on 14 April, the Justice and Peace Commission states its  position given the commitment it has made for the promotion of a  participatory and respectful election process that is free of  violence.    No one can disregard the past, which must be completely  analyzed. Reflections of the past must serve to illuminate the  present, create possibilities for the future, and contribute to  the governing of the country; therefore:    1. The pictures that were shown reminded us of a painful  part of our history, aggravated by the offensive actions of some  of the participants. History cannot be forgotten and only  through a true reconciliation based on the strict application of  justice and repentance can we be in peace with it.    2. The unnecessary expectation created by the words and the  actions of the president presented as a genuine concern for  democracy and the normal development of the state can also be  interpreted as an effort to change the preferences in the  present electoral process, which could contradict his call not  to, and I quote, use his authority and influence to serve the  interests of the participants in the election process, unquote.    3. A few days before the elections are held, we reiterate a  call to debate the different platforms and evaluate candidates  based on their values, capabilities, and past achievements.    4. Panama is our common house. After the elections, we have  the great task of reaching agreements on the great challenges  that lie ahead. That is why the Justice and Peace Commission  makes a call to the president and to all participants in the  election process to -- inspired in the multiple initiatives made  since the ethical electoral agreement and the women's forum on  political parties, including the electoral agreement of the  Executive Branch -- conclude this process with tolerance,  respect, and responsibility.    I want to publicly ask the various media that may pick up  this statement to please reproduce it in its entirety, and we  hope they refrain from editing out parts that may detract from  the primary intention that led us to make this statement. Thank  you very much.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Business flocks to Blair Euro seminar Nearly 100 European companies are to attend a ground-breaking Labour seminar to be held in Brussels next month in a fresh indication that business is starting to take the party seriously, David Owen writes. The Pounds 500-a-head event, to be called Labour Working in Europe, will be attended by Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. The seminar is expected to make a sizeable contribution to Labour's fast-growing fighting fund for the next general election. According to one conference organiser, the party's profit is likely to run into tens of thousands of pounds. Scores of blue-chip companies in sectors including financial services, natural resources, tobacco and telecommunications have reserved places at the event, which will take place in the afternoon and evening of January 10. Mr Blair will make what is billed as a keynote speech setting out his agenda for Europe. The event will be addressed by Mr Klaus Hansch, president of the European parliament.</p>

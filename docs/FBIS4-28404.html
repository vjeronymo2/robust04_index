			<p>BFN     [Text] Noumea, June 10 (AFP) -- An employers' union here  launched a general business shutdown Friday to protest constant  strike threats from workers' unions over employee rights.    About 90 percent of businesses in the territory closed early  Friday in observance of the protest, said Alain Descombels,  president of the French territory's Union of Small and Medium  Enterprises.    Nearly 1,000 people gathered in the capital's center to  denounce "a state of siege" mounted by labor unions, who "do not  respect anything" and are demanding the resignation of High  Commissioner Alain Christnacht.    Business and trade here have been disrupted over the past  few  months by labor strikes which have crippled port activities in  Noumea.    On Thursday, striking longshoremen, who were until recently  employed by the Chalandage transport and handling company,  blocked oil automobile traffic in an area of the capital's  center to protest the closure of the company and layoffs of its  150 employees the same day, as well as the dismissal of their  union leader, Roger Noraro.    However, the barriers were lifted Friday after the  territorial government agreed to mediate a settlement between  the workers and management. Talks were being held late Friday.</p>

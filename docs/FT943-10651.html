			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Beef export inquiry puts pressure on Dublin coalition Ireland's coalition government came under pressure yesterday following criticism of Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister and former industry and commerce minister, for his decision to grant more than IPounds 100m (Pounds 99m) in credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq six years ago. Following publication of a long-awaited official report into the affair earlier this week, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and Labour party leader, described Mr Reynolds' actions as a 'major failure of public policy'. The report has further strained relations between Mr Reynolds' Fianna Fail and Labour, the junior government partner, already at odds over Northern Ireland and a labour dispute at Team Aer Lingus, the maintenance arm of the Irish airline. As industry and commerce minister, Mr Reynolds approved export credit guarantees to the Goodman Group, Ireland's biggest beef processor and exporter, for meat exports to Iraq. The credits were granted between 1987 and 1988. A tribunal was set up to investigate allegations against Goodman Group in May 1991, before the Labour-Fianna Fail coalition government was formed in 1992. Its report concluded that Irish taxpayers were exposed to a potential liability of more than IPounds 100m as a result of the insurance cover extended by Mr Reynolds. It also said the decision on credit insurance was taken by Mr Reynolds 'against the professional advice available to him'. 'The benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the Irish economy from this situation would be minimal . . . and would not justify the risk involved in granting export insurance in the amounts granted,' it said. The report has undermined Mr Reynolds' assertions at the weekend that he had been 'totally vindicated' by it. The chairman of the inquiry accepted that Mr Reynolds had the right to extend the export credits, but said a more detailed investigation should have been carried out. Goodman Group had intended to export a large proportion of the beef to Iraq from European Union intervention stocks but not from sources within the Irish republic. The benefits to the Irish economy of this were 'illusory rather than real', the report said.</p>

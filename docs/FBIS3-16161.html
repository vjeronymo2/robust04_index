The applicants to hold rallies, which are to be held in the  very center of Moscow on Theater Square -- the aim of which,  according to the organizers, is to confirm the people's volition  for the unity of the country, as expressed in the March 1991  referendum and also the leading role of Russia in creating a  single union state -- are the Russian Communist Party, the  National Salvation Front, Working Moscow, the Liberal Democratic  Party, and Revival.    Sergey Dontsov, head of the Moscow Council's State Legal  Directorate, today spoke to their representatives, calling on  them to strictly follow the aim of the planned action and not to  try the patience of the Moscow authorities by coming out with  slogans which do not fit in with the direct purpose of the  rallies.

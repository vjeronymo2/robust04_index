			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: Better margins return BfG to profit BfG, THE former German trades union bank which has been in the throes of a painful restructuring for the last two years and which is currently the subject of intense takeover rumours, achieved partial operating profits of DM78m (Dollars 47.2m) last year, compared with the losses of DM252m in 1990. Mr Paul Wieandt, brought in as chief executive of the troubled bank in early 1990 and architect of the subsequent rationalisation, yesterday said BfG had finally turned the corner after two exceptionally difficult years and that the profits result was far better than expected. Operating profits were DM120m last year and are likely to rise to DM320m in 1992, he said. The results benefited from a rise in interest rate margins, a deliberate decision to move out of unprofitable lending, and sharply reduced costs, reflecting a reduction in the number of branches and in the number of staff. The headcount dropped from 6,500 to 5,700 at the end of last year, down from 7,400 when Mr Wieandt took over. BfG, 51 per cent owned by the Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) insurance group, has recently become something of a pawn in the complex battle between AMB's management and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), which has accumulated a 25 per cent stake in AMB. Earlier this month, it emerged that AMB was considering a reconciliation with AGF on condition that AGF brought Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, in as a buyer of at least a partial stake in BfG. Mr Wieandt refused to comment on persistent rumours that a deal with Credit Lyonnais was imminent. He said an international alliance would be useful to help the bank's capital position. Direct talks with the French bank had taken place but were now over, he said. This still leaves open the possibility that BfG's fate will be sealed by talks between AMB, AGF and the French bank.</p>

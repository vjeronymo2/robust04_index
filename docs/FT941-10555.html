			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Long-term outlook improving The longer leading index of UK economic activity has begun to rise once more, pointing to a favourable long-term outlook for the economy, Graham Bowley writes. The rise was revealed in figures published yesterday by the Central Statistical Office. Increases in business optimism and the rise in house-building starts in the final quarter of last year boosted the index, which is supposed to signal turning points in economic activity about 13 months in advance. The shorter leading index, which indicates turning points in activity five months in advance, and the coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, both continued to rise, providing further evidence of the favourable short-term outlook.</p>

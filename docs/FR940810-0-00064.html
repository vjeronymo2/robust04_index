			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although as noted above, the issue of the continuing validity of OSHA's earlier risk assessment was not remanded to the Agency for reconsideration, implicit in OSHA's proposal to lower the PEL to 0.1 f/cc is OSHA's determination based on the 1984 risk assessment, that the lower exposure limit is necessary to reduce a still significant occupational risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After a comprehensive review of the evidence submitted concerning the validity of the 1984 risk assessment, OSHA has determined that it will continue to rely on the earlier analysis. The Agency believes that the studies used to derive risk estimates remain valid and reliable, and that OSHA's decision to not separate fiber types for purposes of risk analysis is neither scientifically nor regulatorily incorrect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are at least three reasons for OSHA's decision not to separate fiber types. First, OSHA believes that the evidence in the record supports similar potency for chrysotile and amphiboles with regard to lung cancer and asbestosis. The evidence submitted in support of the claim that chrysotile asbestos is less toxic than other asbestos fiber types is related primarily to mesothelioma. This evidence is unpersuasive, and it provides an insufficient basis upon which to regulate that fiber type less stringently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As OSHA explained in the preamble to the 1986 standards,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* to summarize the data on risk differential by asbestos fiber type, human epidemiological studies have suggested that occupational exposure to amphiboles is associated with a greater risk of mesothelioma than is exposure to chrysotile *&blank;*&blank;* No clear risk differential for lung cancer or other asbestos-related disease has been demonstrated by epidemiological studies. Animal experiments, however, have indicated that chrysotile is a more potent carcinogen than amphiboles when administered by inhalation or intrapleural injection *&blank;*&blank;* (51 FR at 22628).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA agreed with the testimony of Dr. Davis, who stated that ``the evidence cannot answer *&blank;*&blank;* with certainty *&blank;*&blank;* if ``one fiber *&blank;*&blank;* of amphibole (is) more dangerous than one fiber *&blank;*&blank;* of chrysotile.'' (Ibid).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, as stated in the 1986 asbestos standard, even if OSHA were to accept the premise (which it does not), that chrysotile may present a lower cancer risk than other asbestos fiber types, occupational exposure to chrysotile asbestos still presents a significant risk of disease at the revised PEL (See 51 FR 22649, 22652). In particular, asbestosis, the disabling and often fatal fibrosis of the deep portions of the lung, is caused by exposure to all types of asbestos. The evidence on this is strong and no new information has been presented to contradict this. As stated above, OSHA estimated asbestosis risks at 0.2 f/cc exposures as an unacceptably high 5 cases per 1000 workers. Thus, asbestosis risks alone justify the regulation for chrysotile.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lung cancer risks associated with chrysotile exposures are also high_6.7 lung cancer deaths per 1000 workers exposed to 0.2 f/cc for a full working lifetime. OSHA notes that SBA's witness, Dr. K. Crump acknowledged that ``(t)here's not a clear difference, *&blank;*&blank;* even in humans, for lung cancer *&blank;*&blank;* in terms of distinguishing the potency of amphiboles vs. chrysotile.'' (Tr. 4220).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the record shows that employees are likely to be exposed to mixed fiber types at most construction and shipyard industry worksites most of the time. Assigning a higher PEL to chrysotile would present the Agency and employers with analytical difficulties in separately monitoring exposures to different fiber types. Thus, regulating different fiber types at differing levels, would require more monitoring all the time and would produce limited benefits (51 FR 22682).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, OSHA believes that its conclusion to treat all asbestos fibers as having a similar potency in the occupational setting remains valid. Most of the evidence submitted to the remand rulemaking duplicated evidence submitted to the 1986 standards' record, or was cumulative to the earlier body of evidence. For example AIANA appended its 1988 submission to the EPA, consisting of numerous studies and reports. Some of these documents were considered by OSHA in the prior rulemaking. There, OSHA had stated that the 1983 Berry and Newhouse study of friction materials manufacturing workers which found nonsignificant increases in lung cancer mortality, was inconsistent with other studies showing that low level asbestos exposure resulted in excess lung cancer mortality, because of the relatively short follow up period used (51 FR 22618).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Maykapar, Moscow; UDC 533.6.011.5] </F>   [Abstract] The importance of estimating the attainable  lift-to-drag ratio and the facilities for increasing it in order  to determine the aircraft shape which ensures the necessary  lift-to-drag ratio at the design flight path section prompted an  analysis of lift-to-drag ratios at supersonic velocities. To  this end, flows behind a diagonal (oblique) shock and  rarefaction wave are considered ignoring friction loss for a  wing shaped as an infinite wedge and a triangular plate with  supersonic leading edges. The advantages of an oblique wing over  a delta wing are employed in a symmetric wing. The study shows  that the lift-to-drag ratio of an infinite oblique plate may be  considerably higher than that of triangular plates with  subsonic, sonic, and supersonic edges whereby a wing with  characteristic side edges is the simplest swept wing but only  until the velocity component behind the shock normal to the edge  reaches the speed of sound. Overall, a straight wedge with  lateral washers is the optimum bearing airframe shape. Analyses  shows that a combination of straight wedge airframe and plate  wing produce a noticeable lift-to-drag ratio gain due to a lift  redistribution between them.

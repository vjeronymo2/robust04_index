			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian natural rubber output continues to fall MALAYSIA'S production of natural rubber fell by 1 per cent to 391,278 tonnes in the first quarter of this year, according to the government statistics department. The fall is part of the continuing trend in Malaysian rubber production. Last year, production fell by 3 per cent to 1.25m tonnes as growers, frustrated by a prolonged period of low prices, switched to more profitable crops such as palm oil. There are also serious labour shortages on many plantations. Traders say there are now serious doubts that the government-projected production figure for this year of 1.3m tonnes can be met. In the first quarter of this year, Malaysian rubber exports totalled 351,159 tonnes - an 11 per cent drop on the same period last year. Malaysian officials expect cocoa production to fall 20 per cent to a five-year low of 184,000 tonnes this year as a prolonged price slump forces some growers to abandon the crop, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.</p>

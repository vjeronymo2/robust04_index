			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tay shares fall 10% on profits warning THE SHARE price of Tay Homes tumbled by 10 per cent yesterday to 151p after the company became the latest housebuilder to issue a profits warning. Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman, said that the collapse of the housing market last autumn meant that group pre-tax profit for the year to June 30 was unlikely to be as high as had been expected. Analysts yesterday cut their forecasts from about Pounds 6m to between Pounds 4m and Pounds 4.5m. This compares with pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.14m last year and Pounds 8.26m in 1990-91. Mr Spencer said that the group, like other housebuilders, had been hit by the devaluation of sterling last autumn which had dented the confidence of would-be buyers. Tay had been forced to reduce prices in order to maintain unit sales, which were expected to be similar to the 1,100 achieved in 1991-92. Average prices had fallen from Pounds 68,000 to Pounds 63,000 during the past 12 months. Sales, however, had improved sharply during the first three weeks of this year. 'Visitor levels have been high and sales good. We can only hope that this is the beginning of the long-awaited housing market recovery,' he said. Net borrowings at the end of December were Pounds 20.5m, representing 68 per cent of shareholders' funds.</p>

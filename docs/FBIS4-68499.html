			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, by unidentified </F> OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent under the rubric "You Talk--We  Listen"; place and date not given: "The Mayor of Moscow Explains  to Caucasus Natives Who Is Not Welcome in Moscow"]    [Text] Muscovites' relations with capital city  visitors have not been very smooth lately. Especially visitors  from the Caucasus. The Moscow militia is frequently accused of  purposeful persecution of "persons of Caucasus origin," while  rumor has it that the capital city authorities encourage these  unlawful actions. Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov does care about the  reputation of his city and the city authorities. Therefore he  decided to visit the Republic of Dagestan in order to discuss at  the point of origin the problem of relations between Muscovites  and Caucasus natives. After the trip, Yuriy Mikhaylovich shared  his impressions with a OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent.    [Luzhkov] When you have a problem, the best way is to go and  study it "at the source." In the beginning of March four  Dagestanis died in shoot outs here in Moscow. Some figures in  Dagestan began to distort the causes of these people's deaths; a  version began to circulate that they had died as a result of  negligence on the part of authorities, and that in general  Caucasus natives are treated badly in the capital city.    When I talked in Moscow with republic Supreme Soviet  Chairman  Magamedov and Ramazan Abdulatipov, they said that people need  objective first-hand information. Then I decided to make a trip  there and explain to Dagestanis what the situation in Moscow is,  how we feel about citizens of this republic, whom we welcome,  and whom we do not.    You may say that my visit was a complete success. We visited  cities and villages; I gave an interview on television, in which  I said that the main cause of crime is the dire economic state  of the republic. They have to deal with the unemployment  problem, use all production and natural resources to get rid of  this trouble--mass unemployment. Because many people from the  Caucasus go to Moscow and St. Petersburg and join criminal  groups because of poor conditions at home.    People kept asking me about registration of persons of  "Caucasus origin" in Moscow. I said: Dagestan is part of Russia;  none of our decrees say anything about registering citizens of  Russia, so this question is misdirected. Yes, we require that  Chechens be registered, because Chechnya proclaimed itself an  independent state. So let them register. As to what "a person of  Caucasus origin" is, I do not know. I know the Caucasus; I know  numerous nations that live in the Caucasus; they are all very  different, very original, and you cannot measure them all with  the same yardstick--this is absurd and illiterate. In my  opinion, crime does not have a nationality. If 50 percent of the  crimes in Moscow are committed by Russians, what do Dagestanis  have to do with it? If 10 percent of the crimes are committed by  Ukrainians, again, what do Dagestanis have to do with it? We do  not divide crime by ethnic attributes.    Speaking of the situation in Moscow, the problem of  interethnic relations has been resolved. I do not want to brag,  but I can say that Moscow remains a city of ethnic diversity,  where people live together peacefully, and we do not have  serious ethnic conflicts. We are currently opening Korean,  Georgian, Armenian, and Tatar schools in Moscow--to make things  easier and more comfortable for people of other nationalities  who live permanently in Moscow, so that they will not abandon  their culture, their language. This is very important.    Together with me on the visit to Dagestan was Yuriy  Tomashev,  first deputy chief of the city administration of internal  affairs [GUVD]; he brought additional information and handed it  over to Dagestani internal affairs organs and leadership. And  this problem got special emphasis in our joint protocol. We  agreed that it is necessary to keep each other informed on the  state of suppression of crime. Also that a representative of the  Dagestani Ministry of Internal Affairs will be assigned either  permanently or on an as-needed basis to work in the GUVD with  members of the capital city militia. So now we will fight crime  together, regardless of personalities and nationalities.</p>

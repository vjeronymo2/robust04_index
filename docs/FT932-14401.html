			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor coming to market with Pounds 25m tag FINE DECOR, a maker of wallpaper which exports to 30 countries, is set to come to the market in June through a placing that will value it at Pounds 25m. The Cheshire-based company demerged from Boots in 1991 via a management buy-out, six months after the chemist and DIY business acquired it as part of Ward White. Mr Harry Morgan, chief executive, who spent 16 years with Unilever before joining the group, says Fine Decor has no pretensions to the exclusive market addressed by Colefax &amp; Fowler or Osborne &amp; Little. 'We are trying to appeal to the international mass domestic market,' he says. 'The secret of our success is that we have identified areas of common ground (in our export markets) in terms of design and colour.' Given the sorry history of Coloroll - a company that looked very similar to Fine Decor when it set out - Mr Morgan is also keen to scotch ideas that it will try to grow quickly through acquisition, although some of the proceeds will be used to that end. 'It is not our intention to change the company other than its balance sheet.' Fine Decor will be coming to the market on the back of a forecast of interim results for the six months to July 1993. In the year to the end of January, sales increased 16 per cent to Pounds 33.2m and operating profits rose 83 per cent to Pounds 3m. Pre-tax profits were held back by the interest charge to Pounds 2.1m. The company is raising about Pounds 10m though the float - half of it for existing investors. The balance will repay the Pounds 5m of MBO debt, leaving the group broadly cash neutral. The MBO team paid Pounds 9m for the business, what Mr Morgan calls 'a 1980's price in 1991'. The MBO team will not be selling any shares and will end up with 20 per cent of the company - down from 30 per cent just before the float. About 40 per cent of Fine Decor's product is exported, most to North America followed by the EC. Mr Morgan says the company has grown despite the recession by taking market share, growing sales of co-ordinated textiles - which now appear alongside the wallpapers in the sample books - and by boosting sales of borders. The group has also sharply reduced its dependence on sales to FADS to only 20 per cent of total sales. Samuel Montagu is sponsoring the flotation.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Crash programme on VAT software - The panic as exporters prepare to meet EC statistical demands MR John Mirams, marketing director at International Software Marketing, found time to answer the telephone, but with difficulty. 'The world seems to have gone mad,' he said. 'People are panicking at the last moment.' The panic had been widely expected. Mr Mirams' company, a subsidiary of software group JBA, is one of a clutch of software houses across Europe doing hectic business as companies come belatedly to terms with the new VAT regulations with which they are now compelled to comply. The list includes major multinationals including the US-owned Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software, private companies with an international presence such as the UK's Coda, and fast expanding national champions like SAP of Germany. The threat of legal action against companies failing to meet the new reporting requirements seems to be concentrating minds wonderfully. The regulations are designed to do away with the paperwork that causes delays at border crossings. But they demand new and comprehensive statistical records of the movements of goods and lists of sales to companies in the Community. The most important new documents are the European Sales List (ESL), which details exports to people registered for VAT in other member states, and the Supplementary Statistical Declaration (SSD) which provides data for the Community's new trade statistics system. The most effective way of providing the new statistics is to extract them automatically from a company's comp-uterised accounting system; detailed changes to the software which are neither quick nor easy to carry out are required, however. A survey late last year by Andersen Consulting showed that UK companies believed their most serious challenge to be adapting their computer systems to generate the required information. The difficulties are exacerbated by lack of appreciation of the difficulties and a traditional reluctance among managers to deal with export issues. 'It has all been left to Fred in the Portacabin with his typewriter,' says Mr Mirams. Andersen's survey showed that across Europe 40 per cent of companies are still unready for the new regime. Software packages are one answer; among the dozen or so UK companies providing software which meet some or all of the new requirements are Albacore Systems, Computer Traffic, Fraser Williams Logistics, Langdon Systems, Telesmart and Vistec. ISM's product was developed by Sitpro, the UK organis-ation concerned with the simplification of international trade procedures. It runs on a personal computer. At a cost of about Pounds 4,600 for a single user it will generate all the necessary documentation. Mr Mirams is unwilling to quote sales figures but says the company has more than doubled its turnover this year. But estimating the size of the market for the new VAT software across Europe is complicated. Some 30,000 UK companies will have to submit detailed VAT returns but many of these will have modular accounting systems to which the new software can be linked without substantial mod-ifications. The new regulations are not necessarily a source of windfall profits for software houses, however. Those supplying mainframe accounting packages will have to spend rather than make money. The terms of their maintenance contracts with customers stipulates that new software to meet legal requirements has to be provided free. Mr Steve Lenehan, brand manager at Tetra, a leading accounting software supplier, points out that the company has spent Pounds 350,000 in copying new software for distribution to its customers and sent out 110,000 sheets of documentation. Mr David Turner of Coda says the company has spent more on modifications than it will recoup in fees. 'It is the first time in the recent history of accounting software that changes have had to be made because of legal requirements.' The software suppliers now have a brief breathing space. Entirely new software will be needed before 1997, when a Community-wide, harmonised VAT system is planned.</p>

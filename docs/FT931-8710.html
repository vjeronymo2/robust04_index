			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dorrell defends project funds plan THE government's policy of increasing the involvement of private finance in public projects is a long-term supply-side reform and not 'creative accounting', Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. He told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that the plans were a part of a long-term policy shift which aimed to see the government as an enabler, motivator and purchaser - rather than supplier - of services. Involving the private sector more in public projects was motivated by a wish to bring private-sector management skills and capital to the public sector. He rejected suggestions from MPs that the scheme was intended primarily to ease the public sector borrowing requirement, which the government has forecast will reach Pounds 37bn in 1992-93. Mr Dorrell said the new policy should increase overall infrastructure investment because investment by the private sector in public projects would no longer lead to corresponding reductions in government spending plans. The minister said Mr Kingsley Jones, a Treasury official, has been appointed to co-ordinate the initiative and said companies with questions about the scheme should contact him at the Treasury. Mr Dorrell also announced revised guidance procedures to increase the amount of contracting out of energy management by the public sector.</p>

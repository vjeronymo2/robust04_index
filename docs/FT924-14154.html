			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Management: Global executives walk a tightrope - How the new breed of managers can come to terms with a confusing world When the gospel of 'globalisation' first gripped western companies in the middle and late-1980s, many reacted crudely, as if national differences in markets and strategy suddenly mattered no longer. It has taken them several years to realise that there is no single 'correct' balance between global, regional and local strategies. Unlike most Japanese companies, they have found it hard to come to terms with the fact that the ideal mix varies not only across industries, but also inside them: between different businesses, product lines and even individual products within the same line. It also changes over time. Some companies have still not got that message about their strategies. So it is not surprising that many of the laggards - plus some which should know better - are now making a similar mistake over the sort of organisational changes they need to achieve their global strategies. The necessary changes include the re-design of structures, procedures, management career paths and, in most cases, the very tricky matter of organisational culture. On the structural front, the key internal question - as distinct from external ones such as how to manage alliances - has been how best to alter the roles, and power balance, between three types of executive: global business (or 'divisional') managers; national (or 'country') managers; and functional (such as production) managers . As far as career paths and culture are concerned, the much-hyped question for most companies over the last few years has been how to breed 'global managers', or at least executives with what has become known in academic and consultancy jargon as a 'global mindset'. Underlying both questions has been the universal need to streamline (or abandon) messy matrix structures in which power was shared - or, more often, fought over - between divisional, national and functional managers. In most multinationals, this traditional arrangement slowed decision-making and sustained (or created) whole tiers of costly head office jobs - both at the corporate centre and in each business. In today's competitive international environment, greater speed, leanness and cost-effectiveness are essential. As a result, most companies which want to 'go global' are swinging the balance of managerial power firmly towards the global divisional (or business) manager, and away from the national and functional managers. At ICI, Britain's leading chemicals group, and countless other companies, the divisions have been declared 'prime'. Once-mighty national managers have lost much of their power, as have - to varying degrees - the functional managers. Where a company makes standard, commodity products which really are global, or speciality items where the demands of customers vary only slightly between countries or regions, a stark arrangement of this kind may be sensible. But in most cases such an all-out drive for global efficiency takes too little account of the need to retain responsiveness to national differences, or even to increase it. The 'global first' approach also underplays the need to transfer skills and learning between national and product markets. But how can one accomplish both these things without recreating a ponderous formal matrix, or - in the words of a now fashionable refrain within multinationals - retraining almost every manager to 'think global, but act local'? The answer is to do neither, according to two of the most influential academics in the field of international organisation, Christopher Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal. Nor is it to relegate once-star country managers and functional executives to bit-parts. Instead, the answer is twofold, they argue in the latest issue of the Harvard Business Review*: to get away from the idea that there can be any such thing as a universal 'global manager', and instead to breed specialists of all three types: country; functional; and global business (or divisional). and to confine to the upper part of the organisation most of the complexities and internal conflicts of balancing global, regional and local requirements. While top managers and some senior executives should operate in a sort of matrix - or preferably in a more flexible 'network' - those lower down should have clear, single-line, responsibilities, performance measurements and reporting relationships. One benefit of this arrangement, say the academics, is that most companies will need relatively few really 'transnational' managers to implement their cross-border strategies. This is an important consideration since people with the necessary qualities are in short supply. Floris Maljers, the co-chairman of Unilever, says it is this shortage, rather than one of capital or any other resource, which has become the biggest constraint in most efforts at globalisation. Maljers has an article in the same issue of HBR about his company's experience. Outlining the roles and characteristics of their three types of 'global manager', Bartlett and Ghoshal draw on the experience of executives in various companies, especially Electrolux, NEC, and Procter &amp; Gamble, as well as Unilever. The academics say there are three roles at the heart of a global business manager's job: strategist for his or her organisation; architect of its worldwide 'asset and resource configuration'; and co-ordinator of international transactions. Country managers, by contrast, 'play the pivotal role not only in meeting local customer needs, but also in satisfying the host government's requirements and defending their company's market positions against local and external competitors'. In other words, country managers should be much more than the ambassadorial ciphers to which many have been reduced. Even more than country managers, functional executives have sunk to bit-part status in many multinationals. The academics use graphic language to describe the waste involved: 'relegated to support-staff roles, excluded from important meetings, and even dismissed as unnecessary overhead, functional managers are often given little chance to participate in, let alone contribute to, the global activity of the corporate mainstream. In some cases, top management has allowed staff functions to become a warehouse for corporate misfits or a graveyard for managerial has-beens. 'Yet, at a time when information, knowledge and expertise have become ever more specialised, an organisation can gain huge benefits by linking its technical, manufacturing, marketing, human resources, and financial experts worldwide". In sophisticated transnationals, senior functional executives serve as linchpins in the process of worldwide learning, connecting their areas of specialisation throughout the organisation. Bartlett and Ghoshal advocate some rotation between their three types of global specialist, whether through long-term appointments or membership of temporary teams and task forces. Unilever does both. The academics underplay the need for the relative power of the three types of manager to vary by industry, business and product line. But otherwise they provide invaluable advice on how to perform the ultimate organisational balancing act: reaping the benefits of global scale without losing innovation sparked by national differences - both in the marketplace and within the company. * HBR Sept-Oct. reprint 92502.

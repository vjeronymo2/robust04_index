			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen at top end of expectations with Pounds 25m POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and crushing equipment, yesterday reported profits at the top end of market expectations and said the current year had started well. Pre-tax profits increased by 35 per cent from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 25.3m in the year to March 31. The increase included a Pounds 3.33m exceptional profit on the sale of Guzzler, a US maker of vacuum cleaning equipment. The results were compiled under the FRS 3 accounting standard. Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said these were 'an excellent set of results' in the face of recession in the UK and a slowdown in Europe. There was concern about the German economy, but Italy was growing and the Netherlands was recovering. 'We will continue to grow in Europe, just not as fast,' he said. Turnover rose 32 per cent to Pounds 95.4m (Pounds 72.4m), including Pounds 4.37m of sales from acquisitions. These included CPV in the Republic of Ireland, which suffered from currency uncertainties and incurred a small loss. Sales to the Far East grew strongly and now account for nearly 10 per cent of turnover. Continental European sales increased by 2 percentage points to 30 per cent. Matbro, a maker of telescopic fork-lift vehicles acquired in 1991, more than doubled sales to Pounds 15.2m. Interest charges were Pounds 717,000 (Pounds 340,000). The sale of Guzzler lifted net cash at the year end to Pounds 17m. Earnings per share came through at 20.7p (16.3p). The recommended final dividend of 4.8p makes a total of 6.6p, up 10 per cent. COMMENT These results easily pleased Powerscreen's growing band of supporters in the City, which marked the shares up 17p to 337p. The company has scarcely put a foot wrong in the last six years of rising profits, and analysts pointed to Matbro's latest results as indicative that Powerscreen's manufacturing and marketing techniques can still be propegated in new niches. This year, all companies in the group are projecting profits increases and the Far East is likely to pick up any slack from continental Europe. But with full year group profit forecasts of Pounds 26m putting the shares on 15 times, all this good news appears to be in the price.</p>

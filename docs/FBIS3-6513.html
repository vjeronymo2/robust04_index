			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vietnamese and Thai deputy finance ministers held  consultations in Hanoi yesterday. The Thai side proposed that  Thailand and Vietnam take the lead to organize a meeting of six  countries situated in the Mekong River basin in order to develop  together the Mekong River basin. About 26 projects have been  proposed by the Asian Development Bank for the development of  the Mekong River basin.    Deputy Finance Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri granted an  interview to reporters in Hue, Vietnam, yesterday afternoon.    [Begin recording] [Trairong] Among these six countries,  Thailand and Vietnam are the strongest countries since China  will involve only one province. Thailand and Vietnam are  stronger than the others. The six countries are China's Yunnan  Province, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand.  Therefore, what is agreed by Thailand and Vietnam, I think it  would be concurred by the other countries.    [Unidentified reporter] Regarding the project to take water  from the Mekong River for use in our country, will there be any  objection from other countries?    [Trairong] This matter has already been discussed by the  Thai prime minister. Therefore, there is no need for me to talk  about it. The project to divert water from the Mekhong River  for consumption is a high-level issue. Thai and Vietnamese  prime ministers have discussed this issue. I, therefore, do not  have to talk about it. We only discussed 26 projects including  issues of the Mekong River, electricity, roads, railways,  airports, tourism, environment, assistance in the field of  education, and so on.

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / De Klerk hints at land sales South Africa's first moves towards privatisation would probably be through the sale of surplus government land, Mr F W de Klerk, the deputy president, said in London yesterday. He suggested there was also scope for running down state oil reserves. The sale of shares in state companies was not likely to be the first item on the agenda. Parastatal companies were being put on to a proper commercial basis, in terms of their board and management structures. In this way, 'the table was being set for privatisation.' Mr de Klerk said telecommunications was a dynamic sector, but if he was asked to guess which company would be privatised first, 'I would put my money on South African Airways.' Earlier this week, Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister in charge of the reconstruction and development programme, reiterated his opposition to selling off either Telkom, transport conglomerate Transnet, or electricity utility Eskom, saying that they were too valuable to the country's development goals to be taken out of state hands.</p>

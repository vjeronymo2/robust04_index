			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Demand is heavy for Scotia placing THE placing of shares in Scotia Holdings, a budding research-based pharmaceutical company that has financed its growth from sales of products based on evening primrose oil, was subscribed more than 3.5 times. The company said demand had been such that it increased the amount it had raised from Pounds 30m to Pounds 40.6m, and that the placing price of 290p had been at the top end of expectations. The offer of 14m shares, about 22.5 per cent of Scotia's enlarged capital, values the company at Pounds 181m. Institutions are likely to be scaled back more than private investors who applied through financial intermediaries. Trading will begin on October 25. The directors have sold none of their stakes and have agreed not to sell any shares for at least 360 days. Scotia will use the proceeds of the float to repay debt and fund development of a number of products in the late stage of clinical trials. The company has five drugs, all developed from an understanding of lipids which make up the structure of membranes of cells. The products are either in or about to start the third phase of clinical trials. Mr David Horrobin, chief executive and founder, says he is hopeful all five will reach the market. The three most advanced projects address widely different clinical conditions. EF4, which probably has the biggest potential market, would address diabetic neuropathy - a condition which leaves diabetics with damaged peripheral blood vessels leading to neurological problems. The drug is in phase-three trials. The second drug, EF13, is being investigated as a potential anti-cancer agent that could prolong life in patients diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer. The third most advanced product, EF27, is designed to reduce the harmful side-effects of radiotherapy, which is used on half of patients with cancer. Radiotherapy's effectiveness is limited by the damage done to skin. Scotia is unusual among new drug companies in that it has concentrated on lipid technology, a field where it has been left largely unchallenged.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round talks halted in their tracks NEGOTIATIONS on reducing tariffs in the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have ground to a halt because of unresolved differences between the US and EC. The March 31 deadline for completion of the tariff negotiations, an integral part of the Round, is now certain to be missed and with it the Easter deadline for concluding the Round as a whole. All four 'tracks' of negotiations intended to achieve a successful outcome to the Round are in trouble. Apart from the detailed bargaining on tariffs and market access for goods (track 1), the country-by-country talks on services (track 2) are also way behind schedule. Even the formal legal drafting exercise (track 3) is proving controversial, as some countries try to re-open issues ostensibly already settled. Finally, there has been no breakthrough in the all-important bilateral talks between the US and EC on cutting farm subsidies, which would enable the EC to subscribe to the draft Uruguay Round package of accords presented last December (track 4). Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, has already conceded that the Easter deadline could slip by a few weeks. But, by common consent, the issues at stake require not time, but political will to make the necessary compromises. Most negotiators believe that, if the farm subsidy deadlock can be broken, other problems can be solved fairly quickly. If the Round is not completed by late spring, the negotiations are likely to go into limbo until after the US presidential election in November. At yesterday's stocktaking meeting of the market access negotiations, many countries expressed frustration at the lack of progress because of stalemate in the US/EC bilateral talks. The outcome of these talks will largely determine the pattern of tariff reductions for all 108 participants in the Uruguay Round.</p>

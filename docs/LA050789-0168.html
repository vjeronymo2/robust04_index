			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO SCHOOLS MAY 9 BOND ELECTION  </P> <P> Over the past several weeks, a number of articles have appeared in newspapers  regarding the $85-million school bond issue proposed by the Capistrano Unified  School District, which is to be decided by voters at the special election  scheduled for May 9. In these articles, as well as in comments made to various  citizen groups, it appears that representatives of CUSD have attempted to  deceive voters.  </P> <P> As a case in point, statements have been made that senior citizens, age 62 and  older, will be exempt from the annual property tax assessment. This is only  partially true, since this exemption is not automatic; it is dependent upon  each senior making a request for such exemption annually; unlike the homeowner  property tax credit, which is requested once and remains in effect so long as  the taxpayer owns that property, to avoid the school bond assessment a senior  must request an exemption each year.  </P> <P> At a meeting of the San Clemente Citizens Growth Management Committee, an  official of CUSD, when asked why this issue was not placed on the November  ballot, thus avoiding the cost (more than $100,000) of a special election, he  replied that CUSD felt that the measure would not have much chance of being  approved on the November ballot. In essence, this official was saying that the  only chance of passing this measure is to schedule a vote on it at a time when  enough people who are opposed to it will not show up to vote.  </P> <P> There is no question that CUSD needs more classrooms, given the pace of  development in south Orange County. But the real issue is: Who has caused this  need for more classrooms and who should pay for it?  </P> <P> Obviously, the people who have lived here for a considerable period of time  have not caused the need; yet, under Measure A, these people will be paying for  years to come. Obviously, the need for additional classrooms is caused by new  development.  </P> <P> The most equitable way to finance new school facilities is to incorporate a fee  into the cost of the new homes whose residents are creating the need.  </P> <P> THOMAS L. PADBERG  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

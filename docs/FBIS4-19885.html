			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Initial Appraisals"] </F>   [Text] Given the hitherto negative, almost hostile,  atmosphere and our fear of a lack of U.S. understanding of Greek  affairs, we must conclude that rather positive results, as well  as some other disturbing puzzles for the Cyprus issue and  Greek-Turkish relations, have emerged from the talks between  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    It is positive that President Clinton recognized that  Greece's concern over the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia--FYROM] issue was justified, stressing that these  concerns "have their roots in ancient and modern history."    It is positive that Clinton said "We are concerned about the  Greek minority in Albania" and pointed out that Greece is  addressing the problem "with wisdom and sound judgment."    It is positive that President Clinton expressed his interest  in the Ecumenical Patriarchate to the Turkish prime minister.    It is positive that the road is open for Greek-U.S. economic  cooperation aimed at their business infiltration into the  Balkans.    This cooperation is backed-up by the U.S. with $1 billion,  which shows their recognition of Greece's role in the region and  its possibilities for peace initiatives.    It is not easy to appraise the practical results of these  initially positive elements now because certainly things were  said at the talks which were not announced at the joint news  conference.    The Cyprus issue remains a puzzle as President Clinton  referred to the mediator for its solution, and Andreas  Papandreou merely said that there is "good news" about the  promotion of the confidence-building measures.    Greek-Turkish affairs also remain a puzzle -- except for the  Patriarchate issue. President Clinton expressed his wishes for  Greek-Turkish cooperation; he pointed out the Turkish  Government's concern over the increase of Islamism, and asked  Greece to contribute to European assistance to Turkey and to  cooperate with it. However, he did not say what Turkey, which  constantly provokes Greece, should do.    At any rate, the meeting showed that there are grounds for  further understanding and development of Greek-U.S. relations  and, with all the necessary reservations, this is rather  positive.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Observer: Site challenge Gleave's city of Glasgow seems out to disrupt the plans of effervescent Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland, to extend his empire in Edinburgh with the opening there of a new gallery of Scottish art. It is the pushy Glaswegians who are making the running with sites for the display of Scottish painting down the centuries. They have already offered the trustees of the National Gallery, led by merchant banker Angus Grossart, free-of-charge space either next to their Kelvingrove Park art gallery or in the old sheriff court building in the city centre. By contrast the more complacent Edinburgh has offered no free sites. Either way, Scottish secretary Ian Lang will have a knotty decision to make when the trustees put their recommendation to him, probably next month. Unless he is willing to punish Edinburgh for failing to make more of a play for the new institution, he could be seen as penalising Glasgow for not electing any Conservative MPs.</p>

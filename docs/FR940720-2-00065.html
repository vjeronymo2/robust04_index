The original owner was Elk Tongue, a northern Piegan. The bundle was subsequently transferred through a series of bundle keepers_Hairy Belly, Not Good, Scraping White, Wolf Bull, and Little Dog_before being sold to Madge Hardin Walters of San Diego, CA. The Denver Art Museum purchased the bundle from Ms. Walters in 1940. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evidence provided by the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, on the behalf of Mr. George G. Kipp, III, and Mrs. Melinda Kipp, confirms that the Elk Tongue Beaver Bundle is needed by traditional Blackfeet religious leaders for the practice of traditional Blackfeet religion by present day adherents. The Pikuni Traditionalist Association, Chief Leonard Bastien of the Piegan Nation, Alberta, Canada, and the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council unanimously support Mr. and Mrs. Kipp as the appropriate bundle keepers. The Denver Art Museum's Collection Committee and Board of Trustees has reviewed the request for repatriation and has no objection. The Elk Tongue Beaver Bundle has been loaned to the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, on the behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Kipp, pending publication of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorities of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have been contacted regarding applicability of Federal endangered species statutes to this transfer and have concurred in the conclusion that the object is not covered due to its age. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this object should contact Dr. Nancy J. Blomberg, Curator of Native Arts, Denver Art Museum, 100 W. 14th Avenue Parkway, Denver, CO 80204, telephone: (303) 839&hyph;4806 before August 19, 1994. Repatriation of the object to the Blackfeet Nation, on behalf of George and Melinda Kipp, may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=34 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 14, 1994 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Dr. Francis P.

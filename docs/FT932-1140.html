			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Clarke warns he might raise taxes: Chancellor says Lamont's medium-term projections would leave deficit too high MR Kenneth Clarke has issued a blunt warning that he will be to ready to raise taxes in his November Budget unless an acceleration in the pace of economic recovery brings a faster reduction in government borrowing. In an interview with the Financial Times - his first with a newspaper since he became chancellor last month - Mr Clarke said the medium-term projections set by Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, would leave the deficit at too high a level. He emphasised that a decision on whether to raise additional tax revenue would not be made until three or four weeks before the Budget. He would then have a much clearer idea of the strength of recovery and the extent to which it would reduce the level of borrowing. He left no doubt of his readiness to take tough decisions if he thought it necessary. Mr Clarke signalled also that there was no immediate prospect of a further reduction in interest rates, emphasising that economic recovery was now under way and that he was determined not to take risks with inflation. He said he had decided to 'sit on the fence' in the political debate about independence for the Bank of England, saying: 'There's nothing that's going to happen in a hurry on the central bank front.' The chancellor said economic growth alone could not close the Pounds 50bn annual gap in the government's finances. Based on current tax, spending and economic growth projections, the deficit would fall to about 4 per cent of national income by 1996-97. 'Where we stand at the mo-ment . . . the forecast I have indicates that the deficit is too high.' He rejected as 'unrealistic' the idea that the government could squeeze public spending below the ceilings agreed by the cabinet for the next three years. The remit given to EDX, the cabinet committee charged with setting the Whitehall budget, had been the toughest in recent memory. Mr Clarke acknowledged that his judgment on whether to add to the Pounds 10bn of tax increases announced in March would depend on whether the overall economic outlook had improved by the autumn. He declined to offer his own forecast of likely economic growth, but hinted that the Treasury's predictions in March might be revised upwards. 'The stronger or more sustained growth becomes, the less likely I am to look at the tax side of the account. If growth shows signs of faltering or weakening, the more likely I am to look for revenue.' Mr Clarke also declared that he would have no fixed target for the level of sterling as long as it remained outside the European exchange rate mechanism. He was concerned over sharp movements in either direction, but the value of the pound would influence rather than dictate the overall stance of monetary policy.

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Gore in new look at flood control STATE floodplain managers have begun working with the White House to develop new approaches to flood control, in the wake of this year's devastating Mississippi floods. Mr Larry Larson, head of the floodplain management and dam safety programmes for Wisconsin and executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said yesterday his organisation had begun to work with Vice President Al Gore and hoped to work out better ways of keeping people out of harm's way. 'We as floodplain managers would hate to see the people affected by this flood walk away thinking it will never happen again. It will happen again,' Mr Larson said. Mr Larson warned that many of the earthwork levees built along the river were only designed to contain much lesser degrees of flooding. Sandbag barricades on top of the levees simply increased the pressure elsewhere. 'Many of the people along the river understood that if that levee on the other side of the river failed, their levee would be under much less pressure,' he said. Alternatives to building more and higher levees included relocating individual buildings or whole communities on higher ground, or lifting building foundations. Some small towns badly hit by this year's floods have already started discussions with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the possibility of moving to higher ground. Mr Larson's call was echoed by Mr Kevin Coyle, head of the American Rivers environmental group. Mr Coyle urged the White House to appoint a commission to rethink the management of the Mississippi basin, and to throw its weight behind a reform of the government flood insurance programme, which he said had encouraged people to build in the path of likely flooding. President Bill Clinton will sign a Dollars 6.3bn flood relief bill today in St Louis, heart of the flood-stricken Midwest, Reuter reports.</p>

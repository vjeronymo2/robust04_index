			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan remains vigilant on inflow of foreign funds TAIWAN has had to slow inflows of foreign investment funds but remains committed to deregulating and internationalising its markets, Mr Samuel Shieh, governor of the island's central bank, said yesterday. Mr Shieh told an audience of London brokers and investing institutions he had decided to limit the remittance of foreign currencies to buy Taiwanese equities because of concern about upward pressure on the Taiwan dollar. 'It is our policy to allow the funds to come in, but we also have to observe some kind of stability of the exchange rate,' he said. 'Our economy is very export-oriented.' Inflows of between Dollars 20m and Dollars 50m distorted the exchange rate because the foreign exchange market in Taipei was very thin, doing business of only Dollars 30m to Dollars 80m a day, he said. Restrictions have been modified since the central bank suspended approvals in February. Mr Shieh said the present policy was for each investing institution or broker to negotiate a timing schedule with the central bank before approval could be given. Foreign brokers say they are generally able to obtain approval for remittances of Dollars 5m per week for each investment scheme. One investor told Mr Shieh it was a matter of concern that 'we can only in invest in Taiwan when it suits you'. Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers, asked what could be done to expand the size of the foreign exchange market. He said further moves to open Taiwan's markets would be beneficial. Mr Shieh said Taiwan had gone some way towards opening a foreign exchange market. However, the move was sensitive because of the risk of excessive speculation. 'The goal (of internationalisation) is to your liking. But the speed may not be to your liking.' Taiwan was discussing aid to the former Soviet bloc with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Mr Shieh said. He was a guest of Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD chairman, at its annual meeting in Budapest this week.</p>

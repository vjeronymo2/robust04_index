			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 4 (YONHAP) -- Foreign ministers of  nonaligned countries demanded Friday [3 June] that North Korea  cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in  its efforts to carry out full inspections of the Yongbyon  nuclear reactor, which the IAEA believes is the center of the  North's suspected nuclear ambitions.    An official statement, adopted at the end of a four-day  meeting here of foreign ministers from 85 nonaligned countries,  stressed the need for a peaceful resolution of the issue through  continuing dialogue and negotiations among relevant parties,  particularly among the United States, the IAEA and North Korea.    North Korea had fiercely lobbied the delegates to the 11th  conference of nonaligned foreign ministers to make no mention of  the IAEA and the North Korean nuclear issue in the draft  declaration, according to conference sources.    The conference, however, ignored these efforts in an  apparent  setback for North Korea in the Nonalignment Movement, they said.    A delegate from Singapore said it was impossible for the  declaration not to mention the IAEA, adding that the Nonaligned  Movement would have lost prestige in the international community  had it not touched on the nuclear issue.    A substantial part of the 66-page declaration, meanwhile,  was  given over to emphasizing the need to change the direction of  the Nonaligned Movement in the post-Cold War era.    In the declaration, the nonaligned countries pledged to  strengthen cooperation among developing countries on the basis  of mutual understanding and reliance and to pursue dialogue with  the developed industrial world so as to promote international  economic cooperation.    Criticizing the rich industrial countries for employing  various forms of protectionism in international trade at a time  when developing nations are trying to adopt open market  policies, the declaration claimed the industrialized world has  denied developing states access to advanced technology by  blocking technology transfers, citing concerns over military  applications.    Touching on regional conflicts, the declaration urged the  immediate signing of a ceasefire between South and North Yemen,  denounced the Israelis for their air raids on Lebanon Thursday  and demanded that Iraq respect the sovereignty and borders of  Kuwait.    The nonaligned foreign ministers decided to hold a  nonaligned  summit conference in Cartagena, Colombia, in September 1995.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / TGWU to present shake-up plan THE TGWU general union will tomorrow announce the biggest shake-up in its history as it attempts to overcome a deep organisational and financial crisis. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, Britain's largest union, will announce the first findings of a management consultancy report by Klein &amp; Co, the US-based union consultants, which is likely to recommend cutting some of the 11 regions and reducing their financial and political autonomy. The union's right wing, which has its power base in the regions, is ready to accept the phasing-out of the smaller regions - probably the south coast, east coast and north-east, all of which have fewer than 50,000 members. It may, however, resist the challenge to the financial powers of the regions that would come from centralising the payment of union dues. Klein is also expected to recommend reducing the 14 trade groups, making better use of the union's computers and introducing proper budgets and financial planning. Some of those points may emerge at a later stage in the consultancy exercise. The central drive of the changes will be to roll back some of the legacy of decentralisation left by Mr Frank Cousins and Mr Jack Jones, leaders in the 1960s and 1970s, who reacted against the centralised, authoritarian regime of the 1940s and 1950s. Mr Morris, who is backed by the dominant broad-left faction on the union executive, wants to bring in the changes without reviving the political in-fighting for which the union is well known. He will need to take further tough rationalisation decisions - on top of the recent increase in union dues - if the TGWU is to start breaking even. The union expects to raise nearly Pounds 1m a month from the 18 per cent increase in dues agreed in February. But some TGWU officials say privately that the financial crisis is even worse than the published estimates have so far revealed. The union suffered a Pounds 10m deficit last year. Before the rise in contributions, a deficit of Pounds 11.6m had been expected for this year. Planned savings of Pounds 5m this year from rationalisation and job cuts will thus have to go ahead.</p>

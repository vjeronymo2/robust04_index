Provincial party Deputy Secretary Zhi  Yiming, Vice Govenor Xu Shanlin, and leaders from the Ministry  of State Security attended and addressed the meeting. Zhang  Yongkui, chief of the Shaanxi Provincial State Security  Department, made a work report.    The meeting pointed out: Since the introduction of reform  and opening up in Shaanxi, the situation has developed very  fast. But the better the situation, the more we should heighten  our vigilance. At present, the world is not quite peaceful,  factors causing instability are increasing, and spy and  intelligence organizations as well as some hostile forces  outside the borders keep carrying out sabotage activities. The  province has a heavy task of defending state security. Viewed  from the angle of opposing peaceful evolution and preserving the  country's prolonged stability and tranquility, we must correctly  understand the importance of strengthening state security,  remain sober-minded and maintain vigilance against enemy  movements on the concealed front, and strengthen the province's  state security.    The meeting requested all offices, mass organizations,  enterprises, and institutions to frequently carry out education  on state security among their personnel, to solidly cultivate  the mentality of everyone being responsible for state security,  to help state security institutions with their work, and to  crack down on all kinds of crimes damaging state security to  ensure the smooth carrying out of reform, opening up, and  economic construction.</p>

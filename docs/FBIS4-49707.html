			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 8 (XINHUA) -- China is planning to apply  for foreign loans to construct ports along the Chang Jiang  River, according to the Administration of Navigation and  Transportation Services of the Chang Jiang River under the  Ministry of Communications.    The foreign loans might come from the World Bank, the Asian  Development Bank and foreign governments, and the related  departments are now making efforts to fulfill the applications,  according to an official of the administration.    He said that the ports to be constructed by foreign loans  include those at Jiujiang, Wuhu, Maanshan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang,  Jiangyin and Gaogang.    The total investment for the construction will be more than  10 billion yuan in a period of ten years, he said.    After the projects are completed, more than 20 berths will  be  put into use and the handling capacity of the ports will  increase by more than 20 million tons.    Over the past decade, the transportation services along the  Chang Jiang River had grown rapidly. There are now more than  3,000 corporations in the services and their annual transport  capacity reached 12 million tons.    Now there are 25 main ports along the Chang Jiang River and  the handling capacity was 158 million tons last year.    Among them, 13 have been approved as open ports to foreign  ships.</p>

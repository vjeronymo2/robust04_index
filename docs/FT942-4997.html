			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Booked up for knights of Polish passion: Harlequin's eastern promise Polish men used to take their gallant reputation seriously: this is a country where coal miners would kiss a lady's hand on introduction at the picket line. But since the collapse of communism, Polish women in search of a white knight turn increasingly to Polish translations of romance novels published by the local subsidiary of Canadian-based Harlequin company. Over the past two years, Polish women, like those in Hungary and the Czech Republic, have fallen for the western charms of Harlequin heroes as avidly as their men have taken to the western pornography once banned by communist censors. While the competition to satisfy eastern Europe's appetite for pornography is fierce, over the past three years Harlequin, which trades in the UK as Mills and Boon, has managed to establish the same market dominance east of the Elbe that it exerts in western Europe and North America. More than 90 per cent of the 24m romance novels sold in Poland last year were Harlequins, and the company enjoys similar sales levels in Hungary and the Czech Republic. This year, Harlequin is pedalling passion even further east, through new subsidiaries in Bulgaria and possibly Russia, where the company is conducting a trial run. Harlequin is the McDonald's of romance: its product is inexpensive, mass produced and offers the same, reliable story-line in dozens of languages every month. In Poland, this approach has allowed Arlekin, Harlequin's fully owned local subsidiary, to become the nation's largest foreign publisher, with monthly sales approaching 2m and a gross profit of nearly Dollars 2m last year, with a full-time staff of only 11. Harlequin paperbacks, with their covers of couples locked in romantic embraces, are now a common sight in Polish bookstores. But to market Harlequins in Poland, Mrs Nina Kowalewska, the managing director of Arlekin, first had to promote a feminine version of the capitalist dream which has conquered eastern Europe: a romantic love match with an invariably well-heeled Prince Charming. First, she blitzed the country with television advertisements in which a woman, sitting in a grey apartment on a grey sofa, finds herself in a bright, elegant, expensively furnished home, with a well-dressed man at her elbow. As a male voice croons 'enter the garden of love', several Harlequin novels appear on the screen. Mrs Kowalewska followed up her visual assault with an even more direct effort to make the western woman's romantic idyll a part of post-communist Polish culture: in 1992 she introduced Valentine's Day into Poland. Harlequin held a Valentine's Day party for its main subscribers and assorted politicians, created a Valentine's Day package for television and offered romantic holidays and a Nissan Micro car as Valentine's Day prizes to its readers in a lottery-style draw. Mrs Kowalewska, one of Poland's best known businesswomen, has also employed less glamorous marketing techniques. She insists on high production standards, printing Polish Harlequins in Germany because no Polish press can cope with such a high volume. Mrs Kowalewska stresses that 'you will never find a spelling mistake or typographical error in our books'. High production quality is a necessary defence for Mrs Kowalewska, who must counter the soft but incessant grumbling of Polish intellectuals. They resent the replacement of the high-brow literary classics such as the epic poem Pan Tadeusz, by 19th century writer Adam Mickiewicz, which once provided a refuge from the reality of communism, with the popular culture of Harlequin novels. But Mrs Kowalewska, who admits that Harlequins are 'entertainment, not literature', enjoys a subtle revenge for the intellectuals' put-downs. High culture in Poland is strapped for cash now that subsidies have ended, and many Polish writers are making ends meet by translating Harlequin romances from English to Polish. 'As a result, Harlequins are better written in Polish than in English,' Mrs Kowalewska says, adding with a polite smile, 'in this way we can also help to subsidise high culture'. Her final defence, taken up on the pages of a Polish political journal, is that while western feminists might criticise romance novels for perpetuating sexist stereotypes, in Poland, such writing is in the vanguard of the struggle for women's rights. 'Polish men are rough, crude and exploitative,' Mrs Kowalewska says. 'Readers tell us that after reading Harlequins they no longer put up with that kind of treatment. They demand to be treated as partners and to be cherished.' Despite the quiet scorn of Polish intellectuals and the mounting trepidation of Polish men, this appears to be a message which Polish women are willing to spend billions of zlotys a year to hear.</p>

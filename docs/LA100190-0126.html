			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GANSLER RETAINED TO COACH U.S. NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM  </P> <P> Bob Gansler will be retained as coach of the U.S. national soccer team, the new  president of the U.S. Soccer Federation said today.  </P> <P> Alan Rothenberg, who replaced Werner Fricker as head of the USSF after the  World Cup, said he anticipated that Gansler would remain as coach through the  1994 World Cup, the first to be played in the United States.  </P> <P> However, Rothenberg refused to guarantee that Gansler would remain four more  years.  </P> <P> "He's there, and the expectation is he'll see us through until 1994,"  Rothenberg said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> Gansler took over the team in January, 1989, and led the United States to its  first World Cup berth since 1950. However, the team lost three straight games  at the World Cup and finished 23rd among 24 nations. Overall, the United States  is 7-11 this year.  </P> <P> "At this point, I have no reason to make a change," said Rothenberg, a Los  Angeles lawyer who was commissioner of soccer at the 1984 Olympics. "It's a  dual thing, evaluating his performance and evaluating what the alternatives  are. We want him to continue, and nobody has dropped on our lap that will be a  superman. There's no reason to make a change."  </P> <P> The USSF made overtures to Franz Beckenbauer, who retired as West German coach  after his team won the World Cup. Beckenbauer then signed as technical director  of Olympique Marseilles in France.  </P> <P> Gansler is making $100,000 this year; his contract automatically renews each  year unless it is terminated.  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Birt to meet all 23,000 staff on BBC's future MR JOHN BIRT, BBC director-general, is pushing ahead with an ambitious and costly scheme to invite all 23,000 staff to one-day discussions about the future of the corporation. Staff will come from BBC offices throughout the UK to sessions in London. The former Radio Times offices in Marylebone High Street will be refurbished at a cost of more than Pounds 3m for the purpose. The refurbished premises will also be able to be used for general training. The sessions for small groups of employees are expected to begin in June and will be held on every working day until next spring. Apart from discussions there will be video presentations. Mr Birt will appear personally for at least part of each day's session so that over the course of the year he will be able to meet all the BBC staff. The sessions are designed to cover everything from the principles behind Extending Choice, the BBC's policy for the future, to Producer Choice, the controversial system of giving producers the right to buy services on the open market. The plan for the discussion sessions was mentioned briefly on January 11 when Mr Birt outlined his policy for the future but was hardly noticed at the time. In fact planning for the unprecedented exercise had already begun. Advertisements for staff to run the operation appeared in this week's Ariel, the BBC's house magazine. The advertisements are for 'facilitors' who will help with the discussions and for members of a support team. The support team will provide 'active professional support on presenters and facilitators, handling efficiently the complex logistics inherent in making these days happen'. The support team contracts are for one year. Previous director-generals have set out to meet as many BBC staff as possible and explain their policies but they have done so by going to the staff rather than bringing staff to them. One of the important principles behind Extending Choice was to create a more efficient and accountable BBC. The BBC says it looked at the possibility of taking the discussion sessions to the regions but decided it would be more effective to have them at one site in London. Last month Mr Birt survived calls for his resignation after it was discovered that throughout his time as deputy director-general he had not been on the BBC staff. Instead he had been a free-lance consultant whose services were contracted through his private company John Birt Productions. Mr Birt is now on the staff of the BBC.</p>

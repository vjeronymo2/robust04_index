The Iranian experts intend to fly to Stepanakert to  participate in the investigation of the aircrash on the spot.    It became known from reliable sources that the recording of  the talk between traffic controllers of the Yerevan airport and  the crew of the Iranian plane was sealed and would be studied by  experts.    The C-130 plane had to fly through the Armenian airspace  bound for Tehran, but deviated 100 kilometres from the route for  unknown reasons.    It thus got into the airspace of Azerbaijan and crashed  three  kilometres off Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

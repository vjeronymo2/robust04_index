			<p>BFN     [Text] News section--The director general for foreign press  and mass media at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance  wrote to invite the chief editors of the country's newspapers to  participate in a meeting on Saturday afternoon, 14 May (today)  with American chief editors affiliated with the Association of  American Chief Editors. The invitation makes no mention of the  topics to be discussed and gives no explanation on the objective  of this meeting.    It is still not clear who invited the American editors to  Iran or why the foreign press and mass media director general at  the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance has extended this  invitation to the American journalists.    Over the past years, America has made extensive and futile  efforts to find a way to open the door to dialogue with the  Islamic Republic of Iran. Apparently a dialogue between the  American and Iranian chief editors is a new ploy by the  Americans to achieve their goal. During the past 15 years,  American publications have disseminated the most poisonous  propaganda against the Islamic revolution, Imam Khomeyni, and  the Islamic Republic of Iran. Journalism is one of the masks  that the Americans use to send their spies to other countries,  and the American journalists who have visited the Islamic  Republic of Iran have always disseminated false and biased  reports about Iran.    With its clear assessment of such dialogues, JOMHURI-YE  ESLAMI refuses to attend this meeting. There is still no  precise information on whether the chief editors of other  newspapers will or will not attend this dialogue.</p>

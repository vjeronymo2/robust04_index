			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / 'Roll up sleeves' - Kohl Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday called for 'unconventional solutions' and new labour practices to pull Germany out of its worst post-war recession, Reuter reports. Harking back to Bonn's 'economic miracle' of the post-war years, he told a business conference that Germans should 'roll up our sleeves in the current recession and structural crisis, just as we did with great success in the 1950s'. 'We need a healthy economy (with) secure and competitive jobs,' he told the conference organised by the German Chamber of Handicrafts in Karlsruhe.</p>

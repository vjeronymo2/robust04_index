			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 10, BNS -- The meeting with Danish  Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen outlined the limits of  aid available within NATO's Partnership for Peace program,  Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik said today after his return  from Denmark where the three Baltic foreign ministers met with  their Danish counterpart.    Luik said that Denmark as a NATO member state admits the  possibility of NATO taking part in building out Estonia's border  defense system.    The foreign minister said the possibility of joint military  exercises was also discussed. "The first major joint maneuvers  will be conducted in 1994," he said. "Germany, Poland and  Denmark, and most probably also the Baltic states will take part  in maritime exercises this summer."    Luik said great importance was attached to Estonia sending  in  the near future a liaison officer to NATO planning division that  works out the plans for all the alliance's military operations.    The Baltic foreign ministers and their Danish counterpart  discussed also the formation of a Baltic peacekeeping unit.  Luik said the Danish officials regard it as having good  prospects and are prepared to train military personnel for it.    Luik said the Danish parliament is going to discuss  financial  aid for the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and the Estonian  border guards. "If the parliament approves an aid program, we  will probably receive more up-to-date communications and  transport equipment," he predicted.    The meeting between the foreign ministers touched on the  Baltic states' relations with the European Union. "European  Union member states accept us as future members of the union,"  Luik said.    Another subject discussed in Copenhagen was the situation in  Russia. Luik said Danish foreign policy leaders expressed great  concern over the state of affairs in Russia. "There's no reason  for panic, of course, but Russia's leaders must be shown calmly,  through clear foreign political moves, what the bounds of  international behavior are," the Estonian foreign minister  declared.</p>

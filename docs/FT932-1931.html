			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Guatemala's new president predicts end to civil war GUATEMALA'S new president, Mr Ramiro de Leon, has announced a campaign against corruption and poverty, and predicted an end to the Central American nation's 32-year-old civil war, Reuter reports from Guatemala City. In his first national televised address since taking office on June 6, Mr de Leon announced on Sunday the formation of a social investment fund and said the finance ministry would redirect government spending to battle rural poverty and finance a 'massive' literacy campaign. Mr de Leon was elected by Congress five days after the ousting of President Jorge Serrano on June 1, and will serve until January 1996, when Mr Serrano's five-year term was due to end. Mr Serrano was toppled one week after he had seized near-dictatorial powers, and Mr de Leon's interim presidency is seen as crucial for putting Guatemala's young democracy back on track. Pledging to fire and prosecute government officials found guilty of corruption, Mr de Leon said programmes to eradicate poverty, human rights abuses and injustice, would win support from the country's leftist guerrillas.</p>

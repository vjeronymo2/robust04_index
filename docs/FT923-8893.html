			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Insurers under pressure COMPOSITE insurers were lower ahead of interim figures next week as worries over the groups' high exposure to mortgage indemnity problems prompted yet more cuts in profits forecasts by brokerage firms. Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance were the principal casualties, the former losing 17 to 167p and the latter 7 to 251p. Smith New Court has reduced its 1993 forecast for Royal to Pounds 7m from Pounds 80m and believes it will announce a nominal one penny dividend at the interim stage against 11.25p last year. It has almost halved its 1993 estimate for Sun Alliance to Pounds 96m. Insurance analyst Mr Steven Bird said; 'The realisation that the economy will remain in recession for longer than expected means the mortgage indemnity crisis will also persist for longer.' General Accident opens the reporting season on Tuesday and is generally expected to cut its loss to between Pounds 20m and Pounds 52m against Pounds 101.5m in first half 1991. It is forecast to maintain its interim dividend at 9.7p, but faces some pressure to cut the final. The shares fell 5 to 380p. Analysts expect Guardian Royal Exchange to reduce its interim dividend to between 2.25 and 2.45p from 4.4p. The stock held steady at 116p. Vodafone wanted Cellular telecoms group Vodafone held up well in a weak market after analysts were told, at the company's annual meeting, that a radical price restructuring would be announced next Thursday. The move is Vodafone's response to rival Cellnet's announcement of several weeks ago which detailed its own revamped pricing policy. Behind the restructurings are both companies strategies for increasing levels of domestic users, which provide only some 10 per cent of income, and to head off the threat of the new localised telecoms system PCN (Personal Communications Network) due to be introduced from mid 1993. Analysts suggested yesterday that Vodafone could attempt to stimulate the consumer market by extending off-peak times and reducing line rents, while at the same time increasing peak rates for business users - with the aim of leaving overall revenue steady while widening the service's attraction. However, others warned that Cellnet, owned by BT and Securicor, was likely to respond to any new iniative and that two of the new PCN operators, Cable and Wireless and Hutchinson Whampoa had the reserves to fight a lengthy price war. Yesterday, Vodafone remained at 327p, fully-paid BT shares slipped 3 to 334p, Cables dropped 6 to 518p and Securicor slipped 2 to 813p. Further consideration of Barclay's results prompted the shares to lose much of Thursday's post-figures gain and slip back 10 to 324p. Lehman Brothers has cut its 1992 profit forecast by Pounds 150m to Pounds 350m and recommends using any strength in the shares as an opportunity to switch into Lloyds (which rose 2 to 384p) or Abbey National (off 4 at 265p). Heavy trading continued in BP as the shares sought a level following Thursday's dividend cut. Yesterday, BP closed 11 down at 185 1/2 p with volume of more than 68m recorded on the SEAQ electronic ticker, making a combined turnover of 142m during the past two days. There are signs that some UK securities houses are modifying their hostile attitude to the company following the measures announced at the second-quarter stage. Mr Fergus MacLeod of County NatWest feels the company has moved from a position of over-optimism to over-caution and says: 'Recession is already there in every part of BP and there will be a recovery story.' On the other hand, there are hints that US brokers, who had been attracted by the relative cheapness of the stock, might be tempering their enthusiasm. Shell Transport shed a further 7 to 454p following disappointing results from Royal Dutch/Shell. Nomura believes the stock is expensive on a yield relative basis. ICI firmed 3 to 1145p. Kleinwort Benson rates the stock a strong hold at around the 1150p level. Rothmans International was also a bright spot with the shares rising 9 to 1039p as they hit the bottom of their trading range. British Airways followed the market trend easing 3 to 254p ahead of next week's release of its first-quarter results. The range of forecasts for the period April to June is from Pounds 90m to Pounds 120m with Smith New Court predicting Pounds 112m. Engineering group Siebe fell 19 to 598p, with securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew reported to have been the day's big seller. TI Group gave up 8 to 268p on accountancy concerns. Fears that Simon Engineering was unlikely to maintain the year-end dividend caused a sharp fall in the shares. They gave up 18 to 167p, on good turnover of 2.1m. Dividend worries were also in evidence at Meggitt where the shares eased 7 to 67p. A recent stock overhang in Weir Group appeared to have been cleared and the shares jumped 18 to 456p. Drinks group Grand Metropolitan added 5 to 417p as dealers said that a large line of stock had finally found a home. The shares were also helped by Smith New Court reiterating its buy stance and switch advice from Kleinwort Benson out of Guinness. Shares in the latter dropped 5 to 530p. More suggestions that Forte was stepping up the search for younger members for its board stopped the seemingly relentless slide in the shares, which were steady at 139p. Rank Organisation rose 11 to 575p as some advised a short-term buy. After Thursday's bout of downgrades, Thorn EMI edged a penny to 712p, with some talk that one of the more savage cuts had brought a strong reaction from the company. Good figures from Unilever enlivened a dull food manufacturing sector, where downgrades accompanied the gloomy economic sentiment. Unilever's profits came in just ahead of market expectations, with European sales particularly strong. However, most analysts appeared to be happy with their estimates and stayed around the Pounds 1.9bn range. The shares climbed 12 to 953p. A BZW downgrade in Northern Foods, put the group under further pressure following 'take profits' advice from several brokers in the past week. BZW is looking for a Pounds 155m profit this year against a previous estimate of Pounds 159.5m. The shares tumbled 21 to 520p. BZW also turned from buyer to hold on the food retailing sector. Among those retreating Argyll shed 9 to 338p, William Low, 14 to 188p, and Sainsbury 8 to 445p. In stores, Burton was subject to a severe pruning from Kleinwort Benson which lopped Pounds 13m from its profits forecast down to Pounds 15m. The shares eased 2 1/2 to 30 1/2 p. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew advised a switch to Boots from Marks and Spencer. The former steadied at 424p, the latter dropped 6 to 309p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (5).

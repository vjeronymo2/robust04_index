			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TIP LEADS TO 44 ARRESTS AT SYLMAR COCKFIGHT  </P> <P> Los Angeles police arrested 44 men and seized 50 gamecocks at a cockfight in  Sylmar Saturday afternoon after receiving an anonymous phone tip, authorities  said.  </P> <P> The illegal fights were being staged in an arena in the back yard of a  residence in the 12500 block of Bradley Avenue, said Sgt. Bill Thomas.  </P> <P> The house's owner, Juan Duenas, 46, was cited for possession of fighting cocks,  Sgt. Sol Polen said.  </P> <P> Most of the men were given misdemeanor citations for being at a cockfight and  released.  </P> <P> The birds were taken to an animal shelter.  </P> <P> If authorities identify the birds' owners, the owners can be charged with  cruelty to animals, Thomas said.  </P> <P> Police also confiscated scales used to weigh the birds before a match, and the  razors that are attached to the birds' legs during the fight.  </P> <P> One of the birds had injuries from a previous fight, Polen said.  </P> <P> Authorities suspect that cockfighting, a sport imported from Mexico, occurs  regularly in the primarily Latino areas of the northeast Valley, but officials  say that raids are rare because the fights are usually clandestine and promoted  only by word-of-mouth.  </P> <P> The matches are usually between birds of equal weight.  </P> <P> The birds' handlers, usually the owners, taunt the two birds by holding them  beak-to-beak.  </P> <P> Then the birds are dropped and the fight begins. A match usually lasts only a  minute or so before one of the birds quits or is fatally slashed by the razors  attached to the opponent's legs with electrical tape.  </P></p>

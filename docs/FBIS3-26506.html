Taiwan's investments have become the second largest source  of  foreign capital in the mainland, second only to Hong Kong, CEPD  said.    The growth rate of Taiwan's investment is stunning, up 600  percent in 1993 from the previous year, CEPD added.    Statistics show that foreign investment in the mainland hit  US$33 billion in 1993, up 200 percent from 1992, making it one  of the largest magnets for foreign capital.    In 1993, Hong Kong invested US$13 billion in the mainland,  accounting for 44 percent of total foreign investment, followed  by Taiwan with US$6 billion, soaking up 18 percent of total  foreign investment. Mainland China, with cheap labor, raw  materials and a booming consumer market, will continue to  attract investors from all over the world, and will be one of  the fastest growing regions in the world, CEPD added.    The United States, Japan and Germany all expanded their  investments in the mainland last year, CEPD said. Investments  of the three countries grew more than 200 percent from the  previous year, it added.    CEPD predicted that with a global economic rebound in sight,  Mainland China will continue to enjoy a double-digit growth rate  this year.    While the mainland continues to attract foreign investment,  CEPD urged Taiwan businessmen to seize the chance to develop  Taiwan into a regional financial center in Asia and Pacific and  make Taiwan into a springboard for foreign manufacturers wanting  to invest in the mainland.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Woolworth chief out after rift Mr William Lavin, the chief executive of Woolworth, has unexpectedly left the US retailer less than five months after being stripped of the chairmanship over the disclosure that the company had falsified financial reports. Mr Lavin's departure, and the announcement that Woolworth is starting a search for a new chief executive from outside, throws further doubt on the future of the troubled group. Hit by growing losses, the company was forced to cut its quarterly dividend from 29 cents to 15 cents in July. Woolworth said Mr Lavin's departure was due to differences with the board over the future direction of the company. It refused to say what the differences were, and Mr Lavin could not be contacted for comment. Mr Lavin has resigned as chief executive, vice chairman and a director, 'effective immediately', Woolworth said. The disagreement over strategy throws into doubt the restructuring pursued by Mr Lavin and raises the spectre of further asset sales. Mr Lavin has slashed Woolworth's US general merchandise stores and sold its chain of discount stores in Canada, while expanding in speciality retailing. But continuing pressure on profit margins in the US and disappointing results in Europe led to a jump in losses in the second quarter. Mr Lavin had been reinstated as chief executive in May, after stepping aside pending the outcome of an internal investigation into of accounting policies. That review found quarterly financial reports in 1993 had been deliberately misstated to allow it report profits rather than losses.</p>

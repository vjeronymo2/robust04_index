A decision by U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to  accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina departs from the principle agreed on when  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was set up that no troops of  neighbouring countries, as well as of countries whose presence  was not acceptable in these areas for historical reasons, would  be deployed in the territory of former Yugoslavia, a statement  issued from the Yugoslav Secretariat for Foreign Affairs a copy  of which was given to TANJUG said.    The Turkish Ottoman Empire ruled from the 14th until the end  of the 19th century in the area which is now former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and then a Slav (predominantly the Serb  Orthodox) people had undergone Islamization. Turks ruled much  of the Balkans until the early years of this century.    The issued statement warned that by its lack of objectivity  and one-sidedness Turkey had a continual negative effect in the  areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina and that was why Turkish troops were  unacceptable as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force in  Bosnia-Herzegovina on any grounds.    Under the U.N. Charter, the U.N. Security Council and U.N.  secretary-general were directly responsible for peace and  international security and in case of the civil war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, they have to do everything possible to reach  a lasting peace as soon as possible, and not to contribute to  escalation of the conflict, the statement said.</p>

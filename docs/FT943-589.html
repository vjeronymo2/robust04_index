			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world sugar crop forecast despite beet problems Statistics agency FO Licht estimates the world's 1994-95 sugar output at 113.453m tonnes, up from last season's 110.378m, reports Reuters from Ratzeburg, Germany. Licht yesterday forecast beet sugar production at 36.389m tonnes, down from last season's 39.404m, while putting saw cane sugar output at 77.064m tonnes, up from 70.974m in 1993-94. The total, while sharply above last season's, remained well below the 116.2m tonnes produced three years ago, it noted. Licht expected the general supply situation to tighten, despite its higher production estimate. 'Consequently another drawdown in stocks will be needed, but the gap may not be sufficient to upset the market greatly,' it suggested. While warning that higher prices would hurt demand it suggested that 'most producers can probably look forward to another year of satisfactory prices.' Analysts remain conservative on European Union sugar output after exhausted crops mostly failed to make up for bad weather, reports Reuters from Paris. An unusual combination of rain and drought attacked yields in member countries, bringing output back towards 'normal' levels after two record seasons, they said. 'Apart from France and Belgium, where the latest beet tests show some catching up, we might now scale down our output estimates a bit,' said C. Czarnikow analyst Mr Christopher Pack. The London broker recently predicted EU beet output of 15.627m tonnes (raw value) compared with 17.408m in 1993-94. Rain delayed spring sowings in Europe and a summer heatwave put severe stress on crops in July. Although August rain brought relief, cool and wet conditions in September limited root growth, analysts explained.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Cervantes on water and a burlesque - Avignon Festival AFTER THE courtyard of the Papal Palace, the next most prestigious venue for a performance in Avignon during the Summer Festival, now in its 46th year, is the Cloister of the Carmelites at the other end of the historic city. It is currently being occupied by a company drawn from many French regional theatres, the Compagnie des Ours, directed by Robert Cantarella. He has been given the task of directing the Siege of Numantia by Cervantes, translated from the Spanish into French verse by Jean-Jacques Preau and Philippe Minyana. This is another new production in this year's festival tribute to the Golden Age of Spain. Because of Don Quixote, we tend to think of Cervantes as essentially a comic writer and in the eyes of posterity that may be so, but the main theme throughout all his work is herosim of a most stoical kind, reflecting his own hard life. Endurance against overwhelming odds is the theme of this sombre play. In it, he dramatised events in 135 BC, when Scipio, having destroyed Carthage, turned his attention and his troops on to the Spanish town of Numantia. The Roman general's strategy was to dig a trench around the town, completely cutting it off from food supplies so as to enforce its submission without losing a single one of his men. The play tells the sad story of how that plan was frustrated by the valour of the Numantians. Apart from its relevance as a theatrical model of Resistance - there was a notable production in Madrid, besieged by Franco's troops, in 1937 - it presents a modern director with severe problems. It relies largely on declamation rather than dialogue, and there is no single hero or heroine to engage the attention. Instead we observe a continual progression of characters, some of whom are abstractions - War, Spain, Famine - while others are real people with a brief part to play in the growing famine that afflicts them all. Cantarella has taken a stunning gamble with the text. He treats it in a mood of continual burlesque, playing against its rhetoric, letting the poignancy of its meaning emerge through a series of turns derived from cabaret, vaudeville, musical hall, and circus. The women glide on in low-cut ball dresses, the men appear as acrobats in clown costumes, and for much of the time they all perform slapstick-style, ankle-deep in water as the main acting area in front of the cloisters has been flooded. Jazz group Trois 8 provides musical accompaniment to these antics and the company takes the plunge, often literally, with style. Some of the fun and games are hilarious. Sacrifices to the gods are made by conjurors, and a man brought back from the dead makes a macabre reappearance upside down. Everything hinges on whether at the end, when the last few surviving Numantians make their act of defiance and capture a loaf of bread at the cost of their lives, Cantarella can pull back from farce to tragedy. Thanks to a small boy (Antoinin Broutard), the ultimate survivor who jumps from the top of a tower - a toy one - rather than surrender, the director just about makes his bid; but it is a damned close run thing. THE Spanish fever that has gripped this year's Avignon Festival is not just confined to reviving some of the dramatic works of the era of Philip II. The Festival has opened its arms to modern Spain and Spanish culture throughout Latin America, nowhere more so than in the area of dance. Avignon has always been essentially a festival of drama, but at the same time has presented programmes of classical ballet, oriental and modern dance. This year - in a signed statement - the directorate has made a commitment to give dance the same status from now on as that given to drama. By August 3, when the festival ends, 10 different dance companies will have been seen, ensuring at least one choreographic work each evening. The first was Plein Soleil by Joelle Bouvier and Regis Obadia, a new work heavily Spanish in tone performed by members of L'Esquisse, the dance company, based in Normandy and founded in 1980 by these two gifted artists. At the outset, the entire company of six men and six women is on stage, utterly still and subdued, staring at the audience. The women in black dresses sit on wooden chairs while the men in suits stand beside them. The music by Louis Winsberg sounds a plaintive air on cello and piano. Soft light filters through the colonnade. The atmosphere is as heavy with grief as the aftermath of a funeral. Slowly the mood changes. The beat becomes more emphatic as percussion takes over from strings, soon to be augmented by flamenco hand-claps. The men turn to caress their partners; then passionately embrace them; then lift them high in the air. Now the sun breaks through and the music incites the dancers to frenzy. The pairs re-form into groups and there are a series of breathtaking lifts as women appear to be hurtling through the air before they are caught in the arms of the men. The erotic charge generated slowly but surely makes the recent ballet at Covent Garden on a somewhat similar theme, The Judas Tree, seem as if it had been scripted by Enid Blyton. Outside the ballet, homage to the Hispanic has been equally widespread. The 85-year-old Nobel prize winner Octavio Paz is here, attending conferences and giving interviews while his native Mexico has been recreated on stage at the Luberon village of Les Taillades by the innovative French theatre director Georges Lavaudant in a strange melange of acting, mime, music and dance. Terra Incognita is a mixed media show concocted by Lavaudant and based on his own Mexican experience as a young man. He arrives in this country of extremes to attend a conventional ambassador's cocktail party. The disjointed chatter is soon interrupted by the appearance of symbolic figures and archetypes from the country's heritage - the ever-present grinning death's head, the proud conquistadors, the slinky nightclub hostesses, and last the native Indians. A Mexican trio and a singer perform from time to time punctuating the rather fragmented scenario. The whole farrago is acted violently by a talented troupe from the Theatre National Populaire. It all seemed a curious throwback to the evasive happy-go-lucky mood of the 1960s.</p>

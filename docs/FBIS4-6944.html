			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Foreign Ministry's Information  Department, on 22 April Thai ambassador to Phnom Penh Sakthip  Krairoek called on King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monique at  their palace. The following is the essence of the meeting:    On behalf of the Thai Government and the Thai people, the  ambassador expressed pleasure that the king's health has  improved, which enabled him to return to Cambodia to the delight  of the Cambodian people. The ambassador also congratulated and  expressed support for the king's proposal to hold a round-table  meeting of the leaders of Cambodian factions -- Samdech Norodom  Ranariddh, Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan  -- during 2-5 May. The Thai envoy expressed the view that due  to the respect and acceptance of all Cambodians, King Sihanouk  is currently the only person to be able to achieve national  reconciliation. The Thai Government sincerely wishes to see  national reconciliation materialized in Cambodia as well as  peace and progress there like in other countries in the region.    On Thai-Cambodian relations, King Sihanouk felt that  accusations and counteraccusations through the mass media should  end. It would be better for the two countries to use diplomatic  measures or government-level contacts.    The Thai envoy emphasized that the Thai Government  recognizes  the Cambodian Government as the sole legitimate administration  of Cambodia and that it does not support the Khmer Rouge. The  Thai Government is determined to maintain good relations and see  the neighboring countries, including Cambodia, enjoy stability  and prosperity. It reiterates continued support for the  Cambodian government's national reconstruction efforts.</p>

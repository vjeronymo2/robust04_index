			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> POLICE IDENTIFY SHOOTING VICTIM  </P> <P> A man found shot to death in a Newport Beach townhouse on Tuesday has been  identified as Roger Hughes, 42, of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Helen S. Parser, 49, was arrested on suspicion of murdering Hughes and is being  held on $250,000 bail, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.  </P> <P> Hughes and Parser were married in 1984, but police were uncertain about their  recent marital status. "It's unclear if they had since been divorced," Gonis  said.  </P> <P> Gonis said police were alerted to the shooting by a "friend of the suspect's  who called 911."  </P> <P> When police arrived at the townhouse, on a bluff above Coast Highway, they  surrounded the building and ordered Parser out of her home. She surrendered  without incident.  </P> <P> Gonis said it appeared that there had been a struggle between Parser and Hughes  before the shooting. "The house was in disarray," he said.  </P> <P> Parser was taken to a local hospital for examination of some minor bruises, but  Gonis said she appeared to be in good condition. MATT LAIT  </P></p>

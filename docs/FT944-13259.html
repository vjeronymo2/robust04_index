			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / People: David Snedden to chair Trinity International It has not taken long for Trinity International's double act to get back in harness. David Snedden will take over the non-executive chairmanship of the Chester-based newspaper group from Simon Mosley on December 1, renewing his partnership with Philip Graf, the deputy who succeeded him as chief executive after Snedden's retirement 19 months ago. Snedden, 62, and Graf, 47, have been working together since the 1970s, when Graf was Snedden's protege at Thomson Regional Newspapers. Snedden brought Graf into Trinity two years after he moved to the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo - as Trinity then was - in 1982. This announcement is no surprise, as Snedden stayed on the board as a non-executive after retiring and quickly became deputy chairman. Trinity - formerly a close company with one management share held by each of 12 directors - enfranchised its shareholders last year. This has encouraged wider ownership, with new institutional buyers including the Prudential and M&amp;G. Snedden, Graf and finance director Mike Masters  - the key people in driving the change - now occupy the three top seats in the boardroom. Snedden now splits his domicile between Edinburgh and a riverside flat in Liverpool's Albert Dock complex. Since he also recently became chairman of Norcor Holdings, the Norwich corrugated packaging company which floated this year, he will certainly not be under-using his company car: the acquisitive Trinity's 50-or-so newspaper titles are spread throughout Scotland, north-west England, North Wales, West Yorkshire and the south-east.</p>

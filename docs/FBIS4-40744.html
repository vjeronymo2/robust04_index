			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "FITUR Board Plenum. Trade </F> Unions Change Ally"]    [Text] Addressing yesterday's sitting of the executive  committee of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of  Russia [FITUR], Federation head Mikhail Shmakov accused Yuriy  Skokov of attempting to break up the FITUR and create on its  basis another trade union organization. The sharpness of the  accusation was provoked by the fact that Skokov is building  contacts with regional trade unions bypassing the FITUR's  central leadership and actually stripping them of control.    Earlier, the FITUR cooperated with the Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE] whose president Arkadiy  Volskiy masterminded the creation of a Trilateral Conciliation  Commission -- the RUIE, the FITUR, and the government -- so that  trade unions could refer their demands directly to the  government. In the wake of October 1993 the government stopped  delegating its ranking representatives to the commission's  sessions, which rendered the RUIE's cooperation with the FITUR  less interesting. When Volskiy's centrists suffered complete  defeat in the December elections and finally departed the list  of influential political forces, all reasons for FITUR-RUIE  cooperation were totally lost. Trade unions bosses and  entrepreneurs started to look around for new partners.    An apolitical mode of life under the leadership of Mikhail  Shmakov looked to union bosses not exciting enough, and they  started to look for a new Big Brother for political gambles.  Producers of commodities suited the role best. Four major  trade unions associations of the Urals, Siberia, the Northern  Caucasus, and the Central Volga, decided to secure support from  Skokov and signed an interaction agreement with him.    This agreement may soon lead to a split of the Federation.  Offended by the behavior of Skokov, who ignored all proposals  for a meeting and who played up to his subordinates behind their  boss's back, Mikhail Shmakov intends to press for the annulment  of the agreement. But since the FITUR is a typical example of a  political partner always on the lookout for someone to form a  bloc with, it is doubtful that union officials will listen to  their chairman and give up so opportune an idea as an alliance  with Skokov.</p>

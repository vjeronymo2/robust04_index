			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Prudential director to get top job at Stock Exchange THE LONDON Stock Exchange will announce today that it is appointing Mr Michael Lawrence, the finance director of the Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest insurer, as its new chief executive. His appointment ends an eight-month search following the resignation in March of Mr Peter Rawlins, who took responsibility for the collapse of the exchange's Taurus project to reform its share settlement system. It is one of the most important City appointments for many years, coming at a time of widespread debate about the exchange's future. Following the humiliating collapse of Taurus, at a cost to the exchange and City firms of hundreds of millions of pounds, many in the City believe the exchange should withdraw entirely from settlement services. Mr Lawrence was one of the most outspoken critics of the exchange's handling of Taurus. It had been thought Ms Jane Barker, the exchange's highly regarded finance director, was a leading contender for the chief executive's position. However, it is understood she did not allow her name to be considered and may leave the exchange for reasons unconnected with the appointment of a chief executive. The exchange has had great difficulty attracting an appropriate candidate. The initial list of contenders, drawn up in early autumn by headhunting firm, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, was unacceptable, according to a member of the exchange's board. 'They were told to go away and start again and we also threatened to appoint a new headhunting firm,' he said. 'Once the committee got this name in front of it, everyone agreed this was the man.' The exchange's selection committee - which consists of Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland's London operations, Mr Miles Rivett-Carnac, deputy chairman of merchant bank Barings, Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of the stockbrokers Smith New Court, and Mr Donald Brydon, chief executive of BZW Investment Management - was particularly impressed with Mr Lawrence's performance as chairman of the 100 Group of leading finance directors, in particular his criticism of parts of the Cadbury code of corporate governance. '(He) has considerable energy and competence', a senior City financier said. Mr Lawrence joined the Prudential in 1988 after working as a partner in the accountancy firm Price Waterhouse. He informed the Prudential board of his decision to quit on Tuesday and is likely to take up his new position in a matter of weeks. His pay at the exchange will be linked to performance, but it is understood he is likely to receive less than Pounds 300,000 a year. One temporary sticking point to his appointment was whether he should be compensated for the loss of Prudential share options. Observer, Page 19</p>

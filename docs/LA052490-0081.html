			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ACCEPT LAND FOR SEWER PLANT  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors voted this week to accept a gift of six acres in  Malibu as the likely site of a sewer treatment facility, even though sisters  Sylvia R. A. Neville and Rhoda-May Dallas were said to have tried at the last  minute to withdraw their offer to donate the land.  </P> <P> "After some discussions involving the county, their thinking was to pull back  completely," said attorney Thomas K. Houston, referring to an apparent change  of heart by the sisters, who control the Adamson Cos., a major Malibu  landowner.  </P> <P> Houston, an Adamson attorney, said that when county officials were informed  that Neville and Dallas had changed their minds, "they said that if that were  the case, they would just go ahead and condemn (the property) anyway."  </P> <P> In voting Tuesday to accept the gift, the supervisors approved a plan to  acquire the six acres next to Pepperdine University by condemnation, if  necessary.  </P> <P> As part of a private deal with the county, Neville and Dallas had agreed to  surrender the property in exchange for the county's helping to expedite  approval of a 300-room, $65-million hotel the sisters want to build in Malibu.  The hotel depends on the sewer being built.  </P> <P> But Houston indicated that Neville and Dallas, the firm's general partners,  were disturbed by "recent rumblings from the county" that officials might not  be able to help the company with the hotel.  </P> <P> Houston said there was never any explicit agreement with the county.  </P> <P> "All we expected was that the county might be able to help us out with some  permits. But the recent rumblings from the county are that maybe they're not  even going to be in a position to do that," he said.  </P> <P> Critics of the arrangement have accused the county of pushing the deal with the  Adamson Cos. for the sake of expediency, despite claims that the parcel is too  close to residential development, and too close to an earthquake fault to be  considered safe.  </P> <P> County officials, eager to get a sewer system under way before a new Malibu  government has the chance to block it, have acknowledged that they have no  ready backup site for the sewer plant if their plans for the property hit a  snag.  </P> <P> Malibu voters will decide June 5 whether the community becomes a city, and  approval is widely expected. They will also pick a five-member City Council  that, depending on its makeup, may be far less enthusiastic than the county  about sewers, hotels and development in general.  </P> <P> The county has for months expressed interest in acquiring the six acres as the  site for the sewer plant, which is to be the centerpiece of a proposed  $43-million sewer system the county wants to build in Malibu.  </P> <P> But the site has been a lightning rod for controversy.  </P> <P> Residents of nearby Malibu Country Estates, a subdivision of million-dollar  homes, complain that if the plant is built under their noses, it will hurt  their property values. They have threatened to file a lawsuit to block it.  </P> <P> The property also is the subject of a dispute between Neville and Dallas, the  sisters of the late real estate scion Merritt Adamson, and his widow, Sharon  Adamson, who claims a one-third interest in the parcel. She contends that the  sisters had no right to give it away. The squabble is part of a much larger  court battle over the disposition of the family's $75-million fortune, which is  expected to go to trial this summer.  </P> <P> As disclosed by The Times last week, Neville and Dallas offered to give away  the land for the sewer plant and said they would try to get Sharon Adamson's  cooperation.  </P> <P> Unable to get Adamson to relinquish her purported interest in the property, the  sisters decided to give the land to the county anyway, and agreed not to object  if the county found it necessary to acquire the property by condemnation.  </P> <P> County officials have acknowledged an arrangement with the sisters, but insist  that they never agreed to an exchange of favors in order to get hold of the six  acres.  </P> <P> "There is no quid pro quo," County Counsel DeWitt Clinton said Tuesday, in  response to a question from Supervisor Ed Edelman. "If there were, that would  be illegal, and we wouldn't have been involved in it."  </P> <P> Edelman said he wanted "to make it clear that my vote (to accept the gift) in  no way indicates my support for any arrangement involving a hotel the Adamsons  want to build."  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum expressed a similar view.  </P> <P> "If I were the Adamsons, and I believed offering this property would result in  the county's performing some kind of favor, I would have to be extremely  naive," he said.  </P> <P> In her lawsuit against the sisters, Sharon Adamson contends that the parcel was  among about $15 million in assets shared in common by her husband and his two  sisters, rather than by the family company, and that the Adamson Cos. had no  right to deal the property away.  </P> <P> Sharon Adamson's attorney has called the sisters' arrangement with the county  idiotic, saying that they were attempting to give away a valuable piece of real  estate "without . . . receiving so much as a snicker."  </P> <P> Although the supervisors voted to accept the gift, they have not formally  approved the placement of the sewer plant there. Under the agreement with the  company, the county has until July 1 to designate the sewer site or the offer  becomes void.  </P> <P> Neither did the supervisors approve a redistribution of the tax assessment  district for the sewer system on Tuesday, as had been expected. By law, four of  the five supervisors must approve the tax assessment, and, with Supervisor Mike  Antonovich absent, Edelman indicated he wanted more time to study the matter.  </P> <P> A revised assessment became necessary after the California Coastal Commission  last November voted to reduce the capacity of the sewer system devoted to  commercial users. Slow-growth advocates had complained that the larger system  envisioned by the county would foster too much development in the civic center  area.  </P> <P> As a result, would-be residential users now complain that they are being asked  to pay up to 37% more than under the original sewer district, and have pressed  the county to justify its data in increasing their rates.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Books: Pulling the plug on feudal rights FIEFS AND VASSALS by Susan Reynolds Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 544 pages Aristocratic society in the middle ages was held together by the bond between lord and vassal. This bond was personally entered into, symbolically enacted, and rewarded by the property or fief, in virtue of which the vassal owed military service, attendance at court and other payments and duties to his lord. Political obligation and legal right rested on this principle, established in the 9th century and comprehensively applied to the exercise of power at every level of society in the 11th and 12th. The entire political and legal structure of western Europe in the middle ages was founded on it. So the story runs. The artificiality of the idea of a 'feudal system' has been well recognised at least since Maitland remarked that it was introduced into England by Sir Henry Spelman in 1631, but that has not prevented the principles associated with it (in this non-marxist sense) from dominating our conceptions of medieval society. The great medievalists of every European nation - Sir Frank Stenton, Heinrich Mitteis, Marc Bloch, F. L. Ganshof - have written their greatest books on its origins, nature, operation and consequences. Susan Reynolds has had the poor taste and staggering endurance to go looking for the evidence. Having assiduously searched a mountain of the most obscure and rebarbative texts the middle ages have to offer she reports that most of it is not there, and that what there is fails on examination to support the mighty edifice that has been built upon it. A mighty edifice indeed there was, but the builders were not 9th- and 10th-century magnates appropriating the remains of public authority to enlarge their own estates and fortunes, as the old story had it, but 12th- and 13th-century lawyers and officials eager to expand the incomes and extend the prerogatives of their royal and princely masters over the mainly inherited property of their free subjects. It was they who began to speak of land being held of the lord - ultimately, of the king - and to use words like vassus and feodum, with the overtones of honourable subjection and obligation from which their 16th and 17th-century successors could abstract a complex conceptual system. What we have taken for the elementary structures of European society are really the products of something more like bureaucracy than feudalism: products, in fact, of the transformation which made government something exercised through the written word rather than by force, and therefore placed it in the hands of those who knew how to manipulate words. Twelfth- and 13th-century bureaucrats, like other bureaucrats, needed precedents for what they decided to do. It was the lawyers' business to find them. In doing so they described a world which we have mistaken for a real historical past. Susan Reynolds conducts her campaign with considerable learning and technical skill across a wide stretch of European history. Since a great deal of it attempts to prove a negative  - what the sources do not say - there is inevitably plenty of scope for defenders of the old order. Nevertheless, the conclusions of Fiefs and Vassals fit very well with those of much recent discussion both of early medieval societies and about the depth and scale of the transformation of Europe after the year 1000. Reading the sources forward from the beginning instead of backwards through 13th-century eyes reveals a society much less precisely stratified than it then became, in which free men inherited and owned land quite independently of the duties which they owed to the king 'not because they were his vassals, but because they were his subjects.' The real makers of the European middle ages were the scholars, lawyers and administrators of the 12th and 13th centuries who, sometimes consciously and sometimes not, constructed accounts of their various pasts to add a veneer of venerable authority and tradition to their highly innovative and aggressive approach to the pressing problems of learning, law and government. Here they have been well and truly caught in the act.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERRIER, STRIVING TO BOUNCE BACK, TARGETS CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> It's summertime, and the livin' is easy. At least that's the word from Perrier  Group of America as the company rolls out Phase II of its campaign to get  squeamish sippers back in the market for "Earth's First Soft Drink."  </P> <P> Sure, there was benzene in it once, but it's gone now. All the  Indian-club-shaped bottles were pulled from the shelves in February. A  three-month drought ensued, but in most major markets, that's over too.  </P> <P> All that's left is a $25-million ad campaign and an all-out effort to wrest  shelf space back from the competition in shops, bars, hotels and restaurants.  Perrier says it's ahead of schedule, but its enemies in the water wars are  dubious.  </P> <P> Consider the flurry of news releases faxed across the country in the days after  Perrier launched its new radio ads in Southern California last Monday.  </P> <P> "After only two months of its planned 18-month relaunch program, the Perrier  Group of America announced Tuesday that it has already regained distribution in  80% of its retail outlets," Perrier trumpeted.  </P> <P> Unconvinced, La Croix Water Co. of La Cross, Wisc., fired off a rejoinder two  days later: "Officials of the La Croix Water Company announced today that its  La Croix Sparkling Water has experienced unprecedented growth since the  worldwide recall of Perrier water last February."  </P> <P> Perrier returned to the Los Angeles market -- where it spends 15% of its  advertising budget -- on May 8, after being unveiled earlier on the East Coast.  Industry experts contend that cracking health-conscious California is crucial  to the company's success.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles food stores, we're back to almost equivalent distribution to  where we were before the recall," Lazgin said. "For restaurants, we're at 50%  of where we were before the recall. We hope to reach 70% by Aug. 1."  </P> <P> Perrier will not disclose precise sales figures, and the numbers it does  release are a lot murkier than its water. Company officials said sales of the  regular, unflavored water in May, 1990, were 67% of total Perrier sales in May,  1989.  </P> <P> "We are gaining ground in regular Perrier," said Perrier spokeswoman Jane  Lazgin. "Generally, 60% of our sales are regular Perrier and 40% of our sales  are Perrier With a Twist (flavored). So we're 7% ahead as we re-enter the  market. We expected to be probably about half that."  </P> <P> The beleaguered firm, however, has yet to start producing its flavored  products, probably won't begin rolling them out until the end of the summer and  won't have distribution in place until November or December.  </P> <P> The water's absence -- three months in major markets and much longer in smaller  cities -- gave its small regional competitors a chance to make a splash in the  $2.3-billion bottled water business. And while no one company bubbled to the  top of the market, experts said, several did very well.  </P> <P> "Perrier hasn't recovered completely," said Greg Prince, features editor for  Beverage World magazine. "The fact that they're selling water at all is pretty  good. But other brands have had an opening. . . . San Pellegrino, Evian,  Crystal Geyser come to mind as ones that got a foot in the door."  </P> <P> La Croix, which is sold in 50 states but is not a big player on the West Coast,  began a media blitz of its own, less than 24 hours after the Perrier recall was  announced. It established a consumer hot line and published print  advertisements nationally.  </P> <P> "In roughly a month interval of the recall, our business escalated 300%," said  William Eiler, spokesman for La Croix. "We have sustained this success. Our  market share in the Midwest increased 48% from the beginning of February to the  end of June. We're up 84% in the Chicago area."  </P> <P> Calistoga-based Crystal Geyser saw its sales jump 50% over last year's  performance, particularly in California, said Peter Gordon, company chairman.  California is the top state in bottled water consumption, with 36% of all  sparkling and still waters downed within its boundaries.  </P> <P> "We really picked up a lot of accounts across the country," Gordon said. "When  Perrier had to remove all of their products from the market, we were prepared  to fill the void. What has been very encouraging is that we have held on to the  business."  </P> <P> If restaurants, hotels and bars show no fidelity to their fumbling former  favorite, Perrier could be in trouble, said Gary Hemphill, editor of Beverage  Industry magazine. Distribution is still not back entirely, and that could hurt  the company as the crucial summer season unfolds.  </P> <P> "They're still not where they'd like to be," Hemphill said. "It's still a  problem for them. It's going to hurt their summer."  </P> <P> But Perrier's Lazgin insists that recovery is more than just possible; it's on  the way. The distinctive green bottles are back in 50% of the restaurants, bars  and hotels where they reigned supreme before, including Lutece and 21 in New  York, Dominique's in Washington, Boston's Grill 23 and Ma Maison and Le  Chardonnay in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "At retail, we're very pleased with where we are, but we expected to retain  much of our shelf space," Lazgin said. "In restaurants, which you have to call  on a one-by-one basis, it takes so much longer. Given those limitations to  distribution, we think we're doing pretty well."  </P></p>

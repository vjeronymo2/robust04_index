			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Boots Friday's trading statement from Boots has well and truly burst the euphoric bubble which had surrounded the stores sector. Weakness in the Do-It-All joint venture with WH Smith is perhaps not surprising. The chain is a weak third competitor in a market which has been riven by price wars and over-capacity. Perhaps the simplest solution would be for Do-it-All to withdraw. But markets rarely work so neatly and the optimism of both joint venturers bodes ill. WH Smith is likely to share in another of Boots' headaches. The Nintendo and Sega computer games craze has cannibalised many other areas of the childrens' present market this Christmas, with video and recorded music sales notably affected. The music business claims that the soggy trend in compact disc sales is due to a lack of new albums. But the expiry of singles and the high price of discs may be pricing the traditional teenage audience out of the market. More generally, Boots' statement adds to the picture of a patchy Christmas. There was a late burst of spending for some retailers which carried over into the January sales. Yet strong January spending may not be a sign of retail health: it may only show that consumers held off before Christmas. The stores sector is at best sputtering into 1993 and it still has fully to face the challenge of rising import prices. Those retailers which source at home will have an edge this year.</p>

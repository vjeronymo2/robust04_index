			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT LEADERS CONFRONT TOUGHEST TEEN HURDLES;  </P> <P> SELF-ESTEEM: EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER'S FOUNDATION HELPS HUNTINGTON BEACH  DISTRICT FASHION YOUNG ROLE MODELS.  </P> <P> Nathan Hashbarger was not thinking about drugs or the problem of teen  pregnancies when he arrived at the school district's headquarters for a meeting  early Thursday morning.  </P> <P> But Hashbarger, 13-year-old student body vice president at Isaac L. Sowers  Middle School in Huntington Beach, and two dozen other middle school students  were shortly to confront those issues and other difficult questions.  </P> <P> They started by meeting Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of President John F.  Kennedy. They then were whisked off to a daylong workshop aimed at improving  each student's sense of self-worth as a way of grappling with tough teen  problems.  </P> <P> Shriver, after an accidental encounter with Huntington Beach City School  District Supt. Diana Peters at a January statewide superintendents' conference  in Monterey, offered to help set up a self-esteem program in Huntington Beach  through the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation.  </P> <P> The temptations of drugs and sex for young people can be overcome only through  a healthy sense of self-esteem, said Shriver, who is well known for her work on  mental retardation and for the Special Olympics.  </P> <P> The foundation is picking up the $6,000 tab to get the Community of Caring  program started. The Long Beach Unified School District is the only other  school system in the area to have such a program.  </P> <P> After attending initial workshops, teachers and students will develop  activities to carry back to the classroom.  </P> <P> Hashbarger and the other students who attended workshops Wednesday and Thursday  are not problem children. They will become role models to others later, back at  their home schools.  </P> <P> Shriver mingled with about 100 guests, including program co-sponsors from the  Huntington Beach Chamber of Commerce, over coffee, juice and rolls before  Thursday's workshop.  </P> <P> In an interview, Shriver said the Kennedy Foundation started the program after  finding that teen-age mothers give birth to more retarded children,  proportionally, than do adult mothers.  </P> <P> "We were in the business of trying to prevent retardation, and there was  evidence that some parents of retarded children lack parenting skills -- they  don't take care of their own health, getting into drug abuse and alcohol, and  so the health of the fetus becomes impaired.  </P> <P> "It became clear that giving young mothers and fathers a sense of values and  responsibility in order to make choices was something we needed to do.  </P> <P> "We don't inflict any values," Shriver said, "but we ask the participants to  examine their own values and see how they apply to difficult situations."  </P> <P> Some of the students did not fully appreciate who Shriver is. So Robert E.  Anastasi, a former school principal from Maryland who directs the Community of  Caring program for the Kennedy Foundation, told them that Shriver is the  mother-in-law of actor-muscleman Arnold Schwartzenegger and mother of TV news  anchor Maria Shriver -- in that order. There was instant recognition and  applause.  </P> <P> In one of several videotapes shown during the day to challenge the students to  be critical thinkers, two teen-agers were shown arguing about sex. The boy is  pressuring his girlfriend to sleep with him, using arguments such as "If you  really loved me . . ." and "You can't get pregnant the first time anyway." The  girl's mother refuses to talk about sex.  </P> <P> Hashbarger was in a group of two girls who, by the expressions on their faces,  were obviously skittish.  </P> <P> "I guess," one girl said when asked whether she would feel comfortable asking  her mother or a trusted teacher about sex.  </P> <P> Asked whether he has heard any "smoothies" in the videotape that he would use  on girls, Hashbarger replied: "If you really love me."  </P> <P> Breaking up with a boy who is too insistent "isn't very easy if you're going  with somebody," said Shelley Caplan, a student at Ethel Dwyer Middle School.  </P> <P> Hashbarger said, "What this program is striving for is getting people to talk  and plan, and not to deal only with the moment."  </P> <P> Nervously fingering a ring she had removed, Caplan said: "Yeah, he (the boy in  the videotape) should think about the future. . . . They should talk to each  other and decide whether they're ready to have a family."  </P> <P> There was no happy ending. Restarting the videotape, the students saw that the  girl gets pregnant and her boyfriend splits.  </P> <P> "Hsss!" "Boo!" said the kids.  </P></p>

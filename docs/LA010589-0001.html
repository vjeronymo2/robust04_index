			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet envoy Yuli M. Vorontsov arrived in Pakistan for a visit expected to  include talks with Afghan guerrilla leaders. Vorontsov indicated that Moscow's  troop withdrawal from Afghanistan will proceed on schedule if there are no  further rebel attacks. Under accords signed last April in Geneva, all Soviet  troops are to be withdrawn by Feb. 15. Vorontsov, one of Moscow's top  diplomatic trouble-shooters, arrived in Islamabad from Tehran, where he spoke  with Iranian-based Afghan resistance leaders.  </P></p>

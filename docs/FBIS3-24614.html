The  international exhibit on ``Mother and Child Care--93,'' which  opened in Moscow, proposes to solve them by means of the latest  medical technologies.    In his remarks at the opening of this exhibit, Eduard  Nechayev, Russian Federation health minister, stated that the  problem of mother and child care in Russia is presently one of  the top priorities. For expressly this reason he considers this  exhibit to be very important. The minister expressed his hope  that this will be instrumental in development of a system of  mother and child care in our country.    The indicators characterizing obstetric care in Russia are  lower than those of a number of foreign countries: mother and  infant mortality rates, as well as morbidity rates for children  and pregnant women, are high. The incidence of abortions also  remains high. In the opinion of Nikolay Vaganov, Russian  Federation deputy health minister, all this is attributable, to  a considerable extent, to the flaws in obstetric technologies,  intensive care and resuscitation of neonates, as well as  shortage of drugs. The deputy minister mentioned that one of the  ways to solve this problem is for Russia to set up joint  production of equipment and drugs with western firms.    The ``Mother and Child'' exhibit offers modern equipment,  instruments and drugs used in gynecology, obstetrics and  pediatrics.</p>

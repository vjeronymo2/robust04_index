			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAX GUIDELINES ON WHAT QUALIFIES AS 'IMPROVEMENT'  </P> <P> QUESTION: What improvements is a home seller allowed to add to his cost basis?  I know that general maintenance does not count and that additions, such as  fences, decks and added rooms, do count. I am uncertain, however, about  replacements. In our home of 25 years, every major appliance has been replaced  at least once, including the furnace and water heater. Can we add the cost of  these replacements to our basis?  </P> <P> ANSWER: This is a very important subject that is often overlooked by  homeowners. Over the last quarter-century, real estate values have skyrocketed,  and when the homeowner sells the property, every dollar that can be added to  cost basis is a potential 33 cent savings on federal income tax.  </P> <P> The tax court cases that have discussed the issues of capital improvements are  usually raised in the context of whether the real estate investor can deduct  certain expenses in the year they are paid, or whether those expenses have to  be added to the basis.  </P> <P> Obviously, from the point of view of the investor, if expenses can be deducted  legitimately in the year they are paid, this is more desirable than merely  tacking these expenses to the cost basis for a future savings down the road.  </P> <P> The distinction, while significant today, was more important prior to the 1986  Tax Reform Act. Investors wanted to take advantage of a tax savings in the year  the expenses were paid, rather than wait for a future date.  </P> <P> For the homeowner, the situation is the reverse. Ordinary expenses for repairs  are not deductible under any circumstances when the repairs are made to your  principal residence. Thus, to the extent possible, the homeowner wants to treat  these expenses as capital improvements, thereby permitting those expenses to be  added to the cost basis of the property.  </P> <P> Many fine lines can be drawn. For example, if the toilet is leaking, and you  merely repair that toilet, I think there is no question but that this is a  repair -- and not a capital improvement. But if you replace that same toilet  with a new one, a good argument can be made that this was a capital improvement  -- and not merely a repair.  </P> <P> One of the most concise definitions is found in an early tax appeal case where  it was stated:  </P> <P> "To repair is to restore to a sound state or to mend, while a replacement  connotes a substitution. A repair is an expenditure for the purpose of keeping  the property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition. It does not add to  the value of the property, nor does it appreciably prolong its life. It merely  keeps the property in an operating condition over its probable useful life for  the uses for which it was acquired.  </P> <P> "Expenditures for that purpose are distinguishable from those for replacements,  alterations, improvements or additions that prolong the life of the property,  increase its value, or make it adaptable to a different use."  </P> <P> Oversimplified, the distinction between a repair and a capital expenditure  rests on whether the work or construction prolongs the life of -- or adds value  to -- the property.  </P> <P> As in many tax questions, the matter will be resolved not by a legal  interpretation, but on the facts of each case.  </P> <P> Some tax court cases have applied the "one-year" rule of thumb. Under this  theory, an expenditure would be capitalized "if it brings about the acquisition  of an asset having a period of useful life in excess of one year or if it  secures a like advantage to the taxpayer, which has a life of more than one  year."  </P> <P> Thus, in your example, since you replaced the furnace and water heater, and  they clearly prolong the life of your house for more than one year, I certainly  feel that you are justified in calling these items improvements and adding  those costs to your basis.  </P> <P> It is interesting to note that the following items have been determined by  either the IRS or by a court to be a capital expenditure -- rather than a  repair: cost of replacing, rearranging and new electrical wiring; basement  repair and waterproofing costs; burglar alarm installation charges; cost of new  flooring; cost of replacement of drainage pipes; installation of sea walls;  cost of replacement and renovation of roof, and costs of window plate-glass  installation and replacement.  </P> <P> Thus, as you can see, the answer depends on the particular facts. My own  suggestion is that if you are satisfied that the work you have done to your  property prolongs the life of your property or adds value to the property, I  would consider those costs to be capital improvements, thereby adding them to  the cost basis of your property.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that if you are audited, the burden will be on you to demonstrate  that these are, in fact, improvements and not merely repairs.  </P> <P> You should also keep all records and bills relating to these improvements. Even  if you can justify that the replacement of your boiler was clearly a capital  improvement, if you do not have the bill for this new boiler when you are  audited, you will have great difficulty having this addition approved.  </P> <P> Kass is a Washington lawyer and newspaper columnist specializing in real estate  and tax matters.

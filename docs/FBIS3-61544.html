Comments on the  Search for New Mechanisms of Scientific Collaboration Between  the East and the West'']    [Text] It is difficult to impress Akademgorodok in  Novosibirsk. At the height of the``cold war'' it received de  Gaulle and Nixon, and in the spy craze era, Gersh Budker, who  was at that time director of the top-secret Institute of Nuclear  Physics, liked to invite probable James Bonds to eat Siberian  pelmeni [similar to ravioli].    Still, the workshop (for the sake of simplicity let us call  it a seminar) attended in late November by the Siberian  Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and NATO's  research program department prompted unconcealed interest there.  Suggestions on possible points of agreement were somewhat  defined when Alain Joubert, director of NATO's program for  international scientific exchange handed out to the seminar  participants a list of 60 international conferences and seminars  within the framework of the 1994 NATO program on ``Science to  serve society.''    These meetings will deal with such priority interests of  mankind as the new generation of immune stimulators, materials  science for orthopedic implants, molecular aspects of  carcinogenesis, climate sensitivity to radiation  perturbations.... Technologies for disarmament, environmental  protection, high-tech technologies for high-level investigation  of human resources were mentioned as the priority areas of NATO  research programs.    Do these remarkable, peaceful programs mean that NATO, the  most powerful military group with its objectively inherent  power-oriented attitudes, will miraculously change suddenly into  some sort of international humanitarian organization?    The answer is easy. Even now, the North Atlantic bloc has  something to protect and someone against whom to defend itself.  And for a long time it will remain a military entity, and, God  willing, let it be only defensive. But expressly this implies  that friendly business relations will be established with it.    Of course it was difficult for Siberian scientists to behave  as equal partners with representatives from the West at this  meeting: the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of  Sciences is in distress, as is all of Russian science.  Scientists are engaged in a feverish search for funding. Yet the  products of major research, as validly noted by Boris Saltykov,  the Russian minister who spoke here, are sometimes sold abroad  for outrageously low prices.    But if scientific developments become, at least in part, a  commodity, the Siberians must be given their due: some solid  results were submitted in the best way. It must be conceded that  the Western emissaries arrived here quite well prepared. Upon  meeting Professor Gerdt Maier, representative of the FRG  aerospace research establishment, I was amazed at how well he  was informed, not only about academic, but also industrial  research of the Siberian scientists. What was particularly  remarkable is that, while the official documents of the seminar  listed the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of  Sciences and NATO research services as organizers, the circle of  foreign participants at the meeting was much broader. Prominent  figures attended: representatives of authoritative international  organizations such as UNESCO and Pangis (pan-African working  network of geological information systems), the international  "Kazimir" project that deals with investigation of rift  zones--faults in the earth's crust, the Association for  Environmental Study in Rome, International Institute of Systems  Analysis in Vienna, and International Institute of Forest  Studies in Moscow, headed by Academician Aleksandr Isayev of  Siberia.    But it is not at all a matter of listing well-known names  and  brilliant institutes: the logic of development of science leads  increasingly to alliances of researchers from previously  separated fields of knowledge and remote continents of our  planet.    The study of forests has become in recent years a brilliant  example of international and interdisciplinary collaboration.    Unfortunately, it is a common tendency to underestimate the  danger that is developing before our eyes. Forest fires, for  example, presently alarm mainly those whom they directly affect.  Yet there are tens of thousands of forest fires per year on our  planet, and the areas involved measure millions of hectares.    An objective scientific assessment is more alarming than the  ordinary one. For example, Doctor Johann G. Goldammer from the  Max Planck Institute (Freiburg, FRG) observed that the energy of  an average forest fire is as great as the power of an atomic  bomb. Furthermore, an enormous amount of carbon dioxide is  released into the atmosphere, and this alone can cause global  changes in the climate. And, according to estimates, within the  next few decades it could lead to severe droughts over enormous  territories, with all their tragic consequences.    The forest fires that have become more frequent in the  United  States and Canada, Spain, France and German, Italy, Austria and  Switzerland, and, of course, in Siberia, have become serious  grounds for scientists from these countries to join forces in  order to solve this multifaceted problem. It was learned that  such forest fires are caused, to a considerable extent, by man's  cavalier intervention in the forest environment, depriving it of  self-protection against fire.    Optimization of the condition of forest will require  enormous  expenditures and time far beyond the lifetime of a single  generation of people. Today, however, the main thing is to learn  to forecast a forest fire, detect it rapidly, assess it and nip  it in the bud.    The unique experiment in Krasnoyarsk Kray last summer was  concerned with solving these problems. For the first time  anywhere in the world, it was possible to test the diverse  knowledge gained in the last decades about forest fires,  radiometric and other forecasting methods, assessment and  tactics of extinguishing them. This was possible largely because  the experiment, which involved a deliberately set forest fire  covering a limited area, was carried out by the International  Research Center of Boreal Forests in Krasnoyarsk.    One of the remarkable distinctions of development of major  Siberian science in our difficult times consists of the fact  that, perhaps, the most interesting results are achieved at  international research centers, such as the one in Altay,  Baykal, and the one dealing with solar and earth physics in East  Siberia. There are 16 such centers today, and there will be more  than 20 in the next few years. They use both the effect of  integration of ideas and knowhow of the West and the East, and  some financial aid from the West. Siberian science is an example  of the experience and volume of collaboration with scientists  from distant lands. Here, an increasing number of creative  contacts are being established directly by research teams, in  addition to officials.    As for collaboration with NATO, the main objective of the  meeting in Akademgorodok was to develop programs for long-term  scientific collaboration, rather than to receive immediately  grants for participation in NATO conferences and seminars.    And a start has been made.</p>

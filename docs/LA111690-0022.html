			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRA COSTA DEFEATS EL TORO TO REACH 5-A VOLLEYBALL FINAL  </P> <P> The Mira Costa mystique claimed another victim Thursday night.  </P> <P> Rallying from a game down, the Mustangs recorded their second consecutive upset  in the CIF-Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball playoffs by defeating  second-seeded El Toro, 16-14, 13-15, 10-15, 15-8, 15-6, in the semifinals at El  Camino College.  </P> <P> Even Coach Dae Lea Aldrich appeared startled by the victory.  </P> <P> "I'm just in shock," she said, holding her hand to her forehead. "It's not that  I don't believe in them, but they're just so young."  </P> <P> Aldrich was referring to her players, who have overcome inexperience and youth  to send Mira Costa into the CIF final for the third consecutive season and the  seventh time in nine years under Aldrich.  </P> <P> The Mustangs (20-1) will face top-seeded Corona del Mar (23-1) at 8:15 p.m.  Saturday at Cerritos College seeking their second consecutive 5-A title.  </P> <P> "I'm sitting in awe," Aldrich said. "It was so exciting."  </P> <P> Outside hitter Cindy DeGarceau led Mira Costa with 22 kills, followed by  sophomore middle blocker Tate Medley with 11 and junior hitter Shannon Parke  with five. Setter Robin Ortgiesen had 38 assists and sophomore hitter Ann  Windes contributed five blocks.  </P> <P> El Toro (18-4) had taken control of the match by winning the third game, but  the Chargers appeared to run out of gas late in the match as Mira Costa gained  momentum.  </P> <P> Aldrich said a turning point occurred late in the fourth game when Michelle  Mauney, El Toro's standout 6-foot-3 middle blocker, appeared to tire. Mauney  sat out a good portion of the deciding fifth game.  </P> <P> "(Mauney) started tipping instead of hitting in the fourth game," Aldrich said.  "I told my team that was our chance because she was getting tired."  </P> <P> After El Toro took a 6-5 lead in the fifth game, Mira Costa closed out the  match with 10 unanswered points. DeGarceau, Medley and Parke each scored two  points during the run.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Pulling yet another batch of lush, free-standing wood pieces from his  apparently limitless sculptural cornucopia, Martin Puryear shines. The sad fact  that Puryear was recently the first and only black American to represent the  United States in a Biennale (Sao Paulo, '88) pales in the face of Puryear's  ability to coalesce the best of craft and the best of the sophisticated  eccentricity that marks sculpture in the '80s.  </P> <P> When we refer to Puryear's craft this is not the analytical Teutonic will to  order that built cathedrals of glass but the craft of the native weaver or the  19th-Century artist-philosopher William Morris who said that respect for nature  and oneness with materials bound object and maker in intimate dialogue. In this  spirit, Puryear seems to coax and cajole like a lover the most sensual yet  gentle forms from a variety of woods, making sculpture that teeters somewhere  between evocations of life forms, functional objects and art for art's sake.  </P> <P> A large odd-shaped "tub," too deep and narrow to imply use, is crafted from  layer upon layer of steam-moistened, glued, then stapled sheaths of raw, rich  wood. From one end of the vessel shoots a queer vertical "handle" worked in a  similar way to look like the flat, flexible tail of a beaver. Several fine  works are first formed and smoothed in wood then painted in a black charred  color and resanded so that strategic bits shine through, attracting light and  highlighting every carefully considered yet innocuous looking detail.  </P> <P> One black piece looks like a big abstracted figurine of a long-neck dinosaur  seen through primitive eyes; another exquisitely simple piece looks like a  hollow storage container for a harp; still another like a stalwart cocoon woven  not of silk fibers but of wood slats patiently bent and sanded to the  malleability of wet plaster. As a counterpoint to the cerebral energy of Jill  Geigerich shown next door, this show is a must. (Margo Leavin Gallery, 817 N.  Robertson Blvd., to May 20.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

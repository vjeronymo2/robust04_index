			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK pushes for debt forgiveness IF THERE is one message that Britain has hammered home during this week's monetary meetings in Washington it is that western creditor countries should move swiftly to grant the Trinidad terms for debt relief to those poorest developing nations which are reforming their economies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, has urged governments to forgive two thirds, and in some cases 80 per cent, of the official debts owed to them, against 50 per cent at present. He has also called for the terms to be applied to the whole stock of debt rather than selected maturities under the present workings of the Paris Club of industrialised creditor countries. The UK aim is to get these countries off the Paris Club's books and in a position where they can rebuild their financial credibility with a view to one day borrowing on the world capital markets. The proposed two thirds to 80 per cent rates of debt reduction have been chosen in the belief that they would permit 'exit rescheduling' after which countries need never return to the Paris Club. The call to apply the reduction to the whole stock of debt is to deal with problems caused by a Paris Club convention that restricts reschedulings and debt reductions to debts incurred before a specific cut-off date. The cut-off date is usually around the time a country first applied to reschedule its official debt. In the case of some African countries it can be as far back as the early 1980s. In these cases present rescheduling and relief agreements have not taken account of subsequent defaults and arrears that make up the lion's share of their present debt burdens. So far 17 countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, have benefited from the Trinidad terms, and had Dollars 1.75bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of debt and debt service obligations written off. Tentative UK estimates suggest if Britain's call to relieve the stock of debt were to be accepted, a further Dollars 8bn would be eligible for forgiveness. Britain claims that it is close to achieving a consensus among creditor countries on applying debt relief to the stock of debt. There is less agreement on having a rate of debt reduction higher than 50 per cent. However, the UK plan has still to win the support of Japan, which argues that debt relief leads to 'moral hazard' that will encourage other borrowers to renege on their obligations. One attraction of the Trinidad terms for the UK is that they have no adverse budgetary implications. The debt has largely arisen through defaults on export credit guarantees that have already been paid by the government. Other countries, notably the US, are less well placed. The US has to make a provision in its budget for official debt relief. Britain has therefore achieved something of a breakthrough in winning the support of the Clinton administration for 50 per cent debt reduction, which the Bush administration had refused to back.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. MAYOR'S RACE DRAWS NATIONAL PARTISAN INTEREST;  </P> <P> POLITICS: ELECTION OF A REPUBLICAN MAYOR IN THE NATION'S LARGEST CITY COULD  CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL BID BY GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO.  </P> <P> The increasingly close mayoral race in New York City has become a high-stakes  political battleground, as the White House and the Democratic National  Committee are trying to affect the outcome.  </P> <P> When Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani's mayoral campaign was on the verge of  running out of money recently, President Bush came to the rescue, raising $1.5  million at a dinner in Manhattan that allowed the candidate's commercials to  remain on the air.  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush will host a luncheon for Giuliani next week, and three  Cabinet secretaries plus White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu will be in  New York to give the Republican contender more support.  </P> <P> On the other side, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of  Massachusetts are campaigning for David N. Dinkins, the Democratic mayoral  candidate. Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey is expected to campaign  for Dinkins soon, and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Democratic Sen. Daniel  Patrick Moynihan campaigned at Dinkins' side Thursday.  </P> <P> Part of the reason for the intense national interest plays into nascent  presidential politics. The election of a Republican mayor in the nation's  largest city could send a cannon shot across the bow of any presidential  ambitions Cuomo may harbor.  </P> <P> An activist mayor of another party would be in a strong position to be a  political thorn in the governor's side, distracting Cuomo from national issues  and limiting out-of-state travel.  </P> <P> Previous mayoral-gubenatorial squabbles have damaged presidential hopes. Mayor  John V. Lindsay bitterly fought with former Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, and  Lindsay's criticism of Rockefeller for failing to call out the National Guard  during a bitter garbage strike in New York City reverberated nationally. When  Rockefeller ran for President, conservative Republicans attacked the reluctance  of the governor to summon the Guard.  </P> <P> Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans in New York City by five  to one. And in an effort to mobilize his natural Democratic base, Dinkins has  sought to picture Giuliani as a creature of "Reagan Republicanism," uncaring  about the plight of the inner cities.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Cuomo once again underlined that theme when he appeared with Mayor  Edward I. Koch and Moynihan at a rally for Dinkins in Manhattan.  </P> <P> "The national Republicans, who have announced they want to establish a new  beachhead . . . in New York by winning this election, have declared war on our  cities for the past eight years," Cuomo charged.  </P> <P> In a new Dinkins commercial, Kennedy attacked Giuliani for calling for a  reversal of the Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.  Giuliani changed his position on abortion during the campaign. He now supports  the right of a woman to have an abortion, plus public financing of abortions  for the poor.  </P> <P> When President Bush first praised Giuliani at a Republican dinner early in the  campaign, he mispronounced the candidate's name. But at a dinner for Giuliani  this month, he was a potent fund-raiser.  </P> <P> And as polls showed the race growing tighter, Sununu and three Cabinet  secretaries, Jack Kemp of Housing and Urban Development, Samuel K. Skinner of  Transportation and Nicholas F. Brady of Treasury, have scheduled fund-raising  events for Giuliani in New York.  </P> <P> A spate of polls was made public Thursday. A survey for New York Newsday  conducted by the Gallup Organization gave Dinkins a 12-point lead, but a  WNBC-TV/New York Post poll put the Democrat's lead at only 5 points, in line  with a recent Daily News-WABC-TV poll showing a 4-point lead.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNK BONDS, STOCKS, REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> BRADLEY AMASSES DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS  </P> <P> In trading that has increased in intensity over the last several years, Los  Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley has built up his personal investment portfolio with  stocks, valuable real estate and, in one notable gamble, junk bonds.  </P> <P> A Times study showed the diverse portfolio has been accumulated, in part, by  trading in stocks and bonds involved in some big corporate financial deals,  including three handled by Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk bond operation  headed by Michael Milken.  </P> <P> Bradley has received some of his largest political contributions from Drexel  and Milken's brother, Lowell Milken, and was instrumental in launching a  congressional lobbying effort to persuade the Securities and Exchange  Commission into allowing the firm to keep its junk bonds operation in Beverly  Hills.  </P> <P> Milken has since been indicted on charges of racketeering, insider trading and  securities fraud. While there is no indication that Bradley had any connection  with Milken's troubles, an intensifying investigation into the mayor's personal  finances prompted him to announce Thursday that he has placed his portfolio  into a blind trust.  </P> <P> "Today, I voluntarily take another step to reinforce my bond of trust with the  people," Bradley said in a statement.  </P> <P> The action is the latest in the series of moves the mayor has taken since  disclosure that he has accepted more than $100,000 in fees from two local  financial institutions that have had dealings with the city. Those disclosures  set off a furor, and prompted an investigation by City Atty. James K. Hahn, who  has asked for Police Department assistance.  </P> <P> Under heavy criticism, the mayor in recent weeks has returned $18,000 in  adviser fees to Far East National Bank. Then, a day after his surprisingly  narrow reelection victory, Bradley resigned from the board of Valley Federal  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. He also established a committee to write a tougher  ethics code for city officials.  </P> <P> Over the last two weeks, The Times has researched the financial holdings that  Bradley disclosed in the statements of economic interests that public officials  are required to file. The information was supplemented by data from financial  reporting services and interviews.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broad Ranges  </P> <P> Because elected officials are required to disclose the value of their  investments only in broad ranges, it was impossible to accurately determine the  current worth of the holdings Bradley will put into the trust.  </P> <P> Asked in an interview Thursday how much he is worth, Bradley replied, "I have  no idea, I couldn't tell you that."  </P> <P> While the mayor agreed to an interview only on grounds that questions would be  restricted to his blind trust, he did comment on his investing.  </P> <P> "There's no magic in it," he said. "I don't know any expert. My losses will  justify that. . . . The market is a risk and you buy from the judgment of  people. Sometimes they are right. Sometimes they are wrong."  </P> <P> Bradley declined to say who his broker was in any of his transactions.  </P> <P> Asked if he likes to "play" in the securities market, Bradley demurred. "Next  you'll want to know if I play the horses," he said.  </P> <P> Among Bradley's investments was Beatrice Foods Inc. preferred stock he bought  in March, 1986 -- one month before the company was acquired by BCI Holding Inc.  in a controversial takeover financed by Drexel Burnham's high-yield junk bonds.  </P> <P> The $6.2-billion leveraged buyout was one of the largest acquisitions of its  kind.  </P> <P> Bradley's statement of economic interest shows that he purchased between  $10,000 and $100,000 of Beatrice Foods stock. After he purchased the stock, its  value rose sharply. That was because of a BCI stock conversion and other  aspects of the deal.  </P> <P> After the takeover, investigators for a congressional subcommittee looked at  the deal, and last year reported that they found evidence that Drexel Burnham  and its employees acquired significant equity in the Beatrice takeover  transaction and profited from junk bonds that were later made available at an  escalated price to customers.  </P> <P> Questions also have been raised about the investment of Rep. Tony Coelho  (D-Merced) in the Beatrice transaction. Coelho's involvement was particularly  controversial because he obtained debentures (a form of corporate bonds) not  normally available to individual investors. The investment netted Coelho a  profit of $6,882 over six months.  </P> <P> Wickes Corp. was another Bradley investment. He reported purchasing between  $1,000 and $10,000 worth of Wickes Corp. common stock in June, 1985, shortly  after the firm made a preferred stock offering to raise cash. After the  offering, the price of the stock rose and Bradley sold his shares in March,  1986.  </P> <P> The indictment of Milken alleges that he manipulated the market to keep up the  price of Wickes stock in April. But by that time, Bradley had reported that he  had sold it.  </P> <P> The mayor also purchased debentures in a successful leveraged buyout of  Metromedia in 1984, when a group of executives took over the company in a deal  involving Drexel Burnham.  </P> <P> It was one of the largest junk bond deals at the time and the debentures were  considered risky. But by the following year -- when Bradley sold them -- the  bonds ultimately paid off at a premium, several brokers said, when financier  Rupert Murdoch led another takeover of the firm.  </P> <P> sh Political Supporter  </P> <P> As one of the mayor's biggest political supporters, Drexel Burnham and its  employees have given Bradley $72,700 in campaign contributions since 1983,  including $8,600 from Lowell Milken. Bradley also has received $51,880 from  employees of Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn., a Beverly Hills thrift that has  invested heavily in junk bonds through Drexel. Michael Milken is a close  acquaintance of Tom Spiegel, the president of Columbia who has had Bradley over  for dinner at his home, according to the mayor's calendar.  </P> <P> Bradley and Milken, who could not be reached for comment, have worked together  on behalf of several community charity foundations, a source close to Milken  said. Several months ago, Milken's personal public relations spokesman  suggested that a Times reporter interview Bradley and a number of other Milken  supporters for a profile story on the junk bond king.  </P> <P> But on Thursday, the spokesman, Ken Lerer, said that he furnished the reporter  with the name of William Elkins, the mayor's longtime aide, not Bradley's.  Elkins sits on the board of directors of Columbia Savings.  </P> <P> Bradley played a key role in helping to successfully bring pressure on the  Securities and Exchange Commission in January to drop its demand as part of a  securities fraud lawsuit that Drexel close Milken's junk-bond operation in  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder told The Times that the firm solicited Bradley's  help by asking him to call Rep. Coelho to arrange what one Coelho aide  described as "some kind of coordinated effort" to persuade the SEC to drop its  demand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acknowledges Contact  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the mayor acknowledged that Bradley contacted Coelho, but  said that the phone call was spontaneous and was not made at the request of  Drexel Burnham.  </P> <P> In other investments, Bradley has traded in Gibraltar Savings &amp; Loan  stocks, Mattel, Discovery Oil, Coast Savings &amp; Loan, Columbia Savings &amp;  Loan, and Valley Federal, on whose board he had served.  </P> <P> Bradley also is an investor in a Riverside County land deal put together by an  old friend, Juanita St. John, who is also head of the Task Force for Africa-Los  Angeles Relations. That organization's finances are being investigated by the  city attorney and city controller.  </P> <P> Records show that the mayor had been a relatively passive investor until the  early 1980s, tending to buy and hold stocks for longer-term appreciation. But  beginning in about 1983, the mayor became much more active in the market, in  some cases buying and selling stocks in a matter of weeks or months. For  example, in early 1986 the mayor bought and sold between $10,000 and $100,000  of stock in Coast Savings &amp; Loan in a month.  </P> <P> Bradley said he began to think about setting up the blind trust immediately  after the election.  </P> <P> "I began tossing the idea around with various people, they all seemed to concur  it would be a good step to take," he said.  </P> <P> "I just think in light of the time, a question of ethics has been raised . . .  and we in this city need to at least take actions that will reinforce  confidence of people in their elected leadership."  </P> <P> Bradley said he has not named the person in charge of the trust.  </P> <P> This article was reported by Times staff writers Bill Boyarsky, Glenn F.  Bunting and Rich Connell.  </P></p>

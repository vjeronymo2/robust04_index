Implementation is not an easy task; we should realistically  think of a way to implement the blueprint."    It is true that the current NPC session has been lively and  fruitful despite its short duration. Deputies are aware that  the session is being held at a time when our country's reform  and opening up are entering a new phase and when various reforms  of the economic structure are entering a crucial moment. The  central authorities have defined the overall task of "seizing  the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability" for the entire party and  country. Not only does this task accord with the aspirations of  hundreds of millions of people nationwide, but also conforms to  our country's reality and objective laws. Deputies attending  the session, therefore, signaled their intention of applying  centrally determined goals, major policies and principles, and  development ideas to their jobs in good time; of relaying them  to the masses; and of turning the intentions of central  authorities into society-wide and nationwide actions at the  earliest possible date.    "We are thinking of a way to implement the blueprint."  Deputy Ye Liansong, who is Hebei governor, was still busy at  this desk in the dead of night. He said: "The government of  the current term has proposed turning Hebei into an economically  strong province? How shall we achieve this? By thoroughly and  actually implementing specific aspects of the major policies and  principles of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council at  the earliest possible date."    His remarks hit the nail on the head. The deputies are  generally aware that "thorough implementation" carries  exceptional significance this year, particularly with respect to  the CPC Central Committee's call for "conceiving new ideas for  economic development." This year is crucial to reform and  opening up. Many major reform measures have been introduced.  We shall encounter considerable problems and difficulties.  This requires people to think more often, more closely, and  more thoroughly. We should go to the front lines to find  effective solutions to problems.    Ye Liansong noted: The key to implementing the blueprint is  to change leading cadres' work style. We must proceed in a  down-to-earth manner. "Dishonest and substandard" work carried  out by leading cadres are even more harmful than "counterfeit  and inferior" products produced by enterprises. He cited an  example, saying: Toward the end of last year, the provincial  party committee and government experimentally implemented a new  set of measures and regimes of incentives and restraints  regarding the appointment of cadres. The purpose of these  measures and regimes is to appoint cadres who work in a  down-to-earth manner to important positions so as to create a  situation in which "capable people will be promoted, people of  average ability will make way for others, and mediocre people  will be demoted," as well as to promote the habits of  determining the true state of affairs, telling the truth, doing  practical turns, and seeking tangible results.    To implement the blueprint is to be practical. To be  practical is to assess local advantages and disadvantages in an  extremely objective and calm manner, and to pinpoint problems  and their root causes in a down-to-earth manner before making  great efforts to surmount them. In short, it means seeking  truth from facts.    Deputy Wang Guiming, who is secretary of Tianjin's Nankai  district party committee, said: We still have a long way to go  before we can turn the intentions of central authorities into  actions at the grass-roots level and achieve tangible results.  He maintained: Fund shortages aside, the greatest difficulty  in seizing the opportunity to develop the economy stems from  structural problems. We have yet to streamline the government  apparatus and completely change the government's functions.  Policies now come from different sources, and there are just  too many departments in charge. In handling an affair, one has  to consult 36 departments. By the time one has accomplished an  affair, the market opportunity has long passed. It seems that  establishing a leadership system consistent with the socialist  market economy is a pressing task.    What shall we do at the moment? Practical action is needed  to implement the blueprint amid considerable difficulties and  problems. Hebei deputies Li Ruichang and Bai Runzhang found  themselves in agreement with Tianjin deputies Wang Guiming, Hi  Zhikuan, and Kou Shiqing on this matter. They all said: "We  still need to solve reform-related problems through reform  means." They maintained: At present, we should draw on  advanced management expertise at home and abroad in order to  break free from the old management mode. We should carry out  reform in our work and perform our work in the course of reform.  Moreover, we should limit the time and simplify the procedures  for handling matters by leaders at all levels and by general  affairs departments. They also proposed: The government should  change its functions in the course of reform, letting the market  deal with things that should be handled by market forces and  allowing enterprises to manage matters that fall within the  scope of their authority. The government should only concern  itself with exercising macroeconomic regulation and control,  with coordinating actions, and with providing service.    Savvy entrepreneurs are the most practical men of action.  When the reporters asked deputies Ji Xuecheng and Liu Jianzhang  -- respectively general manager of Tianjin Automotive Industrial  Corporation and board chairman of Tianjin Hualian Trading House  -- on how to "implement" the blueprint, they pronounced these  two characters: "Practical deeds." They explained: "Stalling"  is the dreaded character when it comes to implementing the  blueprint. Postponing a matter from today until tomorrow and  from tomorrow until the day after tomorrow is something to be  worried about.    Li Huisheng, a peasant deputy from Baoding District, said:  "The NPC session stresses the importance of agriculture  everyday. Nevertheless, relevant policies have not been  implemented among peasants. At the end of each year, for  example, peasants are left with just over 100 yuan for each mu  of land tilled, although they had all along been anticipating  additional incomes. When shall we ever become comparatively  well-to-do? He said: We, peasants, have composed a doggerel:  The prices of production means are soaring, the prices of  agricultural and sideline products are crawling, and the  benefits from agricultural and cotton production are sliding.  The eight measures for strengthening agriculture outlined in  Premier Li Peng's report struck a chord with us. We hope these  measures will come to fruition. We, peasants, are waiting for  results."    It is true that people across the country are waiting for,  looking forward to, and assessing actions to implement the  guidelines of the current session.</p>

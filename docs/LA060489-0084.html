			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's new 542-member Supreme Soviet convened for the first time  and chose economist Yevgeny M. Primakov as chairman of the Soviet of the Union,  one of the two chambers of the legislature, the standing lawmaking body, which  will meet for eight months each year. The second chamber is the Soviet of  Nationalities. Primakov, an ally of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, proposed  creating four commissions and 14 committees, including one to oversee the KGB  secret police. Primakov said the committees are modeled in part on the U.S.  Congress.  </P></p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Wilton in agreed bid for Cowan WILTON GROUP, involved both in investing and dealing in property and shares and in specialist restoration stonemasonry, has launched a recommended offer for Cowan de Groot. At the same time Wilton also announced a decline into losses of Pounds 1.08m (profits Pounds 822,000) for 1990, on turnover of Pounds 4.26m (Pounds 5.24m). Wilton already owns 7.4m ordinary shares (29.3 per cent) in the toys, electrical components, hardware and household goods company and is offering six new ordinary shares for every Cowan ordinary, valuing each Cowan at 15p and the whole company at Pounds 3.8m. It is also offering one new 11 per cent cumulative preference share for each Cowan 10.5 per cent cumulative preference share. In 1990 interest payable and similar charges reduced Wilton's pre-tax line by Pounds 1.56m (Pounds 452,000) and losses per share emerged at 0.26p (earnings 0.16p). Mr Michael Buckley, chairman, said that a main factor in the decline in profitability was Wilton's investment in Cowan. A takeover was a 'practical commercial solution,' given that so much of Wilton's management resources had been spent on Cowan's affairs.</p>

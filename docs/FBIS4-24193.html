			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter de Ionno] </F>   [Text] The SANDF [South African National Defence Force] has  reduced its order for Pilatus trainer aircraft from 75 to 60 in  a package of cutbacks designed to pay for the defence force's  R650-million [rand] contribution to the Reconstruction and  Development Plan [RDP].    No army bases are being closed in the coming year, but the  rapid reaction force will be cut by at least half, severely  reducing South Africa's ability to project force in a crisis or  extend help in the form of foreign peace-keeping missions, say  defence force spokesmen.    Training programmes are being shrunk and annual large-scale  conventional battle exercises may be cancelled this year.    An across-the-board decision to put a hold on major  equipment- development programmes short of commitment to orders  will hit the already stressed defence industry.    In addition to the R650-million contribution, the SANDF is  expected to provide a further "in kind" donation to the RDP in  the form of engineering equipment and training resources worth  about R350-million. Discussions on these provisions began in  May, but were postponed because the government could not  identify specific requirements.    The funding cut defied a defence headquarters bottom-line  spelt out in a crisp policy document issued before the Budget,  "that a further reduction in defence spending is not feasible".  The reduction is a clear signal to hawks that they can expect  their wings to be clipped still further in line with public  expectations and world trends.    In the document, defence force chief General Georg Meiring  outlines reduced armoured vehicle and unacceptable anti-aircraft  capabilities, halted production of the G6 cannon and drastic  cuts in air power were already undermining the SANDF's ability  to ensure the country's defence.    Acknowledging that the absence of a foreseeable threat  within  five years only demands low force levels, the SANDF's final word  is that "defence spending will have to increase in future years."    With plans to increase RDP allocations progressively from  departmental savings coupled to expected integration costs  remaining at least R1-billion until 1997 and the  still-to-be-calculated costs of retrenchments at senior level,  it is difficult to see where the generals expect extra money to  be found.    Lieutenant-General B.S. Raubenheimer, SANDF Chief of Staff,  Finances, says the funding cuts of 50 percent over the past six  years have reduced the military to an "affordable force".</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Associates behind 38% rise at IAWS IAWS, the Dublin-based food, fertiliser and agriproducts company, reported a 38 per cent increase to IPounds 7.85m (Pounds 8.47m) in annual pre-tax profits helped by a near-Pounds 1m increase in the contribution from associated companies. The return for the year to July 31 was struck on sales just 5 per cent higher at IPounds 398.8m. IAWS said the profits advance confirmed the benefits of the acquisition of RH Hall, the animal feeds supplier purchased in September 1990 and included for 11 months in 1991. The company, owner of well-known Irish names such as Bolands Flour Mills and Shamrock, boosted the associates' contribution from IPounds 498,000 to IPounds 1.4m. During the year the company increased its holding in two associates - Northern Ireland-based John Thompson and Irish Pride Bakeries - to 50 per cent. Tight control of working capital helped to cut debt by Pounds 12m to Pounds 19.7m. Gearing was 46 per cent. The final dividend is held at 1p for a maintained total of 2p. Earnings were up 33 per cent to 6.5p.</p>

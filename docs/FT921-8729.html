			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Motoring: Estates make the running SOME buyers of large estate cars can be quite image-conscious. Before deciding upon make or model, they ask themselves: would I care to be seen in this car at Badminton, or even my local point-to-point? Many then turn instinctively to Mercedes-Benz or Volvo. But there are more choices around today than for some years. I have been driving some of the latest large estates that transport permutations of people, lots of luggage or bulky items with ease, comfort and style. Among them are the Audi 100, Citroen XM and Vauxhall Carlton turbo-diesel. The Audi 100 estate, no longer called the Avant, has lost its steeply-sloped tail. This made it look nice and sleek and kept the rear window clean on a wet motorway but was no help at all when you wanted to carry an awkward piece of furniture. So Lovejoy, BBC-TV's rascally antique dealer, would never have had an Avant. I am not sure he would want an Audi 100 estate, either. The floor to roof height is a meagre 30 inches (76 cm) although there is an enormous secret compartment under the carpet. But he would approve of the Vauxhall Carlton; a 3 ft (91 cm) single bed slides into it with space to spare. The capacious Citroen XM has self-levelling, hydro-pneumatic suspension. One-up, it rides as softly as a car. Fully laden - and it will take almost two-thirds of a ton - it maintains the same height and stance and rides just as comfortably. If Lovejoy went into marble statuary, this would be his car. Citroen XM estates cost from Pounds 17,225 for a two-litre with manual gears to Pounds 26,750 for a three-litre V6 automatic. A manual-only 2.1-litre turbo-diesel is Pounds 20,640. Although in no way quirky, they are unmistakably Citroens even if they share most of their mechanical bits and pieces (suspension excepted) with Peugeot's bland but civilised 605 saloon. Audi lists the 100 2.8E V6 automatic estate at Pounds 25,386. It is a sportier drive than the Citroen although this will mean more to the business motorist driving it solo during the week than when his family has piled aboard at the weekend. Both Audi and Citroen are lovely motorway cruisers although the Audi has too much tyre rumble. The Citroen's semi-active suspension keeps it upright on bends; for crossing rough meadows or driving down rutted tracks, it can instantly be hitched-up an inch or two to stop it running aground. Although Vauxhall's Carlton estate has been around for some years, a Pounds 16,585, 2.3-litre, 100 horsepower, turbo-charged and inter-cooled diesel version is new for 1992. It is an impressive car. Build quality is excellent, it rides well with a remarkable lack of road noise, and is massively roomy inside. It has a silky, five-speed manual transmission and a light clutch. Anti-lock brakes are standard and the seats are so comfortable that it is hard to believe it is really a Vauxhall-badged, German-made Opel. After a slightly throbby start-up, the engine smooths out. For a turbo-diesel, it pulls exceptionally strongly at low speeds, yet spins freely up to higher revolutions in the gears. Two other slightly-smaller but, for their size, roomy estates to have come my way recently were the Subaru Legacy 2.0 GL, powered by a two-litre flat-four with multi-point fuel injection, and a Fiat Tempra turbo-diesel. The Subaru, with permanent four-wheel drive, has to be rated a best buy at Pounds 14,449 for people who really must have exceptional traction. The five-speed gearbox has a high range for road use and a low range for off-roading or re-starting on a steep hill with a heavy trailer. It has gentle good manners and a distinctive, although not wearying, engine note. Fiat's Tempra and the Subaru have raised roofs so people in the back seats have ample head-room. Parents - and grandparents - will approve of the Tempra's rear doors. They open to 90 degrees, which makes putting young children into their safety seats so much easier. At low speeds, there is no mistaking the Fiat for anything but a diesel but the 1.9-litre engine quietens and has plenty of punch once the turbo is forcing air into the cylinders at 1,500 rpm and over. The electronic instrument panel includes that useful aid to fuel economy, a bar-graph boost gauge. The Tempra TDS estate costs Pounds 13,781 with power steering; ABS brakes are an optional extra.</p>

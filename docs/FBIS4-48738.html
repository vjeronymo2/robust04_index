			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 25 May (KNA/PANA) -- The strike action  called for Wednesday [25 May] by Mathias Hitimana, leader of a  minor Burundi pro-monarchist opposition party, People's  Reconciliation Party (PRP), did not take effect. The PANA  correspondent in Bujumbura noted that in Bujumbura the capital,  offices, banks and transport were functioning normally.    The PRP leader had called the strike to protest against the  closure of public media organs to the opposition and the  proposed holding of a conference on Burundi, scheduled to take  place in Nairobi, Kenya. Contacted by PANA by telephone  Wednesday [25 May], the PRP leader denied that the strike had  failed. He claimed that in the long run, the citizens will join  his movement's cause because it was just. Asked to comment on  the proposed Nairobi conference on the theme "Restoration and  Maintenance of Public Order in a State of Law", Hitimana, who is  a half-caste said the meeting was under intense discussions  between the UN special representative in Burundi and the  country's politicians.    The negotiations are being conducted to determine the  justification of such meeting, as well as the choice of venue.  [passage omitted]</p>

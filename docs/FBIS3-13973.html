			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by journalist Kanchan Gupta] </F>   [Text] At a time when Pakistan is trying to misuse every  international forum to propagate half-truths and outright lies  about Kashmir, it is heartwarming to hear friends raise their  voice against this nefarious game plan. One such friend of  India is the president of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclac Havel,  who is at present visiting this country. In no uncertain terms  Mr. Havel has opposed the attempt to internationalize the  Kashmir issue, thereby endorsing India's stand. Mr. Havel has  asserted that the best way out is through peaceful bilateral  negotiations as envisaged in the Shimla Agreement. Mr. Havel's  stress on bilateral talks and peaceful negotiations stems from  his abiding faith in the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, which  revolves around the concept of nonviolence.    This is obviously not the case of those who would like to  violate India's territorial integrity. Needless to add, the  greatest threat on this front is today faced from Pakistan,  which has been waging a low intensity proxy war in Kashmir for  the past four years. How else does one explain the fact that  even as Mr. Havel was prescribing bilateralism as the best  option, Pakistan's representatives were busy trying to move a  blatantly anti-India resolution at the ongoing UN Human Rights  Conference in Geneva. Is Islamabad really interested in the  welfare of the Kashmiri people, or is it more more bothered  about embarrassing New Delhi? It would appear that it is the  second point that interests Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government more  than anything else. That is to harass India. For if India had  anything to hide about the reality in Kashmir, it would not have  allowed foreigners access to the valley. Over the past year more  than a 100 foreign journalists and legislators have visited  Kashmir. As recently as last Monday, four ambassadors to the  European Commission representing the Netherlands, Greece,  Belgium, and Germany were flown to Kashmir for an on-the-spot  assessment of the situation.    Let there be no mistake about the purpose of sending a  so-called fact-finding mission to Kashmir, which Pakistan has  been pressing for time and again both in the UN and now at  various human rights conferences. What Pakistan wants is a team  of its own choice, preferably constituted by individuals who are  favorably inclined toward promoting Islamabad's designs on  Kashmir. Such a mission would serve the dual purpose of  furthering the Pakistani cause and whitewashing Islamabad's  nefarious game plan. It would no doubt try and suppress the fact  that the Inter-Services Intelligence--ISI--has a finger in the  Kashmir pie; that, had it not been for arms and material  assistance from across the border, terrorism would not have  flourished in the valley. Neither would such a team take note  of the ISI training out-of-work Afghan mojahedin and then  sending them into Kashmir to lend a helping hand to the  separatists.    Given this backdrop, it is becoming increasingly imperative  for India to mobilize international opinion against Pakistani  designs on Kashmir. Thankfully, given India's record as a  leading members of the Nonaligned Movement and its democratic  credentials, not to mention the role the country has played in  promoting the cause of the developing world--something which  Pakistan can never boast of--there are numerous people who are  willing to lend their voice against Islamabad's perception. For  instance, last week the U.S. assistant secretary of state, Miss  Robin Raphel, who had audaciously suggested a couple of months  ago that Kashmir's accession to India was not final and binding,  was taken to task by two senators, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan  -- a Democrat and a former ambassador to India--and Mr. Hank  Brown--a Republican. They did not mince words in criticizing  the U.S. Administration for its South Asia policy as reflected  in comments and statements on the Kashmir issue. Mr. Moynihan  will soon be visiting India and it is hoped that the impressions  he will carry back will improve awareness of the reality as it  exists in Kashmir.  *</p>

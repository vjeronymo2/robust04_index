			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Plaid Cymru suspends pairing arrangements Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday followed Labour's lead by suspending pairing arrangements with government MPs. Mr Ieuan Wyn Jones, party whip, said its four MPs would review the decision 'once it becomes clear whether the Labour party intend to run a hard campaign to bring down the government'. The decision means Mr John Major, the prime minister, will be unable to miss votes without reducing the government's majority. He is paired with Mr Dafydd Wigley, the Plaid Cymru MP for Caernarfon.</p>

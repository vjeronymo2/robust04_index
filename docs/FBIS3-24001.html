			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Seyfalin Akhundov: "A Foggy Future for a </F> `Transparent' Border"]    [Text] Control was maintained  in its full volume for 4 days at international checkpoints on  the Russian-Azeri border. After the experiment the border guards  decided that a stricter regime was needed in the Dagestan  section.    Major General Aleksandr Baranov, the deputy chief of main  staff of the RF Border Troops, is certain that channels of  illegal crossings of people and cargo over the Azeri border with  Iran and Turkey exist. Just in those 4 days when the border  checks were made more carefully, 57 violators from Iran, Iraq,  Turkey and Pakistan were detained attempting to penetrate  illegally into the Russian Federation through Azerbaijan and  bring in tons of smuggled goods. Border troops confiscated  44,500 bottles of alcoholic beverages. Smugglers attempted to  take 200 refrigerators out of Russia.    Two Russian border detachments, Nakhichevan and Lenkoran,  which were withdrawn from Azerbaijan in 1992, are now stationed  in the cities of Makhachkala and Derbent. All of last year the  border troops busied themselves with their own accommodation.  Control of the Russian-Azeri border, which runs along the Samur  River, was selective. But now they are ready to begin serving  full time.    This OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent was told by the press  service of the Russian Border Troops that stricter control  shouldn't create any obstacles to border crossings by citizens  of the CIS. However, contrary to the assertions, now that the  status of the border is changing, the procedure for crossing  into a contiguous country will be as close as it can to the  regulations existing on Russia's borders with countries of the  far frontier. Which means a lot of red tape. Moreover, how they  intend to solve the problem of the Lezgins is unclear. At  present these people, who live in Southern Dagestan and in the  north of Azerbaijan, are divided by the Russian-Azeri border.  Are half a million people to expect repetition of a kind of  "Berlin Wall," albeit of a less severe form?    When he arrived in Azerbaijan in January, Colonel General  Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of the RF Border Troops,  tried to persuade President Aliyev to give his consent to  locating Russian Border Troops along the Azeri-Iranian border  and in the 11-kilometer section of the Turkish border in the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. By returning to positions they  occupied long ago, they could dependably protect the southern  borders of Azerbaijan, and restrain the onslaught of smugglers  and messengers of the international drug mafia, who have  transformed Azerbaijan into a transloading point en route to  Russia and back. However, Nikolayev's mission failed, and the  consent was not obtained.    Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy  commander-in-chief of the Border Troops, met with leaders of the  Lezgin National Council in Derbent. LNC Chairman Nariman  Ramazanov told this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent about this  meeting. Because Azerbaijan joined the CIS, the Lezgins were  certain that the danger of their becoming a people divided in  half by a border was past. But now the position of the border  guards is such, the LNC chairman said, that they will apparently  close the border soon, because its "transparency" was doing  significant damage to Russian interests. "This in turn will  divide the Lezgin people for all time: The governments of  Azerbaijan and Russia are attempting to solve the problem  without our participation," said Nariman Ramazanov. He is  frightened by the growing separatist sentiments among the  Lezgins. Kakhrimanov, who served as chairman of the LNC before  Ramazanov, and his supporters are appealing to their people to  take up arms and fight for establishment of an independent state  of Lezgistan, which would include land to the north and south of  the Samur River. Formerly the chief of the political directorate  of the Northern Caucasian Military District, Kakhrimanov enjoys  significant authority among his fellow countrymen. It became  known to this OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent from one of these  close associates of the retired general that large amounts of  weapons were concentrated in regions adjacent to the  Russian-Azeri border. If a compromise is not reached shortly in  the matter of the Russian-Azeri border and the status of the  region's Lezgin population, these weapons may begin to speak.</p>

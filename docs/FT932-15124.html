			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Confidence up in financial services BUSINESS confidence in nearly all sectors of the financial services industry has strengthened markedly for the second successive quarter, a Confederation of British Industry survey shows. The survey, conducted quarterly with accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand, covers more than 300 companies including banks, finance houses, building societies, life and general insurance companies, fund managers, securities traders and venture capitalists. The survey, which covers the period to the end of February, found that while business volumes fell slightly, they fell more slowly than in the previous quarter and are now expected to increase in the three months to June. Volumes picked up for most fund managers, insurance brokers and security traders, while the sharpest declines were reported by life insurers and venture capitalists. Some 39 per cent of life insurance respondents said that sales volumes actually fell in the period, in spite of expectations that they would rise. Sluggish demand, intense domestic competition and the threat of legislation are all seen as impediments to future business. While profitability is improving for the banking sector, 49 per cent of respondents reported an increase in non-performing loans which has restrained the improved earnings which should have accompanied the rise in fee and commission income. Meanwhile, the survey found that in all sectors of the financial services industry, margins widened further and average fees, commissions and premiums grew strongly over the last quarter, although their value grew more slowly than in the previous quarter. Industry respondents also reported lower costs for the sixth consecutive survey period. The sharpest cost reductions were reported by venture capitalists, general insurers, finance houses and building societies. Profitability also increased moderately overall, with fund managers, insurance brokers and general insurance companies reporting the largest increases.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Up to 90% of Muscovites 'will fall into poverty' MORE THAN 60 per cent of Muscovites have been pushed below the poverty line in recent months, according to a survey of living standards carried out by the Norwegian trade union research organisation, FAFO International, for Moscow city council. This figure is likely to rise to 85-90 per cent as prices triple in coming weeks, Mr Erik Hansen, head of FAFO's East Europe studies department, warned yesterday. The report, based on live interviews with 2,500 Muscovites between June and August, says: 'We are witnessing a phenomenon so far unknown to sociology; middle income families have overnight been turned into low-income families'. Real per capita income of the poorest sections of the population fell by 20 per cent after last April's limited price reforms, while the incomes of middle income households fell 250 per cent 'forcing them to learn a new consumption pattern formerly characteristic of low income households'. The report shows that even before the abolition of official prices for all but a handful of basic items this week, the average Moscow household spent 80 per cent of its income on food, while 'a significant part of the population spends all its income on food, leaving nothing for the purchase of clothing, footwear, leisure and consumer durables'. Under the former Soviet system, Moscow and St Petersburg (formerly Leningrad) enjoyed significantly higher living standards than most Soviet cities and received priority supplies of food and other products. They have been hit particularly hard by the collapse of the centralised distribution system and cuts in spending on military industries which are big employers in both cities. The dramatic impoverishment which has reduced much of the middle class to penury now threatens the very survival of the poorest strata of the population, the report indicates. The freeing of prices will hit hardest those like the elderly, the handicapped, the chronically ill and single mothers who are unable to adapt to the new circumstances, it says. More than 40 per cent of the workforce fear losing their jobs. This proportion reflects the danger accurately, says the report, given that 'privatisation of small and medium enterprises, combined with further cutbacks in the standing army and military production could create a reserve army of unemployed in the Moscow region of 25-35 per cent of the present workforce'. Fear of crime and violence is growing, too, as is concern that Moscow, despite its problems, will attract a stream of 'refugee-migrants' who will put additional pressure on the city's already overcrowded and inadequate housing, health and other facilities. Although the report gives a bleak picture of contemporary and future living conditions in the Russian capital, it also indicates that 42 per cent of the overall population, mainly young and better educated, are prepared to face market conditions and are willing to raise their qualifications, invest capital and adapt. But the dry statistics also reveal that, barring large foreign aid, 1992 could be the most traumatic year for Muscovites and millions of other former Soviet citizens since the collapse of the Soviet economy in 1919.</p>

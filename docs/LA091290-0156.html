			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 50 KILLED IN FLAREUP OF S. AFRICA BLACK BATTLING  </P> <P> Forty-nine blacks and a white policeman were killed in some of the most vicious  factional fighting since violence erupted in townships around Johannesburg a  month ago, police said today.  </P> <P> A predawn bombing damaged the offices of the governing National Party but  caused no injuries, police said.  </P> <P> The deaths occurred overnight and early today in the townships ringing  Johannesburg, where battles between rival black groups have claimed about 700  lives in the last month.  </P> <P> Worst hit was Tembisa, northeast of Johannesburg, where 25 bodies were found,  police said. Also, 13 people were killed in Vosloorus, seven in Tokhoza and one  in Katlehong -- all townships southeast of Johannesburg.  </P> <P> The policeman was killed and three colleagues seriously wounded when they were  ambushed with assault rifles while driving through a squatter camp in the  Soweto township.  </P> <P> Also in Soweto, three blacks were killed when their yellow van was riddled with  gunfire from AK-47 rifles. The attackers apparently mistook the van for a  police vehicle, most of which are yellow.  </P></p>

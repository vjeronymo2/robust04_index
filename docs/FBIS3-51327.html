			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo today said that within Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] "the only point about which there is a serious  argument or on which positions are still very divergent" is the  adoption of a tariff for importation of capital goods and  informatics products.    The minister is now in the Uruguayan city of Colonia, where  the Argentine, Brazilian, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan presidents,  along with their ministers of economy, are attending a Mercosur  summit.    Cavallo denied that the deadlines for implementation of  Mercosur will be postponed, noting in this regard that a  document christened "Consolidation of the Customs Union and  Transition Toward the Common Market" will be signed "probably  this afternoon."    Concerning informatics products, the minister said that  Argentina advocates "a very low tariff, like the one agreed upon  within the NAFTA," adding that Brazil "wants a very high tariff  because it has a protection system."    He added: "When there is no agreement, debates continue, but  this is an issue on which we can reach a final agreement if each  country maintains a tariff structure for the capital goods it  wants, and if a convergence process is then implemented."    In statements to a Buenos Aires radio station, Cavallo said  that Argentina "wants all areas of the economy, industry, the  farm sector, and the services to make investments, purchasing  the best possible technology at the lowest price."    "That is why we encourage our capital goods producers with  internal tax refunds, but we will not permit them to sell their  equipment at prices that are higher than those prevailing  abroad," he said.</p>

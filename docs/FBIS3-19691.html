			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roswin Finkenzeller: "Stoiber: Moral Rigor Must </F> Not Be Exaggerated"]    [Text] Deggendorf, 20 Mar -- The Christian Social Union  [CSU] is not the Bavarian Social Democratic Party [SPD]. If it  were, its so-called small party conference would mainly have  discussed the party's recent stroke of bad luck, with a number  of affairs going on before the beginning of three election  campaigns. Most of the CSU party committee members, however,  avoided touching on the worrying issue in front of switched-on  microphones. And when the subject was mentioned in Deggendorf,  much of what was said did not really sound like defense, but  more like heart-searching. Landtag Group Chairman Glueck not  only accepted that the parties had the role of a "lightning  rod," but he also acknowledged the particularly strict standards  applied to politicians. Party Chairman Waigel complained that  the party of Lafontaine and Stolpe is viewed more tolerantly  than the CSU, but he also said that it is "the politicians' task  to be examples." The Christian image of man induced Secretary  General Huber to the insight: "We have faults and  imperfections. We are not angels." Yet, he called upon his  party colleagues "not to give in morally to the opposition and  the press."    Minister-President Stoiber promised "investigations" into  the  dubious matters, as had been "my highest principle in dealing  with these problems" since he took office a year ago. But on  the other hand, he admitted, maybe also beating his own breast:  "Moral rigor must not be exaggerated." He strongly rejected  the SPD's comparing the CSU with the Mafia, because one cannot  condemn an entire group because one or the other of its members  does something wrong. Also, he warned the CSU not to be tricked  by the suggestion to move away from the Strauss traditions in  order to be saved. In spite of all human weaknesses, Strauss  achieved great things for Bavaria and the CSU, and this course  must be continued. Thus, in the upcoming election campaigns,  the women and men of the CSU must simply "present themselves as  the more competent people."    He also warned against another trap. He could have referred  to it asking where the desirable rootedness ends and damnable  nepotism starts in the relationship between parties and the  population. In Deggendorf he mentioned a "businessman from  Pfarrkirchen" who had once given the CSU 500 German marks and  now has "problems with social regulations," for which he turned  to his deputy. The minister-president described for himself and  for the audience how the deputy, influenced by the opposition's  accusations of nepotism and quagmire, no longer dares "deal with  people's problems." But should the deputy really contend  himself with referring the businessman to the relevant  authorities or to the legal opportunities available so that "no  affair can come of it?" Stoiber: "He will say -- why did I vote  for you?"    The adopting of a manifesto on Europe that describes the  CSU's well-known position was almost routine. European Deputy  Friedrich described his party colleagues as "realists" that are  different from both the "skeptics" and the "euphorics." The CSU  showed skepticism in its own way: The "stability criteria" of  the Maastricht Treaty must be "strictly" observed, and in the  process of unification, "stability comes before speed." The CSU  rejects the idea of a European federal state and welcomes the  membership of East European countries in the alliance of states.  The only debate took place when a delegate wanted to have the  demand for a European social union included in the manifesto.  His request was not met, with the delegates probably being most  impressed with Stoiber's argument that "social benefits in  Portugal" must not be paid for with German money.</p>

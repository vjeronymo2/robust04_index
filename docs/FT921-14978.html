			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Establishment's anxieties spell the end for Chadli: A willingness to live without democracy rather than under Islamic fundamentalism PRESIDENT Chadli Bendjedid left the Algerian political scene as discreetly as he entered it 13 years ago. He had never aspired to the post of president, as he reminded his countrymen in a rambling letter of resignation at the weekend. Mr Chadli was chosen after the death of Colonel Houari Boumedienne as a compromise candidate between the pro-Libyan Colonel Salah Yiahiaoui and Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the then foreign minister. Born of peasant stock in the eastern village of Boutelja, Mr Bendjedid started his working life as a docker. He soon joined the fight to free Algeria from French rule, which lasted 132 years. His family came to enjoy power but those who knew him well suspect that he remained, at heart, the bluff commander of the western military region of Oran, which he ran for 15 years after 1964. Algeria's third head of state was, in effect, pressured into resigning by the country's establishment. The army had no desire to see its considerable influence questioned by the Islamic fundamentalists whose party, the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), threatened to come to power in the country's first free post-independence elections. Senior officers feared that the fundamentalists would cut the military budget and set up some form of Islamic militia as a rival to the army. Pressure also came from the largest trade union and professional and civil organisations. Many of these people, notably women, made public their readiness to sacrifice the recent democratic experiments rather than live under the rule of the FIS. Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the FIS leader, said at last Friday's prayers that 'the struggle between divine justice and the injustice of anti-Islamic barbarism is our destiny. Cohabitation between truth and injustice is impossible.' The FIS picked up 188 seats in the first round of the general elections last December and, until their cancellation yesterday, was headed for victory in the run-off on Thursday Although FIS leaders reined in their many supporters after the first round, they continued to preach fire and brimstone, describing the influential Berber-speaking minority as 'unbelievers' and the 300,000 Algerians who marched in support of democracy through the capital 10 days ago as 'Jews'. Algeria's new constitution, endorsed by popular vote in December 1988, bans parties which carry a religious denomination. After the FIS won control of a majority of town councils in the June 1990 local elections, it showed little respect for the rule of law and the needs of ordinary Algerians, much as the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party had done before its power was broken in the streets in the 1988 riots. Mr Chadli's resignation has brought to the fore Mr Abdelmalek Benhabyles, a member of the landed gentry and a diplomat. Nicknamed Socrates, as president of the Constitutional Council he must call a new presidential election within 45 days. However, candidates must be endorsed by at least 600 local councillors, which, in effect, rules out any but an FIS or FLN candidate. The rules would thus seem to be ripe for change, so the 45-day delay will probably last much longer. Yesterday, before the elections were cancelled, the FIS warned the government of the consequences of such a move. Party leaders warned last week that any tampering with the FIS victory might provoke violent resistance, but they are themselves likely to meet fierce resistance if they come out on the streets. The party is divided. Two of its paramount leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj, remain in prison, where they have been since last June's riots. Two days ago a founding member of the party, Mr Ahmed Merani, accused Mr Hachani, its current leader, of being 'mad' and 'killing all hope in Algeria'. He was happy to see Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali remain prime minister because 'his government is the best we have had since independence'. After the president resigned, the prime minister called upon all Algerians to remain serene and united. The next few days will tell whether his call has been heeded. Editorial Comment, Page 12</p>

The product is a technology driver chip which  incorporates new element technology in order to achieve a high  speed architecture. NEC's developed architecture divides a  pipeline. Each pipeline executes multiple commands  simultaneously, and pipelines are further divided as processing  time increases which accomplishes high speed processing. As for  the element technology, from circuit and layout design, a high  speed processor, high speed cache memory, high speed clock  signal circuit, high speed clock signal distribution circuit,  and a low noise and high speed interface circuit were developed.  Low noise and high density standard cell layout were also  developed. Thus a CMOS with 500 MHz, 0.4 m, and triple layer  Al circuitry was developed.    The developed 32-bit RISC model MPU operates at 500 MHz. The  developed MPU is a CMOS with 0.4 m triple layer Al  circuitry.  It is a technology driver chip which incorporates new element  technology in order to come up with a high speed architecture.  The product is named ``GALLOP (GHz-clock Applicable Logic and  Layout Octpipeline Processor.''    The high speed architecture which operates at 500 MHz  divides  the pipelines. Each pipeline executes multiple commands  simultaneously, depending on the calculation time. The 32-bit  data path is organized with eight pipeline levels.  <H5>  New Technology Is Incorporated In Architecture, Circuit, And </H5> Layout    In order to realize the CMOS process with triple layer Al  circuitry operable at 500 MHz, new element technology was  incorporated in the circuit and layout designs. The new element  technology includes:    (1) high speed processor;    (2) high speed cache;    (3) high speed clock signal generator;    (4) high speed clock signal distributor;    (5) low noise high speed interface;    (6) low noise high density standard cell layout.    The developed chip has about 200 thousand transistors in a  chip area of 7.9x8.84mm[.sup]2[/]. It uses 3.3 volts, the  power consumption is 6 watts and it can operate at 500 MHz (see  table 1).       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The ``SSSP (Super  High-Speed Signal Processor)'' is the high speed signal  processor that was developed in 1989. It placed a 16-bit  arithmetic processor operating at 200 MHz on board. After that,  ``VSP3 (Video Signal Parallel Pipelined Processor)'' was  developed and operated at 300 MHz. Those devices were made using  bi-CMOS technology.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-50A>      Figure 1. RISC Model MPU High Frequency Trend </FIG>    For example, Alpha by DEC uses 0.75 m CMOS.  Additionally,  with 1 m multi-crystal Si emitter ECL bi-polar process, a  32-bit MPU can be operated with 115 W and 300 MHz. MPU high  speed is realized by using a RISC architecture. To achieve this  high performance, a technology to produce a high speed clock is  most important.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Operational Frequency (MHz); 2. The developed  product introduced this time; 3. Year of Introduction.&lt;/graphic&gt;     However, it is essential from now on to establish high speed  CMOS technology in order to make a low voltage and low cost  devices. For this reason, a RISC chip operable at 500 MHz was  developed for the purpose of determining the speed limit of CMOS  technology and establishing element technology which is  indispensable for future high speed MPUs.    The developed high speed architecture incorporates the basic  features of RISC that can process multiple commands  simultaneously, and additionally pipelines are divided when the  time to calculate is too long. At a concrete level, computing  element that takes a longer time, instruction cache, and data  cache are organized in two levels of pipeline. The register file  that takes a short computing time is in the first level  pipeline. As a result, data path is organized with 8 levels of  pipeline (see figure 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-50B>      Figure 2. Developed RISC Architecture </FIG>   <H5>  Also Employs High Frequency Speed Internally </H5>   As an architecture consideration, the external interface  executes at a lower frequency than the internal frequency.  Although the internal clock is 500 MHz, external clock can be  lowered to 62.5 - 250 MHz. Since the chip packaging and printed  circuit board have longer wiring and have large load and  inductance, the solution to transmit a high frequency signal was  studied. The 62.5 - 250 MHz external signal was twice, four  times, and eight times propagated in PLL (Phase Locked Loop)  circuit. Adjusting to the internal high speed, the instruction  cache and data cache have 1 K byte capacity.    Discussion of the circuit technology developed in element  and  layout technology follows next. The topics include: computing  element; cache memory; clock signal generator; clock signal  distributor circuit; interface circuit; and standard cell layout.  <H5>  Computing Element: Two Levels Of Pipeline Organization </H5>   Since the computation occur at 500 MHz, a pipeline that runs  at 2 ns is organized with two levels. The reason why the  pipeline stage is divided into two levels is because of  difficulty of processing addition calculations with one clock  cycle of 2 ns in one level.    In a 32-bit processor, adder, barrel shifter, and logic  processor are placed on board as an element technology. As an  adder, BLC (Binary Look ahead Carry) that has a good reputation  for video processing, and as a barrel shifter, a transfer gate  model selector are employed.  <H5>  Cache: Two Levels Same As Computing Element </H5>   Since cache memory operates at 500 MHz, the same as the  computing element, a 2 ns pipeline stage is organized with two  levels. At one level, address decode is performed, and at the  second level, signal is read and amplified, and a 22 bit tag  memory is compared with the address. In order to realize 2 ns  high speed, as for the element technology in cache memory, the  address decoder, pipeline register, and comparater are generated  by dynamic circuit design. As a result, the register part is  made small to 100 ps, which is 1/4th smaller than the  traditional register. And comparater speed is enhanced by  30%.    Cache memory uses 4 words as one block, date write is done  by  the write-back method, and the rewriting algorithm employs a  direct mapping method. Rewriting is processed by a bus circuit  control with one block unit.  <H5>  Clock Generator Circuit: Low Jitter PLL Developed </H5>   In order to maintain stable operation at 500 MHz, a low  jitter PLL circuit was developed. The PLL circuit consists of a  Phase Detector which detects the phase shift, Loop Filter which  converts the result of the phase shift to voltage, Voltage  Controlled Oscillator which controls oscillation frequency by  the loop filter output voltage, and a Counter which divides the  output oscillation signal.    In order for the loop filter to run stably at 500 MHz, a  differential amplifier was employed. By this, PLL circuit  frequency stability was improved greatly. Traditionally a loop  filter used the invertor which is placed on the video processor  board. Because of this, with relation to the threshold value of  MOS transistor, a deadband existed, and the frequency was  shifted greatly. This time because a differential amplifier was  employed which eliminated deadband, high stability was realized.  From circuit simulations, it was verified that jitter was  controlled to 15%. Offset problems caused by the  differential  amplifier were solved by feedback. Also for a counter, a dynamic  circuit was employed and 1 GHz operation was realized.  <H5>  Clock Distribution Circuit: Skew Was Reduced By Shortening </H5> The Layer    In order for the clock signal distribution circuit to run at  500 MHz, for the clock signal phase difference, the short  circuit method by which each layer level was shortened to reduce  clock skew was employed. The driver was distributed like a tree,  and then the driver output of each layer level was short  circuited, and skew correction was added (see figure 3). If the  distance between the clock driver is 4mm and input skew is 0.2  ns, then output skew can be reduced by half, 0.1 ns, by the  short circuit of each driver distance.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-51A>      Figure 3. Developed Clock Tree Layer Short Circuit </FIG>     On the other hand, for a part of memory and random logic,  the  driver can not be laid out like a tree. In that case, the clock  signal was supplied by using a large driver. At some point in  the output buffer to supply the clock, capacity to adjust skew  was installed, and by laser trimming, delay time was sensitively  adjusted.  <H5>  Interface Circuit: Low Noise With 1V Oscillation Width </H5>   In the interface circuit, a maximum 250 MHz external clock  signal can be transmitted. Moreover, the circuit that eliminates  nose generated by the interface circuit by itself was developed.  That consists of an input buffer circuit and an output buffer  circuit (see figure 4).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-52A>      Figure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed forFigure 4. Input and Output Buffer Circuit Developed for </FIG>     The input circuit buffer is configured with the combination  of a variable invertor circuit. Noise was controlled by terminal  resistors placed at the input terminals and connector terminals.  Terminal resistors are organized with 4 nMOSUs which have  different channel widths and are connected with parallel. An  externally supplied 4 bit signal turns these four nMOSUs on and  off. When the input buffer circuit characteristics are changed,  noise can be controlled by adjusting resistor values at the  terminal resistors. Reflection caused by improper adjustment of  impedance at bonding wires and packaging will also be eliminated  by the terminal resistors.    However, if the terminal resistor is built-in, chip power  consumption becomes larger. To solve this problem, signal  oscillation width in the input and output buffer circuit is  controlled to a low, 0 - 1V. At 0V, power is not consumed.  However if the reference terminal is lowered to 0.5V, then it  will cause a problem by being influenced from the ground  potential difference. For this problem, power source wiring was  strengthened at the layout design, and the fluctuation of  electrical potential was controlled.    Output signal level at output buffer circuit is determined  by  ratio between pMOS on-resistor and terminal resistor.    On the other hand, in the output buffer circuit, a  momentarily large current will flow when multiple circuits are  operated simultaneously. To solve this problem, the circuit is  divided in two groups, and the current peak was distributed over  two levels. For layers having different clock trees, the time  difference was maintained, so that the clock signal is given to  the register. The peak time difference is about 0.4 ns, and it  is not a problem practically. Delay time of both input buffer  circuit and output buffer circuit are quite small, 0.3 ns.    The interface circuit has a function to adjust phase shift  with an external system. That is a synchronous interface  circuit. By including a circuit to control interface delay time,  system skew is reduced.  <H5>  Layout: About 50% High Density Achieved </H5>   In layout design, transistor density was increased by  50%,  and new standard cell layout which intensely controls noise in  the power source was developed (see figure 5).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-53A>      Figure 5. Developed High Density, Low Noise Layout </FIG>     A simple method to achieve a high speed CMOS circuit is to  use a short channel length transistor. In addition, if the  wiring is minute, then capacity will be larger. Thus improvement  of transistor drive capacity is needed. For this reason, if  transistor width is increased, then transistor density is  lowered at the time of layout, wiring length is increased and  wiring capacity gets larger. To solve this dilemma, a high  density layout was developed this time.    High density was achieved by using the first level Al pole,  and wiring between cells was connected by a second and third  level Al. In the traditional layout, a region to connect at the  outside of a cell is necessary, but this time the layout does  not require that region. Second level Al is passed through at  the top of the cell, and 17 lines at the second level Al are  passed through at the cell 48 m in height.    This time using a standard cell, a 32-bit adder was laid  out,  and 10,210 transistors per mm[.sup]2[/] were integrated,  which is 50% more than the traditional model.  <H5>  Layout: Low Noise With Stack Model Wiring </H5>   Low noise was achieved by the development of a stack model  power source wiring layout. First, in order to supply a stable  power source, impedance was controlled, and the principle,  Rnoise must be shut off at the closest point to where the noise  is generatedS was followed. Impedance was controlled at the  merging layer of the first level Al and the second level Al.  That is because the area and resistance of power source wiring  and connecting wiring can be made small.    The reduction of noise was achieved by the stack model power  source wiring, in which large area of nMOS is established under  the power source wiring. The nMOS formed by using a polyside  layer becomes a bypass condenser, about 0.027 F, which  functionally controls noise. The peripheral area of PLL circuit  is covered by stack model power source wiring, and shielded from  the digital circuit that would be a source of other noise. In  addition, to avoid the influence of noise, the power source for  the digital circuit and the power source for the PLL circuit are  separated.  <H5>  PLL Circuit Establishes Independent Power Source Pad </H5>   In the developed overall chip layout, the database is placed  on the right side, and the data cache and instruction cache are  placed on the left side. The register file is placed on the data  path. Two cache memories are divided into blocks of cache body  and a tag part in order to make the layout area small.    The control circuit and PLL circuit placed on the right side  of the data path are surrounded by 200-240 m width power  source wiring and connecting wiring. The PLL circuit that uses  an analog signal is surrounded by stack model power source  wiring and also an independent power source pad is placed there.  The pad around the chip is spaced 140 m horizontally, and  150  m vertically, and 180 pieces are laid out.</p>

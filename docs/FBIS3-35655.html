During those  three sessions, it has become abundantly clear that the present  leadership and the opposition have different approaches to these  matters.    President Aliyev and his team stress that "only the former  leaders of Azerbaijan bear the responsibility for bringing  Russian forces in Baku which led to over 100 deaths and many  hundreds wounded among the peaceful population". In connection  with this, the following names were recalled: Abdurahman  Vezirov, the former First Secretary of Communist Party of  Azerbaijan; Ayaz Mutalibov, ex-Chairman of the Council of  Ministers and then Azerbaijani President; and Vagif Huseynov,  ex-Chairman of KGB of Azerbaijan.    The opposition deputies see the present leadership as  "trying  to conceal Moscow's policy towards Azerbaijan". First Deputy  Chairman of the Popular Front of Azerbaijan [PFA], Ibrahim  Ibrahimli said that "the present-day leadership's hearings are  politically motivated". The present-day leadership fights with  their political opponents, ex-President Ayaz Mutalibov and the  leaders of the PFA.    According to Ibrahimli, "the military June uprising in Ganja  in 1993, like the Russian troop invasion into Baku on January  19-20, 1990, is the handiwork of one and the same force". The  opposition deputies reminded us that "69 volumes of the inquiry  concerning the January events" are in Moscow and Russia is not  hurrying to give t?em back. According to the opposition, "one  cannot objectively assess the developments of January 20, 1990  without examining those and other missing documents".    No final resolution has been adopted at yesterday's session.  The deputies voted for the creation of a special Commission  into the Investigation of the Events of January 20, 1990.  Parliamentary hearings dealing with this topic will be  continued.</p>

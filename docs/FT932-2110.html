			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Kravchuk retreats in Ukraine power struggle UKRAINIAN President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday back-pedalled in the battle over extra powers for the popular reformist prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma. On Saturday, Mr Kuchma, angered by the president's unilateral move last week to take direct control over the government, lashed out at Mr Kravchuk, accusing him of 'robbing the country'. According to the media, Mr Kuchma also tendered his resignation for the third time this month, but the prime minister's aides said yesterday the reports were inaccurate. The increasingly acrimonious conflict between the president and prime minister has paralysed the country at a time when decisive measures are needed if the economy is to be saved from collapse. Kiev won a brief respite over the week-end, when coal miners in eastern Ukraine called off their 10-day strike. However, the price of this reprieve was a new tranche of subsidies to the coal sector which is expected to trigger another round of inflation. Mr Kuchma, who has earned a reputation in Ukraine and the west as a competent technocrat, is perceived as the only figure able to implement the painful economic reforms Ukraine requires. But Mr Kuchma has said he needs extra-ordinary authority over the economy in order to implement his programme. That has troubled Mr Kravchuk, who fears that if the prime minister succeeds in his bid for additional power then the president will be left an overly circumscribed role. Mr Kravchuk reached for a compromise last week, issuing a decree putting Mr Kuchma in charge of an 'emergency committee' to run the economy, but giving himself direct control over the government. But, as he made clear in a passionate speech in his power base of Dnipropetrovsk on Saturday, Mr Kuchma is unwilling to go along with this new arrangement. 'I understand that the prime minister is no more because the government is headed by the president,' Mr Kuchma said. Mr Kravchuk, whose fear of Mr Kuchma's rising popularity is matched only by his concern that without the prime minister Ukraine's economy will run further adrift, back-pedalled yesterday. 'I am not going to insist on everything remaining unchanged,' Mr Kravchuk said. 'There can be changes (to the controversial decree) if there are constructive proposals.' But Mr Kravchuk also made clear that he is unwilling to relinquish all power to Mr Kuchma. Parliament is likely to act as referee in the increasingly hostile conflict. One option would be for parliament to try to block the presidential decree on constitutional grounds and to grant Mr Kuchma the extra powers he has been seeking for the past month. But although the legislature is generally inclined toward the prime minister, it is divided and might be unable to muster the political will to challenge the president.</p>

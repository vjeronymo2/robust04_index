			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife's gift of money My wife and I have been resident in the UK for close to six years and have been deemed ordinary residents for tax purposes. But, as nationals of two different European countries, we believe we are still considered as domiciled in our countries of origin. My father-in-law, also a foreign national, intends to give her some money. Is she likely to have to pay any tax on it (the gift is foreign currency, to be converted into sterling)? Does it make any difference, in tax terms, if she transfers the whole amount straight to her UK bank account, or deposits it in a foreign account (in the currency of her choice, including sterling) and then transfers money to the UK? If your father-in-law makes the gift in sterling, the answer to your first question is no. The answer to the second question is no, except that the interest on the deposit account would be assessable on the remittance basis if the account were outside the UK. If the gift is made in foreign currency, there could be a capital gains tax liability if there is any favourable movement in the exchange rate between the day of the gift and the conversion into sterling. If the foreign currency were deposited in a bank outside the UK, the exchange-rate gains would be assessable on the remittance basis, but any exchange-rate losses would be disallowed. The gains would be eligible for indexation relief, regardless of where the currency was deposited. As you are both domiciled overseas, you ought to have been making tax returns on the special form (11K) designed for people with overseas domicile. If you have not, remind your tax office to send you this form in future. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

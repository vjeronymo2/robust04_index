			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sweden launches record SKr10bn Pharmacia sale The Swedish government yesterday launched its biggest privatisation, unveiling plans to sell a 32.5 per cent stake in Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 pharmaceuticals groups, for around SKr10bn (Dollars 1.3bn). The take-up by foreign investors, to be promoted through a global offering, is expected to be larger than in previous Swedish privatisation issues. The government originally planned to sell its entire stake in Pharmacia, equivalent to 45.4 per cent of the capital and 57.5 per cent of the votes. It has, instead, decided to retain a 12.9 per cent capital stake and 10.1 per cent of the votes, to promote long-term ownership stability. The move is a response to the uncertainty which Volvo, the Swedish motor group, created last month when it said it would sell its 28 per cent stake in Pharmacia. Volvo has agreed not to sell this holding before 1996. This will be the last Swedish privatisation before the country's September general election, and is in line with the government's ambition to broaden Swedish companies' access to equity capital and widen domestic share ownership. The government has been encouraged by the need to resolve two years of ownership uncertainty at Pharmacia, which was formerly part of Procordia, and by the successful SKr7.6bn sale of a 49 per cent stake in forestry group AssiDoman in March. Analysts noted that pharmaceuticals had been out of fashion because of government clampdowns on healthcare spending. However, they believe the sell-off will have been helped by Roche's Dollars 5.3bn bid for Syntex and SmithKline Beecham's Dollars 2.3bn offer for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services. These have brought new focus to the sector. Up to 82.2m A shares are to be sold. Half of these are being reserved for the retail market, with the balance to be offered to institutions. Analysts expect foreigners to subscribe for as much as 75 per cent of the institutional offer. The price will be fixed on June 17, following an institutional book-building exercise. Institutions are expected to pay near the market price - yesterday SKr126 per share - while individuals have been promised a discount. Pharmacia, which has SKr27bn in annual sales, is one of Sweden's most international companies, with more than half of its 19,000 employees based abroad. Speciality areas include growth hormones, eye surgery and smoking cessation. The company is looking to compensate for low volume growth with vigorous cost-cutting. Goldman Sachs International and S. G. Warburg Securities are the joint global co-ordinators of the offer. Institutional sales in the Nordic region will be lead-managed by Enskilda Corporate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva on 13 May supported the nationwide strikes  against the economic plan of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  who is the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential  candidate and former finance minister. Yesterday in Rio de  Janeiro, Lula installed the Popular Brazil Front. This is a  coalition of parties that support his candidacy (PT, PSB  [Brazilian Socialist Party], PPS [People's Socialist Party], PC  do B [Communist Party of Brazil], PCB [Brazilian Communist  Party], and PST-U [Unified Social Workers Party]).    Lula said: "The demands by Federal Police agents are  justified. The government called in the Army because it is unfit  for dialogue." The PT candidate said that the claim that the  strikes are political "is an old story." He noted that the PT  opposed the economic plan since it was set in motion -- not  since Cardoso became a candidate. Lula said the plan was not  harmed by the strike, it was harmed because Cardoso "escaped  from the responsibility" of managing it to become a candidate.  "He should have raised his baby," he said.    The Popular Brazil Front was set in motion during a lunch at  the Brazil Automobile Club building, in downtown Rio de Janeiro.  The reception was attended by Lula, by PSB Senator Jose Paulo  Bisol, who is Rio Grande do Sul and Lula's running mate, and by  coalition party leaders. The reception was attended by 160  persons who each paid $15. While unionist Ciro Garcia (PST-U)  was defending the strikes, 85-year old Parana representative  Cordolina Fontelles handed Lula a landless people's flag. She  is the mother of Deputy Paulo Fontelles who was murdered in an  agrarian conflict in June 1987.    CUT [Sole Workers Center] President Jair Menguelli said that  of the 5 million plus workers whose collective bargaining date  is in May, less than 200,000 are on strike. "It is a small  number compared to other years. Strikes should continue," he  said.</p>

A few days ago, the bodies of six Haitians -- including  those  of two children -- who arrived in Florida on rickety boats were  cast into the sea; meanwhile, a group of Cubans obtained asylum  easily. [sentence as heard]    Is this a typical aspect of U.S. immigration policy? At the  end of the 1960's, the U.S. Congress passed a law providing for  preferential treatment for Cubans. Despite the intensive  pressuring by Cuban-Americans, more than a few in Washington  question that law.    What is happening and what people are not realizing,  however,  is that many of those who have obtained residency under this  law, claiming that they could not return to Cuba for fear of  Fidel Castro, are now visiting Cuba.    There are many examples of this biased immigration policy. A  few months ago television stations throughout the world were  showing images of Haitians and denouncing their deportation from  the naval base at Guantanamo. Meanwhile, Cubans arriving at that  same place by swimming or crossing minefields are automatically  granted asylum.    In the light of these examples, Cuba seems to be more  dangerous to Washington than is Haiti. Are there reasons a Cuban  deserves U.S. residency more than a Haitian? The United States'  refusal to grant a number of visas to Cuban citizens annually is  what encourages the illegal departures from Cuba. So far, the  U.S. Government has maintained that the policy of repatriating  the Haitians is necessary to prevent many of them from dying on  the high seas.    The other side of the coin is quite different, however. As  you can see, internationally, there are attempts to present  Haiti solely as a land of emigrants who flee in rickety boats.  Less publicized are the struggles for economic power. The  wealthy are apparently linked to the military who destroyed  Haiti's institutions; but the truth is that they see their  future as being in jeopardy.    Many businessmen have gone bankrupt because of the  international sanctions, the black market, and drug trafficking,  which is in the hands of the military chiefs, in collusion with  the CIA and the Pentagon.    The rich, made up mainly of mulattos and whites and with a  mentality similar to that of the Afrikaners in South Africa, are  worried about the resurgence of the Tonton Macoutes, a  paramilitary group made up mostly of blacks. However, the  Haitian elite fears a popular uprising more than anything else,  because such an uprising could ruin everything. For this reason,  the members of this elite reject the return to democracy that  would curtail their privileges, and for this reason they close  their eyes to the murder of fellow citizens or to the  progressive disintegration of Haiti.</p>

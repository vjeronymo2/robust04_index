			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Arts: Mahler - Concert On Thursday night, Yevgeny Svetlanov conducted the Philharmonia in Mahler's Symphony no. 6, and in nothing else. There was no interval. Excellent idea]  -the usual plan, with a very substantial work that doesn't quite fill an evening, is to tack on some hors d'oeuvre, as like as not under-rehearsed. The well-filled Festival Hall proved that Mahler audiences, at least, don't require make-weights. When Svetlanov's concert was first announced, one knew partly what to expect. The symphony would be pretty loud, with the brass accorded special prominence. It would be kept on a tight rhythmic rein, with no indulging in ironic Viennese graces, and though it was sure to be a stern affair, it would be innocent (for better or worse) of anything like Expressionist hysteria. That was indeed how it was, but it was much more besides. The Sixth is the one Mahler work, after his early Klagende Lied, that drives relentlessly through to a black, despairing close. (The Ninth and Das Lied von der Erde have 'tragic' endings too, perhaps, but compromised by visionary hopes.) Though Svetlanov is a Mahler-lover of long standing, he doesn't hear him with Austrian ears - alert for sentimental parody, twisted echoes from the past, snuggly nuances. He took the symphony very straight, holding firmly to well-judged tempi. If he left some intimate corners unexplored (the Andante Moderato was a smooth, public affair, like unemphatic Tchaikovsky), his instinct for overall proportions was unerring. Many 'subtler' readings of the Sixth come apart at the main seams, especially in the long, fiercely taxing Finale; the continuous thrust of Svetlanov's Finale was seamless, and the outcome thoroughly satisfying. Without theatrical tragedy-airs: but the Sixth is after all Mahler's most cannily and compactly-built symphony, not an opera. The Philharmonia brass - including seven trumpets, one more than Mahler requested - were indeed prominent, but largely because they were magnificent. Trumpets brilliant (triumphantly led by John Wallace), horns secure and forthright, a brazen fist of trombones and a notably musical tuba (John Jenkins): an aural feast, complemented by string-playing of fine, impersonal energy. I regretted only the cow-bells, rendered here in an even, quasi-electronic tremolo. Surely Mahler wanted irregular clanking, frankly picturesque, distant sounds from untroubled life in the foothills, far below. Sponsored by Automotive &amp; Financial Group</p>

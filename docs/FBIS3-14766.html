On 14 January  this year in Moscow, the presidents of Ukraine, the United  States, and Russia issued a statement that the problem of  nuclear weapons located in Ukraine is for the whole world to  solve. But on 3 February, Ukraine's Supreme Council adopted a  resolution to accede to the Lisbon Protocol. The press  secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, Ivars (?Embrekts),  pointed out:    [Begin Embrekts recording] The Foreign Ministry of the  Republic of Latvia believes that such action by the president  and Supreme Council of Ukraine demonstrates to the world  community Ukraine's goodwill and serious intention to promote  the disarmament process, and that it is a significant investment  in ensuring peace and world security. We hold in high esteem  Ukraine's stance in the sphere of nuclear disarmament, and (?in  wishing to regard) Ukraine as a (?powerful) and friendly  country, Latvia supports the view of the Ukrainian president,  that in our modern world a country's security is dependent not  only, and not even so much, on its military potential, as on the  successful development of its economy. Latvia (?believes in)  Ukraine's state consolidation and economic prosperity. The  Foreign Ministry has the conviction that the position of the  Ukrainian president and Supreme Council on the issue of nuclear  disarmament will not only strengthen peace and international  security, but will also assist Ukraine to overcome its economic  and internal policy difficulties.

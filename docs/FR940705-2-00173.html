			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(2). In order to ensure the competence necessary to review and approve recombinant DNA activities, it is recommended that the Institutional Biosafety Committee: (i) include persons with expertise in recombinant DNA technology, biological safety, and physical containment; (ii) include or have available as consultants persons knowledgeable in institutional commitments and policies, applicable law, standards of professional conduct and practice, community attitudes, and the environment, and (iii) include at least one member representing the laboratory technical staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(3). The institution shall file a report with NIH/ORDA which includes the names and biographical sketches of all Institutional Biosafety Committee members, including community members, in such form and at such times as required by NIH/ORDA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(4). No member of an Institutional Biosafety Committee may be involved (except to provide information requested by the Institutional Biosafety Committee) in the review or approval of a project in which he/she has been or expects to be engaged or has a direct financial interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(5). The institution, that is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness of the Institutional Biosafety Committee, may establish procedures that the Institutional Biosafety Committee shall follow in its initial and continuing review and approval of applications, proposals, and activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(6). When possible and consistent with protection of privacy and proprietary interests, the institution is encouraged to open its Institutional Biosafety Committee meetings to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-a-(7). Upon request, the institution shall make available to the public all Institutional Biosafety Committee meeting minutes and any documents submitted to or received from funding agencies which the latter are required to make available to the public. If public comments are made on Institutional Biosafety Committee actions, the institution shall forward both the public comments and the Institutional Biosafety Committee's response to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b. Functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On behalf of the institution, the Institutional Biosafety Committee is responsible for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(1). Reviewing recombinant DNA research conducted at or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsored by the institution for compliance with the NIH Guidelines as specified in Section III and approving those research projects that are found to conform with the NIH Guidelines. This review shall include: (i) independent assessment of the containment levels required by the NIH Guidelines for the proposed research, and (ii) assessment of the facilities, procedures, practices, and training and expertise of personnel involved in recombinant DNA research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section IV-B&hyph;2-b-(2).

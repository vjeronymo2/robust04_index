			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Fast action by clearing banks could save many ailing companies Sir, It comes as little surprise to read in the letter from Messrs Smith and Barnes (April 2) that the company in their study failed, despite the presence of a number of professional advisers. Our recent experience of working with small companies in financial difficulty is that management is wholly preoccupied with survival and has neither the time to consult its advisers nor the inclination to worsen its creditor position by so doing. Few small companies can afford full-time professional management, yet such skills are essential to their survival. It is improbable that a company's auditors or its solicitors, let alone its bankers, should be able to provide the level of hands-on management resource that is called for when it is ailing. One solution available to shareholders and directors seeking to buy time from creditors is to appoint a part-time director with the appropriate experience in managing corporate restructuring and refinancing. The appearance of a seasoned professional at the helm of a troubled ship has been known to calm the nerves of lenders and creditors alike. The number of failures in the small company sector could be reduced if the clearing banks reacted sooner to their clients' difficulties: it is too often the case that by the time the bank calls in investigating accountants, the company is beyond rescue and the accountants' fee is the final nail in the corporate coffin. The banks' early warning systems should be able to detect the first signs of decline in the quality of their security and it is then that they should take action, bearing in mind the potentially fatal time-lag which occurs between the processing of management information and the actual state of the company's solvency. Lacking the resources internally to help smaller companies, the banks should be in a position to draw on a pool of experienced company doctors whom they can 'recommend' to their clients. Early diagnosis and treatment of an ailing company by a part-time external director introduced by the banks or shareholders has a better chance of effecting a long-term cure than occasional advice and surveillance by auditors and accountants.

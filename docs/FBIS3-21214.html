The research group  produced the high-speed collision of a bullet with the carbon  molecules to create an ultra-high pressure and ultra-high  temperature state. Although the research project is only at its  initial stage, the synthesized material is sufficiently pure to  be used for electronic materials. Thus, the method appears to be  promising as a new synthesis method for artificial diamonds.    For the synthesis, the group fired an approximately  2-cm-diameter, 2-cm-long bullet toward a tungsten vessel  containing C60 micropowder. The collision impact momentarily  created a state of ultra-high pressure and ultra-high  temperature, and diamonds were synthesized.    Moreover, the group tried to rapidly cool the system after  the synthesis to prevent deformation due to residual heat. Thus,  highly heat-releasing gold was used to sandwich C60 inside the  reaction vessel in order to be able to cool the product at a  rate of 10 billion degrees per second.    In the experiment, the group sandwiched 0.01 g of C60  particles with diameters ranging from 20 to 30  (1  is  1/1,000-th mm) between two 0.2mm-thick gold sheets, and this was  placed in the vessel. A metal-tipped polyethylene bullet was  made to strike that vessel, and a state of 500,000 atm and  2,000C was created. In a time span of 0.3 sec, C60 was  converted into a 10--thick film. Under an optical  microscope,  the film was found to consist of approximately 90 percent  colorless, transparent material and 10 percent intact, black C60.    The size of the colorless, transparent material was 0.1mm at  maximum. When studied with X-ray, carbon atoms were connected by  the diamond bonding, although the overall structure consisted of  amorphous diamonds with a distorted, special structure. The  transparent material was harder than sapphire. Assistant  Professor Kondo conjectures: ``It is likely that C60 was  compressed under the ultra-high pressure to become diamonds.''    Previously, amorphous diamonds had an amorphous structure  because of hydrogen contained in the crystalline structure. The  newly synthesized material did not contain any hydrogen, but had  carbon atoms arranged densely and uniformly. Thus, it is said to  be sufficiently pure to be used for electronic and optical  materials.</p>

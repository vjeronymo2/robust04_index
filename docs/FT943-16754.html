			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Lacklustre Dow lifted by late buying flurry Wall Street Blue chip stocks benefited yesterday from a late flurry of buying just before the market closed for long Independence Day weekend, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.69 better at 3,646.65, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.93 at 446.20. Volume on the Big Board was light, as many investors decided to begin the holiday a day early. Only 198m shares were traded. The secondary markets showed little change, with the American SE inching 0.64 ahead to 424.72, and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.89 to 706.85. In the previous session, the Dow industrials slid 42 points as the bond market reacted badly to signs of mounting inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector. Yesterday there was more of the same kind of economic news. The National Association of Purchasing Management said that its June index of business activity slipped, while more of its members paid higher prices during the month. The results mirrored those contained in a regional survey released Thursday, but investors in neither stocks nor bonds were in the mood for another sell-off. The dollar offered some support, gaining ground on the yen, but its recent erosion remained a peripheral issue for US equity investors. Many of them were reluctant to make a move until it becomes clear next week whether the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates next week in support of the greenback. At the opening, bargain hunters helped lift the blue chips by nearly 26 points, but the early gains dissolved by midday. Stocks caught a second wind during the afternoon, and finished strongly. Among the cyclicals, Alcoa was Dollars 2 3/8 higher at Dollars 75 1/2 and International Paper climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 3/4 . On the negative side, IBM dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57. Profit-taking pushed CBS down Dollars 3 to Dollars 307. A day earlier, the stock surged on news that the media group was close to an agreement to merge with QVC, the home-shopping network. QVC receded Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37 1/4 yesterday. Fresh acquisition news fanned interest in Circus Circus, a casino operator. The stock jumped 20.3 per cent, or Dollars 4 3/8 , to Dollars 25 7/8 on a report that Bally Entertainment was seeking federal approval to take a big stake in its gaming rival. Bally added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 . Venezuela Caracas picked up 3.7 per cent in a technical adjustment following sharp falls in recent days. The Merinvest composite index closed 4.7 higher at 133.23, with the benchmark Electricidad de Caracas up 14 bolivars at 333 bolivars. Corimon, the industrial holding was an exception among the generally firm blue chips, losing 7.50 bolivars to 55.50 bolivars as a result of a six-for-one dividend share issue.</p>

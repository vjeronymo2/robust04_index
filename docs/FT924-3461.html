			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Ethics arrives on enterprise agenda Ethics has long been regarded as a concern of large companies, but increasingly it needs to be taken seriously by the smaller firm, according to several conference papers. They may have to deal with a competitor who is unfairly disparaging their products to gain business, with an employee who has been diagnosed as being HIV positive but did not disclose this to the company, or with a customer copying designs without permission. Unlike a large company, the small firm may not have a policy thought out to deal with these questions or experienced, specialist staff. Instead of starting from scratch, small businesses should be able to call on the expertise of large companies, argued Derek Archer of consultants Archer &amp; Archer. He suggested the creation of a register of ethical management practice which would allow small businesses to consult a large company which had experience of the same problem. Far from being remote from the concerns of small businesses, ethical questions have a direct impact, according to Ian Smedley of the Institute of Directors. Individual moral responsibility can be clearly seen in the small firm and the entrepreneur's personal moral decisions will be fundamental to the attitude and activities of the business. Ethical conduct can be enforced by the operation of self-interest which ensures that businesses co-operate with each other by behaving honestly. Companies which develop bad reputations tend not to flourish while successful reputations and brands are valuable assets. Business needs rules not because it is inherently a less ethical activity but because it is competitive, Smedley argued. It may, however, need to set limits to the application of ethical goals. If businesses accept ethical constraints on their activities and acknowledge special responsibilities to stakeholders or the community this may have a negative effect on performance. They may well end up harming the general good rather than advancing it.</p>

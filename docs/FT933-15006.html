			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Rehabilitation of a wartime voice / Review of the reputation of the poet John Heath-Stubbs 'THE HUNGRY generations tread each other down,' writes the English poet John Heath-Stubbs in Hindsights, an autobiography published this week to mark his 75th birthday. And of no generation has this been truer than his own, the 1940s, which was attacked with such vehemence by the poets of the 1950s - Robert Conquest, Philip Larkin, Kingsley Amis and others - that only in recent years has it been possible, thanks to the publication of the collected poems of Norman Cameron, George Barker, Heath-Stubbs himself and others, to judge how much truth there was in these allegations. So what exactly was wrong with the poets of the 1940s? Irresponsibility, for a start. Coming after the politically committed generation of the 1930s, the 1940s poets seems set apart from the world in which they lived, in both subject matter and language. Poet Denise Levertov has called the work of that decade 'invertebrate'. Apocalyptic, diffusely passionate, intensely metaphorical, it seemed to lack any backbone of reasoned discourse. In their flight from the horrors of war, these neo-romantics plunged headlong into the abyss of themselves and often (like David Gascoyne) crawled out godly. Two movements in the 1930s contributed to the excesses of the 1940s: surrealism and Freudianism. Freudianism gave poets a justification for regarding poetry as the outpourings of the Id; surrealism taught them that the suprarational truths revealed in dreams had a power to heal the divisive wounds of capitalism. Such a potent cocktail was bound to produce muddled-headedness. All this syballine frenzy struck the poets of the 1950s as repugnant and inappropriate to the drab realities of post-war Britain. According to Robert Conquest, editor of New Lines, one of that decade's most influential anthologies, the poets of the new decade would be much more down-to-earth: rational structures, comprehensible language, and a refusal to submit to 'great systems of theoretical constructs or agglomerations of unconscious commands' would be the order of the day. Heath-Stubbs, at Oxford in the war years and published for the first time early in that decade, got smeared along with the rest, and his reputation suffered. He has fought to get rid of the taint of neo-romanticism, and to prove himself more than merely 'an ageing survivor of an abused/Unfashionable decade'. A Hampshire man, he grew up near the New Forest, and from his earliest years suffered from congenital glaucoma (one eye was removed in the 1950s, the second in the 1970s). After miserable years at Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight he went on to Worcester College for the Blind, and from there to a scholarship at Queen's, Oxford. In the poetry, his poor eyesight has been more than compensated for by an extraordinary visual and auditory imagination. He has an acute ear for the bewildering variety of birdsong to be heard even in inner London, where he has lived for the past 40 years. As a schoolboy in the 1930s, he was a passionate autodidact, devouring each new volume of the Thinker's Library as it appeared. Greatly interested in botany and natural history (see, for example, 'Botanical Happy Families' in his new collection of poems, Sweet-Apple Earth, Carcanet, Pounds 7.95), he possesses the intellect of a magpie. His best poetry is Augustan in temper, far removed from the mannered, baroque language of George Barker or Dylan Thomas. He possesses a strong sense of tradition. Those early years in Hampshire gave him a familiarity with the myths surrounding the death of William Rufus at the hands of his man-servant Tyrrel in the New Forest. Did Tyrrel kill the king by accident or design? Or was it a ritual murder involving a witch-cult? The poem 'Purkis' probes that mystery, and also sets it in the context of a popular children's rhyme - English history layered upon English history. Heath-Stubbs, a great, gangling man, shock of white hair falling forward over his face, cane gripped fiercely in both hands, reads this poem with a powerful sense of the music of the verse, a quality which those poets of the 1950s and their impassioned successors began to help us to forget, such was their concern to represent life as it really is.

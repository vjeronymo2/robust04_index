			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRES FORCE 125 TO EVACUATE HOMES  </P> <P> Two fires that broke out Friday within two blocks of each other in San Ysidro,  both producing heavy smoke, forced the evacuation of about 125 people from a  nearby mobile home park, San Diego fire officials said.  </P> <P> No injuries were reported from the fires, along Calle Primera in San Ysidro,  officials said.  </P> <P> It was unclear late Friday whether the 125 people, who were forced to leave the  Rancho del Rio park, would be allowed to return home for the night. Red Cross  officials said they were prepared to offer overnight shelter.  </P> <P> The first fire began about 12:30 p.m. behind La Bodega Wholesale Market in the  300 block of Calle Primera, officials said.  </P> <P> The blaze was originally reported as a grass fire. Firefighters discovered 18  55-gallon drums burning in a storm drain, officials said. Hazardous-materials  specialists could not determine what was in the drums, which sent up clouds of  black smoke, officials said.  </P> <P> It also was not immediately known where the drums came from, officials said.  </P> <P> As fire crews put out the first fire about 6:30 p.m., after it had burned about  6 acres, the second one broke out in the 200 block of Calle Primera, officials  said.  </P> <P> Crews discovered when they sprayed another storm drain with water that an  unknown chemical was burning, because the water produced popping sounds and  smoke, officials said.  </P> <P> The trailer park was evacuated shortly afterward, officials said. Authorities  reported late Friday that the second fire was still burning, but they expected  to have it put out by today.  </P></p>

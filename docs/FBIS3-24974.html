			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It's today since the Burundi opposition postponed  the two-day general strike call until next Monday [7 February].  [sentence as heard] The idea was to allow people in Bujumbura to  get some shopping and for workers to collect their pay packets.  The strike call was a protest against the appointment of a new  president to replace Melchior Ndadaye, who was killed in an Army  uprising last October, and the final trigger was the sacking by  the largely Hutu government of the Constitutional Court at the  weekend. It was dominated by Tutsi judges. Since then, there's  been a wave of ethnic killings in Bujumbura. The death toll has  been put at around 60, and that kept a lot of people off the  streets yesterday. And last night, more violence left a further  10 dead. On the line to Bujumbura, Josephine Hazely asked our  correspondent, Bonaventure Ndiguimana, what the situation was  today:    [Begin recording] [Ndiguimana] I think the situation is very  tense and dangerously evolving. Since yesterday night, there  were so many grenade blasts, and gunfire was heard all night  long. If we consider the number of casualties, 10 in one night,  10 wounded--including three gendarmes--and if we add those to  the 46 announced yesterday by the gendarmerie, we can say that  the situation is seriously jeopardized.    [Hazely] So, have you been down to the town center today at  all?    [Ndiguimana] Yes, I have been downtown. The traffic was at  minimum. Many businesses were closed down. Public offices were  closed down, but private cars could circulate freely, since the  road blockades were removed. But I can say that public  transport was very much disrupted.    [Hazely] Now, I understand the opposition met with the Army  yesterday. Is there any word on what went on between the two  groups?    [Ndiguimana] No, nothing released out of the meeting. No  official statement was released. Some rumors had said that they  were plotting a coup d'etat, but this has been denied by the  chief of staff in charge of gendarmeries. Some news had said  that the Army and the opposition were organizing the coup. It  is not true.    [Hazely] I understand that the human rights league has made  a statement about the situation in Burundi, especially in the  capital, Bujumbura. What is the main source of the message?    [Ndiguimana] The two human rights leagues, ITECA and SONERA  [expansions not given], have issued statements, calling  politicians to be aware of the situation of their people who are  in the countryside and those who are dying in the capital city.  So, they have condemned acts of violence, and they have called  the government to restore the judges of the Constitutional Court  in their duties. The UN special envoy in Bujumbura, Mr.  Abdallah, also issued a strong message to the political class,  saying that they should look into the direction of restoring  peace and order because war is not solution in this country.

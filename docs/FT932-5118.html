			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Letter: Guided busway proposal ignores the realities Sir, Re Mr Bale's proposal to convert the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend line to a guided busway after privatisation ('Buses may run on rail tracks after privatisation', June 1), he may, as a resident of Jersey, perhaps be forgiven for not being aware of the daily realities of life on this line. Between 16:30 and 18:30, 32 trains consisting of either eight or 12 coaches are scheduled to leave Fenchurch Street. Assuming an average occupancy of 500 passengers per train, this equates to 16,000 passengers carried during this period. Even with 70 passengers per bus some 230 vehicles would be required to carry the same number of passengers. A similar number of buses would also be required in the morning rush hour. Another problem which Mr Bale's initial enthusiasm does not appear to address is how he proposes to deal with the 2 1/2 mile viaduct out of Fenchurch Street, much of which is not wide enough to permit conversion to a busway. Does he envisage the buses pouring off the busway on to the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road at Bromley by Bow to fight their way from there into the City? How does he propose conveying his passengers while large sections of the line are closed for conversion? With regard to the proposal to convert the Chiltern Line from Marylebone to Aylesbury, Mr Bale could do worse than to consult the report on this project prepared at the behest of the late Greater London Council. It recommended against the proposal owing to the astronomical cost of acquiring property required for the conversion at the London end of the line. Finally, if Mr Bale would like advice on guided busways nearer to home than either Adelaide or Essen, he could consult the West Midlands passenger transport executive. It abandoned its experiment after less than one year's operation. A N Peachey, 4 The Sycamores, Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire CM23 5JR</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt regrets that  [Minister of Environment and Resources] Olof Johansson has  decided to resign. Carl Bildt answered the question at a news  conference a little while ago as to whether Olof Johansson could  be included in a new right-wing government. Bildt said:    [Begin recording] [Bildt] You have to ask him that. The  political prerequisites in general he should account for; but  what he has already shown us is that they are not influenced.  He is part of this government [laughs], has been part of this  government, the Center Party is still part of this government,  and all the political decisions, all the political principles,  and the political engagements that the government stands for.  But the question should by right be put to Olof and not me.    [Correspondent] Do you think that the Center Party could be  part of a new right-wing government?    [Bildt] The Center Party is in a right-wing government, has  been in a right-wing government, and is still in a right-wing  government. This resignation is a very strong political  statement from the Center Party in an individual matter. It is  stronger than what I thought was necessary, but it is clear that  it does not change anything in the sense that it was not a  surprise. It was not something politically new today in the  sense that the Center Party would have revealed a new political  attitude.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister Bildt was firm that the  bridge  question did not need anymore preparations, as Olof Johansson  has demanded.    [Bildt] If I had thought, or the other party leaders, that  one or two, or maybe three, or whatever number of extra weeks  had brought a solution to this question it is clear that we  would have in that case used this extra time. We have used a  very long time on this so we could have used a little bit more  time, but no one who has heard Olof Johansson express himself in  the fundamental bridge question can actually believe that this  would have been the case.

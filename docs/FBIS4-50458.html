			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- By the end of 1995,  foreign funds going to China's posts and telecommunications  construction will total five billion U.S. dollars, according to  an official from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications  (MPT).    The official said that China's input in posts and  telecommunications construction for the Eighth Five-Year Plan  (1991- 1995) will reach 160 billion yuan, while in the newly  drafted Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the total budget is a  huge 360 billion yuan.    To provide sufficient posts and telecommunications capacity  for the fast development of the economy, China has been  increasing investment in the construction of posts and  telecommunications infrastructures year by year. In 1993 an  investment of 40.4 billion yuan was finished, while this year's  budget hit 53.6 billion yuan.    The official said that in addition to a small amount of  money  from the central government, a major part of the funds will come  from investment by local governments, domestic loans and  overseas investors.    The official said that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan  (1986- 1990) the MPT used 1.1 billion U.S. dollars of overseas  funds, and thereafter, foreign funds going to this sector have  been increasing by a big margin each year.    Foreign funds have been used mainly for buying advanced  technologies and equipment, such as optical fiber cables,  switchboards, mobile telecommunications equipment and mobile  telephone production lines.    At present the MPT and the Ministry of Electronics Industry  are joining hands to tackle some high-tech projects in the field  of telecommunications, and are actively preparing for  construction of China's telecommunications superhighway.    In addition, the MPT also plans to buy 15 planes in the  coming few years to open special postal air routes.    All these projects need support from foreign funds and  technologies, the official said.    In fact, the world's large telecommunications enterprises,  such as Motorola, Siemens and NEC, have already taken a share in  China's huge investment market for posts and telecommunications  construction.    Meanwhile, many other foreign companies would not spare a  single chance to enter the Chinese market. Every time China  publishes a new telecommunications project, a dozen foreign  companies come at once to compete for contracts.    Wu Jichuan, minister of MPT, made a speech to a national  posts and telecommunications conference this week, stressing  again to expand international cooperation and promote the use of  foreign funds.    Wu said that in addition to overseas loans and other  traditional patterns for using funds, the MPT will, with  ratification from the central government, choose some qualified  industrial enterprises to issue shares on the Hong Kong Stock  Exchange; the MPT will also buy equipment from Hong Kong with  foreign currencies borrowed right there.    At the same time the minister reiterated that foreign  businessmen are not allowed to manage or participate in the  managing of public telecommunications networks and special  telecommunications networks within Chinese territories.</p>

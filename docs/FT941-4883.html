			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Big losses forecast by Japanese steel groups Japan's five big steelmakers yesterday announced they expect to incur losses for the year ending this month and with the exception of Nippon Steel, will be passing their dividend. The severity of Japan's prolonged economic downturn coupled with the impact of a high yen will result in a combined pre-tax loss for the industry of Y114bn (Pounds 726m), even after sales of a substantial amount of securities, the steel companies said. Sumitomo Metal Industries, the third-largest integrated steelmaker, is forecasting the largest loss among the five of Y34bn despite sales of stocks amounting to Y16bn. It made a profit of Y5.3bn last year. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is planning to sell a total of about Y66bn of securities holdings but nevertheless expects a loss of Y19bn, compared with profits of Y28.9bn in 1992-93. For Japan's steel industry, this year's results will be some of the worst figures since the economy suffered the severe impact of the yen's rapid rise in 1986. 'The trading environment has become extremely difficult,' said Mr Shigeru Omori, executive vice president of Nippon Steel. The steelmakers are accelerating restructuring plans, with many announcing increased cuts in employees, reduced capital expenditure and stringent reviews of operations. However, personnel reductions will generally be achieved through natural wastage and transfers to subsidiaries. Some diversification plans, which were begun as an attempt to reduce dependence on steel products, are being scaled back or terminated altogether. Sumitomo Metal, which is shedding 4,300 jobs over the next two years, plans to reduce general capital spending by half to Y120bn although it will go ahead with plans to invest Y90bn at its Wakayama plant. Sumitomo also plans to reduce costs by 15 per cent, or Y150bn by 1995. However, the decision to pass the dividend reflects general gloom about the outlook for next year. The domestic situation is unlikely to recover much and some steel groups expect a further deterioration in results. Background, Page 4</p>

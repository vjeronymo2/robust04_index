			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Ukraine's economy not on poll agenda: But links with Russia are Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk appears to be defying the rule that incumbents stand little chance of re-election in a recession. Despite the record of his 30-month tenure - which has included a 40 per cent drop in gross domestic product over the first four months of this year alone - Mr Kravchuk is gaining in the opinion polls against his main challenger on Sunday, the former prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma. Indeed, repairing the economy, the main challenge facing Ukraine's next president - is barely on the campaign agenda. Instead, campaigning has focused on the shape of a proposed new constitution, the status of the Russian language in a country with an 11m-strong ethnic Russian minority and the extent of alignment with Russia itself. Though Ukraine's leaders succeeded in creating an independent state from the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they have failed to make it economically sustainable, leaving its statehood fragile and beholden to Russia. Ukraine is kept afloat by a large Russian subsidy (Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn annually in unpaid oil and gas debts) while Kiev props up its energy-wasteful heavy industries and subsidises its state farms with money it does not have. While the west has woken up belatedly to the fact that Ukraine's stability is important for Europe, Ukraine has yet to face up to the fundamental economic choice of whether to remain dependent on Russia or restructure its energy-intensive industries and diversify its markets. Asked why no one is talking about economics, Mr Mykola Mikhailchenko, the president's chief domestic adviser, says: 'The majority of Ukrainians are satisfied with the current path of reform.' In fact economic dissatisfaction is widespread, but Ukraine's main power brokers - the collective farm bosses, industrial directors and Soviet-era bureaucrats - have so far had more success maintaining their positions than reforming the economy. The slow pace of privatisation - only 150 enterprises in the first wave of the sell-off programme - has also meant the lack of a class of independent owners with an interest in reform. Many private entrepreneurs have gone underground to form a black economy which probably equals the official economy because it is the only way to survive in Kiev's thicket of restrictions and high taxes. The only presidential candidate running on an economic reform platform, Mr Volodymyr Lanoviy, is trailing with less than 10 per cent support in the opinion polls. Even Ukraine's nationalist west has abandoned him, unconvinced this 'Ukrainian Gaidar' could beat their main foe, Mr Kuchma. The two main contenders offer populist promises. Mr Kuchma, a Soviet-era missile plant manager who resigned as prime minister last September after a power struggle with the president, says he will resurrect Ukraine's economy by 're-establishing ties with Russia'. But he does not say whether he means economic union, whereby part of Ukraine's sovereignty would be sacrificed to Russia, or freer trade, which would require Ukraine to lift subsidies and price controls as Russia itself has done. The largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians, particularly communists and factory bosses, seek a return to pre-independence relations where orders from Russian plants flowed in. They are strongly criticised by Mr Mikhailchenko for not understanding 'that Russia is just not the same it was two years ago - you can't just recreate the old connections now'. President Kravchuk offers an even vaguer platform of simply 'developing Ukraine's socially-oriented economy', but observers do not regard his record as encouraging. Only last week he called for the indexation of savings, a move which would cost Ukraine about Dollars 22bn, and parliament approved a new wave of pre-election credits costing the state the equivalent of another Dollars 444m. Last winter the government tightened monetary policy and managed to reduce inflation from 90 per cent monthly last December to only 5.2 per cent last month. But the political fallout from the credit squeeze was too much to bear and Kiev loosened the monetary screws in early spring. In April alone the money supply grew 60 per cent. With the desire to bail out ailing state enterprises winning out over the battle against inflation, most observers believe that the next president is likely to inherit a resurgence of inflation by the end of the summer and a host of other problems which the campaign has not addressed.</p>

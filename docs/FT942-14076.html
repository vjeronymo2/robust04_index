			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium output falls as cuts bite Clear evidence that the international agreement which aims to cut global annual aluminium output by about 10 per cent is taking hold emerged as delegates from some of the world's major producer countries prepared for their meeting in Brussels today. Aluminium output in the western world dropped by 632 tonnes a day, equivalent to 231,000 tonnes a year, between the end of February and March 31, according to the International Primary Aluminium Institute, whose statistics cover more than 90 per cent of western production. This is the second-largest monthly fall since IPAI records began, said Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett. 'This is good, fundamental news for the aluminium market, ' he said. 'It shows that the efforts the industry is making (to cut annual global output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes) is having an impact. And that impact should be even more pronounced next month.' Western producers have so far announced annual cuts totalling more than 900,000 tonnes. Elkem of Norway joined the list yesterday when it said it would reduce annual output by 10,000 tonnes - not quite 5 per cent of its 200,000-tonnes production - from September and hold that level until the end of 1995. Trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, Russia and the US meet in Brussels today to compare notes on the progress made since they reached an understanding about the cuts in January.</p>

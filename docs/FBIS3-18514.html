			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] London, 2 Mar--Douglas Hogg, British minister of  state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, said that the  liberation of Kuwait was an unprecedented achievement and a  turning point in world order.    In an interview with KUNA on the third anniversary of  liberation, Hogg said that the international alliance against  the ruler of Baghdad ensured respect for Kuwait's sovereignty.    He affirmed in an interview at the Foreign Office in central  London that the Desert Storm operation to liberate Kuwait  "should send a warning to the Iraqi aggressors that they would  inevitably be defeated." [passage omitted]    He pointed out that the ruler of Baghdad must put an end to  the operations to "liquidate his people."    In reply to a question, Hogg said he was not aware of the  current cooperation between French companies and Iraq and  referred to the existence of "a significant difference between  current and future plans for cooperation." However, Hogg  stressed that the British Government had approached the French  Government regarding a number of issues concerning the Iraqis.  He said: The French are well aware of our views. Hogg  expressed his conviction that on the whole: We and the French  adopt the same stance vis-a-vis our policy regarding the Iraqi  regime.    Hogg stressed that there would not be any changes in their  policy regarding the ruler of Baghdad unless he complied with  the UN resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait.  Meanwhile, he said that he did not think it was unlikely that  the head of the Iraqi regime would attempt to exploit the  current preoccupation in the West with the issue of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to embark on a new adventure. In reply to a  KUNA question on this, Hogg said: That is possible, but he  would be making a terrible mistake.    Hogg said that Britain was concerned about the situation in  northern Iraq and stressed that the no-fly zone had to be  respected and its monitoring had to be strengthened. He said:  We continue to do this. [passage omitted]    Hogg hinted that he wanted to visit other countries that he  had not visited in the region, such as Oman, and pointed out  that it could take place at the end of next May. No specific  date had been decided.    Concerning the Hebron massacre, Hogg admitted that Britain  realized the usefulness of an international presence of some  kind in the occupied territories. Hogg said that he discussed  the idea with a group of Arab ambassadors accredited to Britain,  who came yesterday to condemn and denounce the massacre.  [passage omitted]    He expressed his conviction that the circumstances could  encourage the Israelis to accept this formula. Hogg told KUNA  that an international military presence in the occupied  territories should not be in the form of forces but in the form  of international observers. He once more emphasized the British  Government's feeling of fear and shock for the occurrence of  that massacre. [passage omitted]</p>

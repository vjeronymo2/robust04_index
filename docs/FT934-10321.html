			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investment draws US converts - Bessemer Trust finds attraction in emerging markets John Trott invests big bucks in international equities for the rich and famous, most of them American. He has nothing in Japan and nothing in German manufacturing industry; but he exemplifies the US conversion to foreign portfolio investment, and to emerging markets in particular. Mr Trott manages, from London, the Dollars 1bn international component of the US-based Bessemer Trust, which has Dollars 8.5bn under direct management and numbers Mr George Bush, the former US president, among its clients. Mr Trott says that expectations in Japan and Germany for the next five years are just too high. Bessemer was founded in 1906 by Mr Henry Phipps, one of Andrew Carnegie's partners in the development of the US steel industry, to manage Phipps family money. The name marks the process of converting molten pig iron into steel which the Carnegie interests licensed from Sir Henry Bessemer, the British metallurgist, who invented the process. The group recommends to its clients that 40 per cent of their equity investment funds go into international markets. The international fund itself has about 40 per cent of its money in emerging markets, although these account for not much more than 5 per cent of EAFA (Morgan Stanley Capital International's Europe, Australian and Far East index, a standard measure for US investors active overseas). John Trott came to Bessemer at the beginning of 1992, extending a trend which began in 1975 when Mr John Whitmore, now chairman of Bessemer, joined. One reason for Mr Whitmore's recruitment was to widen the trust's client base; outside investors' money is now important in the overall scheme of things. Mr Trott came in from Kleinwort Benson, which formerly managed the international fund, to increase further the international presence of the group. When he joined, Bessemer had Dollars 500m in non-US securities; he has lifted that to just over Dollars 1bn in less than two years. Emerging markets, says Mr Trott, are at much the same stage now as Japan was in the 1960s, when it put up its best equity performance: what it had included a growing economy, the work ethic, a strong currency, relatively undervalued equities and a government which provided the framework for economic growth. Bessemer will not put more than 10 per cent of the international fund into any one emerging market. It does, however, have 10 per cent in Hong Kong, which is not classified traditionally as an emerging market, although Mr Trott thinks that the colony recently has behaved like one, and that it will do so in future. He is keen on Hong Kong, from which, he says, the wealth of China will initially flow to the outside world. China's nascent mainland markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen will develop, he says, but at this stage they are relatively illiquid. He does not think Hong Kong is as potentially volatile as Mr Peter Everington, managing director of Regent Fund Management, indicated recently. In effect, Mr Everington said the Hang Seng index, which peaked at 9,642.91 this week, up by more than 25 per cent since the end of September, could hit 12,000 soon on the tremendous inflow of US funds into the colony, or fall to 5,000 in relatively short order on a more bearish assessment which includes the future of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar peg. Bessemer is bearish on Japan. Mr Trott estimates that the Tokyo market is on a p/e ratio of around 85, and says its supporters tell their friends to look at prospective earnings: if these get back to the peak returns of the late 1980s, they say, the p/e would cut to a third of its present level. That, says Mr Trott, would still be 28; and in any case, he argues, there is no way that the Japanese corporate sector will get back to those exceptional rates of return, which came from an undervalued yen, economic growth and a cost of capital which virtually came down to nil. In addition, he does not like the apparent public funds support for the market. Bessemer has been out of Japan for the past six months. This may look silly, given that the FT-Actuaries indices, in dollar terms, show Japan with a gain of 40 per cent on the year to date, 19 percentage points of that advance coming from the appreciation of the yen against the dollar. But, says Mr Trott, in the 12 months to September 30 last, Bessemer's international fund shows a gain of 29 per cent against the EAFA benchmark figure of 26 per cent. Within the EAFA figure, he notes, the Japan weighting was 50 per cent. While Bessemer looks after international equities from its London office, 95 per cent of its clients invest US dollars, and have US dollar liabilities. 'We have to look after that,' says Mr Trott. 'If we believe the dollar is undervalued, we will have to hedge our foreign currency investments back into dollars - although we will take the currency risk if it looks good.'</p>

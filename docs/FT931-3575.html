			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UN general hopeful of Bosnia aid breakthrough GENERAL Philippe Morillon, the French commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, said yesterday he was hopeful a convoy would bring aid to the besieged Moslem town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia today and evacuate women and children. The flamboyant general, who has set up a command post in Srebrenica in a gesture of solidarity with its thousands of suffering people, made his announcement after talks with General Ratko Mladic, the Serb commander, near Bratunac, a Serb-held town some 15km away. A UN spokesman in Sarajevo said it was planned to send in a medical team to evacuate 35 to 40 seriously wounded women and children along with a convoy carrying food and medicine. 'We are 99 per cent certain this convoy will get in,' the spokesman said. Gen Morillon told French radio: 'I hope that tomorrow morning we'll have a road convoy coming here that will in turn evacuate women and children.' Srebrenica has been under siege for 11 months and its population of about 60,000 has not received any aid by road since December, although some supplies have been dropped into the area in recent days by US aircraft. In another interview, the general told French television that he may leave Srebrenica today. The general has promised to stay in the town until relief supplies were allowed through. At the same time, the UN commander said he had informed his superiors before embarking on his controversial trip and denied he had exceeded his mission. He said that in his talks with the Serbs yesterday he had discussed his demands for an immediate Serb ceasefire and a halt to the fighting. The Serb commander, Gen Mladic, had demanded a statement from the Bosnian presidency cancelling a planned counter-offensive on Srebrenica. Bosnia's deputy president, Mr Ejup Ganic, said after speaking by telephone to Gen Morillon that the UN commander indicated the Serbs expressed their willingness to have a ceasefire in the Srebrenica region and his government had agreed. Bosnian radio said that several thousand more refugees arrived in Srebrenica yesterday as the Serbs continued their offensive. Mr Laurens Jolles, an official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees who left Srebrenica on Sunday, said up to 40 people were dying of cold and hunger daily. 'I have seen scenes I would never have expected in the 20th century,' Mr Jolles said. 'Thousands of women and children living together in the snow, without any shelter, huddled around fires. Most have not eaten for four to five days.'</p>

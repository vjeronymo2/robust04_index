			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / White House irritates advocates for Africa Americans interested in sub-Saharan Africa are a small and beleaguered band, who generally welcome any attention from the administration with desperate gratitude. Yet a two-day White House conference addressed by President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, not to mention secretary of state Warren Christopher and national security adviser Anthony Lake, has accomplished the remarkable feat of irritating even Africa's most devoted advocates. Several experts who had been told they would be asked did not receive invitations, and most members of the congressional black caucus stayed away, partly in protest at the administration's policy towards Haiti, and partly because they felt they had been asked as an afterthought. The conference, due to be addressed late yesterday by Mr Clinton, was billed by the White House as an attempt to refocus attention on issues such as sustainable development, responses to internal conflicts, support for democracy and human rights, and enhancing bilateral trade and investment ties. But the idea of an occasional gathering of the great and the good has drawn criticism as being no substitute for continuous attention to the continent's problems. 'It is the typical Clinton method: you get 150 of the brightest minds you can find into the same room, and come up with the lowest common denominator,' sniffed one Washington diplomat. And while Mr Mandela, in a videotaped message, called on the US to become 'the leading partner in the most novel and challenging project since the Marshall Plan', Mr Lake warned the US's willingness to get involved was constrained by lack of budget resources and by the US public's doubts about overseas intervention. Although Mr Lake acknowledged that genocide had taken place in Rwanda - a question on which the State Department has equivocated, to the outrage of human rights groups - he offered little prospect of future US action. With the end of the cold war and South Africa's transition to democracy, as well as the unhappy experience of humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the US has been pulling back from Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, plans to close 15 stations in Africa, which it says existed not to gather information about Africa but to monitor and recruit eastern bloc officials.</p>

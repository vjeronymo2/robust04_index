			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA) -- MENA has learned that the  issue of choosing a host country for the Nonaligned Movement's  next summit has not been decided yet, despite some rumors that  Iran, Morocco, and Egypt may submit requests.    In a statement to MENA, Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar  Velayati denied that Iran will submit a request if any of the  Latin American group countries does not ask to host the summit,  according to the geographical order under which the movement  operates.    Egyptian diplomatic sources said that if there is no  candidate from the Latin American countries, one of the Asian  group countries may be nominated to host the next summit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has said there  was no justification for "Israel" doing what it did last week.  He expected "Israel" to plan more security and military blows.  He expressed the fear that the self-rule accord could become a  bridge across which the Israelis would infiltrate the Arab  economy using the Palestinian factor. He affirmed that the PLO  has cooperated in the security field with "Israel" since 1982  and then with European intelligence services against the  Islamists.    Fadlallah made these remarks during his weekly lesson on the  interpretation of the Koran. He also fielded questions from the  audience. [passage omitted]    Asked about a statement by a Lebanese diplomat that the  recent U.S. stance at the UN Security Council was based on the  consideration that Hizballah has non-Lebanese connections,  Fadlallah said: The U.S. says the Resistance is Iranian and in  some cases Syrian and that it receives its instructions from  abroad. Let us, for the sake of argument, accept the U.S. logic  that the Resistance must be disarmed because it is not Lebanese  or because it has non- Lebanese connections. The United States  has not demanded the disarmament of the South Lebanese Army  [SLA]. Does the SLA have Lebanese or Israeli connections? Why  doesn't the United States demand its disarmament? Why does it  agree that it should stay so that it will strike its people in  the south and western al-Biqa' and defend "Israel?" Is the  Israeli army present in the border area because it has Lebanese  connections? Why doesn't the United States demand the  disarmament of the Israeli army in the border area? [passage  omitted]    Fadlallah emphasized that the Resistance is not a card in  anyone's hand, but benefits from Syrian and Iranian support, and  indicated that Afghanistan, during Soviet occupation, benefited  from the support of the United States, Europe, and the Gulf  states. [passage omitted]    Fadlallah said the reason the United States has adopted a  negative stance toward Lebanon's complaint to the Security  Council is not that the Islamic Resistance has non-Lebanese  connections, but that the Islamic Resistance represents a  problem for U.S. policy in the region. All the Islamists  represent a problem for the United States, which is acting not  only to protect "Israel," but also to protect U.S. policy in the  region. Just as there is an open war between the Islamists and  "Israel," there is also open war between the Islamists and the  U.S. policy worldwide. This is the secret of the hostile U.S.  stances.    Asked about security cooperation between the PLO and  "Israel," Fadlallah said: We do not trust the PLO. We possess  documents on the PLO's relationship with Israel since 1982. We  know the PLO has helped European intelligence agencies and has  given them a lot of information on Islamists in Lebanon and many  of the opponents of Western policy in the region.    Fadlallah expressed the fear that following the  Israeli-Palestinian Agreement, Palestinian officials would  coordinate and cooperate with Israeli intelligence to strike at  Islamists and liberation movements in the region. He also  expressed the fear that the self-rule accord will become a  bridge across which the Israelis will infiltrate the Arab  economy using the Palestinian factor, which can be a cover for  the Israeli factor. He called on the Islamists and all those  who reject the PLO policy to watch this so that the Palestinians  will not become a tool in "Israel's" hand to weaken the  Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic stances.

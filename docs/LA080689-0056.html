			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CREWS LOSE, REGAIN GROUND IN BLAZE NEAR PALOMAR MOUNTAIN  </P> <P> Weary firefighters lost and then regained ground Saturday to the week-old fire  that has been burning near Palomar Mountain when gusty winds pushed the flames  northeast, into the reaches of Cutca Valley and away from the Palomar  Observatory.  </P> <P> U.S. Forest Service officials said the fire gained the upper hand for several  hours, frustrating the efforts of 2,062 firefighters who have been battling the  stubborn blaze around-the-clock in the Cleveland National Forest. But on  Saturday night, Forest Service spokeswoman Rosalinda Ewen said the fire had  burned more than 15,100 acres and was 65% contained.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, officials said the fire had suddenly overwhelmed fire crews  and declared the blaze only 40% contained. Containment had been estimated at  58% on Friday. However, late Saturday night Forest Service spokesmen issued  their first optimistic prediction in a week, and said they expect to have the  fire under control by 8 p.m. Monday. The cost of fighting the fire has been put  at $4.4 million so far.  </P> <P> "It's a frustrating job. The terrain is very steep with very heavy brush, where  firefighters and equipment can't reach," said fire official Audrey Hagan. "The  erratic winds shifted the fire, and we had some blowouts on the east flank, in  Cutca Valley."  </P> <P> In addition to the rough terrain and unpredictable winds, firefighters were  also hampered by 96-degree temperatures and 18% humidity. But, Ewen said that  Palomar Observatory and Eagle Crag Sanctuary, which is home to endangered  golden and bald eagles, are no longer in the fire's path.  </P> <P> The new area where the fire was burning is so rough that fire crews had to be  lifted in and out by helicopters. Firefighters were seemingly reacting to the  whim of the gusty winds, which propelled the fire from ridge to ridge and into  the rocky, brush-covered ravines that lie in between.  </P> <P> But the fire's sudden shift in direction also proved to be a blessing for  firefighters. Ewen said that fire officials were able to issue optimistic  predictions for final containment because the blaze mostly traveled north from  Palomar Observatory, into areas that burned in the Aguanga fire of 1985 and the  16,000 acre Palomar fire of 1987.  </P> <P> "There isn't much left to burn in those areas," Ewen said.  </P> <P> The fire, which began last Saturday south of Vail Lake in Riverside County, was  sparked by a ricocheting bullet fired by a target shooter.  </P></p>

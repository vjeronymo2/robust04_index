			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Africa's lenders and borrowers fall out The African Development Bank's annual general meeting limped to a close yesterday with two central issues unresolved: the replenishment of the bank's soft loan fund and the adoption of stricter lending rules to stem a haemorrhage of loan losses threatening the very survival of the bank. African member countries, which own two-thirds of the bank, baulked at proposals that would restrict AfDB loans, which carry market interest rates, to a handful of solvent governments. They asked for more time to consider new creditworthiness guidelines. 'Donor countries should not insist on pre-conditions that would inadvertently deny any category of countries access to the resources of the Bank Group,' Nigeria's central bank governor, Paul Ogwuma, told the meeting. However, Mr Barrie Hudson, leader of the British delegation, said the problem of arrears had arisen 'because of the inherent risk of lending on terms that are too hard to countries with low per capita incomes and comparative economic fragility.' The AfDB is owed Dollars 700m on a disbursed loan portfolio of Dollars 8.4bn. The deadlock on who should be allowed to borrow, and on what terms, led donors countries to suspend negotiations on the replenishment of the African Development Fund, which ran out of money last year. Mr Hudson urged the AfDB to set an income threshold below which countries could only qualify for concessionary funds. He said the UK would not provide more resources for the African Development Fund until the AfDB acted to improve the quality of its projects, its lending policies and the issue of governance. Mr Babacar Ndiaye, the bank's Senegalese president, implied that donor countries had antagonised African governors with their 'take it or leave it' mentality, but he said he shared the concern of donor countries about the urgency to clear arrears and improving the quality of the bank's loan portfolio.</p>

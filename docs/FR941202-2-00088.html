Additionally, the Amendment provides that: only options approved accounts will be permitted to trade the notes; the notes will provide for a 75% floor; the index value will be calculated at least once a day; and the Amex has executed the necessary surveillance sharing agreements with the relevant commodities exchanges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Benjamin Krause, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Derivative Products Regulation, SEC, dated November 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The text of the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex and at the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 107 of the Amex Company Guide (``Section 107''), the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, and warrants. The Amex now proposes to list for trading under Section 107 intermediate term notes the value of which can be expected to fluctuate based on changes in the level of an index consisting of base metals, precious metals and energy related commodities. These securities will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107 which provide that such issues have: (1) A public distribution of one million trading units; (2) 400 holders; and (3) a market value of not less than $20 million. The Exchange also will require that the issuer have a minimum tangible net worth of $150 million. In addition, the Exchange will require that the total original issue price of the security (when combined with all of the issuer's commodity linked notes which are listed on a national securities exchange or traded through the facilities of NASDAQ), shall not be greater than 25% of the issuer's tangible net worth at the time of issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such notes will have a term of one to three years and will not pay interest. Upon maturity, holders will receive not less than 75% of the original issue price plus an amount in U.S. dollars equal to a participation rate ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a specified percentage) multiplied by any positive difference between the level of the appropriate index at the time of the offering and the average of the closing index level on the five business days preceding maturity. The notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity, and holders of the notes have no claim to the physical commodities in the linked index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

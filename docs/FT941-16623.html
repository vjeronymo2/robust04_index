			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: News in Brief London-based private bank Leopold Joseph is launching an index-matching investment service for private clients and small institutions. The aim is to answer to what it claims is general underperformance against the stock market indices by private client portfolio managers. Its Optimised Investment Service will invest in index-tracking unit trusts, covering UK and overseas markets, rather than individual shares. Portfolios also will include deposits and bonds on an individually-tailored basis. The minimum portfolio is Pounds 250,000. The service adopts a largely 'buy and hold' strategy in order to minimise the expenses of transactions. The annual management fee starts at 0.75 per cent up to the first Pounds 1m, with a Pounds 2,500 minimum. Waters Lunniss, the stockbroking arm of the Norwich and Peterborough building society, has reduced charges on its Brokerline execution-only telephone dealing service. Commission on deals worth up to Pounds 5,000 is 1 per cent (Pounds 17 minimum) and 0.1 per cent on the balance over Pounds 5,000. Previous charges had been 1.2 per cent on the first Pounds 2,500, 1 per cent on the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on the balance over Pounds 5,000. A customer will save Pounds 5 on a deal worth Pounds 2,500. Friends Provident is extending its personal equity plan from the Stewardship unit trust to all its qualifying unit trusts: Equity, European Growth and Stewardship income trust. The initial charge is 5 per cent while the annual fee is 1 1/8 per cent for the Stewardship funds and 1 per cent for the others. Minimum investment is a Pounds 1,000 lump sum or monthly contributions of Pounds 40.</p>

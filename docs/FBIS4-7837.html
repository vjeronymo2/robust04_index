			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jovanovic: "March Toward the Drina"] </F>   [Text] Even though it seems to some people that peace  is coming to Bosnia, soldiers, above all the strategists of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, do not think so at all.    It is not yet known whether the agreement between Sarajevo  and Zagreb will also mean a renewal of the Croatian-Bosnian  military alliance against the Serbs. Press agency reports talk  about a resumption of "low-intensity" combat "in central Bosnia  and in the Neretva Valley." Although the agreement provides for  the establishment of a unified military command--which means  that the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] would also have to be  placed under the command of the Bosnian generals--it appears  that the time is not yet ripe for such an outcome. U.S. General  John Galvin's mission will probably be aimed in that direction.    Serbian military sources, however, report certain movements  by Bosnian forces in the direction of the Drina front and toward  the broader Doboj region, which is the key to controlling vital  transportation routes in northern Bosnia. The story about a  Bosnian "spring" offensive, which has been announced ever since  last October, is still current.    It appears that the key moment in consolidating the Bosnian  army's ranks was Haris Silajdzic's becoming prime minister in  Sarajevo. At that moment (at the end of September 1993) about  nine-tenths of Sarajevo residents (according to Radio  Bosnia-Herzegovina) did not support the policy of a military  solution to the problem of Bosnian access to the sea and the  Sava.    Is the firm course, however, changing things radically? The  Croatian forces were destroyed in central Bosnia and in November  Vares fell, thus territorially linking the Tuzla region with  Zenica. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is organized into six corps:  the First (Sarajevo) Corps, the Second (Tuzla) Corps, the Third  (Zenica) Corps, the Fourth (Mostar) Corps, the Fifth (Bihac)  Corps, and the Sixth (Travnik) Corps. Several independent  brigades have also been formed, the most combative of which is  the Seventh. There are also operational groups that function  under special conditions.    The officer corps consists mainly of former JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army] officers, only two of whom have finished the War  (Generals') School: General Rasim Delic, commander of the  Bosnian General Staff, and his deputy, General Jovan Divljak.  The Bosnian army is estimated to have about 200,000 soldiers.  The General Staff is located in Sarajevo, and commands are  conveyed primarily through satellite communications.  <H5>  Quality and Quantity </H5>   In a Bosnia-Herzegovina TV interview, Alija Izetbegovic said  on 24 February that "we are capturing weapons from the enemy, we  produce some, and we are trying to import them through certain  paths and mountain passes," but undoubtedly weapons are being  independently produced to the greatest extent. Belgrade military  sources claim that certain weapons are procured within the  framework of the "airdrop operation." Clearly, however, that  these are negligible amounts. The conflict with Croatian  units--which was resolved to a considerable extent in Bosnia's  favor--brought Sarajevo control over significant defense  industry resources in Konjic (a munitions factory), Travnik  (cannons), Bugojno (detonators for artillery weapons), and also  in Gorazde, Zenica, and Tuzla.    After the successful operations against HVO units in  November, there were certain disagreements between Bosnian  politicians and individual high-level Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  officers. Apparently rotations have been frequent because of  that. A person who militarily ensured that the area of the Bihac  region would remain mainly (two-thirds) under the central  government's control, Col. Ramiz Drekovic, was withdrawn a bit  mysteriously, to be replaced by Col. Atif Dudakovic. Drekovic is  now the commander of the Mostar Corps. An officer credited with  succeeding in keeping part of Mostar under Bosnian control, Col.  Arif Pasalic, is currently Bosnia-Herzegovina's deputy defense  minister. It is believed that Pasalic is one of the supporters  of an assault, a southern Bosnian Reconquista, toward the  Adriatic Sea. It is claimed, however, that there is a plan,  prepared as early as last year, to break through to the Peljesac  peninsula by mid-May!    Are the latest events changing things radically? The  demilitarization of Sarajevo is freeing up at least 45,000  soldiers in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's Sarajevo Corps, and  those forces, according to many sources, are already being  deployed on other fronts. If there is some kind of peace between  the Croats and Bosnians--with American guarantees, perhaps in  the form of the demilitarization of Mostar and some cities in  central Bosnia--then offensive operations by the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army against Serbian positions are quite  possible.    A possible Croatian-Bosnian peace will probably renew the  establishment of Sarajevo's ground corridors with the sea, and  thus the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's arms build-up could become  more intensive.    The war is declining in quality (armament) and gaining in  quantity (the mass nature of the armies). The forces of the  republic of Srpska [RS] are stretched over an enormous front: in  the west, up to Bosanska Krupa, to the eastern enclaves along  the broader zone of the bank of the Drina, and in the north to  Brcko, and to Popovo Polje in the south. Because of the crisis  over the airport near Tuzla, the headquarters in Pale issued a  mobilization order. In spite of that, it is estimated that the  Serbian forces do not have enough personnel.  <H5>  Stormy Reaction </H5>   Serbian control over eastern Bosnia is currently perhaps the  most critical: three enclaves (Zepa, Srebrenica, and Gorazde)  are arousing the Bosnian General Staff's hope that a military  breakthrough to the Drina is possible. It was heard last week  from well-informed Belgrade sources (Warlord Seselj) that the  "surrender" of those three enclaves was being considered. That,  however, implies Bosnian territorial continuity--and there is  still no support for it in Pale (and the commands inside the  bunkers in Han-Pijesak).    Things are changing with incredible speed. The treacherous  mutual tapping on the shoulders of the Serbian and Croatian  sides culminated at the end of January in the Milosevic-Tudjman  military pact. According to that plan, the RS army was supposed  to penetrate the Bosnian defense near Olovo and proceed along  the valley of the Krivaja River in order to join up with its  forces on Ozren mountain, southeast of Doboj. The Croats would  transfer a large number of Croatian Army regular troops to the  Lasva valley in order to intensify the pressure and thus  facilitate the RS army's action. On the other hand, from the  Croatian enclaves near the central course of the  Bosna--Zavidovici and Zepce--HVO units were supposed to strike  at the Bosnian army from behind when the latter moved to prevent  the Serbs' breakthrough along the Krivaja River.    The purpose of the operation was clear: to break up the  territory under Bosnian control into three parts, thus  accelerating principally a bilateral partition of Bosnia, and  thereby a happy conclusion of the war as well. In the  intelligence field, this would mean encouraging new Muslim  autonomist ambitions (like Fikret Abdic). The West, however, is  reacting stormily: It is raising a fuss over the hitherto  nonexistent problem of the Tuzla airport, with the intention of  frustrating the Serbian army's possible intentions of beginning  a strike against this city, and thus extending the three  critical kilometers of the corridor near Brcko into the  interior, toward the south. The Croats were seriously threatened  with sanctions, and the (perhaps unplanned) demilitarization of  Sarajevo is freeing up enormous Bosnian troops from and around  Sarajevo, which are repelling the Croatian offensive against  Gornji Vakuf and in the Lasva valley....    Military assessments now indicate that in the long term,  Sarajevo has been militarily lost to the Serbian side. The  announced "normalization" of life in the city and its vicinity  will probably mean the establishment of transportation links  between the Bosnian capital and Zenica through Visoko and with  Tuzla through the northern Olovo-Kladanj route. It is believed  that there are about 650,000 people in that region, mostly  refugees from Zvornik, Bratunac, Bjeljina, and so forth. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's military forces in Tuzla, however, are  relatively poorly armed, but it is believed that it would have  to be the future nucleus of a massive strike against the Serbian  front lines on the left bank of the Drina.  <H5>  [Box, p 15] </H5> <H5>  Secret SAS Mission </H5>   The London Sunday Express reported last week that an elite  SAS [Special Air Service] British Army unit had been sent to  Bosnia on a secret mission to discover Serbian, Bosnian, and  Croatian heavy weapons. It is believed, however, that the number  of missions for which this unit was sent to Bosnia is much  higher. The SAS consists of the 21st, 22d, and 23d Regiments,  the 264th Communications Company, and the Commando-45  Paratrooper-Reconnaissance Regiment. It is most likely that  parts of the 22d Regiment, located in Herestford with black  berets, were sent to Bosnia. SAS units also successfully passed  a test in the Falklands war when their commands reported on  enemy movements and positions. In "Desert Storm," they proved to  be more successful than the U.S. "Green Berets."    Their arrival in Bosnia is being associated with Serbian  politicians' and generals' serious threats against the Blue  Helmets in the event of international military intervention. The  Serbian General Staff in Bosnia is now located in Han-Pijesak in  eastern Bosnia, in a bomb shelter. Orders are issued from it by  cable to units in all parts of the battlefield. This avoids the  possibility of radar interference or the interception of command  instructions.    The SAS's biggest success during the Gulf war, however, is  considered to be putting out of commission the underground  communications cables between the Iraqi units in Kuwait and the  command post in Basra. SAS units are infiltrated deep into the  enemy's rear in order to capture or liquidate high-level  politicians or officers. They are transported there by  helicopters with special navigation equipment. During one  characteristic attack against the Iraqi rear an SAS strike group  blew up a bomb shelter in which there were 450 Iraqi soldiers  and officers. The commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, General  Sir Michael Rose, is a member of the SAS.    The Bosnian Serbs also have special units, the best known of  which are the "Panthers" from Bijeljina. The HVO commander,  General Ante Ros, was a member of the French Foreign Legion.  Before assuming his present position, he was chief of the  Croatian Army's Special Forces Command.</p>

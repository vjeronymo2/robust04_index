			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Leading Article: Spring fever in London AT FIRST sight, Mr John Major knows something that the rest of us don't. Not only was his political self-confidence triumphantly vindicated, but the British economic recovery he has been forecasting for so long started just when everyone had given up believing in it. The figures remained grim up to polling day; but in the week since we have learned that output rose in February, and unemployment almost stopped rising in March. The prime minister will have been less pleased with news that producer prices and average earnings are still rising quite strongly; more has been expected of ERM discipline. But the stock market, now taking a rosy view of everything, has no doubt concluded that price rises show industrial confidence, while higher earnings are a strong foundation for rising consumer demand. Against this apparently improved economic background, the 10 per cent rise in equity values since the surprise Conservative victory looks like sobriety itself. Investors with long memories, however, will know that there is a standard contrarian response to election results, especially to an unexpected result: buy on a Labour win, sell when the Tories come back. The market stages an instant funeral or celebration, and then relapses to its previous trend. That conventional wisdom is supported by any long-term chart of moving average share prices: there is almost no sign of changes of government. However, this formula has no clear message at this stage, for by Thursday the market had fully recovered its underlying trend, but had not yet overshot it. Economists have their own way of dampening high spirits, as is their dreary habit: don't extrapolate figures for a single month, and do look at the fine details. This changes the picture quite drastically. On the three-month moving average, output was still falling in February, while the unexpectedly good unemployment figures for March simply balanced the unexpectedly bad ones the month before. There is also evidence that some planned lay-offs were postponed in March to avoid the election season. Darwinian process Output prices are a matter of detail, not trend. All the bounce was in one sector - drink and tobacco. This suggests that in the UK, as in the US, these industries are offsetting the decline in demand for their products by pushing up prices aggressively. It is a rise in the cost of addiction, or the wages of sin. This is one way to confront weak markets, and has interesting implications for equities in these sectors, but says nothing at all about confidence in general. The rise in the wages of work reflects quite a different response to demand weakness, and may be the real good economic news this Easter. This is the first British recession in living memory in which productivity, especially in manufacturing, has gone on rising while output fell. This is partly a Darwinian process, as the least efficient companies close down, but also shows positive progress, shown most spectacuarly last week in Rover's Japanese-style labour agreement - 'a greenfield agreement on a brownfield site', as the management proudly claimed. Employers have been achieving improvements which would have been regarded as unbelievable not long ago, and have been happy to reward labour for its co-operation. This may raise the 'going rate', and so push up costs and prices in less exposed parts of the economy, especially in the service industries. The bad news is that the resultant inflation numbers will persuade the government that it must squeeze for the indefinite future - when the banks are already applying all the restraint that even a puritan could demand. But the good news is that manufacturing industry may be better able than the Labour party's devaluationists imagine to live with a demanding exchange rate. Merciless squeeze The good-news bad-news story really describes the British outlook very well: high wages but high unemployment; good profits for the efficient but a merciless squeeze on the indebted; a fairly sluggish growth in domestic demand, but inviting costs and labour relations for foreign companies seeking new capacity. Membership of the ERM is thus working in unexpected ways, doing less than expected to cut inflation, but speeding up the internationalisation of the UK economy. That may in the long run be the best news of all for investors, for it suggests that UK shares will steadily rise above their high-yielding, poor-relation status in world markets. But there are two cautions. First, most British companies must more fully earn the dividends they are already paying. Second, it takes two or more to converge. While Wall Street is testing new highs as a real though probably undramatic economic recovery is confirmed, Tokyo has lowered the international target as dramatically as anyone could wish. The collapse there has not yet spread internationally, as pessimists have expected - indeed, Tokyo funk money may be helping to support London and New York. But the dust cloud is likely to obscure long-term propsects for some time yet.</p>

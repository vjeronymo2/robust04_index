			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview via correspondence with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, </F> "president of the Democratic Republic of Yemen and secretary  general of the Socialist Party," in Aden, by Amir Taheri in  London; date not given]    [Text] [Taheri] After the war has entered its fourth  week, do you believe that resorting to the use of arms was  unavoidable?    [Al-Bid] According to Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar and General  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who prepared for this war, that is true.  As for us, we refused to think about or prepare for war. We  exerted every effort to spare the Yemeni people war, the most  recent example being the Pledge and Accord Document, which the  other side rejected completely. Then it pushed Yemen into this  war, which has destroyed everything: most recently oil,  economic, and service installations, especially in the capital,  Aden, despite the Security Council resolution.    We are defending, not attacking. We are defending our right  to live, our honor, our rights, our homes, and our land against  the barbarous military invasion and occupation.    [Taheri] Do you see the current conflict as a civil or  international war?    [Al-Bid] Both cases apply to the current situation in Yemen.  On the one hand we set up a unified state peacefully, and this  state needed efforts to complete its structures. It needed to  be looked after and safeguarded. But the "Shaykh and the  general" did not comprehend that and remained prisoners of the  mentality of annexation, looking at the south as a branch that  had joined the roots and as a field for tax collection,  usurpation, and obtaining a livelihood.    On the other hand, being two completely equal parties,  regimes, countries, and so on, we are entitled to present our  case as an international case, as the party represented in the  Yemen Arab Republic is waging a war. Because the building of  the new entity still has not been completed, and the reality has  made it difficult to achieve that, and Sanaa has rejected all  that Aden is offering or has offered. In fact the situation has  reached the point of declaring a war to eliminate an entire  people. So it is a dual matter, as you can see.    [Taheri] Are you willing to accept a temporary return to the  situation that existed before the fighting broke out as a  condition for a cease-fire, provided it is followed by  negotiations between the two parties?    [Al-Bid] Gen. 'Ali Salih unilaterally declared a state of  emergency, abolished enforcement of the Constitution, and waged  a war. What is required is to halt the fighting and create  normal conditions first and then hold negotiations between the  two parties that have equal rights and duties.    [Taheri] You demanded Arab and international intervention to  end the war. What is the nature of the intervention you are  thinking of? Is it supposed to involve peacekeeping forces?    [Al-Bid] We support any Arab and international efforts to  end and halt the war at this point, whether through  negotiations, by sending observers to withdraw the forces, or,  if necessary, by sending peacekeeping forces. Because the  continuation of the war would lead to its escalation and to the  intervention of parties that do not want stability for the  region.    [Taheri] How would you assess the course of the war so far?    [Al-Bid] The course of the war is clear. As far as he ['Ali  Salih] is concerned, the aim has been defined since he launched  the war, namely to destroy our military and civilian  institutions, to occupy the south, and to impose a military  regime on the two parts of Yemen, especially after the collapse  of the regime's military "myth" about the existence of a  "democratic" atmosphere after the achievement of unity and scope  for the press and free expression.    As for our aim, it has always been to defend ourselves  peacefully under artillery bombardment. We take up the arms  available to repel the aggressor.    [Taheri] Among the proposals mentioned in Western diplomatic  sources there is one calling for a cease-fire first and a  general referendum in Yemen on unity within about a year. Do  you believe that such a formula could form a part of the  endeavors being made to end the fighting?    [Al-Bid] The unity was achieved with a political decision,  and it was also ended by them with the decision to wage a war on  us. It is an all-out war in which they have used every dreadful  and barbarous thing, most recently the fatwa announced the day  before yesterday on Sanaa radio and issued by someone claiming  to be a Muslim. He stated that it is lawful to seize southern  areas. And indeed their forces are doing that and plundering  everything, raping women and embarking on actions that conflict  with Islam, ethics, and manhood.    It is happening not only in the areas they have occupied,  but  also in northern areas, specifically al-Bayda', Ta'izz, Ibb, and  Ma'rib.    It is unrealistic to talk about a referendum while military  rule and the military option exist. However, we are willing to  accept it [a referendum] in the southern areas when normal  conditions are secured under UN supervision. I confirm to you  our agreement beforehand to what the people in these areas want.</p>

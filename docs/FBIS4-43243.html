			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Josef Abaffy: "More Flexible, But Incomplete"] </F>   [Text] Economics Minister Rexrodt is quite right in saying  that the new government guidelines on Hermes credits demonstrate  both flexibility and common sense. But this new flexibility is  only one side of the coin: the new regulations are also an  expression of a certain fearfulness. It so happens that the new  flexibility in covering export credit risks does not resolve the  fundamental problem faced by the system which is operating with  losses running into the billions. In principle, the export  credit system should break even. If it does not, it needs to be  subsidized, the GATT principles state; but that represents a  distortion of the competitive system, i.e. it is illegal.    The classification of the laender into risk categories on  the  basis of which credit risk guarantees are set by the government  is a step in the right direction. As against the previous  practice of setting "uniform rates" reliable payment and  customer ethics are rewarded based on the principle of "higher  premiums for greater risks and lower premiums for smaller  risks," while poor performance is penalized by charging higher  premiums or even by refusing to extend subsequent coverage.    But the other side of the coin becomes apparent soon enough.  Russia, for example (or rather, customers in Russia) is in class  five, without a doubt a poor payer of its bills. Last year, the  German Government was forced to pay 5.1 billion German marks  [DM] because Russian customers did not pay their bills. It is  doubtful that this will change in the next few years. Even  Rexrodt knows--and makes no secret of it--that the assumption of  risks in trading with Russia is based on political  considerations and not on business decisions.    In line with the logic of the new flexibility, however,  German exporters looking for credit guarantees for their  business dealings with Russian customers would have to pay  premiums of more than 50 percent because the risk of losses is  as great as it is and because the risk is no longer supposed to  be shared by all exporters on an equal basis. But premiums of  such magnitude would quickly put an end to all export trade.  This problem arises with respect to all the major problem  nations of years past, e.g. the former Soviet bloc, Iran,  Brazil, or Argentina.    One more time Rexrodt weasled out of the problem of who must  bear the economic risks for business deals with politically  significant countries such as Russia or Iran, which are either  unable or unwilling to pay up. Either the risk guarantees are no  longer extended in which case such exports will no longer take  place and the Bonn government will only assume "good," i.e.  minor risks, or the government will guarantee political credit  risks but does not make the exporters pay for them no matter  what Germany's OECD or GATT partners may say. As long as this  central problem of political risks is not resolved it cannot be  maintained that the new guidelines will lead to a reduction of  the Hermes-related budget risks.    But if the government merely assumes "good" risks from now  on, we may not need a risk insurance for export credits any  more. Even now only about six percent of all exports are  Hermes-insured.    There is one more thing wrong with the new Hermes system,  i.e. it is hard to see why the ministry chooses to keep the  laender list a secret. On the face of it, this is simply the way  bureaucrats work who view the public as a nuisance while  forgetting all the while that it is the public that pays their  salaries.    Rexrodt's explanation of the bureaucratic foolishness is  unconvincing. The lists cannot be made public, he says, because  they must continuously be updated. Actually, it is the other way  around: precisely because they are constantly updated they need  to be made public so that the exporters can make proper plans.  It goes without saying that the Foreign Ministry may run into  problems if country A or country B is listed in a less than  attractive category; but that is a matter to be dealt with not  by the exporter but by the country in question. For their part,  the ministry officials should have the courage to break down and  realize that they are here to provide a service.</p>

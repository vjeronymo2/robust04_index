			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORO WOMEN STAGGER IN TRY TO BETTER 1989 RECORD IN SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Starting its second year under Coach Janis Ruetz, the Cal State Dominguez Hills  women's softball team is looking to better last season's 35-22-1 record and  third-place finish in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  </P> <P> Last year, Ruetz took her team to the NCAA Division II West egionals. Much of  the Lady Toros' strength came from pitcher Denise Biller, who had a team-high  15 wins. Overall, the pitching staff led the nation with an ERA of 0.59.  </P> <P> With nine returning starters, Ruetz has a solid chance to make it back to the  Regionals.  </P> <P> "Our goal for the year is, basically, to be consistent," she said. "We want to  do as well as we did last year and get another NCAA berth."  </P> <P> However, the Lady Toros dropped their first two games, 1-0 and 3-0, to UC Santa  Barbara. But they came back Wednesday to sweep Christ College of Irvine, 1-0,  and 4-3.  </P> <P> Senior pitcher Kim Park, who was 13-8-1 with an 0.58 ERA last season, is  considered the team leader.  </P> <P> Sophomore Jennifer Boen, a pitcher and utility infielder, was 4-1 in eight  mound appearances last year with a 0.40 ERA. She also earned all-conference  honors as a utility player. In CCAA play, Boen was 2-0 with two complete-game  shutouts.  </P> <P> Ruetz said she expects Boen to become the No. 2 starter on the pitching staff,  which means she won't play so much in the infield. "(Boen) is ready to pitch  full-time at this level," the coach said.  </P> <P> On offense, the Lady Toros look first to senior outfielder Maria Romero, who  led the team last year with eight doubles, nine triples and 27 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Nicole Stelter, a 5-foot-9 sophomore infielder, was second in RBIs last year  with 21 and hit two home runs.  </P> <P> In the CCAA, the main competition for the Lady Toros will come from perennially  talented Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> "Northridge is always tough for us," Ruetz said.  </P></p>

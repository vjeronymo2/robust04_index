			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Merged chamber appoints chief A manufacturer specialising in cable communications was named yesterday as the chief executive designate of the new North East Chamber of Commerce. Merger of the Tyne and Wear, Teesside and Tynedale chambers has created one of the five largest chambers in the UK. Mr Bill Bates, selected for the Pounds 50,000-a-year post from more than 100 applicants, is managing director of Teesside-based Integral, the European arm of the American-owned South Wire Company. Mr Bates said yesterday he wanted the chamber to give north-east England's business community an authoritative voice in speaking to local authorities, central government and the European Union. He identified as recurrent business problems red tape and form filling, late payment and the cost of money. The new Chamber, to be headquartered in Durham City, will come into operation next January. Mr Bates will take up his new post by this July.</p>

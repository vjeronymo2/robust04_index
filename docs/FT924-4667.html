			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: May Stores considers rival Dollars 55m bid for shoe group MAY Department Stores, the St Louis-based retailer that includes the Payless shoe store chain, said yesterday that it had asked the board of Morse Shoe to provide information on a proposed merger with J. Baker, the footwear group, and that May might be willing to make a rival offer of Dollars 55m for Morse Shoe. The company said that the purpose of acquiring Morse would be to step up its presence in the north-eastern US generally and in the New York area in particular. May said that, if the bid went ahead, it would be an all-cash offer. This is in contrast to the J. Baker proposal, and would not be contingent on financing arrangements, due diligence requirements, or any other major conditions. May already operates around 3,500 shoe stores through he Payless chain, in addition to some 320 department stores.</p>

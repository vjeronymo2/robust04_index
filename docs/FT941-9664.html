			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Clinton wins support from economists Prominent economists, academics and business leaders have lent their support to President Bill Clinton's strategy for opening the Japanese market. A letter backing Mr Clinton's approach swiftly gathered more than 110 names last week, symbolising the consensus - embracing even many traditional free traders - that the US can no longer live with the US-Japan trade imbalance or sign pacts that do not yield progress. 'There is a lot more resolve, unity and specificity,' said a senior US official. 'Look at those figures. . . Dollars 60bn (trade deficit for 1993). Plus we've learned a lot. . . You spend all those years on. . . talks, and you don't have anything. That's why we are insisting on a specific results-oriented approach.' Past pacts have generated some gains, but they have often been limited. Seven years after it was signed, a 1978 deal produced liberalisation of Japan's government procurement computer market. Other talks led to greater Japanese imports of tobacco, fish, beef and citrus fruits. In 1985, Tokyo cut leather tariffs. In 1986, a semiconductor agreement set 20 per cent as a minimum goal for the opening of Japan's semiconductor market; thus far, however, this target has been reached only once. According to the Economic Strategy Institute, the impact of Japanese policies is felt well beyond the US. Its surplus depresses world GDP 'by upwards of Dollars 400bn (Pounds 274bn)' and destroys foreign jobs at a time when unemployment is a severe problem. Japan's 'minimal' imports of high value-added manufactured goods skew the composition of global economic activity and threaten trade frictions everywhere. While the US refused to agree to an empty arrangement for the sake of a successful summit, its own proposals were vague. US officials said they wanted - and Japan at the Tokyo summit agreed to - 'qualitative or quantitative indicators' which would be used to measure progress in market opening. There are no market share targets, and there would be no enforcement mechanism in the agreement. A senior trade official explained: 'A qualitative indicator is not numerical. 'Quantitative' may and may not be numerical, although it is hard to have a quantitative that doesn't have a number somewhere buried in it by implication or direction.' Japanese officials said what they rejected was 'numerical targets' and 'managed trade'. US business representatives, who advised the trade officials, said they also rejected managed trade. Ms Debra Waggoner, director of international trade for the American Electronics Association, said the group sought indicators comparing import penetration in Japan with third country markets, where the US and Japan compete head to head. The AEA would measure growth of the exports, the size of the markets and the competitiveness of the products. 'You set up benchmarks to see if you are making progress,' said Ms Waggoner. 'You want to see if something is amiss and if it is, you want to take the necessary steps to get on track.' A spokesman for the US car industry said: 'We are not asking for guaranteed sales. Just give us the ability to sell.' Whatever was meant, the US and Japan are on a collision course. Mr Clinton's desired 'period of reflection' could end as early as tomorrow, when a review of Japan's cellular telephone market is due. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, is said to have already requested a list of potential targets for sanctions. Beyond that are numerous trade cases to be filed or resurrected and unsatisfactory agreements to be reviewed. Mr Kantor has stressed the importance of trade pact enforcement to the credibility of the administration; he will now have the opportunity to make good on his words.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POTENTIAL INCREASE OF US SALES TO JAPAN IF BARRIERS LIFTED  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector                            Potential sales                                       (dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Food                                          101 Steel                                         138 Paper                                       6,671 Textiles                                      132 Aerospace                                   2,190 Autos                                      20,520 Equipment/tools                             3,939 Computing/software                         18,979 Electronics                                10,702 Telecoms                                      514 Chemicals                                   9,820  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economic Strategy Institute  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CONTINUES WAREHOUSE HEARING  </P> <P> Plans for a 70,300-square-foot concrete warehouse in Buena Park, which had been  opposed by dozens of neighborhood residents, will be the subject of a hearing  Nov. 20.  </P> <P> A motion to continue the hearings to Nov. 20 was passed after Alloy Die Casting  appealed to the City Council during a recent public hearing, stating that  changes had been made since the initial submission of plans.  </P> <P> "We have met with the neighbors on several occasions and have been able to  negotiate many issues," Alloy vice president Jay A. Andrews said. "We have  changed the height to 30 foot, and have agreed to set the building back, out of  view."  </P> <P> Ken Anderson, resident and homeowner in the Poet housing development near the  proposed site on Caballero Boulevard, said in his appeal to the City Council:  "We feel that a lot of the problems have been worked out. We are not opposed to  the building, just the height. We could live with a 26-to-28-foot outside wall,  but not 30 foot."  </P></p>

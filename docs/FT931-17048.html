			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: A year of dull times and minor disasters - Diary of a Private Investor LOOKING back at the end of a year is a useful exercise in highlighting the errors and successes of the previous 12 months in the hope that they can be avoided or repeated. As a private investor, I found 1992 rather dull. My trading in shares was very limited compared with, say, the 1980s, when I would trade very actively, sometimes selling shares in certain companies within months, or even weeks, of buying them. Of course, I also bought some shares then for the longer term but, in those years, there seemed much more excitement in the market, with more takeovers, more small companies having share prices that rocketed almost overnight before, perhaps, taking some months or years to collapse. To me, profits seemed fairly easy to make, especially as I had taken evasive action before the 1987 crash and then taken advantage of lower prices afterwards to build my portfolio. Other decisions I made in the 1980s also proved to be helpful in safeguarding myself in the 1990s. For example, I sold my last property share in 1989 and so did not suffer from seeing shares in some property companies rendered valueless when the companies went into liquidation in 1992. I also resisted the blandishments, made on several occasions in the early and mid-1980s, to become a Lloyd's Name. I was not prepared to risk the amount of money expected of a Name without having much more direct control over the investment. Bitter experience has taught me never to trust anyone in business - if I cannot 'get out quick' and promptly cut losses, I am only prepared to risk comparatively modest sums. However, this year's disasters include not 'getting out quick', even when the opportunity was available. Over the years, I have made some useful profits via my personal pension scheme by buying and selling the capital shares of Scottish National Trust. I appreciated that, due to the structure of the various classes of shares in this investment trust, the share price of the capital shares tended to be highly volatile, but I did not keep a close enough watch on the share price and the performance of the company. The share price fell rapidly this year from 42p to 12.5p, before perking up to 18p and I should have cut my losses much sooner. Fortunately, my holding had been very modest. The same is true of my other investment trust disaster - 1,500 shares in Gresham House. An earlier article described how I made this awful boob, but this was compounded by keeping the shares rather than dumping them when they first started to go into freefall last year - and even retaining them in 1992 when I could have sold them for around 18p to 25p each. I took the view that a holding worth only Pounds 270 was not worth the effort of further research and so held on in the hope of a miracle. I should have sold. The shares are now quoted at 2p each. My wife proved more astute when she sold her last Liberty voting shares for 575p in August while my personal pension fund hung on in the hope that Brian Myerson's approach, via Concerto, to 'ginger up' the company would result in a longer term appreciation of the underlying value of Liberty. Sadly, this did not happen - by the time I sold, I received 550p a share. I still made a useful profit and the voting shares have now fallen to less than 500p. However, I will continue to follow Liberty's progress in case there are signs that renewed buying could prove profitable. Another disaster was HC Slingsby, where my personal pension scheme has, over the years, been steadily reducing its holding, but not fast enough. I could have sold Slingsby for around 150p to 170p in February, but again held on in the hope that this small company, which makes ladders and trucks, would be the subject of a takeover bid. By the time I sold, in April, the price was down to 110p. Looking back, it would seem that takeover hopes have caused me to hold on to shares in a year that has been noteable for its decline in takeover activity. It is never going to be possible to pinpoint exactly when a share may rise on rumours of a takeover approach, and I have been prepared to hold shares for years in the hope of such an approach - especially when my confidence is boosted by such events as the February takeover of sweetmaker Taveners by a Danish chocolate and confectionery group which paid 165p a share. I had bought Taveners in 1987 for 58p each. During 1992, I sold more shares than I bought, taking advantage of rising prices to make profit in a market which I thought was generally approaching overvaluation. The companies whose shares I did buy, such as The Investment Company, and increased holdings in Treatt and Photo-Me, were bought with the long term in mind - rather like laying down wine to mature. My best investments, however, were achieved as a result of Black Wednesday in September, when the pound was devalued. In 1991, I bought shares in Nestle for my pension scheme because I thought the company was well-run and undervalued. With its worldwide spread of investments, and being based in Switzerland, its shares offered some protection against a falling pound. The shares cost the equivalent of Pounds 319 each in March 1991. They are now worth more than Pounds 500 each, having risen sharply after Black Wednesday. As 1992 progressed, I became more and more concerned about the overvalued pound and felt that a sharp correction was long overdue. On September 4, I put a large part of my pension scheme's surplus cash into Swiss francs at a rate of 2.4665 to the pound. The rate is now around SFr2.196, which means that every Pounds 10,000 invested in September is now worth about Pounds 11,232 - plus interest. I shall certainly be considering further currency transactions in 1993. My sole theatrical investment, Return To The Forbidden Planet, continued its successful run in the West End and, since originally making that investment in 1989, every Pounds 1,000 invested has paid out Pounds 1,080 of profit, with the promise of more to come. During 1993, the show will embark on (I hope) a successful tour of the UK. Unfortunately, I also invested in the US version of the show. The show closed and I lost my entire investment in it. But then, I did enter it with my eyes wide open, appreciating the high risks of theatrical investment. Premium bonds in 1992 continued to be a disappointment, although I think Ernie should really be re-christened Ernestine, as in the period 1987 to 1992 inclusive, in every year except one, my wife has won more money than I have. This year the sexist computer still preferred my wife. We each have the maximum Pounds 10,000 holding - she won a total of Pounds 750 (15 Pounds 50 prizes), while my total winnings were a pathetic Pounds 400. My eldest daughter did much better. She only had Pounds 100 of bonds and won Pounds 50. With reductions in the size of the prize fund, I am seriously considering reducing our bond holdings.</p>

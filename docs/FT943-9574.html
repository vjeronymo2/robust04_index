			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: New Ireland shows decline to IPounds 2.4m New Ireland Holdings, the Dublin-based life assurance and pensions group, saw profit almost halve, from IPounds 4.04m to IPounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.37m) pre-tax, in the six months to the end of June, despite an 18 per cent increase in premium income. Premiums from life assurance rose from IPounds 69.1m to IPounds 81.4m, but a sharp rise in claims from IPounds 49.9m to IPounds 79.8m meant a net deficit of IPounds 16.6m (income IPounds 103.8m). There was also a loss on underwriting, although this was reduced from IPounds 1.64m to IPounds 1.24m. Earnings per share dropped from 18.5p to 9.3p. An interim dividend of 3.85p (3.5p) is declared. The ultimate holding company is UAP, the French insurance group.</p>

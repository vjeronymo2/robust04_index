			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Rabin will be no pushover for the peace process - A look at the end of Likud domination IT IS fanciful to think that a country can change character overnight, but to many Israelis yesterday it felt like that was exactly what had happened after Tuesday's general election. In the space of a day, 15 years of government dominated by the uncompromising nationalist ideology of the Likud party were swept aside, replaced by a resurgent Labour party promising to make peace with Israel's Arab neighbours in a spirit of compromise and concession. Words such as 'revolution', 'earthquake' and 'historic' littered the comments of politicians, newspapers and ordinary people as they digested the election's implications. 'Welcome to the new Israel,' gushed an enthusiastic Labour supporter in Jerusalem. The result was a defeat for the Likud that matched its own dramatic rise to power in 1977 under Mr Menachem Begin. He was the charismatic champion of 'revisionist' Zionists who proclaimed Israel's biblical right to all of Eretz Israel - the 'Land of Israel' including the Arab territories occupied in the 1967 Six Day War. It was symbolic that Mr Begin, long out of office, died shortly after the election was called. Under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, his cautious successor, the Likud's foundations were about to shake. Likud's election loss was due in part to the defection of thousands of the country's poorer Sephardim, or oriental Jews, whom Mr Begin had made the bedrock of the party's support. They, like most of the 300,000 recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union, voted Labour in large part because of the dismal state of the economy. But they were also sufficiently reassured by Mr Rabin's image as a tough military man to support Labour's commitment to cede some of the occupied territories in exchange for peace. In the end, the potency of Likud's stance on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and expanding Jewish settlements was blunted by the obstacle it clearly placed in the way of the US-brokered Middle East peace process, which has proved highly popular among Israelis weary of years of conflict. But how much will things now change under Mr Rabin, himself a cautious pragmatist? Ironically, he may find himself having to rein in 'doves' in his own party and his allies in Meretz, the bloc of small left-wing and pro-peace parties which will be Labour's chief coalition partner. Both the Labour doves and Meretz espouse a much more radical commitment to giving up 'land for peace' than Mr Rabin. However, he should be able to move quickly to repair Israel's relationship with the US, bruised by a series of rows between the Bush administration and Mr Shamir's government. Labour's policy on the peace negotiations is much more in tune with Washington, which considers 'land for peace' the essential basis of any settlement. Mr Rabin also said yesterday he was hopeful that his commitment to stop government funding and subsidies for most of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza would prompt Washington to release Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in loan guarantees which Israel badly wants to help finance immigration. President Bush withheld the guarantees because of Mr Shamir's absolute refusal to freeze the settlements. In the peace talks, Mr Rabin has laid out a position which is clearly distinguished from Mr Shamir's government. Apart from his ultimate willingness to cede at least some territory in a final settlement, Mr Rabin is prepared to grant greater powers to the Palestinians in the interim stage of autonomy for the occupied territories than the 'municipal autonomy' offered by Likud. He says an autonomy accord, which he plans to reach within nine months of taking office, would include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from main Arab population centres and transfer of control of day-to-day administration to a Palestinian authority. Mr Rabin says he would concentrate his efforts on reaching agreement with the Palestinians, before attempting a settlement with Syria. He says Israel should not 'go down' from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967, for security reasons. But Mr Rabin was at pains yesterday to stress that he would be no pushover. He said Israel would continue to exercise control over defence, security, foreign affairs and the Jewish settlements during the autonomy stage. His stance on settlements is a long way from what the Palestinians are demanding. He is committed to expanding Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem, the immediate West Bank hinterland, border areas such as the Jordan Valley, and the Golan Heights. His objection to settlements is confined to those in the West Bank and Gaza heartlands which he labels 'political' or ideological, settlements. Labour has been careful not to spell out exactly how much territory it would be willing to give up. The only policy guide it has ever published on the subject was a plan drawn up in 1970 by the late Yigal Allon, then deputy prime minister. The Allon plan envisaged annexing to Israel large chunks of the West Bank and Gaza and ceding the rest to Jordan. The plan is now considered out-dated, partly because the growth of Jewish settlements has complicated the picture. But Labour officials suggest they would be willing to cede more than was then envisaged. The plan's underlying emphasis on keeping what is considered vital for Israel's security remains valid. As big a task for Mr Rabin as the peace process is regenerating the domestic economy. Here the consensus among economists is the need for radical reforms, such as industrial privatisation and liberalisation of the capital and labour markets, to help generate growth urgently needed to alleviate unemployment running at 11.5 per cent and about 40 per cent among immigrants. Mr Rabin talks of diverting the Shk3bn (Pounds 660m) now spent each year on Jewish settlements to investment inside Israel. He hopes winning the US loan guarantees will free funds for a big programme of infrastructural investment. His goal is to revive immigration, which has slipped under the burden of unemployment but which is still regarded as a vital demographic asset for Israel. However, Mr Rabin's commitment to economic reform looks suspect. He has said he favours only limited privatisation of the 150 state-owned companies, not wanting so-called strategic companies - such as the airline El Al - to slip out of government control. He also comes from the traditionalist wing of Labour that was firmly socialist and which continues to support the strong ties with the Histadrut trade union federation which has been one of the main forces opposing wholesale market reforms. It is ironic that the man who will preside over what a Meretz leader yesterday called a new era in Israel comes from the generation of the state's founding days. The outlook for Middle East peace is nevertheless brighter as a result of his election. But Yitzhak Rabin faces many formidable tests, at home and abroad, to prove he can indeed lead Israel to peace and prosperity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RABIN'S MAIN POLICY COMMITMENTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Re-order national priorities away from Likud's commitment to holding   'the land of Israel' to Labour's commitment to territorial   compromise  -Improve relations with the US  -Accelerate the pece process - autonomy for Palestinians in West Bank   and Gaza in nine months  -Shift emphasis of investment from Jewish settlements in occupied   territories to development towns in Israel  -Generate employment to revive flagging immigration from the former   Soviet Union  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- See Editorial Comment</p>

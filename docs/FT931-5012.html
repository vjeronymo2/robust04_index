			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Poll pressure grows on French Socialists: Fortysomethings of France's left-wing elite fight for political life after the election A GROUP of younger leaders in France's governing Socialist party will tomorrow call for their party to put itself at the centre of a new social democratic coalition. The move by the so-called 'quadras' (for quadragenarians or 40-year-olds) is clearly prompted by last month's call by Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist standard-bearer in the next presidential poll, for a 'big bang' to recompose centre-left forces in France. But the 'quadras' are also closely linked to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, who has long been urging his Socialist party to modernise itself. Another sign that the Socialists, who are facing near-certain defeat in the election's two rounds of voting on March 21 and 28, are opening up under pressure came yesterday from Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn. The industry minister, who is hard pressed in his campaign to keep his industrial constituency seat outside Paris, said that Socialist candidates who do worse than their ecologist competitors in the first round of voting should urge their supporters to vote 'green' in the second round. 'In their vast majority, ecologists are basically progressive,' Mr Strauss-Kahn said, 'and it is necessary to block the return of the right.' The industry minister does not himself face a very strong green challenge, but others, including Mr Rocard, do. In earlier stages of the campaign, the country's environmentalist parties were outpolling the Socialists, and they remain the prime target of Socialist wooing. By contrast, the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF party have a formal electoral pact, under which they are fielding a single candidate in all but around 80 of the 577 constituencies. But there is already tension over cabinet jobs in a future government.</p>

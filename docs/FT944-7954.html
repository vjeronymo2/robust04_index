			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Samax is latest new issues victim Weak conditions in the London new issues market have claimed another victim. Samax, which is developing mines in Africa, said yesterday it was postponing its flotation until early next year. Samax planned to raise Pounds 16m by the end of November via a placing by stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing, on terms that would have valued the company at about Pounds 50m. A pathfinder prospectus was issued at the end of last month and the company toured several financial centres making presentations to potential investors. Mr Michael Martineau, managing director, said the response, particularly in the US, was generally favourable, but 'the directors did not believe that the anticipated proceeds of the flotation, given conditions in the new issues market, would enable the company to capitalise on all of the opportunities available'. He said shareholder support had given the board flexibility to delay the issue until market conditions allowed the company 'to achieve a larger issue size rather than proceed on a scaled-back basis'. Samax also suffered because mining companies worldwide have been highly active in raising new money this year. By the end of June, at least Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.41bn) had been raised, topping the Dollars 4.8bn they collected in the whole of 1993, and there were warnings then about the danger of 'indigestion' in the new mining equities market. Samax was set up in 1989 and is developing a graphite mine in Tanzania and a gold mine in Ghana. The flotation was to allow it to complete the financing of its mining operations, repay short term loans and expand its exploration efforts. Its activities so far have been financed primarily by the Addax Oryx Group, described in the pathfinder prospectus as a private, Europe-based group involved in trading and related operations in Africa.</p>

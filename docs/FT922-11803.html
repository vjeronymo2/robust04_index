			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: A Jovial Crew When the London theatres reopened in 1661, Samuel Pepys found the revival of A Jovial Crew 'the most innocent play I ever saw.' Max Stafford-Clark's RSC debut production is far from that, for A Jovial Crew makes a sharp, knowing counterpart to the flaccid Beggar's Opera playing alongside it at the Swan. Both plays are about the low life, and both were operettas in the 1730s. This new production of A Jovial Crew transforms the relaxed original into a robust evening's theatre. Richard Brome (circa 1590 - 1652) wrote A Jovial Crew or The Merry Beggars in 1641. He learned much from working with Ben Jonson, and this play combines Jonson's realism (The Staple of News) and romance (The New Inn). It has been extensively rewritten and modernised to good effect by Stephen Jeffreys. The improbable plot follows the devices and desires of Squire Oldrents' steward Springlove, a man with an inborn desire of liberty who periodically takes to the road with a band of itinerant beggars. When Springlove leaves with a begging crew, Oldrents' flighty daughters, tired of Oldrents' melancholia, follow him and take their respective suitors along. Another couple, escaping from an enforced marriage, joins the crew. Chases and confusions ensue. True to 17th-century form, a lost infant reappears from Oldrents' past, and the naturally good turn out to be nobly born. The moral?: 'They dream of happiness that live in state, But they enjoy it that embrace their fate.' The serious import of Brome's play is that possessions are at best a responsibility and at worst a burden; that beggars are 'the only free men of the commonwealth;' and that for beggars, 'tis not home merely that you leave behind, But language, morals, certainty of mind.' Behind it all lie the Elizabethan Poor Laws stacked up by William Cecil, making each parish responsible for its needy; the laws remained largely unchanged until 1834. Brome jokes about the profession of beggary. He sets out the panhandler's 'Three Rs': Respect, Responsibility, Religion; an appeal to all of these yields a gift. The wit comes from the moments when the gentry-class runaways try begging for themselves: 'troubled times indeed when mendicants plead in rhyming hexameters.' But the scope of Brome's joke extends not a titter further. The three-dozen cast are wonderfully manoeuvred around the stage by Stafford-Clark. Paul Jesson as Oldrents and Roger Frost as a hang 'em, flog 'em Justice lead the troupe, with Ron Clark as Springlove, 'young in years and ripe in goodness.' The hard-core of beggars, ably led by Lloyd Hutchinson, deliver some wonderful ensemble scenes, including a high-energy libidinous tribal dance. Other highlights are David Westhead's lugubrious Yorkshire bailiff, Sophie Okonedo's runaway bride, and James Connolly's beggar-actor. The excellent music (Ian Dury and Mickey Gallagher) shows how robust rhythms can give momentum to an evening, and Wayne Dowdeswell's lighting makes the most of a minimal set.

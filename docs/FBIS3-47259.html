The plan is part of moves by the government to practically  screen each and every military project before it decides the  defense budget, EPB officials said Monday.    The decision was apparently prompted by suspected  irregularities in the Yulgok project and a recent artillery  ammunition scandal. Public criticisms have been rising against  the misuses of taxpayers' money under the pretext of military  buildup.    In the past, the Defense Ministry asked for an annual budget  for the Yulgok projects without specifying in detail where it  was going to use the money. Because of the nature of the  projects, the military has maintained that they had to be kept  in secret.    From now on, however, all Yulgok projects are to be subject  to screening by budget compilers at the EPB, who will check the  need and soundness of each project. The Yulgok projects had  accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of the total defense  spending every year.    The Yulgok project, which was launched by President Pak  Chong-hui in 1974, had spent a total of 30 trillion won. Last  year's budget for the project amounted to 2.9 trillion won, or  31.6 percent of the entire national defense budget.    There are 148 projects, including the purchase of the Air  Force's next generation fighter plane and new tanks for the Army  and destroyers and submarines for the Navy.</p>

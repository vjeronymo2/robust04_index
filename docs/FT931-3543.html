			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Revival predicted for construction equipment AN UPTURN is in sight for the construction equipment industry after three consecutive years of 'devastating' decline, according to the Corporate Intelligence Group. Unit sales of construction equipment such as excavators, loaders and dumptrucks fell 3 per cent last year to 8,910, it said. Demand in unit terms was the lowest recorded for more than a decade - sales were barely a third of the peak of 22,544 units in 1988. The group said the mood of more than 40 leading equipment distributors and manufacturers interviewed last month was bleak 'with an overwhelming resentment against the government for doing so little to relieve the situation'. But, it said, there was a general consensus that the worst was behind the industry. Recovery would be patchy and slow to begin with, but demand should harden by mid-1993, resulting in a full year's increase of 21 per cent. The group said a number of factors supported its forecast: Interest rates are down to an acceptable level, and end-users can contemplate new purchases with realism. Good second-hand equipment is hard to find, with a significant proportion of the stock of used machines having been shipped overseas in the last two years. Machines sold at the peak of demand are coming up for renewal. Although the machines will not be replaced on a one-for-one basis, the trend will start to give some comfort to hard-pressed dealers. The group says demand will probably recover first from sales to the plant-hire sector, resulting in sales increases for backhoe loaders, smaller crawler excavators, mini-excavators and skid-steer loaders. Larger equipment types - rigid dumptrucks, heavier crawler excavators and bigger wheeled loaders - will be slower to recover. The forecast assumes that the government will do little more to stimulate the economy. If it does, and business confidence is partially restored, equipment demand could recover to 12,000 units next year, the group believes. Even that, however, is 20 per cent to 25 per cent below what it believes is a viable and profitable level of business.</p>

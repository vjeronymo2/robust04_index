			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During his official visit to the Republic of Poland  between 15 to 17 March, Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak held talks with Polish leaders to discuss ways of  promoting economic, trade, investment, scientific, and  technological cooperation as well as strengthening bilateral  relations in all fields. During the talks, Poland tried to find  ways of increasing its exports, particularly capital goods, to  Thailand to help reduce its trade deficit with Thailand. The  Thai side informed Poland that Thailand needs capital goods to  develop its infrastructure. However, Poland still lacks  experience in penetrating the Thai market and does not have good  access to market information on the private sector. The Thai  side is willing to help Poland in this.    The two sides agreed to increase their bilateral trade  volume  by setting up information centers. The two sides also discussed  the possibility of bartering capital goods. The Thai side  stressed that barter trade may be carried out for some products  on a reciprocal basis. Both sides agreed to hold a meeting of  the joint trade commission this year.    The Thai side also explained to Poland about the reduction  of  its defense budget and its need for military hardware. In this  regard, Poland might be able to sell its products to Thailand  for military training and agricultural purposes.    The two sides agreed to enter joint ventures to produce  goods  for export to third countries. In particular, there are  possibilities for setting up an aircraft factory in Thailand for  exports to Asian countries and for joint fishing and marine  product processing ventures. In addition, Poland may  participate in projects to build a communications network  linking Indochinese countries, the quadrangle economic  development project, and the south growth triangle project.  Thailand is willing to support Poland's participation in  economic and infrastructure development projects in the country  because Thailand still needs more new roads and an airport.</p>

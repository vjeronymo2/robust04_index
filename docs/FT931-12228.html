			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / People: Under-utilised at Sears John Lovering, who moved from the post of finance director at Sears to become managing director of corporate development and international operations last June, has now resigned to pursue other career opportunities. At the time, when 43-year-old Lovering was replaced as finance director by Stephen Park from Hanson, in a move that chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith now calls 'largely his (Lovering's) choice', he had said he wanted to take on a more operational job having been in the finance seat for four years. But Sears insiders acknowledge he had also regarded himself as a candidate for the chief executive's seat, which was taken by former BA marketing director Liam Strong a year ago. 'He felt his talents were not being utilised,' says Maitland Smith who explains that there has been a change of strategy, which involves concentrating fully on the UK and putting continental Europe 'not exactly on the back burner' but demoting it to part of the 'medium-term strategy'. Lovering will not be directly replaced. As finance director, he had been closely involved in setting up the joint venture between Sears' interests in the Netherlands with the German end of Groupe Andre, the French retailer. 'He loved travelling, visiting the outposts and motivating people,' says Maitland Smith, who adds that, with the slowdown in European consumer demand in addition to Sears' setting new domestic priorities, 'he found he was not doing very much.' ***** Peter Orchard, the chairman of security and bank note printers De La Rue, has died. Mr Orchard, 65, joined De La Rue in 1950 and was made a director in 1963. He became chief executive in 1977 and took over as chairman in 1987 from Sir Arthur Norman who had dominated the company for 23 years. He was also a director of Delta.</p>

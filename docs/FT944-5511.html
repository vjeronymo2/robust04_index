			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Housing upturn 'further delayed by Budget' The Budget has further delayed recovery in the housing market after prices continued to drift downwards or remain flat last month, the country's two biggest building societies said in surveys yesterday. Nationwide, the second largest society, said prices on average had fallen 2.7 per cent last month compared with October - the second largest monthly fall recorded by the society this year. It said the fall was due partly to seasonal factors. A better guide was the annual fall in prices of 0.6 per cent since November last year. Halifax, the biggest mortgage lender, which unlike Nationwide seasonally adjusts its figures, said prices had fallen just 0.1 per cent in November but had declined 1 per cent over the previous 12 months. The housing market traditionally starts to fall away in late autumn. The decline, however, appears to have begun earlier than usual in the past two years since the government moved the Budget to November with the market showing nerves in the run-up to it. Halifax and Nationwide said that this year's Budget had done little to lift the housing market out of the doldrums. They were particularly concerned about the potentially damaging impact on consumer confidence of the decision to limit entitlement to income support for homeowners who become unemployed. From next October new borrowers will be barred from claiming income support to cover mortgage interest payments for the first nine months. Mortgage benefits have also been scaled back for existing borrowers. Mr Gary Marsh of Halifax said the mortgage benefit measures had 'dealt another blow to a housing market already living in the shadow of higher borrowing costs'. Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, are due to meet next Wednesday for their latest discussion of base rates, now at 5.75 per cent, amid speculation that rates could rise another half point this month or next to guard against rising inflation. Both Halifax and Nationwide expect house prices on average to rise by little more than the rate of inflation next year. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said: 'House prices will show little change in 1994 as a whole. Affordability is excellent but concerns over unemployment continue to affect confidence and are holding back recovery. 'We continue to expect activity levels to improve next year but recovery in the housing market is dependent upon the strengthening of the wider economy. Against a background of generally low inflation, accompanying rises in house prices may be modest and heavily dependent on local conditions.' Halifax said: 'Generally speaking house prices in the UK remain broadly flat and any significant recovery is dependent upon improved consumer confidence.' According to the Halifax the average price of a UK home in November was Pounds 62,169 compared with Pounds 52,814 at Nationwide.</p>

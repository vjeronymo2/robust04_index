			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / White House to enter battle over education: State of Missouri contests desegregation plan The Clinton administration is to intervene in a Supreme Court battle over how much state governments can be held responsible for the wide disparities in educational achievement between black and white and rich and poor. Mr Drew Days, the solicitor-general, plans to file a brief on the side of parents and the local school district of Kansas City, Missouri, against a lawsuit brought by the state of Missouri seeking release from a costly court-ordered plan to desegregate its schools which has required it to put more money into schools in poor areas. At the heart of the case is an argument over how much the state has to do to prove it has reversed the effects of decades of racial segregation in schools: is it enough to spend Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 828m) on specialised 'magnet' schools drawing pupils with particular abilities or interests from outside their catchment areas and other educational facilities, complying literally with the court's orders, or must it also bring the test scores of black children in the district up to national levels to prove the success of the desegregation plan? The court decision is potentially far reaching, with more than 100 school districts under similar court orders. Mr Jeremiah Nixon, Missouri's attorney-general, is asking the Supreme Court to reverse a federal appeals court ruling which he argues departs from previous law by holding the state responsible for low student achievement levels. Justice department officials say the state must prove that it has done everything it reasonably could to ensure the success of the desegregation plan before it can be released from the court's supervision. The case, which is to be argued before the Supreme Court in January, is believed to be the first school desegregation case in which the Clinton administration has taken sides. The administration of former President George Bush generally sided with school boards seeking to be released from court-supervised desegregation plans. Responsibility for education in the US is delegated principally to the states and to 15,000 local school districts, which are massively uneven in funding and educational achievement. With no national curriculum or examination, high school graduation standards vary widely. A recent survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development criticised 'the extreme and unjustifiable disparity of service quality between affluent and poorer communities'. The Clinton administration is working with state governors to establish national educational standards under the 'Goals 2000' legislation signed earlier this year. But the federal government has little leverage to make states bring their poorer districts up to these standards. A 1973 Supreme Court decision that education was not a 'fundamental interest' means that the unequal distribution of education funding cannot in general be challenged under the US constitution, but racial equality laws do provide the federal government with the means to hold state governments to some standard.</p>

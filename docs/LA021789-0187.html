			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLD WEATHER FAILS TO CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE TO ORCHARDS  </P> <P> The record-breaking cold apparently did less damage to San Joaquin Valley  citrus orchards than had been expected, agricultural officials said today.  </P> <P> "It could have been disastrous and it's really too soon to tell for sure, but  it doesn't look like it's going to be as bad as we first expected," said a  spokesman in the Fresno County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.  </P> <P> He predicted that damage to the valley navel orange crop would be about 10% to  15% from the four days of temperatures that dropped into the high teens in some  valley areas last week.  </P> <P> Officials credited efforts by growers to ward off the freezing temperatures in  their orchards and the fact that the freeze happened in February for the lower  than expected damage.  </P> <P> Growers ran warm water through their orchards, burned fuel oil and dried peach  pits and operated wind machines.  </P></p>

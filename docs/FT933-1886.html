			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Major stresses Asian priority for Britain: Kevin Brown on Britain's role as 'best friend' AS MR John Major moved on yesterday from Japan to Malaysia, it was clear that the fuss in the UK over his leadership has obscured an important shift of emphasis in British relations with Asia. The UK prime minister went out of his way during the trip to stress the government's determination 'to give Asia a new place in our national priorities,' and even spoke of a 'special relationship' with Japan - a phrase historically associated with the US. 'Until the 1980s,' Mr Major said at a dinner with Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, 'we in Britain were frightened of your surging economic might.' Now, he said, the old barriers were down. At times, Mr Major's enthusiasm for things Japanese exceeded that of his hosts. He suggested, for example, that Japan could become a permanent member of an expanded United Nations Security Council as soon as it wished. The suggestion reflected Britain's increasing sympathy for Japanese international aspirations. Perhaps it was not Mr Major's fault that it was delivered at the very time that Japan is toning down its campaign for security council membership because of domestic opposition by pacifists. Nevertheless, Mr Major made his point. In case anyone should misunderstand, the message was rammed home by the highest-powered business delegation ever to leave British shores - including senior executives of a dozen leading companies such as GEC, British Telecom, British Gas, Rolls-Royce and Cable &amp; Wireless. Part of the presentation problem faced by the British party was that there were no attention-grabbing contracts to be announced, in contrast to Mr Major's last such trip, to India. Nevertheless, the trade element of the visit was judged more of a success than the much larger trade mission to Japan led last year by then US President George Bush, which was widely regarded as too large and overly aggressive. For example, Rolls-Royce, which powers most of Japan's maritime self-defence force, said the trip had provided a useful opportunity to lobby for an order worth up to Pounds 1.2bn over 20 years to supply engines for Japan Air Lines' new fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft. There were also signs of movement on improved access to the Japanese market for Britain's insurance, financial services and legal sectors. Guinness, the drinks group, said it hoped the trip would increase pressure on Japan to honour its Gatt commitment to equalise excise duties on domestic and imported spirits. The Japanese were pleased, too, by the British party's enthusiasm for inward investment and the prime minister's rejection of managed trade as a solution to the Pounds 5bn trade gap between the two countries. Mr Major's message that multilateral trade is 'good for everyone' was welcomed by Japan, as was his trenchant criticism of Washington's position on sectoral trading targets in US-Japan framework talks taking place in Hawaii. Mr Major was also given private assurances by Mr Hosokawa that Japan will seek to assist completion of the Uruguay round of Gatt negotiations in spite of the domestic political difficulties in liberalising its closed rice market. The friendly tone of the talks reflects in part the ideological compatibility of the British government and its six-week-old Japanese counterpart on issues such as deregulation, which both have made a policy priority. Underpinning the mutual warmth is an increasingly close economic relationship, which has more than doubled two-way trade from less than Pounds 5bn in 1984 to Pounds 9.7bn last year. However, the key element in the relationship is Japan's growing direct investment in the UK, which amounts to 40 per cent of such investment in the European Community. Mr Major made clear to the Japanese that Britain has none of the reservations about inward investment which have created tensions between Tokyo and Washington. Indeed, he lavished praise on the Japanese car factories in Britain, which he said had 'changed the way we work'. Mr Major did not say so, but businessmen and officials travelling with his party left little doubt Britain's objective is to cement its position as Japan's 'best friend' in the Community - a role that Tokyo appears content for London to play. Mr Major left open the details of how Britain's putative closer relationship with the rest of Asia will work, limiting himself to an offer to use British security council membership, military expertise and 'experience of conflict resolution' to assist Asian friends. Fittingly, however, for the leader of a country emerging from a serious recession, Mr Major's objectives appear to be largely trade-related. 'Already in the Asia-Pacific, Britain is the largest European investor, the largest European exporter of invisibles, and the second largest European exporter of goods. We shall do better,' he said.</p>

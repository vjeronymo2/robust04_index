These observers believe that the al-Ghubayri demonstration,  along with the regrettable and unjustifiable loss of life, which  accompanied it, was not the cause of the confrontational  posture, which Hizballah and all those who move in its circles  assumed. It was rather a product of that confrontational  posture, which all those who have been working with Hizballah  and those who have been striving to run it also assumed. [These  incidents] show, as the observers add, that grief or anger over  the loss of life was not the essence of the problem for those  who "burned their bridges." Nor was their attitude toward the  'Arafat-Israeli agreement the essence of the problem or the  reason for the sharp and hard-line positions that were taken and  expressed in the rhetoric of the previous hateful war. The  people who took those positions were trying to throw the country  once again into the gloom of internecine fighting and  divisiveness.    The essence of the problem, which uses the blood of victims  as its slogan, has to do with feelings of dread about the  countdown phase. Hizballah leaders fear that this phase might  have started and that its onset could signal the end of what the  party has been representing over the past years since it was  founded.    There are reasons for those feelings of dread, and the most  notable of them have to do with the new equations that are  emerging in the region. These equations do not show Hizballah  having the same regional prestige that it had over the past  years.    Another notable reason for those feelings of dread has to do  with developments in Lebanon under a state of peace. The  direction in which these developments are moving tends to  highlight the real magnitude of those forces that, like the  Lebanese forces for example, rode the wave of war in Lebanon and  appeared to be larger than they really were. Today, the Lebanese  Forces appear to be like one of the ordinary partisan Christian  forces, whereas in the past their prestige and influence made  them appear to be representing Christians in Lebanon.    This factor applies to Hizballah, too. In a state of peace  Hizballah cannot possibly represent more than 10 percent [of the  population] under the best of circumstances, particularly when  we learn that Hizballah pursues its activity among Shiites, and  most Shiites, like other sectarian groups in Lebanon, tend to  renounce the previous war in all its forms.    Another salient reason for those feelings of dread has to do  with Hizballah's brittle organizational and political makeup.  The tight, or rather rigid, form of that organization is  considered an indirect indication of the confluence of various  tendencies, each with its own nature, characteristics, and  interests. Hizballah's makeup is also considered an indication  of the fact that the party has brought together groups who are  dominated by pressure from Iran and driven by interests and  politics.    Other than those reasons for Hizballah's dread there are  other reasons that have to do with Iran. Iran is always sending  out signals indicating that it would soon abandon its support  for Hizballah, the party that was basically founded by Iran.  Hizballah has relied on the enormous financial assistance, that  it has been and is still receiving from Tehran. It is this  financial assistance, which enabled Hizballah to expand its base  and build and strengthen its agencies.    In this regard everyone remembers the statements made by  'Ali  Akbar Mohtashemi, Hizballah's founder and the former interior  minister of Iran. Mr. Mohtashemi, whose statements were critical  of Iran's policies, called upon Hizballah to be vigilant and to  reach beyond what the state of Iran was trying to forge in its  international relations.    All these feelings of dread came to a head the moment when  the 'Arafat-Israeli agreement was reached. It was a moment,  which suggested that doors leading to the resolution of issues  in the Arab-Israeli conflict were being opened. New conditions  would then ensue, and Hizballah would find no place for itself  under those new conditions. Hence, it became evident that  Hizballah was losing no time in its quest for a confrontation.  It was doing that by becoming the driving force behind what  happened during and after the al-Ghubayri demonstration. In  doing that, Hizballah is seeking guarantees for its survival.    AL-SHIRA' discusses in three articles in this issue these  designations for the feelings of dread, which are being felt in  Hizballah. The first and second articles, which are AL-SHIRA's,  discuss details, which have to do with the party, with the  positions of its leaders, and with the circumstances under that  the party acts. The third article, which is by Amir Taheri, was  published by our fellow newspaper, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT. That  article discusses the reality of Iranian politics today.</p>

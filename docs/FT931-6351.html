			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Housing bill and Britain's constitution Sir, My regard for the Conservative Party is much enhanced by its steadfast pursuit of the Housing Bill, albeit in a somewhat emasculated form, and notwithstanding the loss of the Duke of Westminster's support. The Duke wishes to use Britain's unwritten constitution as an impediment to change. It is in fact the opposite, for it permits parliament to update legislation in an orderly fashion, while restricting upheaval to the legislative chamber. The Grosvenors have a litigious record in both the British and the European courts. One would hope that the present Duke will not now set out to try to frustrate parliament's will by either further attacking the principle or searching for loopholes in the legislation. This can only create bitterness, expense, a modicum of delay and further legislation. George Donath, 37 Eaton Mews South, London SW1W 9HR</p>

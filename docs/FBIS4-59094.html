			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, May 8 (AFP) -- A nightly curfew has been  imposed on the Yemeni capital Sanaa which is also facing severe  fuel shortages, an evacuee who fled the city told AFP here.    The evacuee, who refused to be identified, said long queues  form daily at petrol stations and the public transport system  had been virtually brought to a standstill.    The curfew begins nightly at 9:00 p.m. until 5:00 a.m, after  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared a state of emergency  Thursday.    At night anti-aircraft salvos light up the sky searching out  attacking southern planes, which have launched several air raids  on the city, the Arab national said after landing on an  evacuation flight in Jordan.    He added that a total news black-out had been imposed since  fighting broke out four days ago between rival army forces, and  amid reports that southern troops had fired Scud missiles at the  capital.    He was not able to say whether there were any victims.    So far there has been no official casualty toll in the  fighting which erupted Thursday, but an Islamic party supporting  the president said Saturday 150 had died.    The evacuee was among 170 people, mainly UN personnel, flown  out of Sanaa Sunday to Amman on a special flight.    Hundreds of foreigners have fled the war which has pitted  Salih against his southern rival Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid.</p>

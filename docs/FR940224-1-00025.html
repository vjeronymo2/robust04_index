			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After careful evaluation of the comments and additional technical analysis, EPA determined that additional public notice to clarify certain key compliance issues and to modify certain proposed technical approaches would be beneficial. The next sections of this notice discuss the issues in question and request relevant comments from the public. EPA asks the public to focus their comments on the key areas discussed below. Comments on topics addressed in previous notices and comment periods will be treated as late communication to which EPA is not required to respond. The issues to be addressed are the following: (1) Timing of requirements for new F/FAs, (2) alternative testing requirements in lieu of Tier 2, (3) general emission generation methodology, (4) mileage accumulation for the testing of atypical F/FAs, and (5) base fuel specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Compliance-Related Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Timing of Requirements for New  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The registration requirements proposed in the April 1992 NPRM were organized within a three-tiered health effects evaluation structure. Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers would be required to perform a literature search on the health and welfare effects of  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FA emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide exposure information. Tier 2 would include short-term biological testing to screen for specific health effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals to the whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. After receipt and review of manufacturers' Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittals, EPA would determine, on a case-by-case basis, if additional testing were needed under Tier 3 to evaluate the risk of a particular F/FA (or group of F/FAs) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could include any emissions analysis, health effects, welfare effects, and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The organization of the F/FA program's requirements into hierarchical tiers was proposed, in part, to ensure that the rule would accommodate the goals of section 211(b) within the time restrictions of section 211(e). Section 211(e) requires that, for F/FAs registered as of the date of promulgation of the final rule, the ``requisite information'' be submitted to EPA within three years of that date. On the other hand, manufacturers seeking to register F/FA products after the date of promulgation would have to satisfy the testing requirements before registration would be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA judged that compliance with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements should be achievable within the three-year time limit for registered F/FAs; thus, these two tiers were proposed to be defined as the ``requisite information'' for registration pursuant to its authority under CAA section 211(e). However, maintenance of such registration would be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which EPA might impose pursuant to its authority under CAA section 211(b). For consistency, the same definition of ``requisite information'' and the same Tier 3 arrangements were proposed to apply to both currently registered and new F/FAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to maintain these originally proposed provisions in the case of currently registered F/FA products. Thus, for continued registration of such F/FAs, compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 must occur within three years of promulgation of the final rule. As proposed in the NPRM, this registration would be conditional on subsequent satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which might be prescribed by the Agency. This means that if Tier 3 testing were prescribed for a fuel or fuel additive product registered as of the time of promulgation, the registration would be extended for that time which EPA specifies as necessary for completion of the prescribed Tier 3 requirements. Only upon satisfactory completion of these requirements would re-registration occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of products for which manufacturers seek registration after promulgation of this rule, EPA is re-examining the appropriateness of the timing of these Tier 3 provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA interprets section 211(b) in conjunction with section 211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission products of such fuel or fuel additive ``causes, or contributes, to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise particular caution in registering new  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FA products that are significantly different from or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in scope or character from currently registered  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FA products. The potential health risks associated with the use of new F/FAs could be higher, lower, or the same as those of current F/FAs. Thus, before permitting the introduction of these products into the market, the Agency must have reasonable certainty that the public health consequences will not be made worse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clarification is therefore needed concerning what constitutes a ``new''  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FA. EPA believes it is appropriate to distinguish between two types of unregistered products which a manufacturer might seek to register after the promulgation of the final rule: (1)  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> F/FA products similar in composition and usage to those already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) F/FA products which differ significantly in composition and/or usage from such current products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

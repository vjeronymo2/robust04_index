			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY URGES USE OF SHORT-TERM THERAPIES FOR WOMEN'S DEPRESSION  </P> <P> New forms of psychotherapy lasting as little as 12 to 16 weeks are proving  increasingly effective in treating depressed women, according to a massive  study of women and depression that suggests that long-term therapy and years of  medication may not be necessary for many of the millions of American women who  suffer from the disorder.  </P> <P> The two-year study, preliminary results of which were presented Friday at the  annual meeting of the American Psychological Assn., confirmed previous findings  that women are twice as likely as men to experience diagnosable depression and  are three to five times as likely as men to attempt suicide.  </P> <P> "Women are especially vulnerable to depression, but new treatment technologies  report a success rate of 80% to 90% in providing at least initial, and  sometimes long-term, relief," said Ellen McGrath, chairman of the association's  task force on women and depression, which intends to release its findings in  full this fall.  </P> <P> According to McGrath, the task force found in reviewing recent research that  several forms of short-term therapy are well suited for treating women's  depression. On their own or in combination with each other or with  anti-depressant medication, the therapies offer at least temporary relief  within three to four months, the group contends.  </P> <P> One of those therapies, so-called interpersonal therapy, focuses narrowly on  current "interpersonal problems" such as grief or a dispute over a woman's role  in marriage. The emphasis on relationships makes the therapy especially  appropriate for women, who derive much of their identity and sense of  well-being from relationships, members of the task force said.  </P> <P> The group also called for wider use of cognitive therapy, which aims to correct  distorted thinking such as negative and pessimistic views of oneself and the  world; and behavioral treatments for depression, which aim to teach social  skills, problem-solving, assertiveness and other skills.  </P> <P> Robin Post, a clinical psychologist at the University of Colorado Health  Sciences Center and a member of the task force, said studies indicate that  those therapies have proven effective in as little as 8 to 16 weeks. However,  she said depression is often cyclical; about 20% to 45% of women who are helped  will experience a recurrence.  </P> <P> Post and others on the task force urged therapists to set up peer support  groups and "refresher courses" for graduates of short-term therapy. They said  it is important for women to understand that they can get relief from  depression without embarking upon a decade of psychotherapy and years on  anti-depressant drugs.  </P> <P> The task force, made up of nearly two dozen therapists in research and private  practice, began the study in response to accumulating evidence that depression  is increasing, particularly among women. Reviewing published and unpublished  data from studies on depression that included thousands of women, they  concluded that one in four women will suffer so-called major depression --  which goes beyond simple reaction to a specific life stress -- in her lifetime.  </P> <P> The group attributed the disproportionately high rate of depression among women  to a mix of social, biological and emotional factors. Those range from an  unequal burden of poverty that falls on women, to hormonal changes, to what  McGrath described as women's tendency to focus on depressed feelings "at the  expense of action and mastery strategies."  </P> <P> The group also made the following findings:  </P> <P> * The rate of sexual and physical abuse of girls and women appears to be higher  than previously thought. One study found that 37% of adult women had  experienced some form of physical or sexual abuse by the time they reached age  21, McGrath said.  </P> <P> * Married women are more likely to be depressed than single or divorced women  or widows, the group found. A woman in an unhappy marriage is three times more  likely than her husband to feel seriously depressed.  </P> <P> * Depression in women is misdiagnosed 30% to 50% of the time, sometimes as a  physical problem such as untreatable dementia. Nevertheless, women are  frequently prescribed powerful medication: 70% of all prescriptions for  anti-depressants go to women.  </P> <P> The task force called for therapists and counselors to learn, through  continuing or graduate education, more about the evolving short-term therapies.  The group said a mix of interpersonal therapy and cognitive and behavioral  approaches appears to be "one of the optimal treatments . . . for mild to  moderately depressed women."  </P> <P> Anti-depressants "are effective and even necessary in treating certain kinds of  depressions for women," the group reported. But they cautioned that the drugs  work differently for men and women and in some cases have not been tested  adequately in women before marketing.  </P></p>

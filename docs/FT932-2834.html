			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Goldman broke rules over Maxwell 'loans' WHEN Goldman Sachs, one of the most famous names in inter-ational merchant banking circles, was fined Pounds 160,000 by the UK Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body, it was the first formal censure of its activities in relation to the late Robert Maxwell. The fine was for violations of securities rules in transactions with Maxwell companies. Goldman Sachs was also ordered to pay costs estimated at around Pounds 125,000. The SFA did not conclude that Goldman or its personnel participated in or were aware of illicit conduct. The bank was a party in transactions which have been the subject of inquiries by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office. Goldman Sachs officials have said that the bank acted at all times in good faith and was unaware of possible irregularities. Yesterday's fine does not rule out further actions against the investment bank by the SFA or any other bodies. The SFA charges relate to three separate purchases of portfolios of securities, two of them from Maxwell-controlled fund managers which invested assets on behalf of pension scheme members. The third and most significant charge relates to the purchase of a block of securities from a company at the heart of Robert Maxwell's network of private companies. In each case, Goldman Sachs paid for the portfolios immediately, but did not receive all the securities until up to three months later, effectively providing a loan to Robert Maxwell. Goldman Sachs failed to record this practice properly, and to reflect it in its reports of its capital position to the SFA. In the third case, which occurred just months before Robert Maxwell's death, Goldman officials did not seek internal credit approval for the 'free payment'. Also in that case, Goldman Sachs Equity Securities (UK) 'for seven business days had a deficit in its regulatory capital ranging between Pounds 9m and Pounds 20m and submitted materially inaccurate information in its July (1991) monthly reporting statement,' to the SFA. The significance of the charges is that 'loans' occurred during a time when it is now known that Robert Maxwell's companies were becoming desperately short of cash. One of the questions raised by investigators is whether any of the banks which dealt with him in that period should have probed more deeply into his financial condition. For years before Robert Maxwell's death, Goldman Sachs was one of the main banks used by the 800-odd companies under his control. The bank was never formally appointed as an adviser but was extensively used by the Maxwell empire for trading currencies and shares. It was also one of the stock market's most prominent buyers of shares in Maxwell's two publicly quoted companies, Maxwell Communications Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers, in 1990 and early 1991. In late 1990 the bank bought a 'put option' in MCC shares from Robert Maxwell, giving it the right to sell a large block of shares to him later in the year. The stock exchange has investigated the transaction following complaints by investors that the deal was an attempt to support the share price, but cleared Goldman Sachs of improper action. In early 1991 the bank bought large stakes in overseas investments from Maxwell companies as they tried to raise cash. In the same period Goldman Sachs also bought MCC shares heavily in spite of a profits warning from MCC. In some of these deals it was acting on behalf of companies and trusts registered in Switzerland which were introduced to it by Robert Maxwell and which are now believed to have been controlled by him. These transactions are alleged to be part of a scheme to support MGN and MCC shares which has been under investigation by the SFO. In August 1991, Goldman Sachs revealed that it had failed to disclose stakes worth a total of Pounds 143m in MCC and MGN within the time required by the UK Companies Act. The bank has said that it regretted the omission. In the weeks before Robert Maxwell's death and in the days immediately afterwards, Goldman Sachs reduced its holding in MCC shares - it appears because of his failure to repay loans. The share sales led to a cooling of the relationship between Mr Maxwell and the bank.</p>

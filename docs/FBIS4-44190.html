			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "deu": "Green Offer for Scharping's Voters"] </F>   [Text] After their double-digit success in the European  elections, the Greens feel so confident about Bundestag  elections that they would even like to help the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] during the election campaign.  The best result for the Greens is useless if the Social  Democrats do not succeed in improving their chances  considerably. Thus, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer  instructed his colleagues at the Laender Council during the  weekend [25-26 June] to spare the SPD in the next few months.    Not so much to please their own supporters but to attract  Scharping's voters, the Greens are trying to get rid of the last  elements of their image as a middle-class nightmare. One liter  of gasoline should only cost five German marks once sufficient  three-liter cars are available. The withdrawal from NATO has  been postponed to the distant future, and everything that costs  money will be calculated carefully. This sounds like an appeal  to the floating voters of the center parties and seems to be  addressed to Scharping's supporters: Nobody should any longer  have to vote for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union out of fear of a coalition between the SPD and the Greens.  The message of the Laender Council of the Greens was that by no  means do the Greens want to be responsible if the Kohl  government should not be voted out of power on 16 October.    The following impression is strengthening: The more the  Greens orient themselves toward reality, the more social  democratic their programs become. In practice, the ecological  party has the task of forcing the SPD to implement its own  program. For the Greens, the alternative for 16 October is  clear: Kohl/Kinkel versus Scharping/Fischer, and "continuation  of the current situation" versus "change."</p>

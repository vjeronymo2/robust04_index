			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investors hope  that China will continue to deepen its reforms as an effort to  keep its economy on a healthy track, according to some  participants in the just-concluded 1994 China summit.    Representatives at the summit from well-known multinational  corporations stressed this point in their speeches.    Hubert Demestier from the Total oil company of France said  that the changing needs of the Chinese society resulted from the  development of its economy, its demands for energy were on the  rise, and the energy mix was also changing.    "As an international oil company having been active in Asia  for 40 years, Total has closely followed the gradual reform of  the Chinese economy," he said, adding that the company was the  first foreign oil company to find and develop oil in cooperation  with China in the South China Sea.    "We appreciate the quality of the Chinese industry and the  very high standards applied in oil exploration and production,"  he said.    Demestier pointed out that in order to keep the enthusiasm  of  foreign investors in the oil production field, the Chinese  Government should be flexible to optimize crude supply, refinery  operation and product sales.    Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine Investments Holdings  Company from Hong Kong, said that a period of growth in the  Chinese economy must call for a dramatic transformation of its  physical and financial infrastructure, and it is necessary for  China to invest heavily in its infrastructure now.    According to the forecast of the company, at least 230  billion U.S. dollars will be required in China between now and  the year 2000.    Tose pointed out that during the period, the domestic  capital  would account for 80 to 90 percent of the total investment, and  about 35-40 billion U.S. dollars would come from abroad.    In order to absorb foreign funds, he said, the allowed rates  of return in China should be competitive with those available  elsewhere.    "We believe that it would be wise to develop as large a role  as possible for portfolio investment in financing the deficits  China will see," he added.    Shanghai's history of being a cosmopolitan financial and  trade center along with recent developments such as the  launching of a bond futures contract make it a logical choice to  collect international and domestic funds and channel those funds  into infrastructure-related bonds and corporate bond issues,  Tose said.    Vincent Tan Chee Yioun, chief executive officer of the  Malaysian Berjaya group, said that the Chinese economy has  undergone tremendous growth and transformation and, coupled with  its huge population and land area, excellent and significant  business opportunities were available.    "It is in China's best interest to continue developing upon  its present policy," he said, adding that under the support of  the Malaysian Government, the group had earmarked a sum of 100  million U.S. dollars for direct investment in China.    "Being new in opening its economy to the world, China has a  very short `track record' for investors to ascertain likely  future policy direction," he said. "It is therefore more  critical for China to consciously demonstrate its long-term  desire to attract and retain foreign investors as partners in  China's development and modernization process."    T.T. Tsui, chairman of the New China Hongkong Capital  Limited  Company, said that in recent years, Hong Kong has invested  greatly on the mainland, and the investment from the mainland to  Hong Kong, which now reaches around 20 billion U.S. dollars, was  increasing significantly as well.    "The close relations between the two sides were set up on  the  basis of the achievement China had made over the last 15 years,"  he said. "Without reform and opening, the bilateral ties could  not develop so smoothly."    Overseas expansion of Chinese enterprises would be  inevitable  in the future, he said, adding that since the mainland companies  were familiar with Hong Kong, it was very natural for them to  increase their presence in the Hong Kong market.</p>

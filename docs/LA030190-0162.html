			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> MORTALITY: Efforts to reduce the U.S. infant mortality rate have faltered (A1),  but Orange County's figures are moving in the right direction. . . . Overall,  deaths per 1,000 live births dropped from 7.6 in 1987 to 6.8 in 1988, according  to the March of Dimes. . . . The "mortality gap" between white and black babies  also is reversed here, with white infants dying at a higher rate than blacks,  Latinos or Asians. Kristina Lindgren and Mark Pinsky  </P></p>

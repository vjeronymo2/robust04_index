			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Insurers move in on EU market Two of the UK's largest insurers - Scottish Amicable and Equitable Life - will today launch new European operations as part of plans to take advantage of the expected liberalisation of the continent's insurance market. Competition in the market is expected to increase in the wake of today's deadline for implementation of the European Union 'framework' directives, which allow insurers to sell home, motor and life insurance across national boundaries for the first time. Scottish Amicable European, based in Dublin, will become operational today, with the launch of products into the UK. These feature flexible, regular premium protection-based policies, and will benefit in terms of pricing from the differences in how life assurance is taxed in the rest of Europe compared with the UK. The company aims to start selling products in Germany early next year, said Mr Paul Bradshaw, chief executive. Equitable Life will launch UK-style life products in Germany, which will be sold alongside its range of traditional German policies by its direct sales force there. The legislation should be implemented in 10 of the EU's member states by the end of the year. Companies will be free to operate throughout the EU on the basis of a licence obtained from regulators in their home state. Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK are expected to have transposed the insurance directive into national law by the July 1 deadline, while Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Luxembourg would be ready by the end of the year, EU officials said. Spain and Greece are being allowed until December 31 1996 and December 31 1998 respectively to effect the changes. The greater competition ensuing as a result of the directive is expected to lead to lower prices, especially in traditionally more regulated markets such as Germany. Officials acknowledge, however, that differences in tax regimes of member states may restrict the impact of the directive. See Features</p>

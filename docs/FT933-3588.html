			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Carlton may buy into Independent publisher MR MICHAEL Green, chair-man of Carlton Communications, is interested in acquiring a stake in Newspaper Publishing, owners of The Independent and Independent on Sunday. Mr Green, who began his career in printing, would like to add newspapers to his television interests which include Carlton Television, holder of the London weekday ITV licence. The expression of interest from Mr Green, who is also chairman of Independent Television News, is being put in the context of trying to strengthen the opposition to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International and challenging Mr Murdoch's ability to set the media agenda in the UK. Carlton is only one of six potential investors who have expressed an interest in taking a stake in Newspaper Publishing. The others include Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, and Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Ian Hay Davidson, chairman of Newspaper Publishing has made it clear his first priority is to install a new chief executive before going ahead with a refinancing that could involve raising up to Pounds 20m. Carlton Communications would only seek a stake of around 30 per cent although a 'Conrad Black clause' would also be sought. Mr Conrad Black invested in the Daily Telegraph on condition that he would have right of first refusal on any further fund raising. As a result he won control of the Daily Telegraph.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Reasons for larger civil service not hard to find Sir, Your leader article 'Whitehall Farce' (November 6) falls well short of the FT's usual rigorously analytical approach. The reasons why civil service numbers have risen are not hard to find - higher unemployment needs more civil servants to administer benefit; the unprecedented size of the prison population does not keep itself behind bars; VAT on fuel will not collect itself, and paying it back to those who cannot afford it - some 5m people - will need thousands more civil servants to check and administer claims. Mrs Thatcher cut 100,000 jobs from the civil service, but the taxpayer still pays for the functions which were contracted out. The real cost of that exercise are revealed now when contracts are re-negotiated at well beyond the expected increases. But now there is no civil service alternative. Contractors may complain about favour to in-house bids, but civil servants complain about the government's dogmatic preference for the private sector above value for money for the taxpayer - as, for example, with the Capita vehicle licensing plates contract which costs Pounds 2m in the in-house bid. Mr Waldegrave's explanation for this was that even where the taxpayer could get work done more cheaply in the public sector 'it might be better done in the private sector'. Without explanation, this remark seems to contradict the claim that decisions are based on cost efficiency, and seems to have its roots more in the philosophical prejudices of the 1970s than the 1990s. The simple solution to this endless process of claim and counter-claim is to involve the National Audit Office in assessing bids received not only as regards costs, but also on value for money for quality of services provided. As to the old chestnut of open advertisement for top civil service jobs, we shall all be wiser when the Cabinet Office finally publishes the efficiency unit report. But open competition in itself will not provide for a less 'secretive' system. Some recent appointments have demonstrated that government ministers take decisions on appointments on the basis of undisclosed criteria, and sometimes in opposition to the interview panel's recommendation. Taxpayers end up footing the bill for enormously inflated private sector salaries. The crux of the issue is that system must be based on fair and open competition safeguarded by public scrutiny; it is therefore unlikely to bear much comparison with the private sector. The real issue about appointments at these levels is the threat of the politicisation of these jobs. It goes to the heart of the maintainence of a politically neutral civil service.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Stolpe faces renewed pressure to resign MR Manfred Stolpe, east Germany's most prominent politician, came under renewed pressure yesterday to resign as the Social Democratic (SPD) prime minister of Brandenburg state after new disclosures claimed he was an informer for the former Stasi state security police. Mr Eduard Lintner, the conservative state secretary in the Bonn Interior Ministry, called on Mr Stolpe to step down after an official report charged he informed on the Protestant Church for nearly 20 years. Mr Thomas Klein, head of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Brandenburg, part of a coalition under Mr Stolpe, called on him to step down. Mr Stolpe signalled he would take legal steps against the commission for creating a 'faulty chain' of circumstantial evidence. He did not deny his frequent meetings with the Stasi, but vigorously denied ever acting as an informer.</p>

He says, however, that Bosnia needs Indonesia's  diplomatic and political support more urgently. Speaking to  reporters after holding talks with Foreign Minister Ali Alatas  in Jakarta this afternoon, Haris Silajdzic said he deeply  appreciated the spirit of the volunteers. According to  Silajdzic, the spirit of the volunteers is important because it  reminds the Bosnians that they are not fighting alone. Bosnia,  however, more urgently needs the diplomatic and political  support of Indonesia as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement.  According to the prime minister, the Indonesian volunteers will  find it difficult to enter Bosnia because the country is in a  critical condition.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / People: Carr accelerates to find finance director for Amber Day Amber Day, the discount retailer which has been racked by boardroom ructions for the past year, has appointed Keith Paskins, 48, as finance director. Paskins is well known to Peter Carr, 52, an experienced retailer who took over as chairman of Amber Day in August. Paskins is a former finance director of Galerias Preciados, the Spanish stores group where Carr was chief executive from 1988-91. Before that Paskins worked on financial systems for the stores group Debenhams, where Carr was managing director. Carr says the Glasgow-based chain of 52 What Everyone Wants stores would benefit from Paskins' expertise, but adds: 'It's most important that he's a retailer first and then he's an accountant. It's rare to find an accountant with a merchant's attitude.' Paskins takes the role vacated by David Thompson, who become chief executive of the company last month after a boardroom tussle which saw the departure of Stacey Ellis as chairman only seven months after he joined the discount retailer in an attempt to rebuild its shattered credibility with the City. Thompson had been acting chief executive since the sudden departure last year of Philip Green, Amber Day's controversial chairman and chief executive.</p>

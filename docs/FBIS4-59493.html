			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ghawshah Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F> Hamas Will Not Use Violence Against Palestinian Autonmous  Authority"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas, has announced that its opposition to the  Palestinian autonomous authority in Gaza and Jericho will be  political, informational, and popular, and that it will never  use violence against it because all the violence will be aimed  at the Israeli Zionist occupation.    It said that the opposition circle has increased with some  of  the negotiation "pioneers" joining it, having been frustrated.    This came in a statement made by Hamas official spokesman  Ibrahim Ghawshah to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Amman. He said: The  members of the Palestinian police are our brothers and sons of  the Palestinian people and it is inconceivable in any  circumstances that the Palestinian police would confront their  own people.    But he added: If there are some sick minds who agree to  serve the Zionist occupation, the people inside [the occupied  territory] will know how to deal with them depending on the  circumstances arising from such behavior.    Hamas' official spokesman defined the mechanism for his  movement's political opposition in the coming phase under the  Palestinian autonomous authority as follows:    1. Expose and point out the loopholes, mistakes, and  drawbacks of the Cairo agreement.    2. Expose the Zionist hegemony over the autonomous  administration which began with the entry of the police forces.  The members of these forces were subjected to an inspection of  their arms and a baggage search, and they were issued with  identity cards by the occupation authorities.    3. Explain to all sectors of the Palestinian people that the  laws and regulations enforced in the [Gaza] Strip and Jericho  will be Zionist occupation laws and regulations and that any  amendment or modification will be subject to a certain mechanism  and subject to the approval of the Zionist authorities.    4. Explain that the Gaza-Jericho agreement places certain  unpatriotic commitments on the Palestinian authority. Hamas and  the Palestinian opposition will expose all these commitments one  by one, beginning with the undertaking distributed to the  detainees requiring them to renounce terrorism and accept the  Cairo agreement as a condition of their release, and ending with  the assertion that collaborators should not stand trial and  should not be harmed.    The Palestinian opposition, Ghawshah said, is currently  creating the broadest possible popular base in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip, and that base is growing every day on the  grounds of opposition to the agreement.    He noted that some of the "pioneers" of the Madrid  conference  and then the Washington conference, such as Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, and some of the Oslo "pioneers" such as Yasir  'Abd-al-Rabbuh of Fida [the Palestinian Democratic Union], and  the People's Party and some sectors of Fatah itself, have joined  the opposition. Some Fatah detainees refused to sign the  occupation's undertaking committing them to acceptance of the  Cairo agreement. Not only did they refuse to sign, they also  condemned the agreement.    Ghawshah stressed that Hamas is present everywhere and is a  skillful player on the Middle East chess board, and that it will  act at the right time in the interest of the Palestinian people.    He said that Hamas will not disappoint those who have placed  their confidence in it and will play its part fully in  continuing the jihad operations against the Zionist occupation.    The official spokesman refused to reveal Hamas' plan in that  respect but he said "we have made preparations."</p>

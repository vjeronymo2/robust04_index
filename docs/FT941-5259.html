			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / US grants will aid 'telecoms highway' The US Commerce Department yesterday took a step towards a US 'information superhighway' by announcing that Dollars 26m (Pounds 17.8m) in federal matching grants is available for telecommunications technologies for schools, hospitals and libraries. Mr Ron Brown, secretary of commerce, said his department would target those who needed help, thus avoiding pockets of 'information haves and have nots.' The department will provide up to 50 per cent of the cost for demonstration projects, which use diverse technologies and can serve as models for others, and planning grants. The funds could, for example, spur 'telemedicine,' allowing hospitals swiftly to exchange information, and 'remote learning' by making data available to rural schools. Mr Brown also attempted yesterday to head off a Republican assault on the National Competitiveness Act. The legislation funds two other Commerce Department schemes; the advanced technology programme, allowing grants for research and development of generic technologies, and the manufacturing extension partnership, to disseminate manufacturing advances in the country.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Chegarovskiy under the rubric </F> "Privatization-94": Somebody Must Leave"]    [Text] The "war of the edicts" between the Department  of Privatization and the Ministry of the Economy continues. The  duel began back in the spring of last year and by the time it  ended the ministry was left with the right to shoot. It took  advantage of this right by preparing in October and finally  approving on 5 January of this year the draft edict "On Measures  for Regulating the Reorganization of Enterprises During the  Process of Implementing the State Program for Privatization in  the Republic of Moldova During 1993-1994." As of 12 January the  draft had been okayed by the Procuracy of the Republic of  Moldova, the Ministry of Finance, the Commission on State  Control, the State Property Fund and, naturally, the Ministry of  Economics itself.    As you can see, consent has been given by all the interested  ministries and control organs; the only thing lacking is the  signature of Mircea Snegur, after which four pages of  typewritten text written by the bureaucratic hand will magically  be transformed into an edict of the president of the Republic of  Moldova. True, it has not been signed by another department  which also has something to do with privatization--the  department with the same name. But is a convict frequently asked  to consent to the sentence that is handed down? And the  aforementioned edict is nothing other than a sentence both for  the department itself and for the policy it has been  "implementing" during the past two years.    What are the chances that the edict will be signed by the  president and, as they say, "take effect on the day it is  signed"? The authors of the draft themselves estimate it as  50-50, but there are certain peculiarities that give reason to  think that they are either being modest or are afraid of  endangering their success. All preceding attempts on the part of  the department and the ministry (the first was to consolidate  their grip on the "heights" they had seized and the second was  to push their rival off from them) ended in mutual failure,  which largely suited the department as the defending side. Its  persistence was largely determined by the personality of the  leader and general director, Vissarion Cesuev. A pragmatist and  a romantic, a swindler and practically a holy man prepared for  self-sacrifice--this is how he is described by people from the  "interested ministries and control organs." Today he is included  on the election list of the SDPM [Social Democratic Party of  Moldova] and, as a member of the coordinating council of this  party, is among the top 10. He would be assured a place in the  future parliament, but even before 27 February, according to the  Law "On Elections," he would have to temporarily resign from his  position as director and go on leave. In any case the department  would lose its support and its banner. And it feels like a  football team whose star goalkeeper has been injured and there  is nobody to replace him. Moreover, there are very persistent  rumors that are very close to the truth saying that the  president's edict on firing Cesuev has already been prepared.  This edict is also lacking the president's signature.    The second peculiarity is also closely linked to the  elections. The defeat of the department is above all a blow to  the Social Democratic Party, and since this blow was prepared  for in the government, one automatically recalls that  practically all the government leaders (the prime minister and  two of his deputies) ran for parliament on the ADPM [Agrarian  Democratic Party of Moldova] slate.    The department, of course, has protection, and it is not  weak. Money for its activity is allotted by the International  Monetary Fund and other foreign investors. Here, true, an  interesting question arises: How does the IMF use its credit to  keep afloat a department whose activity is considered illegal in  the homeland. After all, the republic procuracy approved (and  not for the first time) a draft of the edict which contains the  following: "A situation has developed whereby a considerable  share of state property has been illegally transferred to  entrepreneurial structures, a channel has been opened for  illegal use and acquisition of state property, members of labor  collectives are being deluded regarding the promised shares and  dividends...." Let me repeat once again that the edict has not  yet been signed by the president and we do not know whether it  will be signed at all, but the procuracy has signed it!    Measures for eliminating the "situation that has developed"  /  which developed "...on the initiative of the State Department on  Privatization..."/, [punctuation as published] according to the  edict, will be severe: forced opening of closed joint-stock  companies; a ban on the reorganization into joint-stock  companies with mixed capital of enterprises that are subject to  privatization; the return to members of labor collectives and  legal entities of monetary funds previously attracted for  facilities that are valued at up to 1 billion rubles; the  introduction of essential changes in the founding documents of  hundreds of joint-stock companies in order to "return" them to  the list of state-owned facilities offered for privatization for  BND [certifications of national wealth] during 1993-1994; the  declaration of documents of joint-stock companies that have not  made these changes to be invalid, and so forth. Taken together  these measures call an abrupt halt to everything that was done  by the department in the sphere of the creation of joint-stock  companies and throw the process of privatization back to 1991.    Privatization is in danger. All of last year and the  beginning of this year proceeded under this slogan. They are  whispering about it in waiting lines, discussing it openly in  the government, and shouting about it in the department. What  danger can threaten a cause that has so many supporters? It is  simply that in the waiting lines, in the government, and in the  rebellious department there is no common viewpoint either on  privatization or on the danger that threatens it. We are  learning patience. The waiting line is not moving--someone must  leave.</p>

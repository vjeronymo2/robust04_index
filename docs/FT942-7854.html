			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Jailed executives cleared over exports to Iraq Two executives jailed three years ago for exporting parts capable of being used in Iraq's nuclear programme were cleared by the Court of Appeal yesterday. The judges will give reasons for their ruling tomorrow but their decision came after defence lawyers argued that a misdirection to the jury by the trial judge had led to a miscarriage of justice. During the trial at the Old Bailey in June 1991 the Crown claimed that Mr Ali Ashour Daghir and Ms Jeanine Speckman, directors of the Surrey-based company Euromac, conspired to export electrical capacitors which could be used as triggers for nuclear bombs. Mr Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Daghir and Ms Speckman, argued that trial judge Mr Neil Denison gave jurors the impression they could still convict if they found the electrical capacitors were for non-nuclear military use. This was a 'material defect' in the summing up because the prosecution had 'nailed its case to the nuclear mast', the Court of Appeal heard. Yesterday's decision was a big setback for UK and US Customs officials who had claimed after the conviction of the two executives that their 18-month joint investigation had foiled Iraq's attempts to build up its nuclear programme. In recent weeks UK Customs investigators have been subjected to intense scrutiny at the arms-for-Iraq inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Scott. One senior UK Customs investigator involved in the case said last night: 'This is a body blow. Let's not make any bones about it.' Investigators claimed to be taking some comfort that the decision appeared to hinge on a narrow judicial argument. But lawyers for Mr Daghir and Ms Speckman said the case raised serious questions about high-level political involvement, and the extent to which the arrest and publicity surrounding the trial had served political interests. The investigation into Euromac involved an elaborate undercover operation, with Customs officers posing as willing agents in the smuggling effort. The operation - code-named Argus  - employed some controversial techniques used in US 'sting' operations which are not usually approved by the UK government. Mr Daghir was jailed for five years but bailed pending appeal after serving 15 months. Ms Speckman served an 18-month sentence. Both are planning to claim compensation. In evidence to the Scott inquiry last December, former prime minister Baroness Thatcher said she had taken a 'particular interest' in nuclear capacitors. She told the inquiry that 'Customs had, in fact, done a very skilled piece of work' in the Euromac case.</p>

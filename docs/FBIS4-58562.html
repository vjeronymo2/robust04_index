			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jericho Mayor Jamil Khalaf, in </F> Jericho, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, on 5 May; from the  "Dialogue From Afar" program --recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] As we begin this dialogue we would  like you to give us an idea of the feelings of the Palestinian  public, specifically in Jericho, toward the agreement signed in  Cairo yesterday.    [Khalaf] The Palestinian people in Jericho were in a state  of  great joy. They raised flags. The boy scouts beat drums and  blew trumpets. The whole Palestinian people in Jericho were  very joyful.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do the Palestinian people view the  future?    [Khalaf] This agreement is a historic step after the signing  [of the Declaration of Principles] on 13 September 1993 in  Washington. This particular step marks the beginning of the  first phase in the life of the Palestinian people. For the  first time, the Palestinian people will govern themselves  through self-rule in Jericho and Gaza. The area is not  insignificant. It has a population of approximately 1 million.  This is an important and historic step in the life of the  Palestinian people. We hope and implore God that it will be a  good and constructive step toward establishing peace in the  whole region.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Differences centered on the Jericho area.  What agreement has been reached regarding the size of the  Jericho area?    [Khalaf] There are promises. As we understand it, there is a  promise by the U.S. secretary of state. There should be no  differences over the border. The important thing is that the  self-rule plan in the two areas was signed. This is very  important for the Palestinian people. The borders will be in  accordance with the agreement and the peace plan signed by  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Won't a new phase begin that will require  the  Palestinian and Israeli sides to deal with each other?    [Khalaf] During the current phase the areas must be opened  up  so that Palestinian citizens will enjoy a kind of prosperity.  In the period preceding the talks the areas were closed. This  closure caused great hardship for the Palestinian citizens and a  recession in the Palestinian economy. We hope that the means of  livelihood will be opened for the Palestinian people so that  their economy will thrive. Economy is the most important thing  in the people's life. We hope there will be aid and mutual  economic cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli  peoples. Naturally, we need foreign aid from the European  Union, the World Bank, the United States, and other foreign and  Arab states. Over 27 years the Israeli and Palestinian  economies have merged. It is difficult now to separate the  Israeli economy from the Palestinian economy. This separation  will take much time. But now there are direct trade dealings  and contacts between the Israeli and Palestinian economies. It  is difficult to stop or reduce these dealings. The Palestinian  people must feel there is economic prosperity and an increase in  their income.    The Jericho area is an agricultural and tourist area. We  must export our goods to other towns, including Israeli towns.  We do not have factories or plants. We have agriculture.  Jericho is the agricultural capital of the Jordan valley.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Are there preparations in Jericho and the  occupied Palestinian territories to receive the Palestinian  national authority?    [Khalaf] Yes, we are awaiting the arrival of our Palestinian  brothers [from abroad]. We are one family and one people. We  are waiting impatiently for the arrival of our brother  Palestinians who will take over authority and establish law and  order. This is the most important step in our life.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] As we end this dialogue, we thank you. We  always welcome you to the Voice of the Arabs.    [Khalaf] I thank President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for his  titanic efforts. I also thank the Egyptian people for receiving  the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and for their efforts toward  establishing peace in the region.</p>

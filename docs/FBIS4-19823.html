			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] Articles reporting on the popularity of  the government and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur continue to  appear in the French press.  <H5>  "Secret" Survey </H5>   According to Catherine Pegard writing in the 9 April Paris  weekly LE POINT, a large-scale "secret" survey is being  conducted nationwide by the Central Office for Polling and  Statistics on behalf of the Renseignements Generaux (RG)  following a request by Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua.  According to Pegard, Balladur is the survey's principal theme.  Out of 32 questions included in the survey, Pegard cites the  following:    "Do you believe that Edouard Balladur is presently carrying  out an in-depth course of action aimed at preparing France for  the future, or a limited course of action aimed at preparing the  presidential elections?"    "Can you tell me if you agree or disagree with the following  opinions?    --"Edouard Balladur's government is right in proceeding  prudently, for French society is fragile.    --"Edouard Balladur's government is carrying out an in-depth  course of action by preparing the foundation for our country's  recovery.    -- "Sometimes the government meets with obstacles. This was  to be expected. Everything will be simpler after the  presidential elections.    -- "No other policy but Balladur's is possible. No one could  do better.    --"The government is doing all it can under difficult  circumstances. One must be patient and trusting.    --"The situation is more serious than it is admitted, and  the  government has not sufficiently taken into account the realities  and problems of the French people."    According to Pegard, the survey also includes a series of  questions related to political figures such as Balladur,  potential presidential candidate Raymond Barre, Rally for the  Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, Union for French Democracy  (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, EU Commission President  Jacques Delors, Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, Minister  of Interior Charles Pasqua, National Front (FN) leader  Jean-Marie Le Pen, Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard,  and President of the National Assembly Philippe Seguin. The  survey seeks to determine the degree of "trust" they inspire in  solving problems ranging from unemployment to morals, societal  cohesion, and AIDS.  <H5>  Poll Results </H5>   The 7 April Paris weekly PARIS MATCH published the results  of  a BVA poll conducted on 18-19 March on behalf of PARIS MATCH,  France 2, France 3, Europe 1 and the daily newspaper LIBERATION  among a representative sample of 968 individuals over 18.  Respondents were asked to answer the following questions:    "I will cite the names of the principal ministers in Edouard  Balladur's government. Can you tell me which are the five  ministers whose course of action you liked the most in the past  year?"    Some 61 percent chose Charles Pasqua, 45 percent chose  Minister of Social Affairs Simone Veil, 42 percent Minister of  Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe, 41 percent Minister of Defense  Francois Leotard, and 25 percent Minister of the Budget Nicolas  Sarkozy. A number of other ministers obtained scores below 25  percent.    "Out of the following personalities, tell me who, in your  opinion, would have obtained better results, worse results, or  results comparable to Balladur's if appointed prime minister."    Some 23 percent said Pasqua would have obtained "better  results," 33 percent "worse results," 41 percent "comparable,"  and 3 percent did not know.    Twenty-two percent said Raymond Barre would have obtained  "better results," 35 percent "worse results," 42 percent  "comparable," and 1 percent did not know.    Fifteen percent said Chirac would have obtained "better  results," 39 percent "worse results," 44 percent "comparable,"  and 2 percent did not know.

Some 11 percent said Valery Giscard d'Estaing would have  obtained "better results," 53 percent "worse results," 34  percent "comparable," and 2 percent did not know.    "In the next few months, do you want Balladur's government  to...."    Follow the same economic policy: 36 percent    Change its economic policy: 61 percent    Do not know: 3 percent    "With regard to fighting unemployment, when do you think it  would be possible to determine the success or failure of  Balladur's policy?"    Right now: 14 percent    At the end of 1994: 22 percent    In March 1995, after two years of government action: 59  percent    Later: 4 percent    Do not know: 1 percent.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / 'On arrival 152 of the sheep are dead': Ferry company pledges to curb the transport of livestock have raised suspicions A consignment of 240 calves spend more than 45 hours locked in a Dutch truck travelling from Limerick in Ireland, via Dover, to Barcelona in Spain. Their journey is broken just once, when they are unloaded and loaded again in 90 minutes. Another Dutch truck carrying 450 English sheep leaves Dover for the Netherlands. Four days later the same consignment crosses by boat in soaring temperatures from the Italian port of Brindisi to Igoumenitsa in Greece. On arrival, 152 of the sheep are dead. Cases like these, cited by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have spurred British ferry companies into pledging curbs on the transport of livestock. P&amp;O, which has about 60 per cent of the cross-Channel freight market, said last month it would stop carrying animals for slaughter from October unless European agriculture ministers agreed immediate improvements in journey times and conditions and a 'viable' enforcement regime. Brittany Ferries, which has about 10 per cent of the market, announced last week that from next Monday it would not carry on its cross-Channel and Spanish routes animals going straight to slaughter. The moves were welcomed by the RSPCA, which wants the European Union maximum journey time of 24 hours without food, water or rest to be cut to eight hours. Mr Mark Ranson, the society's senior scientific officer, asked: 'Why do you need to take an animal from the top of Scotland all the way to Spain for slaughter?' Public feeling runs high on the subject. An RSPCA survey last September found that 65 per cent of Britons backed the eight-hour limit. Earlier this summer Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister and a campaigner against cruelty to animals,joined calls by animal-rights groups for a boycott of ferry companies carrying livestock for slaughter. But EU member states cannot agree on a change in the rules. While Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands support an eight-hour journey limit, southern EU countries are not keen on any limits. In June, agriculture ministers failed to reach agreement on a Greek compromise that would have reduced the 24-hour limit to 22 hours. Britain, which has an internal 15-hour limit, joined other northern EU states in blocking the plan in the hope of a better deal at the next meeting in September, which will be held under the German presidency. British livestock farmers, already suffering from European restrictions on beef exports because of BSE - 'mad cow disease' - feel the ferry companies are unfairly penalising them. They are supported by Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, who said: 'Those urging precipitate action would do nothing to protect travelling animals in the long term and would impose an immediate damaging effect on a trade already going through a difficult period.' Britain exports 2m sheep worth Pounds 65m each year, mainly for slaughter in France, according to the Meat and Livestock Commission. About 500,000 calves worth Pounds 95m are sent for veal or breeding, mostly to Belgium and Holland. Mr Richard Beale, chairman of the Association of Livestock Exporters, said the ferry companies were motivated by commercial considerations. 'They've looked at losing the slaughter trade versus losing public opinion,' he said. 'They're in a desperate battle now with the Channel tunnel.' The ferry companies are also at odds with each other. P&amp;O described Brittany Ferries' announcement as 'a bit of a whitewash' because it plans to ban only animals being transported direct to abattoirs, not those that are first fattened for slaughter. According to P&amp;O: 'Ninety-five per cent of animals leaving the UK are not slaughtered straightaway but fattened up first.' Stena Sealink, P&amp;O's main competitor, hit out at both companies, accusing them of 'making qualified statements for the PR value'. The company said it would make a 'definitive statement' on its position by the end of August. Sealink warned that exporters would charter ships if the ferry companies barred them. 'You're going to have third class ships with third class crews and conditions for animals will deteriorate.' It added that picking and choosing customers, especially if they were not breaking any rules, was 'a dangerous and slippery slope'. If the ferry companies were to agree a joint ban, it would not be bad news for every sector of the UK livestock trade. The leather and tanning industry would benefit from more animals being slaughtered in the UK. Abattoirs, suffering from overcapacity, would welcome the extra work. Mr Peter Scott, general secretary of the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers, said: 'We would rather animals went abroad in carcass form, not only on economic grounds for ourselves but also on welfare grounds. Animals that are stressed and frightened make rotten meat.'</p>

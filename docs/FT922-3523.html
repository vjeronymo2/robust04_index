			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / People: Back to business Howell Harris Hughes, the last of the outgoing members of the Prime Minister's Downing Street policy unit, has resurfaced as deputy chairman designate of Cantrade Investment Management. Hughes, a former partner of Phillips &amp; Drew, was recruited to the policy unit at the start of 1989 by Professor (now Lord) Brian Griffiths. He was involved primarily on Department of Trade and Industry issues and his responsibilities have now been passed on to David Poole, the James Capel director who joined the policy unit last month. By joining Cantrade Investment Management, the newly-formed investment arm of Switzerland's Bank Cantrade, 48-year-old Hughes is returning to his old stamping ground of non-pension fund investment management. He joined P &amp; D in 1967 and rose to head the part of the business which specialised in non-pension fund business. P &amp; D is now part of the Union Bank of Switzerland empire as is Bank Cantrade. Cantrade Investment Management, formed around the basis of the old CS Investment Management, has Pounds 1.3bn of funds under management and services a different part of the market from the much bigger Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management. Hughes' appointment means that all the old members of the policy unit have now found new jobs. Jonathan Hill, who worked for Jacob Rothschild and Hamish Hamilton before joining the policy unit, replaced Judith Chaplin as the Prime Minister's political secretary in March. Civil servant John Mills has been appointed the new director of consumer affairs at the Office of Fair Trading, and Caroline Sinclair, a former Treasury official, has moved to the Home Office. ***** Jeremy Logie (above), formerly md of BAA Hotels, is chief executive of the HOTEL CATERING AND INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. ***** Air Chief Marshal Sir David Parry-Evans will be the new chief commander of ST JOHN AMBULANCE. ***** Robert Drummond, chief executive of Grosvenor Venture Managers, becomes chairman of the BRITISH VENTURE CAPITAL ASSOCIATION. ***** Angela Browning MP is parliamentary adviser to the INSTITUTE OF SALES &amp; MARKETING MANAGEMENT.</p>

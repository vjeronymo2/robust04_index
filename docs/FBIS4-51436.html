			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 25 May, Jiang Chunyun, secretary  of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech at the  study meeting sponsored by the central study group under the  provincial party committee. In his speech he put forward that  to meet the demand of establishing the systems of socialist  market economy, we should further enhance studies in the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; in the  theories of socialist market economy; and in basic knowledge and  the knowledge of modern science and technology. We should also  upgrade the consciousness of implementing the party's basic line  and improve the capability of participating in and having the  socialist market economy well in hand.    From 24 to 25 May, the central study group under the  provincial party committee concentrated its efforts on studying  the viewpoint of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to  emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts and the  viewpoint in which the essence of socialism is to emancipate and  develop productive forces. At the same time, the group, by  bearing the province's reality in its mind, discussed the issues  of shifting the business mechanism of enterprises; establishing  modern enterprise systems; and accelerating the economic  development; in line with the ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping  with regard to deepening the reform and broadening the opening  up. The central study group also heard the special-topic report  given by Hong Hu, vice minister of restructuring economy, with  regard to establishing modern enterprise systems.    In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: The works of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping and particularly the Third Volume of Deng Xiaoping's  Selected Works represent the great and important development of  Marxism and the scientific system of theories. In his works,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping gives scientific, clear, accurate, and  meticulous expositions to the issues of what is of socialism and  how to build socialism from theories to practice. These  expositions have dealt with a series of important problems faced  by the party in leading the cause of building socialism.  Currently, there are many issues that are worth being studied  by us. Of these issues, a prominent one is to implement the  resolution adopted at the 14th CPC Congress with regard to  establishing the systems of socialist market economy and turning  the traditional planned economy into a market one. Successful  transformation of the economy will enable full exposure of the  superiority of socialism, reinforcement of national strength,  and enrichment of the people's wealth.</p>

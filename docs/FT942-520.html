			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Brazil and Sweden through - Salenko sets goal record Romario scored a stunning, solo equalising goal at the Silverdome in Detroit to ensure Brazil finished top of Group B last night after a 1-1 draw with second-place Sweden. Kennet Andersson's 24th-minute goal was the first the Brazilians had conceded in the tournament but both teams comfortably qualified for the second round. In the other Group B game, Oleg Salenko scored a record five goals as Russia crushed Cameroon 6-1 in San Francisco to give them a chance of going through as a third-place finisher. Salenko struck in the 16th, 41st, 45th, 73rd and 75th minutes - all five goals with his right foot - making him the first player to score five goals in one game at the World Cup finals. The previous best, shared by nine players, was four goals: most recently by Spain's Emilio Butragueno against Denmark in the 1986 finals. Dmitri Radchenko added Russia's sixth in the 82nd minute. Even a goal by 42-year-old Roger Milla with his first touch as a second-half substitute was not enough to inspire Cameroon's Lions, who finished bottom on one point and were eliminated.</p>

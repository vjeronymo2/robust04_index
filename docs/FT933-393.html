			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The final salary scheme may face retirement Britain's pensions industry is holding its breath ahead of tomorrow's report from the Goode Committee. When Robert Maxwell ran off with the Mirror Group's pension assets his worst crime may have been to ensure that occupational pension schemes would become buried in extra cost and regulation. At stake is the future of the final salary scheme, known in best American jargon as a defined benefit plan. Under this system the sponsoring organisation shoulders most of the investment risk in exchange for control of the design and running of the scheme. The alternative structure, defined contribution, seeks to offload the investment risk on to the scheme member, who has no clear idea of what his share of the fund will be worth on his retirement day, nor of the size of the annuity that the money will then buy. Fund management companies are on red alert. They would require a drastic change in both business strategy and investment style to cope with the quite different demands of defined contribution schemes, where the hopes and fears of the individual members are paramount, and finance directors count for little. It may never happen. Certainly, there has been no substantial shift in existing schemes to the defined contribution approach in the UK so far. But Goode could provide a welcome excuse for many companies. They might reckon that after a long period of unsustainably good investment returns (15 per cent a year for the average UK scheme over the past 15 years) this could be an ideal moment to draw a line under the final salary-linking promise. In the US the move away from defined benefits has been rapid. According to the Greenwich Associates survey of large US pension schemes, corporate defined benefit plans have a negative cash flow of more than Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.4bn) a year and assets of defined contribution schemes have climbed from 27 to 35 per cent of the corporate plan aggregate in four years. Responsibilities cannot be shed quite so easily, however. In the UK, at any rate, employers know that if the investments in a defined contribution scheme go wrong they will still come under pressure to perform a rescue act. Investment houses are therefore busily devising investment products and strategies which they hope will meet the emerging need for both high returns and low volatility. Life assurance companies used to think they had the answer in the shape of with-profits plans, which are still used in personal pensions and small corporate schemes. However, the with-profits formula has come unstuck. Traditionally based upon fixed-interest portfolios, it has been adapted to equity investment only with difficulty, and the large element of volatile terminal bonuses in the pay-out (sometimes as much as 50 per cent) has destroyed the predictability which used to be the attraction. Mercury Asset Management, leader in the defined benefit market, has launched a Guaranteed Fund as the answer for the defined contribution sector. When making contributions trustees can select dates, probably linked to members' retirement plans, at which guaranteed values will apply. These values will rise year by year if the equity market goes up. One of the life companies, Provident Mutual, some years ago abandoned the with-profits approach in favour of a new formula called the pension assured fund, which is now worth more than Pounds 600m. The value of units cannot go down, and so the benefits are reasonably predictable as retirement approaches, although the retirement date has to be chosen at the outset. Elsewhere, Kleinwort Benson Investment Management is launching the Pension Protection Portfolio, which covers both the annuity and equity market risks. It is basically a portfolio indexed to long-dated gilt-edged securities, but beefed up by the purchase of options which will capture equity market performance when this is positive. No doubt many more products will appear if the market shifts in the direction of defined contribution. Some will work, but in other cases unlucky trustees (and perhaps beneficiaries too) will discover the black boxes fail to yield their promised magic, due to unforeseeable circumstances. In searching for the best of all worlds we may encounter defined retribution.</p>

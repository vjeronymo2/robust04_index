			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Georgiade et al. (Ref. 15) evaluated the effectiveness of two povidone-iodine formulations for use in the preoperative skin preparation of 150 subjects scheduled for elective surgical procedures. An initial sample for culture was taken from the unbroken skin of the operation site prior to the use of the formulations, and a baseline bacterial count was determined. Sampling was by a cup scrubbing method, using a sterile wash solution that incorporated a neutralizer. The operative site was then gently treated for 5 minutes with a povidone-iodine surgical scrub formulation and allowed to dry. Following the initial disinfection, a povidone-iodine antiseptic solution was evenly applied to the site and allowed to dry. The sample site was rinsed with sterile water and a second sample for culture was done. Upon completion of surgical procedures lasting from 30 to 180 minutes, the sample site was again cultured and sterile dressings were applied. The reported mean post-scrub reduction in the baseline number of bacteria of the sample site was 30,599 (4.5 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction). This reduction was maintained through the surgery as evidenced by the reported post-operative mean reduction of 30,613 organisms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vorherr, Vorherr, and Moss (Ref. 16) compared three antiseptic preparations (including 10 percent povidone-iodine), in 150 female subjects (50 to each preparation) for effectiveness in reducing the numbers of bacteria in the perineum and groin. The mean log reductions in bacteria after skin preparation with povidone-iodine at 10 minutes and 3 hours, respectively, were reported as 3.65/3.09 for the perineum and 3.42/2.85 for the groin. Another study by Dzubow et al. (Ref. 17) evaluated three antiseptic skin preparations frequently used for dermatologic surgical procedures. A 60-second wipe with 1-percent povidone- iodine was performed in 14 subjects after which aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken at 5 and 60 minutes. The aerobic flora were reduced by 2.8 and 2.5 log at 5 and 60 minutes, respectively. The reduction in anaerobic flora was reported to be 1.7 log at 5 minutes and 1.2 log at 60 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leaper, Lewis, and Speller (Ref. 18) compared the effectiveness of povidone-iodine impregnated drapes, povidone- iodine with a sterile drape, and conventional preoperative skin preparation with povidone-iodine for the reduction of skin bacteria. Forty-five subjects scheduled to undergo elective groin surgery were randomized to one of the three treatments. Impression plates and skin swabs were taken immediately before and after surgery, and swabs were taken before and after skin incision and closure. Conventional preoperative skin prepping with povidone-iodine produced the greatest reduction of the bacterial flora (240 colony counts to 34 colony counts, 2.3 log <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Duignan and Lowe (Ref. 19) studied the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for reducing pathogenic bacteria in the vagina. A 1:10 solution of a povidone-iodine formulation containing 0.75 percent available free iodine was instilled into the vagina of 35 subjects and left in situ for 1 to 3 minutes. Aspirate cultures were taken from the vagina before and after preoperative disinfection and subcultured into thioglycollate broth containing neutralizers. Povidone-iodine removed 92 percent of the bacteroides species, anaerobic streptococci, gram negative bacilli, and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Streptococcus pyogenes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  present prior to the preoperative disinfection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

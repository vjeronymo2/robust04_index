			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Price of car parts may rise under Brussels proposals European car owners may be forced to pay higher prices for spare parts and be banned from shopping around for better deals under European Commission proposals to harmonise rules governing the legal protection of industrial design. The Commission's plans will insist that certain car body parts be legally protected for the first three years after a car is launched, giving the manufacturers the exclusive right to supply spares during that period. Consumers and independent suppliers fear the proposals will stifle competition and allow car manufacturers to charge what they wish for windscreens, panels, headlamps and other parts. The UK has a free market in the supply of spare parts for repairs. This contrasts with countries such as France, which uses copyright law to protect carmakers from the competition of independent suppliers. The Commission, under pressure from powerful carmakers on one side, and consumer groups and independent suppliers on the other, has come up with the three-year compromise plan as part of a wider initiative to harmonise rules covering the legal protection of industrial design. These rules differ greatly across the 12 EU member states. In the proposals, the Commission argues that many car parts, such as windscreens, are unlikely to qualify for legal protection according to strict rules defining design and that consumer groups are overestimating the costs of such protection. No final decision has been taken on the Commission's proposals. They are being scrutinised by the working group of the Council of Ministers and have yet to be debated by the European Parliament. However, independent suppliers believe manufacturers could use the three-year ruling to create a monopoly in the supply of spare parts. 'Without a repair right, the availability of spare parts would decrease, the price of spare parts would increase, and the very existence of the European independent spare parts industry would be put at risk,' says the European Campaign for an Automotive Repair Right, a grouping of independent suppliers and consumer organisations. They also argue that the ruling could cause great inconvenience to consumers in the UK who are able to ring up glass suppliers, for example, 24 hours a day for repairs on broken windscreens. 'It is not just a matter of cost, it is a matter of flexibility,' said Mr David Roycroft, of Pilkington, the UK glass manufacturer. The carmakers say they should be allowed some sort of protection for parts in order to recoup the costs of investment in design, although the consumer groups say those costs are covered in the sale of the vehicle.</p>

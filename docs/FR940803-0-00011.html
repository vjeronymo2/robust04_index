			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For these reasons, the Board and its Quality Control Committee developed plans to further revise the definition. As a result, the Board unanimously recommended on May 16, 1994, to revise the definition of inedible kernel to eliminate kernels with attached frass and webbing from being classified as insect injury and therefore, inedible. This rule will not affect the U.S. Standards for Grades of Shelled Almonds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This revision is expected to improve the quality control program by making the definition of inedible kernel better reflect handler processing capabilities and providing more equity for handlers and growers. It may also result in growers being paid for marketable almonds which are currently being scored as inedible on incoming inspections and may result in higher returns to growers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Board's recommendation, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) This rule relaxes requirements currently in effect; (2) this rule should be made effective as close to the beginning of the 1994&hyph;95 crop year as possible to be equitable and beneficial to growers and handlers; (3) this rule was unanimously recommended at a public meeting and all interested persons had an opportunity to provide input; (4) this rule is not controversial; and (5) this rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 981  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Almonds, Marketing agreements, Nuts, Reporting and recording requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 981 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 981_ALMONDS GROWN IN CALIFORNIA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The session studied and implemented the  guidelines of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military  Commission and of the eighth enlarged plenary session of the  Eighth CPC Committee of the Nanjing Military Region; reviewed  work in the past year and mapped out plans for the coming year;  and studied and discussed, in particular, ways to effectively  build up army units under the provincial military district, as  well as militia and reserve forces in Jiangsu, in keeping with  the development of the new situation.    At the session, Wei Changan, secretary of the party  committee  and political commissar of the provincial military district,  delivered a work report on behalf of the provincial military  district's party committee standing committee. He said: Last  year, the provincial military district concentrated efforts on  building up grass-roots units and ensuring their quality, and  fulfilled tasks in various fields, thereby maintaining the  upward trend in the building of army units and reserve forces.  In the coming year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his concept  of army building in the new era, the provincial military  district will further implement the policy of attaching primary  importance to quality; go all out to expedite the construction  of party committee leading bodies at all levels and grass-roots  units; and strengthen the war preparedness, training, and  management of army units and militia and reserve forces so as to  push the building of army units and reserve forces to a new  height.    (Chen Chungeng), secretary of the party committee discipline  inspection commission and deputy political commissar of the  provincial military district, gave an evaluation report on  results in promoting clean administration by army units in  Jiangsu in various phases, and set forth demands for further  promoting clean administration by members of the party committee.    Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial party committee  and  first secretary of the provincial military district party  committee, gave an important speech. He said: Last year, the  provincial military district, while attending to work related to  war preparedness, training, management, logistic support, and  militia and reserve forces, actively organized army units and  militia and reserve personnel in supporting key local  construction projects and taking part in rescuing disaster  victims and delivering relief, thereby forging closer ties  between soldiers and civilians and promoting reform, opening up,  economic construction, and social stability in Jiangsu. In the  coming year, party committees at all levels in the provincial  military district should diligently study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, persist in using the theory to achieve unity in  thinking and to guide the work, and strive to promote the  building of army units and militia and reserve forces to a new  height.    He added: The annual Spring Festival is drawing near. All  localities should launch "double supports" activities for  building closer army-civilian relations. The provincial  military district, all military subdistricts and garrisons, and  people's armed forces departments at all levels should strive to  solidify and develop the excellent situation of army-civilian  unity.    Zheng Bingqing, member of the provincial party committee  standing committee and commander of the provincial military  district, outlined the requirements for improving leadership and  work style and fulfilling this year's tasks.</p>

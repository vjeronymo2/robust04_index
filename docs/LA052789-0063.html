			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINESE STUDENTS PROTEST IN BEIJING  </P> <P> During recent weeks, numerous analysts have predicted what will happen in  China. When 2 million people marched in Beijing, it was predicted that changes  toward democracy were inevitable. When martial law was declared, it was  predicted that a dark period would be inevitable. When the 100 military  officers opposed martial law, it was predicted that the hard-liners would fall.  When 7 of the 8 army divisions supported Premier Li Peng, it was predicted that  the hard-liners would take control.  </P> <P> The predictions have not been correct. Why has the U.S. media been so  inaccurate with their analyses and predictions? In my opinion, the complexity  of the problem has been overlooked. All of the above predictions were made  using a common-sense approach. But this is not how it works in China.  </P> <P> I think that the strength of both the moderates and the hard-liners in the  Chinese government has been greatly exaggerated. When martial law was declared,  Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun were the only leaders willing to identify  themselves openly as hard-liners. This week even Li Peng went on Chinese TV  claiming that he was not responsible for calling in the troops. On the other  side, (Communist Party general secretary) Zhao Ziyang was the only openly  moderate along with (chairman of National People's Congress) Wan Li leaning  towards Zhao without making his position clear.  </P> <P> It appears that most of the people in the government are uncommitted to either  side.  </P> <P> It also appears that the complexity within the democratic movement has been  overlooked. Analysts have been trying hard to find out if the goal of this  movement is to overthrow communism, or to get rid of corruption and bureaucracy  and make the existing socialism work better. The answer varies depending on  which students you talk to. I don't think that there is an ultimate goal.  </P> <P> But though these people have very different ultimate goals, their immediate  goals are the same. This is the force that has united the people from all walks  of life.  </P> <P> The outcome of this struggle is undecided at the moment and will continue to be  undecided regardless of which leader appears to be in control. At no time  should we be overly optimistic, nor overly pessimistic.  </P> <P> PAUL LIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

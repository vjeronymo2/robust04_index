			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Unease at universities' pay deal signalled THE Department of Education confirmed yesterday that it has convened a meeting with university vice-chancellors and the Association of University Teachers which almost certainly indicates government displeasure at the pay deal that was agreed for university teachers in May. The AUT and the vice-chancellors agreed a 6 per cent rise with a further 1 per cent to be distributed locally later in the year. With the delay in implementing the award the AUT says the increase to the salary bill is about 5.75 per cent. However, with the government keen to restrict public-sector pay rises to 4 per cent - as it did last week for the 2,000 top civil servants covered by the Top Salaries Review Body - the lecturers' rise is regarded by ministers as eating up too much of the overall university grant. By threatening to alter the level of the overall grant the government is in a strong position to force a reduction in the pay rise. An AUT spokeswoman said that since 1979 average non-manual earnings have risen 58 per cent in real terms while academic earnings have risen only 10 per cent. Some vice-chancellors had indicated during the negotiations with the AUT that they could not afford a pay rise higher than 2 per cent. However, the AUT said that those universities with special difficulties had been taken into account in the negotiations. The House of Lords yesterday reserved judgment in a test-case appeal that will decide whether senior university lecturers can count on keeping their jobs until retirement without fear of being made redundant on cost-cutting grounds. Five law lords headed by Lord Keith heard 4 1/2 days of legal argument in an appeal by Professor Edgar Page, a 61-year-old philosophy lecturer made redundant by Hull University in October 1988. The law lords' decision is not expected before the start of the new legal year in October.</p>

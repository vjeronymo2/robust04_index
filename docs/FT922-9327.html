			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK car sales It is surely stretching the evidence to conclude that the level of new car sales in April is concrete evidence of economic recovery. Nevertheless, combined with an upbeat statement from the motor component manufacturer T&amp;N, the 9.1 per cent year-on-year increase in vehicle registrations last month provoked new stirrings among the leading component stocks yesterday. The fact that the April number was positive after 29 months of dismal decline is certainly not to be sniffed at. But the caveats are real all the same. The comparable figure last year was depressed by the introduction of a higher rate of value added tax, while this time the budget reduction in car tax and the election result will have provided an immediate boost. Out in the showrooms, moreover, the general mood remains one of extreme caution as dealers await the reality of the upturn rather than the promise. There is hope that the recent half point interest rate cut may help tempt the still elusive private buyer, though that is tempered by fear that many may now hang on for the change in registration number prefix in August. As for T&amp;N, whose shares jumped 8 per cent yesterday, the chairman's prediction that the recovery should be well established by the end of this year is fighting talk. The company's achievements in lowering costs and taking advantage of German competitors' misfortunes to gain market share are indeed impressive. But it is worth remembering that T&amp;N desperately needs bigger volumes to justify its appetite for capital spending.</p>

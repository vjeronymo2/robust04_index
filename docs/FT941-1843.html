			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP set to explore in China's Tarim basin British Petroleum has become the latest international oil company to secure an agreement to explore for oil in the remote Tarim basin in western China. Under the terms of the agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation BP Exploration and four Japanese partners will spend three years on a seismic programme, after which they will have an option to begin exploration drilling. The consortium's commitment is on a relatively small scale, thought to be around Dollars 3m for the seismic operation. Other foreign companies which have recently reached exploration agreements in the area include Exxon and Texaco of the US, Agip of Italy and a number of Japanese companies. The Tarim Basin has long been viewed with interest by foreign companies, but its remote location and lack of infrastructure means development of any oil finds are likely to be long-term prospects.</p>

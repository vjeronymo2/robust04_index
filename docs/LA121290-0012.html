			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING: MARYLAND BEATS UC IRVINE  </P> <P> Bill Mulligan and his UC Irvine team know how hard a victory can be to come by,  after getting only five all last season.  </P> <P> That's why the Anteaters' 93-79 loss before 7,263 in Cole Field House at  College Park, Md., Tuesday was so painful.  </P> <P> "It looks like a 14-point game on paper," Mulligan said. "It wasn't."  </P> <P> Irvine (3-4) might have turned the tables on a Maryland team that had lost  three games in a row. Instead, the Anteaters fell below .500 after making only  37% of their shots, and only 14 of 46 in the second half.  </P> <P> Even so, Irvine trailed by only 81-77 with 2:23 to play. But Maryland's Kevin  McLinton made a layup despite being fouled by Jeff Herdman. McLinton completed  the three-point play with 1:44 remaining, and Maryland (3-3) made nine of 10  free throws the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Terrapin center Cedric Lewis had 21 points, 14 rebounds and eight blocked  shots. Walt Williams, a 6-foot-8 point guard, also scored 21 points, making  seven of 10 shots.  </P> <P> For the second game in a row, Irvine was also hurt by the slow start of senior  center RickyButler.  </P> <P> Butler, averaging 19 points, stumbled through the first half. He finished with  18 points and nine rebounds, but had only four points at halftime. He had only  three at halftime in a loss to Utah Saturday, and finished with 23.  </P> <P> Herdman, who scored seven points in the final five minutes against Maryland as  the Anteaters cut the deficit to four, finished with 18 and had eight rebounds.  </P> <P> Irvine played its second game in a row without starting guard Dylan Rigdon, who  was sidelined because of a hip injury.  </P> <P> Irvine led, 20-12, in the first half before Maryland went on an 11-0 run.  Maryland led by five at halftime and pulled out to a 13-point lead with 10  minutes to play after a 15-2 run that included eight consecutive points by the  Terrapins, who attempted 31 fewer shots than Irvine but made 59%.  </P></p>

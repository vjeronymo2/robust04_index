Based on diplomatic sources in Lefkosa, ANATOLIA reported that  with the second letter he sent to the UN secretary general,  President Rauf Denktas narrowed Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos  Kliridhis' area of maneuvering. ANATOLIA reports that unless  Kliridhis creates a new conflict issue, there is no reason why  the indirect talks should not begin soon.</p>

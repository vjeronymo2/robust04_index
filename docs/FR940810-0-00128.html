			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Shipyard Standard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the reopening of the record for supplemental comments in November 1992, OSHA asked for comment on the application of the proposed scheme for shipyards. There were few specific responses. J. Curran, State of North Carolina Department of Environmental Health and Natural Resources (Ex. 162&hyph;46) and BCTD (Ex. 162&hyph;42) supported applying the construction standard to shipyards. Mr. Siebert, a representative of the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, agreed with others in wanting a separate standard for shipyards to be developed by SESAC (Ex. 162&hyph;13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has accepted these suggestions and has issued a separate, final standard for shipyards. Its specific provisions are discussed in appropriate places in the preamble. It is more similar to the new construction standard than to the general industry standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (k)(8) covers training. It expands the training provisions of the current standard considerably. One, training must be given to virtually all employees who are actively exposed to asbestos, i.e. whose exposure is the result of performing Class I through IV work, or who install new asbestos products. Under the unrevised standard, training was triggered by exposure above the action level, i.e. 0.1 f/cc, the new PEL. As discussed above, OSHA has determined that there is a still significant risk at this level. Further, the Agency's experience in enforcing its health and safety standards, along with testimony, comment, and data in this record clearly establish that training of employees is a vital component of any successful program to control exposures to asbestos and other toxic substances. Participants agreed (see e.g., testimony of Dr. Sawyer at Tr. 2164 ``.&blank;.&blank;. (T)rain the worker. I think is the most important factor.'') There was substantial record support to expand training. Among those who advocated additional OSHA training requirements were: P. Heffernan of Kaselaan and D'Angelo (Ex. 7&hyph;36), K. Churchill of California Association of Asbestos Professionals (Ex. 7&hyph;95), D. Kirby of Oak Ridge National Lab (Ex. 77&hyph;111), E. Krause of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers (Ex. 7&hyph;115), G. Lofton of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers Union (Ex. 7&hyph;118), P. Curran of North Carolina State Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources (Ex. 7&hyph;118), W. Dundulis of the State of Rhode Island Department of Health (Ex. 7&hyph;124), BCTD (Ex. 119), American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (Ex. 141), Service Employees International Unions, AFL-CIO (Ex. 144), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Tr. 230).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants supported training all employees who handle asbestos, rather than waiting for significant exposures to trigger it [see e.g., testimony of D. Kirby, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ``You need to have awareness training of .&blank;.&blank;. custodial and maintenance'' people, (Tr 122); and, R. Lemen, NIOSH, who supported ``.&blank;.&blank;. approved training courses for all workers who are routinely handling asbestos containing material, (Tr. 231)].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second major expansion of training requirements covers curriculum method and length of training. Before, in the 1986 standard, OSHA merely required that certain topics be covered in the training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, as OSHA noted in its proposal, and participants noted in their comments, EPA's training requirements under the Asbestos Hazard Response Act (AHERA) become the standard for the asbestos abatement industry. Under AHERA, at the time of the proposal:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> .&blank;.&blank;. Inspectors must take a 3-day training course; management planners must take the inspection course plus an additional 2 days devoted to management planning; and abatement project designers are required to have at least 3 days of training. In addition, asbestos abatement contractors and supervisors must take a 4-day training course and asbestos abatement workers are required to take a 3-day training course. For all disciplines, persons seeking accreditation must also pass an examination and participate in annual re-training courses. A complete description of accreditation requirements can be found in the Model Accreditation Plan at 40 CFR part 763, subpart E, appendix C.I.1.A. through E. (54 Fr, November 29, 1989 at 49190).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> More recently, EPA has published an interim rule updating its Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) (59 FR 5236&hyph;5260, February 3, 1994) pursuant to the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Under the revisions, the length of certain courses has increased, i.e. asbestos abatement workers now must take a 4-day, rather than a 3-day course. Additionally, the entire MAP now applies to work in ``public and commercial buildings as well as in schools,'' and requires more ``hands-on'' training. For example, for abatement workers 14 hours of hands-on training must be included in the 4-day training course.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The training provisions in the new standard correspond to the class of work performed. For Class I and II work, employers must provide employees with a training course which is the equivalent in curriculum, training method and length to the EPA MAP worker training described above. Keying OSHA required training to the AHERA program was supported by many participants; in many sections of the country, most training is now done using AHERA accreditation as the standard for quality, (see e.g., testimony of Daniel Swartzman, School of Public Health, Univ. of Ill, Tr. at 486. et seq.). and because AHERA training as noted above, is the recognized standard for quality in asbestos work (see. must be trained in the proposal, OSHA asked for comment on whether OSHA should provide model curricula and certification for training, and on whether and how OSHA training requirements should be reconciled with those of EPA (55 FR 29726&hyph;28).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

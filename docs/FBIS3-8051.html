			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar by Jan </F> Smolec; place and date not given: "We Will Not Be the Armory of  the World, but..."]    [Text] [Smolec] Mr. Prime Minister, during the past few  days, you have held meetings with politicians and businessmen in  Moscow, Tashkent, Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Karachi, and  Ankara. This was a journey of 25,000 kilometers. From where do  you have the best reports?    [Meciar] We have good reports from each country, but the  most important ones are, in any case, from China. We were  received by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. The  signing of an agreement on trade-economic and cultural  cooperation opens up a huge market for Slovakia. This giant  country appreciated the fact that Slovakia was one of the first  countries in East Europe to come and discuss cooperation with  the PRC.    [Smolec] Ill-wishers are accusing you of flirting with a  socialist country, are they not?    [Meciar] The whole world trades with the People's Republic  of China. China was the first of the Asian countries to  recognize us as a state. There are no contentious issues  between us. China has a dominant economic-strategic position in  Asia. It is undergoing a complicated transformation process.  In Shanghai, they are quite literally achieving a minor  economic miracle. We want to learn from what the Chinese are  doing. What China does well, we want to take up ourselves. I  do not pay any attention to what the ill-wishers say.    [Smolec] In China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Turkey, you  shrewdly pointed out to politicians and businessmen that  Slovakia was once a "power" in arms production. Now it is  producing only 8 percent of its original output. We had  politicians who forced us to repent for having experts who  manufactured high-quality weapons.    [Meciar] Others have come into the arms markets we left. We  are offering these products to NATO. No agreements were reached  with Germany or France; on the other hand, they reached an  agreement with the Czech Republic. We did not come to an  agreement with Great Britain. So, we are looking for ways of  cooperating with others. For example, with Turkey, Thailand, and  other countries. World experts admire the technical standard of  Slovak weapons because, in some respects, it is unique. We do  not want to turn Slovakia into the world's armory, but we see no  need to destroy our arms industry. It is important that we are  able to compete. We have to make up quickly for the loss we  suffered through no fault of our own. The tradition of our  products means a lot. Very few people know that the cannon that  Columbus fired when he discovered America was made in Upper  Hungary--that is, on the territory of present-day Slovakia.    [Smolec] During your trip, did anyone express any doubts  about Slovakia?    [Meciar] The Slovak Republic was viewed everywhere we went  as a reliable and responsible partner. They did not know much  about us in Pakistan, but, when we told them about Slovakia,  they expressed an interest in visiting it.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / American recipe for European consumers: The likelihood of Europe acquiring an increasing taste for US snack foods The merger of PepsiCo's and General Mills's snack foods businesses in continental Europe represents another investment in the belief that what the US consumer did yesterday, the European consumer will do tomorrow. In 1980, snacks accounted for about 18 per cent of the average American diet. Today, it is more than 25 per cent. The trend has made PepsiCo's snack foods more profitable than its better-known drinks brands. Operating profits rose from Dollars 339m (Pounds 188m) in 1986 to Dollars 934m in 1990 before restructuring costs reduced them to Dollars 788m last year. Annual retail sales of two snack brands, Ruffles potato chips and Doritos tortilla chips, have retail sales of more than Dollars 1bn each. The successful growth of the business in the US convinced PepsiCo that the process could be repeated worldwide. Factors which drove the demand for snacks in the US have been evident for some time in Europe. As the number of working women has increased, families have been eating fewer meals together. The demand for convenience foods has been stimulated and Europeans have discovered a taste for the chips and crackers, candy and cookies, on which US consumers graze. The experience of Pepsico's Frito-Lay, the leading US snacks manufacturer, suggested that some potential barriers to growth in Europe would be less inhibiting than some observers thought. PepsiCo's successful introduction of western-style snacks in countries such as Mexico and Korea encouraged its view that European eating habits would be as susceptible to change. Concerns about health and diet in the US as early as the mid-1970s led to the company providing low-fat, low-salt snacks to make consumers feel better as they indulged. 'The development of the industry has been remarkably consistent in spite of widely varied cultures and tastes,' says Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of PepsiCo international foods and beverages. 'Once the snacking habit is established, consumers demand more variety. Product innovation then generates further growth.' PepsiCo introduced more than 40 new snacks into the US market during 1989 and 1990 - and the potential of the European venture's combined research and development resources to improve on that record is clearly seen as a benefit of the merger. PepsiCo's international snacks operations now involve 27 businesses in 25 countries. It is the group's fastest-growing division. Sales have risen from Dollars 419m to Dollars 1.8bn, and profits from Dollars 27.6m to Dollars 171m since 1987. Europe, including the UK where PepsiCo secured a 39 per cent market share with the Dollars 1.35bn acquisition of Smiths and Walkers crisps from BSN, the French foods and drinks group, in 1989, accounts for 30 per cent of sales. Annual consumption of snack chips in the UK, the most highly developed market, is still only 9lbs a head compared with 14lbs in the US. In Spain, consumption per head is 3lbs, and in Turkey a mere two ounces. Combined sales of the new venture amount to little more than 3 per cent of the existing market - but the partners have now put themselves into a much better position to increase that share. General Mills brings to the venture secure shares in northern Europe. Its three companies there - Biscuiterie Nantaise which has 4.4 per cent of the Dollars 4bn French market, and the Smiths Food Group operations which hold around 8 per cent of the Belgian and Dutch markets - have annual sales of around Dollars 325m. PepsiCo complements that with leadership in Spain, Portugal and Greece, the fast-growing markets of southern Europe. Europe may as well reconcile itself to the crunch of Cheetos and Doritos, Bloopers and Chupa Chups.  ---------------------------------------------------                 JOINT VENTURE  ---------------------------------------------------                 Company          1991      Total                                 (sales)   market                               Dollars m  Dollars m  --------------------------------------------------- Belgium         General Mills    35.9     473.7 France          General Mills   181.2     4,150 Netherlands     General Mills   106.9     1,352 Greece          PepsiCo          37.6       230 Portugal        PepsiCo          39.6       232 Spain           PepsiCo         239.6     1,546  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

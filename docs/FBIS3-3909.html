How should we strengthen the  management and education of party members operating private  businesses from other localities? The party committee of Xinhua  District in the city of Shijiazhuang took some experimental  measures and has achieved some results.    Establishing organization. The Xinhua Country  Fair Center in this district ranks fourth among the 10 biggest  country fairs in China. In 1992, this center boasted over  20,000 private business operators, among whom 134 were nonlocal  party members. Most of these party members, in effect, had  disconnected themselves from the party organizations they  originally belonged to and had not been subjected to management  and education by their party organizations for a long time. As  a result, their exemplary vanguard role and political influence  as party members had weakened significantly. Some of these party  members took care of their personal interests at the expense of  the party's interests and substituted the party's principle with  the principle of exchange of equal value. They turned a deaf  ear or a blind eye to practices that violated the party's  principles and policies or that disrupted market order, and to  the phenomena of bullying and wheeler-dealering. The party  branch of the Xinhua District Country Fair Center keenly felt  that in order for them to play an exemplary vanguard role on the  market, there must be a set of organizational forms that would  suit the nature of their work and their characteristics, and  that they should be subjected to regular and undisrupted  management and education.    In June 1989, in pursuance of the "party constitution"  provision that "a grass-roots party organization should be set  up wherever there are three or more full members of the party,"  the party committee of Shijiazhuang's Xinhua District founded a  local party branch among the private business operators at the  Xinhua Country Fair Center, subordinate to the general party  branch of the district's industrial and commercial  administration bureau. The head of the industrial and  commercial administration office became the branch secretary,  and retired senior cadres were appointed deputy secretaries.  The branch committee consisted of five private business  operators holding party membership. The general party branch of  the industrial and commercial administration bureau made it  clear that all private business operators who are party members  and have worked in the market for more than six months must have  their formal or temporary membership credentials transferred to  the party branch of private business operators here, take part  in the regular activities of the party organization, and pay  membership fees in a timely manner. The party branch set up a  file for each of its members and entered into it their  biographic information, as well as their main accomplishments  and problems in participating in the branch's regular  activities, playing an exemplary role, adhering to various  relevant regimes, and observing discipline and law. The  establishment of the party branch of private business operators  effectively strengthened the organizational awareness of the  party members among the private business operators, as well as  their conscientiousness in exercising self-control,  self-education, and self-restraint.    Improving the system. System building is a key  link in strengthening education for party members, especially  for those among private business operators who cannot do without  the restraint of systems. After the party branch of private  business operators was established, it introduced, over a period  of time, a full set of systems, such as: the system of  reporting the branch's work to the general party branch, the  system of party-member management with prescribed objectives,  the system of regular appraisal of members, the system of  filling out monthly introspection reports by members, the system  of regular democratic meetings, the system of reporting to the  party branch one's ideological experience in the form of  correspondence when absent from the market on a business trip or  on a visit to one's family for over a month, the system of  two-way communication with the party organizations to which its  members used to belong, and some other operational systems that  suit the management of party members among private business  operators. In the meantime, the branch exercised management by  objective toward each member in such areas as participating in  regular organization activities, operating according to the law,  paying required taxes in a timely manner, and giving  enthusiastic support to public welfare undertakings. It  quantified the members' rights, obligations, and  responsibilities, and appraised their performance every six  months, the results of which were used as the main basis for  conferring the title of exemplary party member at the end of  each year. Through the building of systems, the management and  education of party members among private business operators were  institutionalized and regularized, which brought the behavior of  the party members into bounds and enhanced their  conscientiousness in observing discipline and law.    At the Xinhua Country Fair, party members among the private  business operators not only took the lead in paying various  taxes and levies required by laws and regulations, but also  explained state laws and the rules and regulations of the market  to other private business operators in their respective lots.  As a result, the broad ranks of operators obviously were more  willing to observe discipline and the law, and to pay taxes as  required. Before long, the authorities began to be able to  collect all the required taxes and levies within five days each  month.    Strengthening education. The party members among  the private business operators were specifically educated to  "take the lead in doing five things." In other words, they  should take the lead in implementing the party's principles and  policies, working hard while maintaining a simple lifestyle, and  dedicating themselves selflessly; take the lead in operating  according to the law, providing quality service, and fighting  unlawful businessmen and bad people or practices; take the lead  in combating all sorts of negative and corrupt phenomena, and in  promoting new positive practices of a socialist nature; take the  lead in attaining prosperity through hard work, not forgetting  those who lag behind in the process of getting rich, and  contributing to common prosperity; and take the lead in doing  business in a civilized manner and striving to win the title of  civilized private business operator. In the meantime, the  district industrial and commercial administration bureau also  invested 12,000 yuan and built a "function room for party  members operating private businesses" and a "party school for  private business operators," to provide activity and study  venues for party members operating private businesses.    The consistent education with definite objectives  significantly enhanced the party spirit and awareness of party  members operating private businesses. As a result, cases  emerged one after another in which advanced individuals  conscientiously engaged themselves in business in a civilized  way and took the lead in being selflessly dedicated. Last year,  a customer from Shanxi Province left his wallet containing 5,800  yuan cash and his driver's license and identification card at  the stall owned by party member Wen Hui, after buying some  clothes from him. As soon as he saw it, Wen Hui left his stall  unattended and went all over the place in search of the owner.  When the moved owner got his wallet back and offered him 1,000  yuan as a token of gratitude, Wen Hui said: "This is what I  should do. I should not make money this way. Otherwise I will  not be living up to the title of party member, will I?" Wang  Yinhe, a party-member private business operator in his 70's,  donated thousands of yuan in a space of eight consecutive years  for the purchase of saplings and seeds, and grafted more than  22,800 jujube and peach trees for his home village, and  cultivated by himself more than 21,000 black date and apricot  saplings on the hillside and edges of the fields in his home  village. Over the years, the party members operating private  businesses contributed a total of more than 350,000 yuan in  support of the construction undertakings in their home towns and  home villages in various ways and did over 2,400 good deeds for  the public. All the 134 party members among the private  business operators at this fair received the title of "civilized  private business operator" and five of them were chosen as  exemplary party members.    Stepping up supervision. While the party branch  among the private business operators was improving the  responsibility system for party building and strictly exercising  organizational supervision, it also subjected its members to the  supervision by the public. For this purpose, the party branch  worked out a rational and evenly distributed pattern of stalls  run by its members, each marked with a conspicuous, red sign:  "Party Member Stall." The branch clearly assigned to each of  its members individuals to whom they should pass on experience,  give help, and set an example, on the basis of the findings of  investigation and analysis on the ideological and political  quality and performance of more than 7,000 private business  operators at the fair. This way, they not only reinforced the  supervision of party members by customers and their non-member  colleagues, but also achieved the result of "party members  setting an example for their colleagues" and "party members  taking care of their colleagues." This has ensured the  implementation of all the measures for building a civilized  market, as a result of which the Xinhua Country Fair Center has  been chosen a national civilized market for six consecutive  years.</p>

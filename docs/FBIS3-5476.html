			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Tuesday [8 March] he will continue trying to break  an impasse on talks over a new trade "framework" between Japan  and the United States.    Hosokawa, speaking at the House of Representatives plenary  session, said "a window for the negotiations is still open to  both Japan and the United States."    Japan is determined to go ahead with its pump-priming  measures and the opening of its market to foreign traders, he  said.    The prime minister was referring to his February 11 summit  with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Hosokawa and Clinton  announced the breakdown of the framework talks at a joint news  conference following the Washington summit.    Hosokawa, replying to questions by Shunichi Suzuki, a member  of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), expressed  worries about the reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade  provision, which he said violates the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Super 301, reintroduced by Clinton on March 3, gives the  U.S.  Government power to impose retaliatory tariffs against unfair  traders if they fail to remove trade barriers.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told the same session that  Japan, the U.S. and South Korea will make joint efforts to  resolve the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons.    At the House of Councillors earlier in the day, Hosokawa  renewed his pledge to reform Japan's economic structure, which  has been criticized by other countries as impeding fair trade.    "The Japanese people expected the coalition government to  break the rigidity of politics and the economy caused by the  long-term rule of the Liberal Democratic Party," he said.    Hosokawa also expressed hope that the Japanese economy will  see a recovery in fiscal 1994, which begins in April.    Accelerating inventory adjustment in the private sector  offers bright prospects but the economy remains stagnant in  general, he said at the upper house session.    "The government compiled the 15 trillion yen stimulus  package  and incorporated measures into the fiscal 1994 budget to bring  the economy back on track as early as possible in fiscal 1994  and keep up stable growth from fiscal 1995 on," the premier said.    He was responding to questions by Tomio Yamamoto, an LDP  upper house legislator.    Hosokawa tried to allay concern about a possible shortage of  rice, saying the government increased the amount of domestically  grown rice to be sold in March and is taking steps to solve the  shortage.    Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of  rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's  worst harvest in the postwar period.    Representatives of political parties started three days of  interpellations Monday on last Friday's policy speeches by  Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / US union cash for Poland Poland Partners, a new Dollars 65m (Pounds 44m) venture capital fund, backed by a US government agency and created to boost the private sector in Poland, will include five pension funds from US trade unions. Although the unions have been generally hostile towards overseas investment, US labour rallied around Poland's Solidarity movement during its days underground, and the relationship is still close, according to Mr Bob Kalaski, director of communications for the machinists' union. The concept for Poland Partners originated after a speech in 1990 to US unions by President Lech Walesa and the fund has been strongly supported by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government agency. Opic has already backed 22 ventures in Poland involving US companies with Dollars 400m in financing and risk insurance, and Dollars 1.2bn in financing in the former eastern bloc. For this fund it will provide up to Dollars 39m in investment guarantees. The fund will be managed by the Poland Partners Management Company, which is owned by California-based Avalon Ventures, Company Assistance Ltd of Warsaw and Landon Butler &amp; Co of Washington.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent ends the week cautiously higher In spite of a less volatile day's trading in Europe yesterday worries remained over a possible rise in US interest rates next week. As a consequence Nomura's strategists have advised further selling of equities for cash, with or without a further rise in short term rates. 'Equites are an each-way loser,' says Nomura. 'Even higher bond yields and the equities dive; bond rallies born out of further short rate rises and/or switching out of equities have exactly the same effect - note that the Dow fell last Tuesday night after the bond market had rallied.' Nomura is pessimistic and has recommended reducing a global equity allocation by 10 per cent to 50 per cent and raising cash to 30 per cent, while aiming to buy bonds between now and the end of the year. FRANKFURT moved higher on encouraging state inflation data and strength in the bond markets. The Dax index finished up 16.09 at 2,089.12, before rising further to 2,092.75 in the Ibis. Turnover on the day was DM5.7bn and the market gained 1.4 per cent on the week. Activity again remained low with corporate news only patchy. There were reports that Daimler's long term debt ratings had been downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's which left the shares off 90 pfennings at DM779 in the Ibis. PARIS recovered some of the losses of the previous sessions, ending the session, also the last day of the account, some 1.5 per cent higher and unchanged over the week. The CAC-40 index closed up 27.98 at 1,927.35. The account ended with a loss of nearly 4 per cent. Recommending a neutral stance on the French market Kleinwort Benson noted that foreign investors, who supported the market in 1993 by investing some FFr75bn, have now gone underweight in favour of Germany. Credit Lyonnais CIs remained under pressure after the group's postponement of first-half figures. The CIs, which are thinly held, dipped FFr5.80 to FFr395.20. MILAN overcame early disappointment over the failure of the government and unions to agree on pensions reform at a meeting on Thursday as hopes rose for a break in the deadlock on Monday. The Comit index registered a 2.94 fall to 668.19, taking the week's loss to 1.5 per cent. However, the real-time Mibtel index rose 48 on the day to 10,737. Olivetti was up L40 at L2,053 after announcing better than feared six-month figures on Thursday. Pirelli was L16 higher at L2,607 ahead of the release of its first-half results this afternoon. Generali was down L289 at L39,374 after reporting weaker than expected first-half results. ZURICH nudged higher in low volume, supported by firmer bond futures, and the SMI index rose 6.2 to 2,609.1, little changed over the week. Insurance issues, which had an active week, closed mixed. Swiss Re, the subject of speculation that it aims to acquire Elvira, added to the week's advances with an SFr8 rise to SFr571, although analysts noted that the share had fallen by 30 per cent since the beginning of the year following various sell recommendations. Merkur, the retailer, put on SFr4 to SFr361, ahead of its announcement of better than expected first-half profits and a forecast of improved full year figures. AMSTERDAM was another beneficiary of the better mood across the continent yesterday. The AEX index improved 3.25 to 403.61m but down almost 1 per cent on the week. Heineken was unchanged at Fl 238. Kleinwort Benson has downgraded the stock from a buy to hold on the basis that the shares are now fully valued. The brokers commented that since July the shares have appreciated by nearly 16 per cent and have outperformed the Dutch market by 9 per cent. MADRID saw an end to its five-day losing streak, picking up 1.5 per cent in response to firmer government bond prices, short-covering, and the opening gains on Wall Street. The agreement between the minority ruling Socialist party and the CiU centre-right Catalan nationalist party over the 1995 budget also gave support to bond and equity markets. The general index closed 4.36 higher at 298.82 in volume of Pta25.9bn. The market was down 0.8 over the week. Blue chips led the market higher, with Telefonica up Pta60, or 3.6 per cent, at Pta1,750. Endesa added Pta160 to Pta5,530 and Repsol gained Pta75 to Pta3,815. Bankinter added Pta190 or 1.7 per cent to Pta11,520 after the bank said it planned to pay a second 1994 gross dividend of Pta116 pesetas, up 9.5 per cent from 1993. OSLO fell back on fears that the country might reject EU membership in a November 28 referendum. The All-share index lost 2.46 to 596.62 in spite of higher prices for North Sea oil and lower interest rates. Turnover was NKr529m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr2 to NKr239. STOCKHOLM improved helped by strong financial stocks. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 12.0 to 1,428.3, off 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was moderate at SKr2.7bn. The banking and insurance index rose 2.5 per cent: S-E-Banken A shares gained SKr1.20 to SKr47, while Skandia put on SKr4 to SKr125.

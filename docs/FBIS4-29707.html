			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, the United States and Japan  are strengthening their conspiracy and collusion [kongmo  kyoltak] in preparation for an emergency [yusasie taebihayo] on  the Korean peninsula.    According to Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN dated 18 June, the U.S.  Government recently asked Japan to transport Americans along  with Japanese in South Korea when Japan withdraws its people  from South Korea in preparation for an acute situation  [kinbakhan satae] on the Korean peninsula.    Accordingly, the Japanese Government is making every effort  for an early passage of the revised Self-Defense Forces [SDF]  Law draft that enables Japan to dispatch SDF planes to South  Korea. On the other hand, it has begun to consider using  warships, which are capable of transporting more people than  airplanes, in case of emergency.    The revised SDF Law draft aimed at dispatching SDF planes to  South Korea is reportedly being deliberated by the Special  Security Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives.  This hints that the U.S. anti-Republic crushing maneuver has  reached a very dangerous stage [migugui pan konghwaguk apsal  chaektongi maeu wihomhan tangye-e irugo ittanun kosul sisa  haejunun hanpyon], as well as showing that the Japanese  reactionaries' ambition to invade Korea again and their maneuver  to dispatch their troops overseas have reached an extreme level  [kukto-e tarhago ittanun kosul].    The United States is trying to use military planes and  warships of the SDF in carrying out a war against the Republic  under the pretext of withdrawing foreigners form South Korea.  The Japanese reactionaries backed by the United States [migugul  tungdaego] are attempting to mobilize SDF troops for a war of  invading Korea [choson chimnyak chonjaeng] and to legally  dispatch them overseas by revising the SDF Law, under the cloak  of transporting foreigners.    The conspiracy and collusion of the United States and Japan  aimed at the Korean peninsula is arousing concerns of world  public opinion for its dangerousness [ku wihomsonguro hayo].</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Cairo summit aims to warm up peace process: The Israeli prime minister will find Egypt receptive to his wish for a fresh start WHEN Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's new prime minister, arrives in Cairo today for his summit with President Mubarak, his aim will be to establish a new partnership in the search for Middle East peace. Mr Rabin has made no secret of his desire to enlist Egypt's help in revitalising the process - based on the Camp David accords of 1978 - which provided a framework for peace between Egypt and Israel and a formula for a settlement of the Palestinian problem in the occupied territories. The new Israeli leader sees reviving the tripartite relationship between Washington, Israel and Cairo as a way to advance the Middle East negotiations launched in Madrid last October. 'Rabin feels there is room for a greater involvement of the US and Egypt in helping to move things on,' said Mr Gad Ben Ari, Mr Rabin's spokesman. 'Our relationship with Egypt has been almost frozen and that was an obstacle to the peace process: that is why it is so important to meet President Mubarak and warm things up again.' Since his election last month, Mr Rabin has referred repeatedly to Camp David as the blueprint for a settlement, in contrast to Mr Yitzhak Shamir, his predecessor, who was always unwilling to follow the path mapped out by the accords. Under the terms agreed at the presidential holiday retreat near Washington, Israel would hand over day-to-day administration in the West Bank and Gaza to a 'freely-elected self-governing authority' for the Palestinians. Israeli forces would substantially withdraw from main Arab population centres. The Palestinian authority would serve as an interim confidence-building arrangement for five years during which negotiations would take place to determine the 'final status' of the territories. Mr Rabin will find the Egyptians extremely receptive to his desire for a new partnership. Egypt, the only Arab state to have made peace with Israel, has been uneasy about its peripheral role in the Madrid process which is based on bilateral negotiations between Israel and its other Arab neighbours. While neither President Mubarak nor Mr Rabin wishes to replace the structure of talks set up at Madrid, the Israelis see benefits in an enhanced Egyptian role. They hope that Egypt can facilitate difficult negotiations with the Palestinians and Syria, the latter being the most prickly of the parties to the talks. Egypt strongly welcomed Mr Rabin's election victory last month as an opportunity to put aside the awkwardness that characterised relations with Israel under Mr Shamir's Likud party. Mr Mubarak had always refused to meet Mr Shamir as a protest against the former prime minister's unwillingness to compromise. Both Israel and Egypt also have their eyes firmly fixed on Washington in this new phase: Mr Rabin wants to win an early reward from a Bush administration eager to secure a foreign policy success before the November presidential election. The Israelis are hoping that when Mr Rabin and Mr Bush meet next month, the president will approve the release of US loan guarantees to aid mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. Israel's request for guarantees worth Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.2bn) was frozen because of Mr Shamir's refusal to halt Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Mr Rabin is also anxious to move quickly on the peace issue to retain the political initiative over his right-wing opponents who are in disarray following their election defeat. Winning the loan guarantees would be persuasive evidence to Israelis that the shift of policy under Mr Rabin, including the reining-in of settlement activity, had paid an early dividend. For its part, Egypt, which is heavily dependant on American aid of more than Dollars 2bn annually, wants to continue to demonstrate its usefulness as a moderate force in the troublesome Middle East at a time when concerns abound about continuing instability. However, Cairo will have to ensure that closeness to the new Israeli administration will not arouse suspicion among its Arab brothers who ostracised Egypt after it signed its 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Syria has already expressed strong misgivings over Mr Rabin's emphasis on giving priority to talks with the Palestinians. This has fuelled traditional concerns in Damascus that Israel will seek to delay negotiations over the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967 at the same time as the West Bank and Gaza. The Syrians have summoned Arab foreign ministers, including Mr Amr Moussa of Egypt and the Palestinians, to Damascus this weekend to try to ensure Arab solidarity before the first round of peace talks, expected to be held in Rome in September. The Palestinians, who feel vulnerable to pressure from Arab regimes such as Egypt, are also anxious that Mr Rabin be obliged to adhere to international demands for a complete cessation of settlements. While the Egyptians will roll out the red carpet for Mr Rabin, they are certain to remind him that even though his initial gestures have created a more positive climate, success will require more substantial Israeli compromises.</p>

Speaking to reporters on his flight back to Rome from  Vienna,  Ciampi said that it was "very easy to predict" that interest  rates will continue to fall this year, although not as much as  they did in the last three quarters of 1993.    "Between April and December of 1993," Ciampi said, "interest  rates fell between four and five points. Today they are at 7 to  7.5 percent. At this rate, they should drop to below 3 percent  this year but I fear that will be difficult."    How interest rates go will depend on what happens in Italy  and abroad, he added. "I think that none of us in April thought  it would have been possible to cut interest rates in just eight  months to today's levels."    Asked whether his government planned additional austerity  measures to reduce the deficit in the near future, Ciampi  replied that the first public finance report will be available  in March. "At that time we will see what changes need to be  made.... At this time I have no indications because it is not  easy to have any after the first month of the year."    Continuing recession in Europe however will certainly have  negative effects on Italy's primary surplus, Ciampi said. Lower  interest rates can reduce the burden of debt servicing but in  March, "and only in March," Ciampi stressed, will it be possible  to compare forecasts to reality.</p>

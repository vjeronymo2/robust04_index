			<p>BFN     [Text] The Economy Ministry estimates that in the period  1994-96, government spending will rise from $61 billion to $88  billion, and that a strong negative trade balance deficit will  continue. It does, however, forecast that some 250,000 jobs will  be created.    All these details are included in the estimates drafted by  the Economy Ministry for the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan,  which was put together by the Economic Planning Secretariat. The  principal points of this plan were partially disclosed by  President Carlos Menem in his 1 May address to open the new  session of Congress.    The plan envisages the objectives for the two-year period  1994-96. These are: to consolidate the achieved stability; to  strengthen economic growth through an increase in investments,  savings, and exports; and to promote higher levels of employment  and a more equitable distribution of income at personal and  regional levels.    Within the macroeconomic framework, the Economy Ministry  forecasts that the Argentine economy will continue to grow in  1994, recording high levels of investment and an increase in  exports.    In this regard, the plan estimates that with the  considerable  decline in relative prices, the renewal of a significant amount  of reproducible capital, the incorporation of technology, and  the completion of major energy projects, the investment-output  ratio will be enough to sustain high growth rates.    Later in the document, the economic team extrapolates that  government expenditure will edge up 44 percent, especially in  general administration and in the defense and justice portfolios.    Social government expenditure, which will total $51.014  billion this year, will rise to $57.375 billion in 1995 and to  $63.417 billion in 1996. This will represent an increase from 18  to 18.8 percent of the GDP.    With regard to the consolidated government spending,  however,  the plan estimates that the new scheme for allocating resources  will be enhanced in this period, thus resulting in an increase  in government spending to meet constitutional requirements and  social programs of approximately 4.8 and 11.5 percent  respectively.    The plan, drawn up by the Economy Ministry, bases its  predictions on the assumption that a fiscal balance and the  soundness of public finances will be maintained; tax revenues  will increase at an annual rate of approximately 17 percent; the  privatization process will be concluded; the appropriation of  financial resources for social programs will be given top  priority; expenditures will be more equitably distributed; and  investments will increase.    With regard to foreign trade, the report states that the  trade balance will continue to show a deficit. It is estimated  that the trade deficit will add up to $4.351 billion this year,  $4.365 billion in 1995, and $3.604 billion in 1996.    It is thus estimated that exports will climb from $16.116  billion to $24.763 billion, while imports will rise from $23.888  billion to $29.968 billion.    The Economy Ministry considers that a recovery in trade  began  to be seen in 1993, and it extrapolates that by the year 2000 it  will have expanded by 11 percent as compared with last year's  figures.    The plan says that "it is only natural that imports should  grow at a faster pace than exports in a country that has  undergone so many changes." It speculates that the increase in  international interest rates will lead to a decline in imports  due to a shrinkage in available foreign savings.    Concerning employment, the economic team believes that the  incorporation of capital goods into companies, labor  flexibility, the reduction of the tax burden, the foreseen  deregulation in the construction industry, and the enforcement  of the Fiscal Pact will foster the creation of more jobs.    They estimate that 700,000 new jobs will be created between  1993 and 1996 in urban areas. In other words, the government's  estimate is based on the premise that some 250,000 new jobs will  be created every year during that period.    As for financial considerations, the plan underlines that  the  capital account of the balance of payments will attract $31  billion in the period 1994-96. It nonetheless foresees that  there will be greater uncertainty in international markets and a  decline in the inflow of foreign capital.    In conclusion, an increase in public investment in different  areas is foreshadowed in the "A Growing Argentina 1994-96" plan.  It also establishes a system of priorities: to promote projects  aimed at the training of human resources from the low-income  bracket; to develop programs and projects that contribute to  enhancing the qualified labor force; and to channel investments  into plans that envisage reducing regional imbalances.    The plan thus underlines that public investments at  national,  provincial, and municipal levels will total $6.7773 billion in  1994, representing 2.4 percent of GDP. This amount is to be  supplemented with $3.086 billion to be invested by private  companies in charge of public utilities.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Argentina's Total Government Spending (in billions of pesos)                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Aim/Function|1992        |1993        |1994        |1995        |1996        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total expen-|61.602      |70.31       |74.804      |81.858      |88.467      |  |ditures     |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |I.

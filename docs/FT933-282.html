			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (24): The future lies in returning to the past - Traditional methods to restore an Inca canal will irrigate unusable land HUNDREDS of metres sheer above the valley floor near Ollantaytambo, in Cuzco province, an ancient Inca irrigation canal hugs the contours of the mountainside. Below are agricultural terraces abandoned for centuries by the descendants of those who built them. Soon however, these narrow strips of land - which often look more like a stairway than a field - will be fertile once again with corn, wheat, potatoes and the traditional Andean crops of quinua, kiwicha and tarwi. Under the supervision of Dr Ann Kendall and a part-time team of visiting British archaeologists, local labourers are reconstructing the stone-built canal which once allowed them not only to feed themselves, but also to sell a substantial agricultural surplus to surrounding towns. Dr Kendall, who has spent 26 years on and off in Peru since writing her doctoral thesis, embarked on canal reconstruction 15 years ago. The Cusichaca Trust, which she founded, receives financial support from Britain's Overseas Development Agency (ODA), although the initiative for the rebuilding work on the six-kilometre Pumamarca canal came from the community of Ollantaytambo itself. The technology used in rebuilding is described by Dr Kendall as 'traditional' - using materials as nearly as possible the same as those used by the Incas. Clay and stones are gathered from the rocky mountainside for the retaining walls. Grated cactus provides an on-the-spot strengthening agent. 'This is a tectonic area and there's almost constant minor earth movement,' Dr Kendall explains. 'To use cement here has proved disastrous. Clay, on the other hand, is wonderfully plastic and keeps the canal stable. Any small landslide damage can be easily repaired using local materials - which, of course, are virtually free.' Traditional technology is slower and more labour-intensive than modern bulldozers and cement mixers, but in this timeless land there is no lack of volunteers. About 30 local men are employed on a weekly basis, working under the supervision of a master mason from Ollantaytambo. They are paid principally in food. 'An important part of our work also consists in training these men,' says Dr Kendall. 'Some who have gone back to their villages are now looking at possibilities for rebuilding ancient canals in their own areas too.' The Pumamarca canal is costing about Dollars 225,000 over three years. It will irrigate 160 hectares of otherwise almost unusable land. Today, villagers may plant a crop on some terraces, but the unirrigated soil must lie fallow for five years out of six; canal irrigation will allow them to harvest two crops a year, including a plentiful surplus to sell. At a little over Dollars 1,400 per hectare, the cost of the Cusichaca Trust's canal rehabilitation scheme compares very favourably with that of 'traditional' irrigation works with dams and reservoirs. 'We're giving people an alternative to migration to the towns where, in any case, there's no work and they must often live in appalling conditions,' says Dr Kendall. 'With the possibility of new land here, we're already starting to see reverse migration.' The aptly named Mr David Canal, the recently elected president of the Ollantaytambo community, says the number of local inhabitants applying for a share of the communally-owned agricultural lands has almost doubled this year. Once the canal is completed, the 'comuneros' to whom land is granted will assume the obligation of maintaining the waterway. 'These are the old ways, the ancient techniques and our own resources,' he says. 'We have always admired the achievements of our Inca ancestors, and that gives us confidence in what we are doing here.'</p>

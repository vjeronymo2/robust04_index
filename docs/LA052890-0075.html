			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OJAI FESTIVAL KEEPS CUTTING-EDGE TRADITION -- WITH A TWIST;  </P> <P> MUSIC: NEW DIRECTOR STEPHEN MOSKO WILL REPLACE THE OLD AND EUROPEAN STANDARDS  WITH NEW AND AMERICAN FARE.  </P> <P> There's a change of direction for the Ojai Festival this year. In the past, the  annual outdoor event has built a reputation for blending lesser-known music by  Bach, Beethoven and other established masters with the work of cutting edge  20th-Century personalities such as Igor Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez, Lukas Foss  and Peter Maxwell Davies.  </P> <P> Stephen Mosko, the festival's new music director, plans to maintain the  cutting-edge tradition, but add a pronounced twist. This weekend, the music of  Frederic Rzewski, Morton Subotnick, John Adams and Elliott Carter (who will all  attend) dominates the agenda, replacing any old and European fare with music  exclusively new and American.  </P> <P> "It's a celebration of the vitality of American music," insisted Mosko by  telephone from the Bay Area, where he serves as music director of the San  Francisco Contemporary Players. "The emphasis is not about being academic. It's  more a fun festival than anything."  </P> <P> Mosko (also known by his lifelong nickname, "Lucky") speaks at a rapid-fire  pace about the return of tonality, and influences from rock and pop music that  have helped shape the direction he is trying to emphasize. The conductor,  composer and teacher, who was born the same year the first official Ojai  Festival was held in 1947, has also included the works of younger composers  such as Rand Steiger, Steven Mackey and Art Jarvinen.  </P> <P> "I don't think that any of us from my generation and younger weren't influenced  by pop culture," Mosko observed. "And world music has also been an enormous  influence on composers of our era. I owned my first Ravi Shankar record when I  was 12."  </P> <P> The annual weekend festival in the Ojai Valley -- 90 minutes northwest of Los  Angeles -- will present eight concerts in three days, ranging in duration from  one to three hours. The Ojai Festival Orchestra will be appended by two other  performance ensembles: Mosko's San Francisco Contemporary Music Players and the  California E.A.R. Unit.  </P> <P> When asked to describe more specifically what listeners might expect, Mosko  pointed to the 1960s and '70s, when composers began to rediscover tonality.  </P> <P> "It was a feeling to get back to the immediacy that music can make," he  explained. "Back in the 1960s when the Fluxus movement was going on, the word  'minimalism' referred to pieces like those by La Monte Young where a cello  would play one chord for an hour. I don't know when things got turned around  with that word.  </P> <P> "The reaction by critics to what they now call 'minimalism,' or 'the new  simplicity,' is more sociological than musical. The music simply tries to  incorporate methods outside the longstanding European tradition."  </P> <P> Mosko, who holds teaching posts at the California Institute of the Arts and  Harvard University, has also changed his composition style since early in his  career when outrageous avant-garde theater and music were going through a  heyday. He defends the return of tonality in new music.  </P> <P> "The myth with this type of music is that intellectualism goes away if the  music becomes more intuitive," he said. "But if you examine the canons in Steve  Reich's 'Desert Music' or the intricacies in the scores of John Adams or Morton  Subotnick, the complexity is there, even if the music sounds simpler than  something by Elliot Carter."  </P> <P> Executive director Jeanette O'Conner, who has served in some capacity with the  festival for the last 11 years, admits that the subscription rate this year is  lower than in the past -- down 10% from last year. But she says she has no  regrets as she leaves the Ojai Festival to become the director of development  for Chamber Music America in New York next year.  </P> <P> "After all, traditions are made to be broken," she said. "In Ojai, the locals  have tended to view the event as crazy music plus Bach and Mozart. This year,  the strong element will be the crazy music."  </P> <P> Tickets are availble by calling (800) 554-OJAI. Single ticket prices range from  $10-$27.50 per concert, $50-$125 for the entire series of five concerts. Three  special concerts are not included in the series price.  </P> <P> </P></p>

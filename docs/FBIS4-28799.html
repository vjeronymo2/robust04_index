			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  reassured U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday [14 Jun] of  Japan's resolve to support possible UN sanctions against North  Korea, a Foreign Ministry official said.    "If a resolution is adopted, we will take responsible action  within the bounds of our constitution," the premier was quoted  as saying in a telephone talk with Clinton.    He was referring to a possible UN resolution calling for  sanctions against Pyongyang because it refuses to allow further  inspections of its nuclear facilities, suspected of being used  in a push to develop nuclear weapons.    During the 20-minute conversation, Clinton said the U.S.  perceives the North Korean nuclear issue as posing problems for  nuclear nonproliferation and global security, the official said.    The U.S. President also spoke of the need for the United  States, Japan and South Korea to take a united front in  persuading Pyongyang to allay international concerns over its  suspected nuclear program.    Clinton voiced grave concern over North Korea's reported  decision to immediately withdraw from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), adding the international community should  keep an eye on any move by the communist nation, the official  said.    North Korea said Monday it will immediately withdraw from  the  IAEA over the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog's "unreasonable  sanctions" and its attempt "to intrude even into our military  sites."    Noting China has to play a key role in encouraging North  Korea to clear its suspicions on its nuclear program, Hata said  Japan will keep in close touch and cooperate with the U.S. in  pursuit of resolution of the issue.    The premier also said he shares with Clinton the view that  the UN Security Council is nearing the stage of deciding on  appropriate steps, including sanctions, in dealing with North  Korea, the official said.    Hata denied Tokyo's reported reluctance to levy sanctions on  Pyongyang, saying it is way off the mark.    Asked to comment on Russia's proposal to call an eight-party  international conference to resolve the nuclear fray on the  Korean peninsula, Japan's chief executive responded he evaluates  highly Moscow's efforts but noted the Security Council's move  should not be affected by such a gathering.    While showing understanding of Hata's view, Clinton said the  U.S. will seek to cooperate with Russia on the matter, the  official said.</p>

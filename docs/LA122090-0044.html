			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ALL THE TRIMMINGS  </P> <P> By early this week, the Salvation Army in Torrance had filled two garages with  canned food donated by individuals, businesses and service organizations,  including Epson America, Del Amo Fashion Center, Kiwanis and Rotary clubs,  local schools and Scouting and YMCA groups.  </P> <P> The food, collected by city workers, will be distributed to about 150 needy  families before Christmas Day. Other South Bay groups are helping the needy  this holiday season. Among them are students at Peninsula Heritage School, who  collected canned food, toys and candy for the "Feed My People" program at  Rolling Hills Covenant Church, and the Sandpipers, a philanthropic organization  that expects to assist 43 families, including 131 children, with donations of  food, toys, clothes and money.  </P></p>

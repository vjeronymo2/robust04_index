			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy After yesterday's consumer credit figures for March, the pre-election picture of the UK economy is reassuringly complete. Even while sales were taking a temporary turn for the better in February, credit advances were slowing down. Retail sales were soft in the weeks before polling day because consumers had neither the need nor the inclination to borrow. It was scarcely surprising, then, that first-quarter figures for personal bank loans showed a reversal of the small increase in borrowing during the run-up to Christmas. More generally, it is perhaps worth asking whether the drift away from the use of credit by consumers means the series in question is an early candidate for rationalisation by the new boss of the Central Statistical Office. Arguably the broader credit series and monetary aggregates tell the same story more fully. But the more pressing problem is to divine what has been happening since the election. Statisticians and economists alike are waiting to see whether March's erratically soft numbers will be followed by an equally unreliable rebound. Hence the greater attention being paid to forward indicators such as consumer and business confidence. The Confederation of British Industry's survey of small companies provided welcome evidence that optimism has begun to permeate the lower reaches of the corporate sector. Equally, it suggested a degree of scepticism among managers about the pace of recovery. While orders are expected to increase, there will be only a modest rise in output. If nothing else, it looks as if high unemployment will be around for a while yet.</p>

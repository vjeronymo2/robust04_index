			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: South Korea may get Rover engine Kia Motors of South Korea is at an advanced stage of negotiations with Rover, the leading carmaker in the UK, for the production in Korea of Rover's planned top-of-the-range V6 engine. Mr Sun-Hong Kim, chairman of Kia Motors, visited Rover last week, and a final agreeement is expected to be signed next month. Kia is expected to produce the Rover engine under licence for use in a new range of executive cars, it plans to launch in 1995/96. The South Korean vehicle maker, in which Ford of the US owns a 10 per cent stake and Mazda of Japan an 8 per cent stake, is developing growing ties with the European motor industry. It reached agreement last week with Karmann, the German automotive engineering and production group, for the assembly in Germany of its Sportage four wheel drive sports-utility vehicle. It will become the first Korean vehicle maker with assembly in Europe with output planned to rise to 30,000 vehicles a year. It is also discussing with Group Lotus, the UK sports carmaker and automotive engineering consultancy, the possible transfer to Korea of production of the Lotus Elan sports car. Lotus was forced to stop production of the Elan in 1992 because of heavy losses. Now owned by Bugatti International, Lotus has re-started production of the Elan in a limited run of 800 units. Elan output in the UK is due to stop next year, however, when Lotus exhausts its present stock of engines, and it is negotiating the transfer of the sports car project to Korea. Kia's potential deal with Rover concerns the production in Korea of the UK carmaker's new V6 engine range in 2.0 and 2.5 litre versions. The V6 is being developed by Rover from its highly successful K-series engine range, produced in 1.1 and 1.4 litre four-cylinder versions. Larger 1.6 and 1.8 litre K-series engines are also under development.</p>

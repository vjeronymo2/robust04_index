			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat speculation takes centre stage in Milan ACTIVITY on the Continent was generally strong ahead of the weekend, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN turned its attention to Fiat after another report, this time in Business Week magazine, that it was about to sell a 40 per cent stake to Renault. The report was denied by both companies but, said Mr Guiseppe Bonini of Intersim in Milan, after a week out of the news, the market was sensitive to stories about the motor group. The latest report, following a 50 per cent rise in the Fiat share price over the last two months, which was not justified by fundamentals, had left investors again thinking that 'an announcement of some sort must be on the way,' he added. Fiat gained L171 to settle at L5,597 before continuing to L5,820 after hours. The rise was enough to spark a sharp early rally in a market that was also supported by the denial by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of reports that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato had come close to resigning. The Comit index closed down 0.56 at 496.66, or 3.4 per cent lower on the week. Banca Commerciale, which the government has said it will privatise after Credito Italiano, led the downturn, falling L156 to settle at L4,530, before dropping to L4,464 after-hours. FRANKFURT was slightly firmer on a day that was dominated by the expiration of options. However, the expected volatility in equities failed to materialise and the DAX index finished 2.62 higher at 1,698.81, down 0.5 per cent on the week. Turnover swelled to DM20.5bn from DM6.2bn. Reaction to Thursday's cut in the discount rate was generally muted. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities in London commented that the course steered by the Bundesbank would allow 'market rates in Germany and elsewhere to come down, probably with next week's repo. But it also conveys dissatisfaction with current levels of inflation and Bonn's efforts to cut spending.' Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley added that while last weekend's solidarity agreement was good news for the market it was not enough 'to address the underlying structural causes of Germany's recession'. With construction workers currently seeking pay rises of some 7 per cent, further rate cuts, he noted, were unlikely unless there was a settlement of around 3-4 per cent and further progress in reducing inflation. In the corporate sector Asko was one of the day's strongest performers with a rise of DM55 or 8 per cent to DM710 on slightly improved sales. PARIS went into the election weekend little changed on the day and the week: the CAC-40 index closing 0.83 lower at 1,962.69. With a victory for the centre-right widely forecast analysts have turned their attention to the effect a new government will have on the markets. With the franc under pressure on the currency markets speculators are expected to mount further attacks next week when the country is in a transitional state ahead of the second round of voting on 28th March - volatility in equities may be expected. Credit Lyonnais CI's were active, rising FFr35 to FFr575 on speculation that a new government might seek changes at the top of the management structure. Carnaud Metalbox was another high volume stock, although the shares closed just 90 centimes lower at FFr224.90 as bid hopes abounded. Elsewhere in second liners Skis Rossignol put on FFr91 or 9 per cent to FFr1,070 in very high volume which some analysts were unable to understand. ZURICH derived strength from Thursday's move to lower domestic interest rates and a clutch of corporate results and the market closed at an all-time high. The SMI index rose 28.5 to 2,182.6, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. 'The market had not been expecting the SNB to follow the Bundesbank's lead and cut rates, but it proved a very positive move,' said Miss Felicity Smith at Hoare Govett in London. Holderbank bearers - the day's most active issue - gained SFr12 to SFr662 on better than expected 1992 figures. Nestle, reporting next Wednesday, saw its bearers rise SFr30 to SFr1,185. Shares in machine maker Georg Fischer fell SFr15 to SFr760 after news of a 74 per cent plunge in 1992 profits and an announcement that the machine maker was omitting its dividend. AMSTERDAM was slightly stronger, helped by a firmer dollar, and the CBS Tendency index gained 0.1 to 107.7, closing a good week 3.3 per cent higher. Ahold was among the losers as investors reacted to its announcement on Thursday of a 1-for-10 rights issue, slipping Fl 1.00 to Fl 94.40. STOCKHOLM was heartened by signs that the opposition Social Democrats were willing to negotiate with the centre-right government over economic policy. The Affarsvarlden index ended 7.8 down at 1,007.2, for a weekly decline of 0.5 per cent. DUBLIN's central bank cut short-term interest rates and the market responded with a rise in the ISEQ overall index of 39.58 or 2.8 per cent to 1,461.48. COPENHAGEN was depressed by the suspension of Baltica, the country's biggest insurer, and the KFX index shed 0.73 to 80.83 in turnover of DKr493m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 19                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1148.16     1147.76     1147.56     1147.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1223.24     1222.14     1223.42     1223.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1146.55     1145.90     1145.89     1145.37 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1223.98     1225.03     1224.48     1223.70  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 18    Mar 17    Mar 16    Mar 15    Mar 12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.55   1146.10   1151.53   1153.62   1145.86 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1222.53   1214.92   1222.33   1219.52   1212.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1148.44 ; 200 - 1227.52 Low/day: 100 - 1145.21  200 - 1222.14.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

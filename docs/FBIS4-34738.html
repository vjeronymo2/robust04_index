			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Claudia Schuffner] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Souza Cruz Company confirmed that it  had made two shipments of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco to the  United States. This type of tobacco has twice as much nicotine  as regular tobacco (6 percent as compared to the average 3  percent). Production of the Y-1 tobacco has been banned in the  United States. Y-1 was developed in a laboratory by the U.S.  company DNA Plant Technology. The U.S. Department of  Agriculture has banned both the production and export of seeds  of this type of tobacco.    David Kessler, director of the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration), reported that the Y-1 plant was grown in Brazil  because "U.S. manufacturers agreed that the nicotine content of  new varieties of tobacco should be close to average levels,"  which vary from 2.5 to 3.5 percent. According to Souza Cruz,  Y-1 was produced at the request of the Brown and Williamson  Tobacco Co. The company's press office in Rio de Janeiro  reported that 850 tonnes were exported in 1991, and 253 tonnes  in 1992.    Souza Cruz adviser Victor Sznejder said the company filled  orders placed by Brown and Williamson as well as by 50 other  customers from different locations around the world. Yet of the  average 60,000 tonnes of tobacco of various species exported by  Souza Cruz, the only order for the Y-1 type came from Brown and  Williamson. Although denying that the plant had undergone  genetic changes, Souza Cruz could not explain how the seeds of  the Y-1 plant -- the patent rights for which Brown and  Williamson has claimed both in Brazil and the United States --  ended up in the hands of Brazilian farmers.    Souza Cruz does not produce tobacco in Brazil, but purchases  the production of 65,000 farmers in southern Brazil. These  farmers, however, could not have gained access on their own to  the genetic code of the Y-1 plant. Brown and Williamson may  have sent the seeds to Souza Cruz, which in turn may have turned  them over to the farmers. The two companies are close partners.  They are both controlled by BAT (British American Tobacco)  Industries, a British group that owns 100 percent of the assets  of Brown and Williamson and 75 percent of those of Souza Cruz.    In Brasilia, the Brazilian Government has announced that it  has no control over the nicotine content of cigarettes  manufactured in Brazil. Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry,  which is charged with monitoring tobacco production, reported it  has never heard of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco. The FDA  claimed that this type of tobacco, which has a high content of  nicotine and which increases addiction in smokers, is being  produced in Brazil.    Jose Meireles, chief of the Division of Production  Standardization and Supervision, said their control of Brazilian  tobacco is limited to "checking the health conditions of the  product." Government experts would verify, for instance,  excessive humidity or use of toxic pesticides. They do their  inspection with the naked eye, without laboratory analyses that  could measure the nicotine content.    Thus, Brazilian consumers do not have the slightest idea of  the tar or nicotine content of the tobacco used to manufacture  cigarettes in the country. In most cases, the experts rely on  the information supplied by the respective manufacturers.    Advisers of Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli have noted  that the ministry has no authority to check the quality of  export products. In the case of the Y-1 tobacco exported to the  United States, Law 5025 -- issued in 1966 -- provides that an  exporter will be held accountable for the quality of the product  he is selling. Agricultural experts are awaiting, however, to  receive the FDA report to discuss with Industry and Commerce  Ministry the mechanisms for controlling the tobacco being  exported.    The Health Ministry has announced that it has no authority  to  monitor the content of cigarettes. The ministry has issued only  one decree on the subject; it orders manufacturers to post the  warning that cigarette smoking is hazardous to human health on  each cigarette.</p>

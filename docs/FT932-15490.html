			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Cut-price cowboy: Marlboro's falling sales say more about the market than the brand Since the late 1980s, brands have acquired cult status in western business, where faith in their supposedly guaranteed earning power has prompted many high-priced corporate takeovers. However, Philip Morris's recent decision to slash the price of Marlboro cigarettes in an effort to reverse their declining share of the US market suggests that faith needs to be re-examined. Marlboro is one of the few genuinely global brands. Like Coca-Cola, McDonalds and Sony, it commands instantaneous recognition almost everywhere. In many poorer parts of the world, its American imagery also makes it a powerful aspirational symbol, promising status, stylishness and a better standard of living. These are just the sorts of qualities which make strong brands desirable assets - their firm grip on consumer loyalty is supposed to enable them to ride above the competitive fray, piling up profits while lesser rivals scrabble in the dust. Only last year, a US business magazine pronounced Marlboro the world's most valuable brand worth by the magazine's calculation Dollars 31bn. So what has gone wrong? Conventional wisdom holds that brands usually lose their effectiveness when starved of advertising and marketing support. But Philip Morris cannot be faulted on that score. It has regularly backed Marlboro with an annual marketing budget of more than Dollars 100m in the US alone - four times the spending by its closest rival. How well that money has been spent is, of course, debatable. Some critics believe the Marlboro cowboy, the brand's long-established symbol, may be out of tune with the times. It is also true that regulatory controls on tobacco advertising in the US - and many other countries - have limited the range of persuasive techniques producers can legally deploy. However, the most plausible explanation for Marlboro's falling sales lies not with the brand but with the product. Faced with a growing choice of cheaper alternatives, many US smokers seem to have concluded that Marlboro cigarettes do not offer anything special enough to justify a premium price. If so, that leaves Philip Morris with a problem - though far from a unique one. Many products which once traded heavily on marketing imagery have recently encountered growing consumer resistance. Grocery manufacturers' brands face increasing pressure from supermarkets' cheaper own-label lines, while discount retailers flourish. German luxury cars have been successfully challenged by less expensive Japanese rivals. American Express business credit cards - synonymous with the executive expense account - have fallen on leaner times. Recessionary belt-tightening is partly to blame. But it is not just that consumers are spending less; they have also become more discriminating about getting genuine value at all price levels. Customers have not deserted Mercedes-Benz for ordinary family saloons but for marques such as Toyota's Lexus, which are comparably engineered and equipped. Other charge cards now offer more cheaply services once unique to American Express. The profitability of leading British supermarkets owes much to their success in offering high quality own-label groceries which compete directly with the brand leaders. Threatened brand leaders cannot regain supremacy simply by cutting prices or increasing advertising if the products and services they offer are no longer competitive. Consumers need to be convinced that, by paying more, they are getting something demonstrably different or better. In a few cases, such as scotch whisky, where heritage and provenance are important, this may be possible by emphasising exclusivity. But usually the answer must involve improving existing products and developing new ones. Most well-known brands, for example, Coca Cola, grew originally out of product innovations. Long-lasting ones owe their longevity to their owners' continued resourcefulness and business skills. Superior processing technology and manufacturing know-how are important elements in the enduring success of Nescafe and Kellogg's breakfast cereals. The competitive strength of Benetton and Marks and Spencer depends heavily on their sophisticated arrangements with suppliers. Swatch has prospered by allying fashion flair with exceptionally rapid product development and highly efficient production. A problem for branded cigarette manufacturers is that there is little they can usefully do to improve on or differentiate the basic product. RJR's disastrous project to develop a smoke-less cigarette a few years ago proves the point. Nor are scale economies in production or distribution of critical importance. If advertising imagery fails to keep consumers loyal, competition in the industry may increasingly be based on price. The central lesson is that a brand's value is determined ultimately by the quality of the product or service to which it is attached and of the business producing it. A strong brand is not a guarantee of success. It is the reward earned - often over a long period - by a company adding value by consistently satisfying customers and staying ahead of the competition. At a time when corporate performance in many industries depends increasingly on attributes such as reputation and service, there is a genuine need for more precise methods to measure the value of intangibles. But the issues have so far been as much obscured as clarified by the recent debate over the merits of putting brands on balance sheets. Efforts to put a price on brands involve, at best, highly subjective judgments and amount, at worst, to a mechanistic checklist exercise. But however diligently carried out, they are necessarily coloured by past performance. They offer few verifiable insights into how and why that performance was achieved and, hence, whether it can be maintained. But in the real world, that is what really counts.</p>

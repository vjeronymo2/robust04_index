			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Ankara (AA)--[passage omitted] Foreign Ministry  spokesman Ferhat Ataman replied to a question by an ANATOLIA  correspondent at the end of a news conference in Ankara today.  Ataman declared that Turkey welcomes the U.S. State Department's  report on terrorism in 1993 from two aspects.    Ataman said that the fact that the separatist PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] organization was described as a terrorist  organization in the report shows that the message Turkey wishes  to convey to the world is being received, particularly in the  United States. The spokesman noted that it is extremely  important that world public opinion recognize the true nature of  the separatist organization.    Secondly, Ataman remarked, the report identifies the  separatist organization as the main reason for the increase in  world terrorism last year. He added: "This is also a very  important point."    Ataman stated that if certain other countries start sharing  the same view regarding the separatist terrorist organization,  this will constitute a very important development in the  struggle against terrorism.    The section of the report concerning Turkey also listed  Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] as a terrorist organization.</p>

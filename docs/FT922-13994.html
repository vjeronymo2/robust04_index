			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UN chief appeals on Cyprus THE United Nations secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, has appealed for a more concerted international drive to solve the Cyprus problem, a solution to which remains as elusive as ever in spite of intensive UN mediating efforts. In his first report on the Cyprus issue since assuming office, Mr Boutros Ghali has asked the UN Security Council to play a more active role in brokering a settlement, warning at the same time that the UN would not be able for much longer to maintain a peace-keeping force in Cyprus 'at the present scale'. Mr Boutros Ghali was forced to admit that the repeated efforts made by his representatives over the past year to bridge the gap between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities had produced not only no progress, but in certain areas, even 'regression'. He warned that if his fresh effort to reach a settlement did not succeed, consideration would have to be given to 'an alternative course of action'. He did not spell out what course of action he had in mind. He said the lack of progress had led to an increasing unwillingness on the part of the countries in the 2,150-strong peace-keeping force, first sent to the island in 1964, to continue contributions.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commission paves way for wider Europe The European Commission yesterday agreed on further steps to speed up integration of central and eastern Europe into the European Union, including changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and a possible softening of anti-dumping measures against cheap imports. The proposals are meant to signal that the EU is serious about building a 'wider Europe'. The goal is to submit a substantial package of measures to the European summit in Essen in December. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, said the Commission paper offered faster liberalisation of east-west trade, more financial aid, and practical steps to allow central and east Europeans to adopt progressively the EU's economic and legal system. The paper is the result of a review of trade, aid and competition policy and the operation of the CAP toward the six 'associate' EU member states: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Among the proposals are: A timetable for harmonising legislation and technical rules to achieve common European standards covering each EU aspirant. A single authority in each associate country to monitor and control state aid, and to prepare an inventory of state aid with the Commission. A pledge to inform any associate member before launching anti-dumping or safeguard clauses against cheap imports. The Commission favours 'a clear preference for price undertakings rather than anti-dumping duties'. Though carefully worded, a pledge to review the EU's farm exports to eastern Europe 'to address any serious imbalance in east-west trade'. The paper notes eastern farm exports, particularly livestock, slumped from a surplus in 1990 to a deficit of Ecu433m (Pounds 340m) in the first 11 months of 1993. An overhaul of the Phare aid programme which has pumped more than Ecu1bn of technical aid into eastern Europe in the past four years. Officials want multi-annual programmes, and an end to the condition that no more than 15 per cent of the Phare budget can fund trans-European networks, the huge east-west road and rail programmes. The Commission also believes funding for the EU's programme to aid eastern Europe should be guaranteed over the next five years. Speeding up trade concessions to Bulgaria and Romania to bring them into line with other east European countries. Sofia and Bucharest would be granted free trade in industrial goods by 1995, in steel by 1996 and in textiles by 1997.</p>

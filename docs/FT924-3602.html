			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Civil Engineering: Oceanographic research centre The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) has awarded WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION SOUTHERN a Pounds 29m contract to build the Southampton Oceanography Centre. Wimpey is set to start work on the project, which is jointly funded by NERC and the University of Southampton, in the New Year. The development at Empress Dock, adjacent to Ocean Village, will be a striking addition to the Southampton waterfront. Set on a five hectare site, the project comprises a multi-storey, brick clad and concrete framed building offering 22,000 sq metres of research and teaching facilities for the Research Council. The centre will act as the national focus for all subjects of oceanographic research, training and teaching. It brings together NERC's Institute of Oceanographic Sciences Deacon Laboratory and its Research Vessel Services as well as the University of Southampton's departments of oceanography and geology, and the underwater acoustics group from the faculty of engineering and applied science. Along with a research aquarium, temperature controlled investigation areas and test tanks, the development will also house the National Oceanographic library.</p>

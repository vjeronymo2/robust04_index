			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (7): Perks are curbed - UK company policy The ways in which companies allocate executive cars not only give an indication of the general health of UK companies but also provide an idea of the difficulties that they may have in recruiting and holding senior people. The latest clutch of surveys about the company car market suggest that, while the UK economy is improving, there is no shortage of talent available and that corporations can be less generous in their car allocation policies. For example, Lex Vehicle Leasing, in its latest Report on Motoring, draws the conclusion that business confidence in Britain is on the rise, because the average age of the company car went down from 2.8 years in 1992 to 2.5 years in 1993. This reverses a three-year trend. Moreover, Lex points out that the number of company cars on Britain's roads rose slightly last year, from 2.65m in 1992 to 2.7m. 'Companies make investment decisions, like replacing company vehicles, when they are confident that the business climate is improving. I think these results indicate a turn-round in business outlook,' says Mr Jon Walden, Lex Vehicle Leasing's managing director. However, a survey by William M. Mercer, the consulting actuarial group, suggests that those companies making or contemplating changes to their company car policies are gearing up to be less generous and more restrictive. For example, nearly half of the surveyed companies that have made changes extended their replacement criteria, as 16 per cent of those contemplating changes intend to do. 'Replacement of a company car at over 75,000 miles is now almost as common as replacement between 60,000 and 75,000 miles. Replacement at over three years and up to four is now more common than at over two years and up to three,' Mercer reports. Its survey also shows that a higher percentage of organisations employing fewer than 5,000 are restricting the number of people eligible for company cars. The main reason given by companies making such changes was 'cost containment'. Mercer gives an indication of typical company-car costs, as at June last year, for various management groups. The median average salary for directors and partners in the companies surveyed was Pounds 60,000, and the purchase price for their company cars was Pounds 25,000. Senior managers' median average salary was Pounds 40,000, and their car purchase price was Pounds 19,000. The finding for middle managers was a median average salary of Pounds 28,000 and a median average car price of Pounds 15,500. For the junior management/specialist, the salary was Pounds 20,000, and the car price was Pounds 12,800. Monks' Guide to Company Car Policy, published in collaboration with Lease Plan UK, gives an indication of the cash limits - that is, the maximum permitted outlay - for company cars. It suggests the median cash limit for chief executives was Pounds 30,500; for other directors it was Pounds 26,000; for senior managers the limit was Pounds 22,000; while for area sales managers it was Pounds 14,000. And what do executives choose for their money? According to Monks, a remuneration consultancy, 22 per cent of company chairman want a Jaguar and 16 per cent a Mercedes. Rover comes a distant third in the desirability stakes at 7 per cent. Jaguars are also the choice of 32 per cent of chief executives, followed by BMW and Mercedes (17 and 15 per cent). Some 8 per cent of chief executives choose Rover. 'Other directors' put BMW top of their list of choices in a close-run race. Some 18 per cent choose BMW, 15 per cent Jaguar, 12 per cent Rover, 11 per cent Ford and 10 per cent Mercedes. Senior managers put Rover and Ford neck and neck with 19 per cent each, followed by Vauxhall, with 17 per cent, and BMW, 13 per cent. Vauxhall moves to the top of the popularity poll with area sales managers, being the choice of 30 per cent, followed by Ford, with 22 per cent, and Rover, 15 per cent. Monks' research tells a similar story to Mercer's. It says: 'Although the majority of directors and senior managers are permitted the choice of any car, subject to a price limit, a matched sample of comparison shows that an increasing percentage are being restricted to a defined list of models. In the important area of sales, an increasing number of companies are either permitting sales representatives no choice or no longer permitting the choice of any car.' Companies are also attempting to cut the provision of fuel for private motoring. Monks reports a 'marginal reduction' in the number of companies providing this perk. 'The findings continue the trend observed in 1993 of an increase in the percentage of companies offering no fuel and a decrease in the number offering some,' it says. However, 'the more senior the employee, the more likely he or she is to receive fuel for private motoring.' And when are senior managers entitled to change their company cars? Monks says 37 per cent of chief executives can replace their cars after three years. A further 48 per cent keep their cars for more than three years. The most popular mileage for a change is 60,000 (24 per cent) but 32 per cent of companies do not specify a mileage limit for their chief executives. The pattern is very similar for 'other directors,' with 38 per cent exchanging cars at three years and a further 50 per cent keeping them for more than three years. Once again, the most popular mileage limit was 60,000 (25 per cent) and 28 per cent of companies specified no mileage. Another sign that companies want more value for money from their company cars - no matter what the user might feel about it - comes when Monks reports 'a continued increase in the number of companies choosing 80,000 as a mileage limit (for all their cars), with four years now being the most popular time period for replacement.'</p>

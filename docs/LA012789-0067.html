			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPENING IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> The U.S. State Department is taking seriously an offer by leaders of El  Salvador's guerrilla movement to participate peacefully in presidential  elections later this year. A spokesman says that the government of President  Jose Napoleon Duarte shares Washington's view of the proposal. It should be  taken seriously enough for Duarte to call for resumption of negotiations with  the rebels.  </P> <P> Previously the five guerrilla groups that make up the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front had refused to accept the legitimacy of the elections  scheduled for March 19. They have been fighting the Salvadoran political system  for almost 10 years, striking at governments run both by military juntas and,  more recently, by U.S.-backed civilian leaders like Duarte. FMLN leaders  insisted that their popular support could not be measured by voting, and they  refused to lay down their arms until they were granted a share of political  power in El Salvador.  </P> <P> Their offer to reverse that stance caught both the Duarte government and the  Bush Administration -- still trying to get settled in Washington -- by  surprise, although it is encouraging to see the White House recover so nimbly.  The rebels did not change their position on giving up their arms, but they are  willing to stop fighting for five days before the voting, to agree not to  interfere with campaigning or balloting as they have done in past elections,  and to accept the outcome of the vote. In return, they ask that the election be  postponed until September and that the government guarantee the safe  participation of their political representatives in the electoral process.  </P> <P> The initial reaction in San Salvador was disappointingly legalistic. Government  officials said that the voting cannot be postponed under the Salvadoran  constitution. They seemed to overlook the fact that El Salvador's current  constitution is only a few years old and was written under wartime conditions.  Such documents can be revised when circumstances warrant, and this may be such  a case.  </P> <P> Duarte should brush aside extreme rightists and military leaders who want to  reject the plan, and he should use the proposal as an opening to resume the  dialogue that he began with the guerrillas three years ago and that has  recently been stalled. The State Department's reaction certainly would  strengthen Duarte's hand in any confrontation with the Salvadoran right. The  United States provides about half the revenue that the Salvadoran government  needs to operate -- not just to wage its counterinsurgency effort but also to  feed its people. That alone should discourage extreme elements from trying to  interfere in any way with the chances for peace.  </P> <P> More than 60,000 persons have died in the 10 years since the Salvadoran civil  war broke out, and one-fifth of that small nation's 5 million people have been  displaced by the fighting. For the last several months, since it was revealed  that Duarte is dying of cancer, there has been no movement toward peace in the  country. In fact, the war has actually escalated, with renewed atrocities  committed by both sides. Until the rebel offer was made public, the prospects  for an improvement of any sort in El Salvador were bleak. Now there is a  glimmer of real hope that must not be extinguished without being fully  explored.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by O.Yu. Ivanov, V.G. Kobernichenko, and L.B. </F> Neronskiy; UDC 621.396.96]    [Abstract] A quasi-optimum but fast algorithm is proposed  for digital radar aperture synthesis: subdivision of the  reference function _O_ into M not overlapping time intervals  (subapertures) with K readings in each and simplified data  processing in each. For specificity is considered formation of a  continuous radar image by the method of subframes, namely from  (1  _D_N  N) readings taken along the signal path  with  partial change of information in the memory of the aperture  processor after every image forming stroke. For usually small  subapertures K and subframes _D_N the the two steps of the  algorithm are:  1) formation of M subaperture sums, after phase correction of  each input reading;  2) formation of _D_N output readings from the M subaperture  sums, after additional phase correction and then another  summation. The main advantage of this algorithm over the basic  one is that the same and only the same M subaperture sums are  used for formation of the _D_N output readings, inasmuch as the  weight function included in the reference function remains  constant within a subframe. Consequently, in the case of _D_N =  K formation of each new reading for the output image requires  only 2M complex multiplications and additions and thus K/2 times  fewer than are required for conventional convolution. The  algorithm will be still faster when a fast Fourier  transformation is performed during execution of the second step.  An analysis of the radiation pattern of an antenna with a thus  synthesized aperture indicates that both the width of the major  lobe and the height of the first minor lobe are determined  principally by the radiation pattern of the array multiplier,  which corresponds to a focused antenna of the same dimensions.  The radiation pattern of a subaperture remains constant within a  subframe and changes by jumps from one subframe to another.  Figures 3; references 4.</p>

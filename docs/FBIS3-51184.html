			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The "feud" between the United States and the PRC  should not affect Brazilian businesses, even though the United  States is the number one importer of Brazilian products. Luiz  Americo Medeiros, the chairman of the Textile Industry Trade  Union (Sinditextil), has stated that "when the United States  cuts the quota of one country it does not necessarily increases  that of another. On the contrary, it increasingly seeks to  apply more restrictions." Medeiros noted that the United States  finds it easy to curtail the PRC's quota because the latter has  not yet joined the GATT. The bilateral agreement between Brazil  and the United States expires on 31 March and will be  automatically renewed for another year.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Green light to avoid confusion (2) Sir, John Murphy underestimates the wit of most shoppers. Most of them can read and understand monosyllabic four-letter (and shorter) words such as: 'Try this new Cola.' If a product suits in terms of price and quality, the consumer will buy it regardless of how it is presented. As to the 'research' from the British Producers and Brand Owners in which it claims that consumers are 'confused', in the immortal words, 'they would say that wouldn't they?'

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: FLESH AND BLOOD BY FRANCOIS MAURIAC (CAROL &amp; GRAF:  $8.95)  </P> <P> Set in the Gironde region of France, this bleak novel presents a three-sided  conflict: the decadence of the flesh versus antiseptic renunciation versus a  reverent embrace of life's possibilities. These qualities are embodied in  Edward, a languid young drone; his sister, May, whose cowardice leads her to  deny both her passion and her talent, and Claude, a pious young man who  abandons the seminary to return to life as peasant-laborer. Like oil in water,  these characters pass through each other's lives but never really interact. The  eddies caused by their passage are soon calmed, and each proceeds to his  destiny: to suicide, to a loveless marriage, to wholesome physical labor that  forges a bond with the enduring land. Gerard Hopkins' translation captures the  essence of Mauriac's style, but the text is littered with typos, including a  description of Edward acting from "an access of zeal."  </P></p>

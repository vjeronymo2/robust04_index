			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIMITS ON TV ADS AIMED AT KIDS  </P> <P> I found it difficult to read your editorial without snickering. Are you  kidding? Have you seen what's available on television these days? I suppose by  limiting advertisements to 12 minutes per hour children will wallow in the  educational benefits from the remaining 48 minutes of quality programming like  "Muppet Babies."  </P> <P> Parents aren't going to save their children from "brain death" until they  finally pull them away from the tube. I think it's time people stop asking  Congress to solve their own problems and start taking responsibility for their  parental obligations.  </P> <P> DOUG BENNINGTON  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPLOSION, FIRE KILL 2 CREWMEN ON U.S. CARRIER  </P> <P> An explosion and fire killed two crewmen on the aircraft carrier America, the  third fatal fire aboard a U.S. warship in less than a month.  </P> <P> The Norfolk-based carrier was in the Atlantic several hundred miles off North  Carolina when the explosion occurred in a fuel pump room about 7 p.m. Saturday,  said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman.  </P> <P> "Shipboard firefighters successfully extinguished the fire with no additional  casualties," said a statement issued by the Atlantic Fleet's Naval Air Force  headquarters.  </P> <P> John said a team of investigators, including structural and fuel experts, would  be flown to the America to assess the damage and determine the cause of the  explosion. He would not speculate on possible causes of the blast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hours to Cool Pump Room  </P> <P> "The fire was very quickly isolated and brought under control, said Lt. Cmdr.  Steve Burnett. "But because of the intense heat . . . it took several hours to  cool the pump room," he said.  </P> <P> The flames and damage were believed confined to the pump room, he said.  </P> <P> The ship, which left Norfolk on Thursday with a crew of about 5,000, continued  on its mission, a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian  Ocean.  </P> <P> "At this time, we see no reason to cut the mission short," John said. "The  vessel is able to continue."  </P> <P> On April 19, an explosion and fire in a gun turret killed 47 sailors aboard the  Norfolk-based battleship Iowa off the coast of Puerto Rico. Last Tuesday, six  sailors died in an engine room fire on the supply ship White Plains in the  South China Sea.  </P> <P> Lt. Paul Jenkins, a Navy spokesman, said it is highly unusual for the Navy to  have three fatal shipboard fires in a month, but he said that "there's no  evidence to link these three isolated incidents. The Navy's overall safety  record is superb."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Miles of Piping'  </P> <P> The victims of Saturday's fire apparently were working in the pump room at the  time of the explosion, Jenkins said. Aircraft carriers have "miles and miles of  piping" through which jet fuel is circulated by several pumps, he said.  </P> <P> The America, built in Newport News in the early 1960s and commissioned in 1965,  is 1,047 feet long, roughly the length of 3 1/2 football fields.  </P> <P> John said the investigators, who were to leave Norfolk no later than today,  would determine whether to repair the vessel during its tour of duty or wait  until the carrier returns to port.  </P> <P> The two crewmen killed were identified as Petty Officer 3rd Class Richard E.  Childress, 22, of Ham Lake, Minn., and Airman Recruit Larry J. Brunson, 19, of  Akron, Ohio. The Navy said their remains would be flown to Norfolk.  </P></p>

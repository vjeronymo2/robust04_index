			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday [11 June] Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev  said Kyrgyzstan was doomed to remain a long time yet on the  sidelines of economic progress. Akayev was speaking at a  conference at the Slavic University, in Bishkek.    In Akayev's view, the republic's geopolitical position did  it  little credit. Kyrgyzstan was a land-locked Republic and lacked  other trade communications. Very soon, he said, the republic  would depend on its neighbors and especially on Russia because  economically developed nations felt Central Asia as a whole,  including Kyrgyzstan, lay in a zone of their interests.    But, Akayev said, the Republic's industrial potential failed  to call for serious foreign investment because Kyrgyzstan was  unable to save its industrial infrastructure. And that was why,  he said, the government had to discontinue the production of  many items.    According to Akayev, political instability and the absence  of  government guarantees impeded foreign investment in the Kyrgyz  economy. So, he said, Kyrgyzstan would be unlikely to build up  its international rating in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>

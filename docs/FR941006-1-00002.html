The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, including EIA. A viral disease of equines, EIA, also known as swamp fever, may be characterized by sudden fever, swelling of the legs and lower parts of the body, severe weight loss, and anemia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 75.4(a) of the regulations defines an EIA reactor as any horse, ass, mule, pony or zebra which is subjected to an official test and found positive. Under &sect;75.4(b) of the regulations, no EIA reactor may be moved interstate unless the reactor is officially identified and meets certain other requirements. Section 75.4(a) of the regulations defines ``officially identified'' as the permanent identification of a reactor with markings permanently applied by an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative, a State representative, or an accredited veterinarian using a hot iron or chemical brand, freezemarking or a lip tattoo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APHIS believes that EIA reactors could be moved interstate to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance, as an alternative to being officially identified prior to the interstate movement. Moving EIA reactors interstate to slaughter under a permit and in a sealed conveyance would ensure that the animals are not diverted for other uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, we are proposing to amend the requirements for interstate movement in &sect;75.4(b) by adding a provision stating that ``Official identification is not necessary if the animal is moved directly to slaughter, traveling under a permit and in a sealed conveyance.'' In addition, we propose to add definitions to &sect;75.4(a) for ``official seal'' and ``permit.'' An official seal would be defined as a ``serially numbered metal or plastic strip, or a serially numbered button, consisting of a self-locking device on one end and a slot on the other end, which forms a loop when the ends are engaged and which cannot be reused if opened. It is applied by an APHIS representative or State representative.'' A permit would be defined as an ``official document (VS Form 1&hyph;27 or a State form which contains the same information, but not a `permit for entry') issued by an APHIS representative, State representative, or accredited veterinarian which lists the owner's name and address, points of origin and destination, number of animals covered, purpose of the movement, and one of the following: The individual animal registered breed association registration tattoo, individual animal registered breed association registration number, or similar individual identification, including name, age, sex, breed, color, and markings.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELDERLY SUICIDE: MORE THAN A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH  </P> <P> "Suicide Is a Tragic Secret for the Elderly." True, but think again. I would  say Daniel Rosenthal chose the easiest way to go -- a quick death. I am 84 and  I have no intention of just wasting away in a nursing home. When I cannot  function as a normal human being, out I go.  </P> <P> I have an idea that I hope will eventually be accepted by the civilized world:  Let all of us who wish have hypodermic syringes filled with quick death, which  we, ourselves, can inject in our veins.  </P> <P> MADELEINE S. WILLIAMSON  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

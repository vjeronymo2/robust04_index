			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered Oh dear, oh dear] Standard Chartered just cannot seem to manage a year without finding a banana skin to tread on. The latest one - the securities scandal in Bombay - has cost more than Pounds 300m, much more than Standard expected at the half year. Exchange movements have since aggravated the problem and weak local financial markets have eaten into its collateral, but at least the bank has not suddenly discovered any new exposure. Its higher provision reflects a more sober reflection of what it can recover from the wreckage in a country where it is unpopular and singularly lacking in influence. Strip away India, though, and it is easy to see why the market greeted yesterday's results by pushing the shares up 3 per cent. Other net provisions may grow this year, simply because there will be no repeat of the recoveries from GPI Leisure and MiniScribe. Yet operating earnings are steaming ahead and the tax rate, which has been pushed up by the Indian general provision and unrelieved ACT, should come down. Standard's dividend costs only Pounds 47m. Even after a large real increase, it should have enough retained earnings to push its tier one capital well over 5 per cent. On that basis, the shares are cheap, but only because rational analysis does not allow for the kind of nasty surprise which has become a Standard Chartered hallmark.</p>

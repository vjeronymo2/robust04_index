Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of North  Ossetia, today sent a telegram to Boris Yeltsin expressing  categorical disagreement with the assertions of the Ingush  president. The position of the Ingush president is described as  a "desire to draw the federal authorities into resolving the  complex refugee problem by force, to destabilize the situation  and hamper the normal process of preparing for and holding  elections for president of the Republic of North Ossetia on 16  January."    "Attempts to impose conditions from the outside while  resolving internal matters of our republic," the telegram says,  "are leading to the disruption of the difficult negotiating  process of settling the relations between the peoples of the  neighboring republics and are aggravating the situation in North  Caucasus."</p>

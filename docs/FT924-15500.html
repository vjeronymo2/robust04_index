			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps Adwest rise to Pounds 7.5m RESTRUCTURING appears to be paying off at Adwest, the engineering, property and power systems company, which yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.53m. Mr Fred Grant, chairman, said that failing the long promised economic recovery, 'any success we have been able to achieve has been largely of our own making.' He remained cautious about the current year, despite a good first quarter. 'We are running the business on a very short rein   . but we can still see soft spots in the economy.' Operating profits for the year to June 30 increased by 12 per cent to Pounds 10.1m on sales just 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 127m. A significant turnround in the power systems division, which includes the previously loss-making defence business, was partly behind the increase. Power systems had contributed slightly more than one-third of operating profits, against about a quarter last time. Defence acounted for about Pounds 20m of total sales. The automotive division, which supplies components to Land Rover, Jaguar, and Peugeot, had increased margins despite a Pounds 1m loss in the power steering business. Mr Graham Menzies, managing director, said he was reasonably confident that the power steering operation would be profitable in the current year, following the closure of a factory and increased sales to Japanese manufacturers such as Nissan. Property profits were down by Pounds 1m to about Pounds 4m. The decline was due to the absence of exceptional dealing profits which came to Pounds 1.25m in 1991. Mr Grant said the company had sold 186 houses in its joint venture with Bryant, compared with 146 last time. However, a move towards smaller houses meant the average price fell from Pounds 84,000 to Pounds 79,000. Margins had also declined. The rent roll on the group's investment properties had been increased from Pounds 2m last year to Pounds 2.5m. After two years of restructuring, Adwest had cut costs as far as possible, Mr Grant said. About 800 jobs had been eliminated in the past two years, bringing the total to 2,485. The emphasis now would be on increasing productivity. The company was confident that it could increase sales per employee from Pounds 51,500 to Pounds 55,000 in the current year. Earnings per share were 0.4p higher at 8.6p and the final dividend was maintained at 5.75p for a total of 7p. The shares rose 7p to close at 120p.</p>

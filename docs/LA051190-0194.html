			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VEGETABLES PACE 0.3%;  </P> <P> WHOLESALE PRICE DROP  </P> <P> A second steep drop in vegetable costs helped push wholesale prices down 0.3%  overall in April, the government said today.  </P> <P> It was the sharpest decline since August and the third consecutive moderate  report after a severe cold snap sent prices spiraling 1.8% in January, a  15-year record.  </P> <P> The Labor Department's producer price index for finished goods, one stop short  of retail, had fallen 0.2% in March and showed no change in February. The  monthly numbers are all adjusted for seasonal variations.  </P> <P> For the first four months of the year, wholesale inflation was running at a  4.2% annual rate, down from 4.8% for all of 1989.  </P> <P> "The numbers are increasingly ratifying the fact that we've dodged the  inflationary bullet, at least for a while," said Dirk Van Dongen, president of  the National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. "The bad news is that maybe the  soft landing (economic slowdown) is a little softer than we would like."  </P> <P> In April, food prices fell 0.6% after an identical 0.6% decline a month  earlier. Prices rose for eggs, rice, pasta and pork. They fell for fruit,  chicken, cooking oils and candy.  </P> <P> Vegetable prices, which fell 25.5% in March after record increases the previous  two months, fell another 31.1% last month. It was the biggest drop since the  government began tracking those costs in 1967. Tomato prices fell 73.3%.  </P> <P> "They are no longer boxing tomatoes in Florida because the boxes are worth more  than the tomatoes. . . . Thus the winter freeze is nothing more . . . than a  bad memory," said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.  </P> <P> Energy prices dropped 1.7% after declining the two previous months. Gasoline  prices, with the start of the warm weather driving season, climbed 2.2%.  However, fuel oil fell 1.9% while natural gas dropped 5.5%.  </P> <P> Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a modest 0.2% after  rising a moderate 0.3% in March. Economists said this "core" number is often a  better indicator of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.  </P> <P> Automobile prices fell 0.9% in April. Clothing price inflation recovered from  increases a month earlier. Women's, men's and boys' clothing costs were  unchanged. Girls' and infants' clothing fell 0.2%.  </P> <P> Prices rose for medicines, soap, floor coverings and toys. They fell for  alcoholic beverages, jewelry and magazines.  </P> <P> Despite the moderate report for April prices at the wholesale level, economists  are still concerned that inflation may be accelerating this year.  </P></p>

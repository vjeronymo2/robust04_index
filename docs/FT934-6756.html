			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Citic arm forms China investment vehicle Citic Australia, part of the fast-expanding Beijing-based investment company, is joining with Hambros Australia to launch a quoted investment vehicle which will make direct equity investments in China. The new company aims to tap growing institutional interest in this area, and claims to be the first Australian company to focus on equity investment in China. The initial funds are relatively modest - 35m shares are being issued at ADollars 1 each. However, subscribers will also have an option to purchase one further share, at the same price, before May 1995. Citic and Hambros say that this is partly because of a requirement that 50 per cent of the funds raised be invested within six months. This could become difficult if the sums were larger, given the limited scale of Chinese stockmarkets. The aim is for about 25 per cent of the fund's assets to be invested in shares quoted on the Shanghai or Shenzhen exchanges. Foreigners can only buy 'B' shares, and only 13 companies on the SHSE and 19 on the SZSE offer these. However, the fund notes that several new issues are planned over the next nine months, and intends to keep around one-quarter of its assets liquid in order to participate in these offerings. It will also put about one fifth of the fund into unlisted groups. The remaining 30 per cent will be split between Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong, and companies listed elsewhere which do the bulk of their business in China.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Five-year pay pact offered by I G Metall THE leader of Germany's largest and most powerful trade union has offered the government five years of pay peace during which he would expect pay rises to do no more than preserve the purchasing power of his 3.5m members. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, who will today be re-elected as leader of the I G Metall engineering union, made the offer as the union's opening shot in the renewed debate about a 'solidarity pact' to place the financing of German unification on a sounder footing. The offer, made in an interview with the Financial Times, follows a suggestion from Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the German president, that unions should not seek increases in real wages for several years. 'We would be happy to make a pact in which, over the next five years, real wages would be protected. That would be a good basis for a solidarity pact,' said Mr Steinkuhler in Hamburg, where the I G Metall Congress opened on Sunday. The offer represents a small but significant concession by the union - which usually demands a cost of living increase plus a share in productivity improvements - and underlines that it is ready to contribute to a solidarity pact. However few of the unions' other ideas for such a pact are likely to find favour with the government. I G Metall, like the opposition Social Democrats, favours another round of tax increases to help finance unification but Mr Steinkuhler insists 'they must be more fairly distributed and cover a more realistic time period'. The union proposes a 'labour market' tax which would fall not just on employees but also on the self-employed and public officials. It wants a profits levy on companies not investing in east Germany. I G Metall itself is under growing pressure to relax an agreement, signed with the engineering employers in 1991, for a convergence of east German hourly wage rates to the west German level by 1994. German employers say unit labour costs in most of east German manufacturing plants are almost double west German levels, deterring badly needed investment. Mr Steinkuhler says the convergence agreement is not negotiable. The debate heated up yesterday, when Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, said he would introduce a law to allow renegotiation, if the unions and employers failed to agree such a move themselves. 'The Chancellor (Helmut Kohl) proposes a solidarity pact, and then Mollemann sabotages it,' an angry Mr Steinkuhler declared. Union faces up to German unification, Page 21</p>

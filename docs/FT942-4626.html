			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Battle joined in Russia over defence spending A fierce struggle over Russia's military budget is coming to a head in Moscow. On it may depend the survival of the government, further economic reform and the political neutrality and effectiveness of the armed forces. The struggle pits the military and defence industry against the still shaky reformist forces and their erratic push to create a functioning market economy. Big concessions to the military's demands for much higher spending - claimed by the defence establishment as essential if a military revolt is to be avoided - would destroy attempts to contain spending and control inflation to its present levels of under 10 per cent a month. The intensity of the fight reflects the lack of progress in two years of reform in restructuring the vast defence establishment, which includes the military forces, the reconstituted and expanded border guards, interior ministry troops and the intelligence operatives (former KGB). The military is underfunded, under-employed, badly housed, often unpaid and receptive to extreme nationalist and Communist influence and increasingly aggressive in its own defence. Pressure to increase military spending is beginning to tell on the country's democratic institutions. The state duma, or lower house of parliament, yesterday passed the 1994 budget within the limits set by the government - with income set at Rbs124,000bn and specified payments set at Rbs194,000bn - though it increased military spending from Rbs37,000bn to Rbs40,500bn, largely by cutting repayments of foreign debt. The Federation Council, or upper house, has already said it will increase military spending to Rbs55,000bn when it reviews the budget. But a senior military adviser close to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, warned yesterday that official spending of Rbs55,000bn would breach an important deficit pledge made by the prime minister to the International Monetary Fund and could force Mr Chernomyrdin's resignation. The official figure may greatly understate true spending. Mr Vitaly Shlykov, a former deputy Soviet and Russian defence minister and the country's main expert on military production, said the Rbs55,000bn figure was a 'game' and that true expenditure would inevitably be much higher because budget outlays not specifically identified as military would, in fact, be devoted to the services. . The crisis is deepened by the fact that budget income is now lagging well behind target. Mr Sergei Kondrashyev, deputy head of the finance ministry's military expenditure department, told a hearing of the state duma's defence committee on Tuesday that in the first five months of this year the ministry had received only 15 per cent of the year's total revenue - or 36 per cent of the revenue it should have collected for the period. Mr Shlykov said that President Boris Yeltsin had last month written to Mr Chernomyrdin, expressing his support for the higher spending on the military. Mr Chernomyrdin, who earlier this week flew to Germany for medical treatment, had so far held fast to the spending figure of Rbs40,500bn - but the pressure on him was now intense. 'The military and the defence industry are now fused together in a very powerful lobby,' said Mr Shlykov. 'We might see a change of government because of this struggle'. Old enemies, Page 23</p>

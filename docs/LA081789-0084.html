			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 PARTIES ENDORSE WALESA AS PREMIER;  </P> <P> TWO LONGTIME COMMUNIST ALLIES BOLT ALLIANCE, BACK SOLIDARITY COALITION  </P> <P> The Polish Communist Party's two longtime parliamentary allies bolted their old  coalition Wednesday and agreed to back a Solidarity-led government with Lech  Walesa as premier.  </P> <P> Solidarity lawmakers, with their new partners in the United Peasants' Party and  Democratic Party looking on, endorsed a resolution Wednesday night calling for  Walesa to be named premier at the head of what would be the first non-Communist  government in the East Bloc.  </P> <P> Earlier Wednesday, the United Peasants and Democratic parties voted to abandon  their alliance with the Communists that began 40 years ago and to join forces  with Solidarity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jaruzelski to Get Plan  </P> <P> The new coalition intends to present its plan today to President Wojciech  Jaruzelski, who retains the power to nominate the premier.  </P> <P> One Solidarity lawmaker, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said there are indications -- but  no firm assurances -- that Jaruzelski will agree to the plan if it carries the  approval of the three parties.  </P> <P> "We must take some risks," Kaczynski said.  </P> <P> During the day, Walesa appeared to give out conflicting signals as to whether  he would serve as premier of a new government. Before the Solidarity vote,  Walesa told the delegates of all three parties, meeting in the main chamber of  the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, that he would accept the post. "I never  dreamed that Lech Walesa could be premier," he said. "I never even imagined  it."  </P> <P> Early today, however, he was quoted as saying, "I will not be premier," and  adding, "There are better people than Walesa" for the job. But to complicate  matters further, he added that he had not yet made his final decision.  </P> <P> Walesa was greeted with loud applause as he arrived at the meeting from his  home in Gdansk. In a brief speech, he said the choice to enter government was a  difficult one, "but there is no other one, and we must undertake it. . . . We  came here to change Poland."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nod of Gratitude  </P> <P> He gave a special nod of gratitude to "our elder friends from the Peasants'  Party and Democratic Party" who earlier in the day had voted to endorse his  proposal to form a Solidarity-led coalition.  </P> <P> "Together we will teach the (Communist Party) pluralism, freedom and listening  to others," he said.  </P> <P> However, it remained uncertain whether the Communists, reeling from setback to  setback in the rush of political events, would turn over control of the  government. Communist lawmakers, in a separate meeting, appointed a group to  formulate a stand on the question, and there were signs of growing resistance  from Communist Party leaders. There was continuing uncertainty as well over the  reaction of the Soviet Union to the possibility of a Solidarity government in  Poland.  </P> <P> Communist Party leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, in what was described as an  emotional speech before a closed meeting of Communist members of the Sejm,  accused Walesa of violating the spirit of the "round-table" accords signed in  April. Those accords, signed by the government and the opposition, re-legalized  Solidarity and endorsed measures aimed at pulling Poland out of its political  and economic crisis.  </P> <P> "We have entered a period of an open fight for power," Rakowski said, according  to the official Polish news agency PAP. He urged the party to stand firm. "The  situation is dangerous," he said, "but it is not time to put up our hands."  </P> <P> Solidarity deputy Aleksander Paczynski opened the joint caucus of the new  opposition coalition, whose 264 votes should control the 460-member Sejm, with  two proposals certain to raise even more Communist alarm. He called for a  renegotiation of the round-table accords to bring about new and fully free  elections in two years instead of four, as the accords now state. And he  proposed shifting control of the Communist-run state television and radio to  the Parliament.  </P> <P> Through such "spectacular, quick decisions," Paczynski said, a Solidarity  government led by Walesa would ease public anger and impatience and demonstrate  that substantive changes are under way. The round-table accords should be  renegotiated, he said, because neither side should be bound by agreements  "reached in a different time, in a different situation and under different  circumstances."  </P> <P> The resolution passed by Solidarity lawmakers said that the "parliamentary  coalition of the Peasants' Party, the Democratic Party and Solidarity is  capable of forming a government of national responsibility under the leadership  of Lech Walesa in which all political forces of our country could be  represented, all forces which are determined to act in favor of political and  economic reform."  </P> <P> Walesa last week suggested that Solidarity was prepared to form Poland's new  government but that it would continue to reject Communist entreaties to join in  a Communist-led government.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ready to Step Aside  </P> <P> But the situation continued to develop rapidly when the newly elected premier,  Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, announced Monday that he was ready to step aside in  favor of Roman Malinowski, the United Peasants' Party leader. Malinowski,  Kiszczak said, had a better chance of forming a broad-based government.  </P> <P> Solidarity, however, quickly rejected Kiszczak's idea, and Malinowski's own  party gave it virtually no support. Malinowski himself has not commented on the  proposal, and his nomination now appears to be a dead issue.  </P> <P> Walesa said Tuesday, after insistent questioning from journalists, that he  would accept the post of premier "if society wants it" but insisted that he  preferred that someone else take the job.  </P> <P> He also said that if Solidarity did take over the government, it would leave  the sensitive interior and defense ministries in the hands of the Communists, a  pledge that was designed to ease nervousness in Moscow and in party  headquarters in Warsaw. He added that Solidarity would have no intention of  pulling Poland out of its Warsaw Pact military commitments with the Soviets.  </P> <P> The Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow mildly described Walesa's pledge as  "sensible."  </P> <P> "Poland is a member of the Warsaw Pact," said ministry spokesman Yuri A.  Gremitsky, "and Solidarity should make the necessary conclusions as a result of  that."  </P> <P> Gremitsky said the Soviet Union is "very much concerned" about the Polish  situation, but "we don't interfere in the internal affairs of that country,"  and he added, "The Polish people should decide themselves."  </P> <P> Newspaper commentaries in Moscow, however, have warned that a Solidarity  attempt to take the government could destabilize Poland and Europe and threaten  the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> In response to the Soviet concern over Poland, Adam Michnik, a Solidarity  member of Parliament and the editor of the journal Gazeta Wyborca, wrote  Tuesday that "Solidarity is not a movement that is in the grips of an  anti-Soviet phobia."  </P> <P> A continued push by Solidarity on the issue, which now seems likely, would  provide the first substantive test of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  toleration for East Bloc experiments in democracy.  </P> <P> As recently as July 6, in a speech before the European Parliament, Gorbachev  said that change "in some particular countries . . . is exclusively a matter  for the people themselves and of their choice." He added: "Any interference in  internal affairs, any attempts to limit the sovereignty of states -- both  friends and allies or anybody else -- are inadmissible."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Clear Indication  </P> <P> As the Polish reform experiment moves further into uncharted territory,  however, there is still no clear indication of whether the Communists would  actually relinquish power, regardless of the alliances in the newly elected  Parliament.  </P> <P> Another Communist Party official Wednesday appeared to cast grave doubt on the  question. Slawomir Wiatr, secretary of the party's Central Committee, said the  Polish party "would not take responsibility" for the consequences of a  Solidarity attempt to form a government.  </P> <P> "Every thinking man, the more so a politician," Wiatr said, "should realize  that we are not a state of parliamentary democracy yet. Having a majority in  Parliament is not in itself a sufficient condition to exercise power. It will  take us some time still to arrive at a system in which political parties will  be able to alternate as ruling parties without destructive results for the  state and society. We should all remember that."  </P> <P> President Jaruzelski called Tuesday for an urgent meeting of "main political  and social forces" to seek what he called "rational solutions" for Poland's  political impasse. No such meeting was held Wednesday, and the president's  office would not say when it might occur.  </P> <P> Walesa said he did not know when he would see Jaruzelski.  </P> <P> As the parliamentary caucus of Solidarity and the United Peasants and  Democratic parties began, it was uncertain when its resolution might be  introduced to the Sejm, but it seemed likely that intense behind-the-scenes  negotiations with the Communist leadership would be required first.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE PLAYERS IN POLAND  </P> <P> Solidarity's Lech Walesa has refused to accept any government led by newly  elected Communist Premier Czeslaw Kiszczak. Now two smaller parties, longtime  Communist allies, agree to back a Solidarity-led coalition, with Walesa as  premier.  </P> <P> COMMUNIST PARTY: On Aug. 2, Czeslaw Kiszczak was named Poland's premier and  immediately tried to persuade Solidarity to join a "grand coalition." But  Walesa, whose party holds 161 seats in the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament,  blocked that attempt. On Monday, Kiszczak said he would step aside in favor of  United Peasants' leader Roman Malinowski. But that idea also was rejected by  Solidarity when Malinowski's own party gave the idea virtually no support.  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY: Lech Walesa, although committed to a Solidarity-led government, is  issuing conflicting signals as to whether he would serve as premier. Solidarity  says that if it heads a new government, the sensitive ministries of interior  and defense would remain in the hands of the Communists.  </P> <P> UNITED PEASANTS' PARTY: Once regarded as the Communists' most important  partner, with 76 seats in the 460-seat Sejm. Led by Malinowski, a 54-year-old  economist, the United Peasants abandoned a four-decade Communist alliance and  endorsed a Solidarity-led coalition headed by Walesa.  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC PARTY: The other key pro-Communist party, which holds 27 seats in  Parliament, also bolted the alliance by voting for the Solidarity-led  coalition. Like the United Peasants, the Democrats have been seeking more  political independence. Led by Jerzy Jozwiak.  </P> <P> </P> <P> POLAND'S SEJM (lower house)  </P> <P> Polish United Workers Party (Communists): 173 seats  </P> <P> Communist-allied Catholic parties: 23 seats  </P> <P> Democratic Party: 27 seats  </P> <P> United Peasants' Party: 76 seats  </P> <P> Solidarity: 161 seats  </P> <P> Total: 460 seats  </P></p>

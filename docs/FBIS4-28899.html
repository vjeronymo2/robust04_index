			<p>BFN     [Text] Negotiations on the automobile and automobile parts  sector in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks have been  stalling as negotiators have failed to start discussions on core  matters, such as defining objective criteria for gauging the  openness of Japanese markets to foreign access. Division chiefs  participated in experts' meetings which began in Tokyo on 13  June, but not much progress seems to have been made there. U.S.  negotiators have started spreading word regarding their view  that "an agreement on the automobiles talks will be set back  until the (July Naples) summit or later" (as stated by Walter  Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan). Some officials of the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], who are in  charge of the trade negotiations, have expressed impatience,  saying: "Trade talks on the automobiles sector may be settled at  a later time than talks on other priority areas such as  government procurement and insurance."    Ever since the framework trade talks were resumed,  negotiations on the automobiles sector have been continued  energetically. Division chiefs held meetings on 2-3 June, and  sub-cabinet level talks were held on 10-11 June. Division  chiefs met again this week.    Despite all that has been going on, not much progress seems  to have been made in the talks because negotiators have been  unable to hold in-depth discussions regarding objective  criteria, which is a key issue in the talks. At the sub-cabinet  level meetings held late last week, Japanese and U.S.  negotiators considered draft accords proposed by each side as a  springboard for discussions. However, it is said that the  negotiators have "failed to go as far as to be able to merge  them [the proposed draft accords]" (as stated by a top MITI  official). Another reason for the lack of progress in the trade  talks is that "U.S. negotiators have become cautious, fearing  that the trade talks may break down" (as stated by the same MITI  official).    In the backdrop of U.S. negotiators' lingering with the  talks, there is a view arising in some quarters of the Japanese  Government that "U.S. industrial circles are pressuring the U.S.  Government to be more patient so that greater concessions can be  drawn out from Japan" (as stated by a government source). This  could be considered an advanced U.S. tactic aimed at irritating  Japan, and Japanese negotiators may thus find it difficult to  respond to the situation.</p>

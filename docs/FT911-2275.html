			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Edward II - The Pit, Barbican Simon Russell Beale If you want to see a play wrecked by a wrong choice of costume, go to the Royal Shakespeare Company's Edward II, which has arrived at The Pit from Stratford. To be fair to the designers, there are a lot more faults in this production than the wardrobe, but the clothes do set a tone. If you dress the characters in black and white leather jackets, trousers to go with them, and heaven knows what the Queen is wearing, you are at a disadvantage from the start. For a number of reasons, the production never quite recovers from this self-inflicted wound. Simon Russell Beale is an actor of great versatility; he is not, however, one of nature's Edward IIs. The point about the part is that he has a strong homosexual attraction to his favourites. He is also the King of England with wars to fight, civil and foreign. To carry this off, in the court and on the stage, requires a certain style. Beale plays the role as someone short, fat and stupid who hops about like a bloated frog. The message may be that you do not have to be beautiful to have homosexual passions. Yet it would help if there were a certain style. Beale is simply gross. He never rises to the part. Moreover, he shouts - repeatedly and unnecessarily. So do much of the rest of the cast. This is not a production of light and shade. Edward II, admittedly, is not Christopher Marlowe's best play: not a patch on Tamburlaine the Great or Dr Faustus. But it does have its moments as well as unmistakeable affinities with Shakespeare's Richard II. Its greatest attraction is Piers Gaveston, the King's first favourite. The RSC's Gaveston, played by Grant Thatcher, comes into his own only when he has been beaten up and his mouth is covered in blood - like lipstick. By then, he has little left to say. Before that, he is dressed in his ridiculous white leather clothes with sequins. The only surprise is that he does not wear an earring. That is left to the King's next favourite, Spencer, whom we first see under a sheet with a curate. The nobles and the clerics are wooden. This may be deliberate. For if the King does not behave like a king, even a deviant king, the court can hardly be expected to behave like a court. The general entourage is more like that of a rotary club faced with unseemly goings on, which cannot have been what Marlowe intended. There ought also to be room for some humour, since most of the characters go through a remarkable number of changes of mind. That is not there either. The best performance is by Ciaran Hands as the young Mortimer. By the time he has become an accomplice to murder, his black jacket is decked with phosphorescent green. For the rest, it is a pretty grim evening. The direction is by Gerard Murphy.</p>

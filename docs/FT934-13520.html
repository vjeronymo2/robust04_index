			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Trimmed to the bone: Carmakers' efforts to curb costs Teams of Toyota engineers have recently been visiting the company's components suppliers in Japan more frequently than usual. Their visits are part of a bold attempt to reduce manufacturing costs by at least Y100bn (Pounds 625m) for the second year running. The 'value analysis' initiative is being pursued energeticallyby Toyota and its Japanese competitors: they are scrutinising the costs of car manufacturing down to the smallest detail in the search for savings. A similar exercise called 'value engineering' is also under way for new models that are still in the design stage. Companies are looking for savings over a short time scale. 'It normally takes several years to cut costs by 20 per cent to meet the 20 per cent rise in the yen, and we have to do that in a year,' says Mr Takashi Hamaguchi, deputy general manager of purchasing at Nissan. 'Suggestions on how to reduce costs have been made by everyone. There was even a suggestion to do away with the vanity mirror,' says Mr Goro Itoh, general manager of the cost planning department at Toyota. Other suggestions which have been adopted are already bringing savings: By moving an electric wire harness that runs beneath the floor of one model to the side and bending it slightly, Nissan was able to reduce the overall size of the bracket that holds the harness down, thereby reducing costs by Y20 for each car. Toyota reduced the curve in the windscreen of its best-selling Corolla model with a saving of Y600 a car. It also stopped covering the 'side members' - holes at the bottom of the car body that are designed to reduce overall weight - with rubber covers each costing Y4. Such detailed examination of where cost cuts can be made has resulted in Toyota introducing some 1,600 changes on the Japanese version of its Carina family car. Many ideas have come from components suppliers, all of which have been asked by Toyota to review their production costs. 'The main cost reductions will come from our suppliers, which make up 80 per cent of our costs,' says Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda chief executive. In an effort to contain the development costs of new models, Honda has been talking to its components suppliers earlier in the design process. The exercise has clearly paid off: Honda was able to cut the capital spending needed for developing its recently launched new generation Honda Accord by 50 per cent compared with its original estimates.</p>

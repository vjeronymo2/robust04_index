			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Lebanese cabinet may delay election JUST four days before the country's first legislative elections in 20 years are scheduled to begin, the Lebanese cabinet will today discuss a petition from five influential Christian parliamentarians that the elections be postponed. Opponents of the poll  - the majority of them Christians  - say the presence of 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon will ensure the victory of pro-Syrian candidates. Syria wants the poll to take place before the scheduled withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon in September. More than a dozen members of parliament this week announced that they were withdrawing their candidacy, citing their wish 'to preserve national unity'. They include Mr Tammam Salam, the eldest son of former Sunni Moslem Prime Minister Saeb Salam, who has also spoken out against what he calls 'forced elections'. The deputies who petitioned President Elias Hrawi include Mr Fares Boueiz, the Lebanese foreign minister, who is Mr Hrawi's son-in-law. Never before has a Maronite president enjoyed so little support from his own religious community. Syria's Lebanese allies, including Prime Minister Rashid Solh, have insisted that voting will begin as planned on August 23. But the divisive issue has further undermined the ailing Lebanese economy and the decision of the Christian Phalange party to boycott the poll has ensured that 700,000 of the country's 2m eligible voters will not participate in the election. A new legislature therefore risks having even less credibility than the present assembly, which has repeatedly renewed its own mandate since 1972.</p>

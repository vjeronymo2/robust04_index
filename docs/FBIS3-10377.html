Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and Nicaraguan  President Violeta Chamorro signed the joint statement this  afternoon at the end of Cristiani's official visit to Nicaragua,  which started on Thursday.    Chamorro and Cristiani reaffirmed their support for a  proposal to create the Central American Social Investment Fund  Against Poverty. It was agreed to create this fund in the  Central American Bank for Economic Integration to alleviate  poverty. In addition, Chamorro and Cristiani encouraged the  international community to support this proposal both  technically and financially to carry out programs and projects  aimed at stimulating human development.    The presidents agreed that perfecting the integration  process  requires joining forces with the social and human development  aspects to overcome poverty.    The two presidents expressed satisfaction over the recent  signing of an agreement creating a Permanent Central American  Commission for the Eradication of Production, Trafficking,  Consumption, and Illegal Use of Narcotics and Psycotropic  Substances, and Related Crimes. They agreed to create bilateral  cooperation mechanisms for the "timely" treatment of matters  that, because of their importance, deserve the area governments'  joint attention.    They also expressed interest in developing a means of  communication that can improve relations between the two  countries. In this regard, they agreed to update a study to  eventually resume the ferry service between El Salvador and  Nicaragua on the Gulf of Fonseca. They also agreed to keep  conducting studies to modernize the ports of Potosi in Nicaragua  and La Union in El Salvador on this same gulf.    The presidents also admitted the need to keep in force the  strategies and policies adopted within the framework of the  International Association of Coffee-Producing Countries and the  International Coffee Withholding Plan, strategies and policies  which make it possible to get a realistic price of coffee.    Chamorro and Cristiani, upon considering the effects of  NAFTA, reaffirmed their desire to temporarily receive benefits  similar to those in the agreement until Central America  definitively joins this instrument.</p>

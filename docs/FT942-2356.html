			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): Lamb to set up another 'listening bank' Grumblers may complain that Britain often seems like a third world country, writes Peter Norman. But that is not why the World Bank is boosting its presence in London and installing a full-time senior official in its eyrie in New Zealand House this summer. The Bank is sending Geoff Lamb, one of its high flyers, to the UK to build up relationships with Whitehall, the City, universities and non-government organisations and tap UK expertise on development issues. By setting up a 'listening bank' in the UK, the Bank hopes to strengthen its capability to deal with such thorny issues as development and environment on its home turf in Washington. A youthful-looking 50, Lamb was a close aide of and speech writer for Barber Conable, the Bank's president in the late 1980s. He is currently in charge of the Bank's policy on public sector reform in former Communist countries and the Middle East. Lamb is no stranger to the British Isles. He is an Irish citizen, having been exiled from South Africa in 1965, and will be responsible for relations with Ireland in his new job. He was deputy director of the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University before joining the Bank. There are also family ties in London. Lamb is married to Caroline Atkinson, a former economics correspondent of The Times and daughter of Sir Fred Atkinson, the government's chief economic adviser in the late 1970s. With the move to London, Atkinson will have to leave the IMF, where she is responsible for Italy and Greece. But a new career beckons - probably at the Bank of England.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar embarks on cost reduction plan LOW &amp; BONAR, the Dundee-based packaging and plastics company, is closing its UK non-wovens business and implementing a cost cutting programme at its Canadian operations. The company, which has annual sales of about Pounds 300m, is to close Bonar Carelle, which employs 32 people, by the end of the year. The closure will involve an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.8m to cover the writing off of investment, but will eliminate Pounds 700,000 of UK losses. Low &amp; Bonar will concentrate its non-woven operations on its Bonar Fabrics plant in South Carolina which is 'on the positive side of break-even,' according to Mr Jim Leng, chief executive. Both plants use the group's powder bonding process to make fabrics but although the South Carolina plant now has a good market supplying linings for computer diskettes, hopes that the Scottish plant would develop new products and markets for this technology have not been fulfilled and it has secured only a small part of the European market. 'This is the penalty for developing new products in new markets with new technology,' said Mr Leng. The Dundee plant had incurred losses for six years. The decision further reduces Low &amp; Bonar's manufacturing presence in Scotland, where only 5 per cent of the company's 4,400 employees are engaged. It still has packaging and polypropylene operations in Dundee. In Canada, where the bulk of the group's North American operations are located, the workforce is to be cut by 7 per cent producing a saving of CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m). The next phase will entail rationalising manufacturing plants and making additional manpower reductions. Costs are expected to be substantial and will be charged as an exceptional item this year. Bonar Inc, the group's Canadian subsidiary, achieved net income of CDollars 3m (CDollars 4.95m) in the nine months to August 29 on sales of CDollars 146.2m (CDollars 153.9m).</p>

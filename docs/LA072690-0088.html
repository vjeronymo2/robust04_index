			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: MALIBU;  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY SELECTED  </P> <P> Malibu voters can meet the fledgling city's first staff member -- and so far  its only one -- at 7:30 tonight when Michael Jenkins, the city attorney,  appears before the City Council-elect.  </P> <P> The five-member council announced Jenkins' hiring Monday, the same day a  California appeals court ruled that Los Angeles County can delay Malibu's  official incorporation until next year.  </P> <P> "My first order of business for Malibu is to review the court's decision with  the council to see what action to take," said Jenkins. "After that we'll look  at a long list of start-up problems for this special city."  </P> <P> Hiring legal counsel to guide it through a maze of lawsuits and other problems  has been a priority for the council-elect, even though the proposed city has no  money. "Basically I'm operating on good faith with the council," said Jenkins,  "but this isn't unusual with a new community." Once Malibu incorporates, tax  dollars will flow into the city treasury.  </P> <P> Jenkins is affiliated with the Los Angeles firm of Richards, Watson and  Gershon, which specializes in municipal law and represents about 18 Southern  California communities. "It's a premier firm," said Malibu attorney Barry  Haldeman, who chaired the search committee.  </P> <P> Jenkins has a law degree from Duke University and is president-elect of the Los  Angeles County City Attorneys' Assn. He is also on the faculty of USC Law  School.  </P></p>

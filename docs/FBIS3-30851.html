The situation cannot be settled by a direct  military intervention as this would only bring suffering to the  civilian population, the fighting parties should be thoroughly  separated and the units disarmed so that peace talks could be  started, he added.    The opposition Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM)  considers the events to be a "monstrous sign of war," but "the  campaign which wants to use the massacre for an armed  intervention is suspicious," the party's spokeswoman said.    The campaign is motivated by an effort to create a suitable  atmosphere for escalating an anti-Serbian military intervention  in Bosnia, no wonder "that the campaign is as usual joined by  some Czech governing circles," she added.    Saturday's [5 February] Sarajevo massacre is a provocation  which is to serve as a pretext for a "military intervention of  the Western countries," a leader of the extreme opposition  Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party  (SPR-RSC) said. "Even if the West resorted to force, we are  firmly opposed to the Czech Republic being involved," he added.</p>

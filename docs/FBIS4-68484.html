			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Prime Minister of Kabardino-Balkaria G.M. </F> Cherkesov to republic assembly of representatives of Balkar  society on 23 March 1994: "Unity of the Republic, Interethnic  Accord, and Creative Labor Are the Foundation of the Renewal and  Development of the Balkar People"]    [Text] Esteemed Comrades!    Literally two weeks have passed from that moment when, with  the participation of representatives of the regions, we marked a  sorrowful date in our republic--the 50th anniversary of the  violent expulsion of the Balkar people. A lot was said about  this barbarous action and its consequences at meetings, rallies,  reports, and speeches, and in the mass media. Recalling the  past, thinking about the fate of their much-suffering people,  about their present and future, and seeing the faces that know  hard times so well, the representatives spoke with special  warmth, frequently with tears in their eyes, about what helped  them to endure, survive, and overcome all the difficulties and  adversities, about the friendship and fraternity of the people,  and about the need to strengthen unity and affirm an atmosphere  of mutual understanding, trust, and benevolence.    In fact, there was a detailed analysis in those days of the  half-century path of the Balkar people, lessons were drawn from  history, losses, successes and achievements and existing  problems were shown, and the work being done for their  rehabilitation was elaborated in detail. The participants in the  mournful measures, the Balkar population and residents of the  republic, accepted with great satisfaction the appeal of the  edict of President of the Russian Federation Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin and the edict of President of Kabardino-Balkaria Valeriy  Mukhamedovich Kokov directed at restoring historical justice and  eliminating the consequences of the criminal deportation. The  apology given to the Balkar people by the head of the Russian  state for the arbitrariness and lawlessness committed against  them made a great impression on everyone.    Thus, pressing problems are being resolved logically, and  questions that disturb the people are being removed one by one.  A significant step has been taken toward meeting the  expectations of the people, and good possibilities have been  opened up for their revival and development.    It would seem that everything is moving along normally and  that there is no reason for anxiety. Nevertheless we are  compelled today, putting aside important matters, to meet here  together in order to look into the situation that is developing  and discuss a number of extremely serious questions that are  truly fateful for our people.    You know that the mass media recently carried speeches and  statements by O.Y. Beppayev, acting chairman of the National  Council of the Balkar people, that flabbergasted and discouraged  the residents of the republic and created tension and alarm. You  read these pearls, and you are amazed. It simply cannot be  believed that they came from a military person who occupied  rather high posts in the army, who has seen hatred, malice,  blood, tears, and death, and who knows the price of rash,  impulsive words and actions. It is offensive and bitter that  such views and approaches are professed by a person of whom all  of us were proud, whom we so warmly received in the republic,  and whom we respected precisely for his dedication to the ideas  of peace, friendship, and harmony.    But just what did happen? What is the reason for the  metamorphosis that occurred? This can only be guessed. Well, in  the meantime we must state with regret that Beppayev's  utterances exude a peremptoriness, unsubstantiation, boundless  ambition, and irresponsibility. These revelations, if they can  be called such, have one purpose--to undermine trust in the  authority structures, inflame unhealthy passions, and  destabilize the situation. I am confident that nothing is likely  to result from this.    However, let us analyze everything without haste and in an  orderly manner. Some members of the National Council frequently  like to present themselves as the only spokesmen of the  interests of the Balkar people and their genuine supporters and  benefactors. In addition, continuous attempts are made to  confuse the issue, to convince the uninitiated that the state  organs are idle and sit with their hands folded, but they do not  sleep for many nights and are working to the limit of their  strength.    In this connection I consider it necessary to inform you  once  more how the work on rehabilitation is proceeding, what has  already been done, and what remains to be done. I want to  emphasize especially that since the very first days the law of  the Russian Federation was published on this question, all the  difficult problems associated with its implementation have been  consistently at the center of daily attention of the president  and the government. Believe me, nothing is done that simply.  Each step, every item in one or another adopted document  requires a lot of strength, nerves, and time. Of course, no one  thinks about this. It is impossible not to talk about the fact  that on all questions of rehabilitation the Balkar people are  moving ahead of all repressed people. And this is the great  service performed by V.M. Kokov. He displays unusual stability  and persistence, and uses all his influence and authority to  resolve the indicated problems. Thank you for this, Valeriy  Mukhamedovich!    One of the key directions of the activity of the government  for rehabilitation of the Balkar people is work to overcome the  socioeconomic backwardness of the mountain population centers  and economies and the creation of the necessary conditions for  their normal development. With this aim, at the initiative of  the Cabinet of Ministers of the KBR [Kabardino-Balkar Republic],  the Government of the Russian Federation adopted a directive on  6 August 1991 outlining a complex of measures to expand housing  and sociocultural construction and strengthen the  material-technical base of the agrarian sector.    I do not want to tire you with figures and facts, especially  since we have written and talked about this more than once.  Nevertheless, some of them should be cited. To implement the  program developed for 1991, 10.2 million rubles [R] were  allocated, for 1992--R199 million. The question arises: Where  did this money go specifically? I reply. For the construction of  a club in the village of Babugent, the reconstruction of a  children's sports school in the village of Kendelen, a  kindergarten, a boiler house, and a sewage treatment plant in  the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, gas installation and the  development of projects for the supply of gas to the settlements  of Kendelen, Bylym, Zhankhoteko, and Verkhnyaya Zhemtala. Owing  to those resources, construction of housing was also conducted  in the village of Khasanya, the village of Verkhnyaya Zhemtala,  an out-patient clinic in the village of Gerpegezh, a hospital  and a kindergarten in the village of Verkhnyaya Balkaria, and a  gas supply network and roads for kolkhozes and sovkhozes.    More than R1.5 million in appropriations was allocated from  the budget of the Russian Federation last year to finance  programs for the development of mountainous population centers  and socioeconomic support of the Balkar people. The resources in  question were directed at strengthening the material-technical  base of facilities in public education, health services, and  cultural, municipal, and housing construction.    If anyone is interested, it is also possible to give  specific  addresses, but such a listing will take a lot of time. I will  say only that some of these resources went to the creation of  the feature film "Journey to the Edge of Life," which recounts  the bitter years of banishment of the Balkar people, the "Book  of Recollections," the preparation of a Balkar encyclopedia, the  construction of mosques in the settlements of Bylym, Khasanya,  and Babugent, and memorials to the victims of genocide and those  who died in wars.    In the first quarter of 1994, R820 million was received to  pay off credit indebtedness for the past year on construction  projects in the mountainous population centers. These resources  were earmarked for the construction of hospitals and clubs in  the village of Khasanya, a sports complex in the village of  Kendelen, the acquisition of mill equipment and a bakery in the  village of Kich-malka, a relay station in the village of  Khushto-Syrt, a fruit storage facility in Yanikoy, and the  reconstruction of the Kashkhatau cannery.    If we are talking about the outlook, according to the Decree  of the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation  "On Socioeconomic Support of the Balkar People," there are plans  for the erection of a large number of installations of  production and sociocultural significance. For these purposes it  is planned to construct a Kashkhatau brick plant, expand  enterprises of the Elbrusstroy building industry combine, the  marshalling yard in the village of Babugent, the lime shop and  red lead shop in the village of Khabaz, a number of shops for  the output of small wall blocks, untreated tile, and joiners'  articles.    Special attention is being given to ensure the employment of  the able-bodied population and the creation of additional jobs.  It is planned to build a plant for the production of consumer  commodities in the village of Kendelen, folk art enterprises in  Kashkhatau, Kendelen, Bezengi, Khabaz, and Khushto-Syrt. It is  proposed to start development of mining of mineral  deposits--bentonite, hot springs, and gold. It is planned to  restore the settlements of Guba-santy, Ozen, Glashevo, Uskhur,  Chelmas, Kyzgen, and others.    Social rehabilitation has exceptionally important  significance in the complex of measures for restoration of  justice. Serious work has also been done on this area. Pensions  from 1 March 1991 have been recalculated for all who went  through the tragedy of the forced expulsion. In fixing pensions  for citizens who were subjected to repression, the time they  spent in special settlements (places of exile) is tripled. An  increase has also been implemented in the scale of pensions for  age for each year of work, taking into account periods  stipulated in the Law of the RSFSR "On State Pensions in the  RSFSR."    There is also progress in cultural rehabilitation. At  present  two Balkar professional state artistic collectives are operating  in the republic: the Dramatic Theater imeni Kaysyn Kuliyev and  the folklore-ethnographic ensemble Balkaria. The mastery of  these collectives is growing from year to year. They make us  happy, give us true esthetic pleasure, and have gained  popularity and love and recognition not only in  Kabardino-Balkaria but also far beyond its borders.    A Balkar theatrical studio has been opened in the North  Caucasus Institute of Arts to train artistic personnel. Children  desiring to learn the art of the national dance have the  opportunity to visit the studio while the ensemble Balkaria is  there. All told, about 400 persons of the Balkar nationality are  studying in training institutions of culture in the  Kabardino-Balkar Republic. Music schools are operating in the  settlement of Kashkhatau, the villages of Babugent, Verkhnyaya  Balkaria, Kendelen, and Yanikoy.    Measures are also being taken to satisfy the requests of the  Balkar population for press products. The republic newspaper  ZAMAN and the journals MINGI-TAU and NYUR are now being  published here. Pages in the Balkar language are issued  periodically in the newspaper SOVETSKAYA MOLODEZH and in the  city and rayon newspapers GORNYATSKAYA SLAVA, GOLOS CHEGEMA, and  TRUDOVAYA SLAVA. The total circulation of books published in the  Balkar language in 1993 was about 60,000 copies. The proportion  of these publications in the republic according to titles today  is 32 percent, and in volume, 28 percent. The quality of  programs of television and radio broadcasting in the Balkar  language has improved and the number of hours increased.    A powerful impetus is given to all this work by the Edict of  President of the Russian Federation B.N. Yeltsin "On Measures  for Rehabilitation of the Balkar People and State Support for  Their Revival and Development." This document obligates the  appropriate organs in the near future to adopt a complex of  additional measures for the political, social, and spiritual  revival of the Balkar people. It addresses the problems and  return to the motherland of our countrymen from Central Asia and  Kazakhstan, grants persons from among repressed peoples new  benefits in pension support, and allocates resources for a  lump-sum allowance to persons of Balkar nationality who were  subjected to illegal resettlement and their families, including  children who were born in special settlement places.  Incidentally, this question is being examined in the Ministry of  Finance of Russia, and we hope that it will be decided  favorably. As for the R1 billion coming from the budget of the  Russian Federation for these purposes, the Cabinet of Ministers  of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic authorized the Ministry of  Social Protection of the Population in a month's time to pay out  a lump-sum allowance of R500,000 each to rehabilitated persons  of Balkar nationality over 80 years of age, and also to  participants in the Great Patriotic War, regardless of age.    The edict of President of the Kabardino-Balkaria Republic  V.M. Kokov of 8 March 1994 is truly historic. Its great  significance is determined by the fact that this document, if it  is supported by our parliament, will perhaps resolve the most  severe problems that have been the subject of speculation for a  long time. It addresses the renaming of Sovetskiy Rayon to  Cherkesskiy Rayon, the restoration of Elbrusskiy Rayon, and the  creation of a bicameral parliament, one of whose chambers would  be formed on a parity basis. We are convinced that the  implementation of this edict will not encroach on anyone's  interests and rights and that it will not harm anyone. As V.M.  Kokov emphasized at a recent news conference, it is dictated by  the aspirations to put an end to confrontation, to cut the  ground from under all kinds of extremists, and to ensure peace  and accord in our republic.    As we see, a lot is being done to restore justice. I will  say  more: A unique opportunity exists at present for genuine revival  and development of the Balkar people. It must be taken advantage  of. Peace-loving and kind by nature, they are interested in  civic peace, stability, and tranquility in the republic, and in  creative labor. However, judging by some publications, this does  not please individual figures. They need discord, intrigues,  rallies, and congresses in order to remain afloat and be visible.    How else can one explain the harsh and deliberately  confrontational speeches of S.U. Beppayev. Is it really not  blasphemous to call the mournful rally near the railroad station  square and the meeting of the public "a shameful spectacle" and  "a stagnant party aktiv." On what grounds does the general  declare that he is supported by almost all the Balkar people?  Who empowered him to speak in their behalf, who gave him the  right to try to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the leaders  of the republic. It is rather paradoxical that a person who has  lived for just a short time in Kabardino-Balkaria allows himself  to make such statements.    Indeed, it will become known to the general that the peoples  of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, including the Balkar people,  voted for the Constitution of the Russian Federation, and voted  rather energetically for the election of the president and the  prime minister of the republic to the Federal Assembly. This  means that the Balkar people trust the leadership of the  republic, approve and support its program of actions, and share  its position and views on fundamental questions.    Esteemed Comrades!    Today the leaders of rayons, cities, villages, and  settlements, deputies, members of the government, the scientific  and artistic intelligentsia, in other words the pick of the  nation, have assembled in this hall. We are the sons and  daughters of our long-suffering Balkar people. And to us, of  course, its fate is not a matter of indifference. If this is so,  we cannot today pretend that nothing is happening, remain  silent, and live according to the principle "it is no concern of  mine," or "we will see what will come out of this."    To our great regret, some of our comrades, people who work  in  responsible posts, are not showing themselves to be fighters,  they are passive, they temporize, they want to be good for  everyone. This unquestionably does not become them. The writers,  poets, artists, painters, and scientists have not made their  weighty utterances yet. We must put the question today in a  tough way--it is time to take a position and to find in yourself  the courage to talk about this frankly. You cannot sit immorally  on two chairs.    After all, we are not talking about something petty and  personal. We are talking about reputation, honor, dignity, about  destiny, specifically about the fate of the people. This is the  question: Either they will follow the path of peace, accord,  creativity, cooperation, and progress, or they will be doomed to  new suffering and deprivation.    Is it really not clear to us that hotheads and figures who  are inclined to be extremists have an excessive desire to  destroy that which was created over many decades and centuries,  that they want to reduce to naught the tangible results achieved  in recent years through joint efforts in the rehabilitation and  creation of pleasant conditions for the socioeconomic and  cultural development of the Balkar people? Is it really possible  to look at all of this calmly? Is it really permissible to  remain silent and, what is more, to assent to it?    No, we must, we are bound to give a decisive rebuff to those  (and it is a small group of people) who are pushing the people  to the abyss, those who in their unseemly affairs are trying to  hide behind their name. Our duty is to explain to the people,  especially to the youth, who is who, who is trying to do what,  and to what the aggressive speeches, vanity, and excessive  ambition of individual politicians may lead. We have to do  everything to ensure that people believe us and follow us, not  those who are excessively suspicious, offended, woolgathering,  and irresponsible leaders--impostors.    There is no need to talk about what difficult times our  country is experiencing now. And, alas, it seems there is no ray  of hope. This year also promises us little. It is already  becoming clearer and clearer to a large number of both  politicians and ordinary citizens that confrontation,  opposition, scandals, and fighting are ruinous, and that they  threaten the existence of the state itself. The only salvation  is to strengthen legality and law and order.    This truth is urgent in an even greater degree for our  country. We can no longer in any way spend precious time,  forces, and energy on explaining relations and on fruitless  discussions and arguments. It is necessary for all of us now to  work on the economy. How to stop the decrease in standard of  living of the population and the reduction in production, how to  achieve the stable operation of enterprises of all forms of  ownership, kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and individual farms, what must  be done so that people have jobs and receive wages on time, so  that they can walk the streets without fear, teach and rear  their children in peace, and look to tomorrow without fear--this  is what we have to think about, it is toward this that the  efforts of state organs and public associations, and all of us  together, should be directed. Only together will we be able to  resolve these problems. No one will be able to pull out of the  crisis, out of the poverty and need, by acting alone. This  really is what the experience of the republics of the former  USSR, now sovereign states, and the sad fate of even such giants  as Ukraine tells us.    We have outlined great plans, including on the development  of  mountainous population centers, mountain farms, and full  rehabilitation of the Balkar people. We are fully resolved to  bring this work to its logical conclusion. Let no one hinder us.    The majority of the Balkar people always was and is for the  integrity of the republic. Separatist slogans and appeals are  foreign to it. The people associate their present and future,  their dreams and hopes, their successes and achievements with  their own united and indivisible Kabardino-Balkaria, with  friendship and fraternity with Kabardin, Russian, and other  peoples who live in the republic. They realize deeply that the  unity of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic, interethnic accord, and  creative labor are the basis and indispensable condition for  revival, development, and prosperity. No one will be able to  deceive the Balkar people, confuse them, or force them to change  the traditions and precepts of their forefathers.    I thank you for your attention.</p>

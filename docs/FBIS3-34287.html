			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij by 'Ali </F> al-Ruzz and Bisharah Shirbil in London; date not given]    [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] Have your meetings with British  officials produced any specific agreements?    [Mirhij] I held wide-ranging talks covering the possibility  of supplying Lebanon with arms, equipment, helicopters, coast  guard requirements, rescue boats, light weapons, communication  equipment, and various means of transport. The talks were held  in the commercial way used traditionally between states. We  sensed a British interest in strengthening economic ties and in  playing a part in the region. We also sensed a British interest  in the Lebanese market as a key to the region and beyond. They  appreciate the Lebanese activity abroad and know that the goods  it receives become popular.    [AL-HAYAH] Did the British officials show no inclination to  provide financial or technical aid?    [Mirhij] The talks were held on a selling and buying basis  but the British expressed willingness to provide facilities if  deals were concluded. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the process of reconciliation  between the various sects?    [Mirhij] It means nothing. Thr reconciliation should be  among all the Lebanese because there are differences within each  sect. Sectarian solutions only confirm the old disease. I hope  that what I have said will not be interpreted to mean that I am  against good relations within each sect and between sects, for  that is a binding moral and humanitarian necessity.    [AL-HAYAH] Is the cabinet now an institution as stipulated  in the al-Ta'if agreement or is it still controlled by the  "troika"?    [Mirhij] The cabinet is in the process of becoming an  institution. This road is full of challenges but there is no  alternative to it because when the cabinet becomes an  institution it will be fulfilling everyone's rights and will be  a guarantee for everyone. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] How do you view the president's call for the  amendment of the al-Ta'if agreement in connection with the  powers of the presidency?    [Mirhij] The al-Ta'if document represents the political  ceiling in a dangerous phase in Lebanon's life and it has  achieved some kind of political balance and, more importantly,  national accord on the basis of which the state has been  rebuilt. That is why that formula should be preserved and  protected by all means.    [AL-HAYAH] Are you in favor of the literal implementation of  the al-Ta'if agreement?    [Mirhij] Yes, and after implementation we can improve from  within. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Have their been any operations against Syrian  checkpoints?    [Mirhij] There have been some attempts against some position  and the culprits have been arrested.    [AL-HAYAH] Amnesty International has talked about torture of  detainees.    [Mirhij] I have no official information that anyone has been  tortured. Let me say that such attempts in fact target  stability and not the legal and legitimate Syrian presence which  is objectively and strategically needed. Resisting the Syrian  Army in this connection means resisting the supreme national  interest.    [AL-HAYAH] There are those who claim that there has been  an arrangement to ensure that the Syrian presence is not  terminated.    [Mirhij] It will be a different matter when Lebanon is  united and its institutions well established. The Syrians are  helping Lebanon build its institutions because that is in their  interest.    [AL-HAYAH] What about political decisions?    [Mirhij] Political decisionmaking in accordance with the  al-Ta'if agreement has eliminated the possibility of conflict  with the Syrian position and pushed toward integration. For  instance, how would we have confronted the Israeli ambitions had  there been no Lebanese-Syrian solidarity?    [AL-HAYAH] If the challenges of negotiations with Israel  necessitated a Lebanese-Syrian confederation, would you agree?    [Mirhij] I am for any close integral political links that  serve Lebanon, confirm its existence, and contribute to the  liberation of its territory from occupation and the rebuilding  of its state. What is going on now is the consolidation of the  fraternity treaty and the building of its institutions.  [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Are you continuing to grant citizenship to  whomever it is due to?    [Mirhij] That is a commitment under the al-Ta'if agreement  and the cabinet statement. We want to carry it out whatever the  difficulties and complications.    [AL-HAYAH] What about Palestinian rights?    [Mirhij] Relations with the Palestinians are at their best.  We always meet with them and facilitate their work as much as  possible. There are some problems regarding the practice of  certain professions such as medicine, engineering, and law.  Apart from that, we help them in all fields.    [AL-HAYAH] There are those who use a racist language against  the Palestinians.    [Mirhij] There is such a thing but we are fighting it. The  Palestinians are our brothers and they have suffered and have  been the victims of international ambitions and the Zionist  movement. It is our duty to do our best to help them. Sometimes  there is failure. That happens with our own people but it is  something we are continuously trying to surmount and not a  position we take.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of  the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], appears to be walking  on thorns these days as rumors continue to spread of a possible  political comeback by his predecessor, Kim Tae-chung.    Despite adamant denials by his aides and the retired  politician himself, persistent speculation on a Kim comeback is  having repercussions throughout the country, with some political  pundits already predicting the dawning of "a new era of two  Kims."    These observers believe there may be a new round of politics  pitting DJ, as Kim Tae-chung is popularly called, against  President Kim Yong-sam just like in the old days.    Meanwhile, talk like "crippled" and "DJ rules from behind  the  veil" is used to describe Yi Ki-taek's questionable leadership  of the Democratic Party.    Outwardly Yi Ki-taek is maintaining a stony silence about  such speculation. This is quite a change from the recent past  when he observed that Kim Tae-chung could comment on any  political issue, if he so desired, as a member of the party.    In an emotional farewell shortly after his defeat in the  1992  presidential election, Kim Tae-chung declared that he was  retiring from politics for good. Nevertheless, he said he would  like to retain his membership in the party for the time being.    In a recent interview with a provincial newspaper, Kim said  that even if he wanted to make a comeback, he would not ride on  the back of the Democratic Party or any faction. Hounded by  reporters to clarify the remark, Yi lost his temper and  retorted: "What do you want me to say?"    Yi was said to have ordered his aides not to comment on this  question, either.    Yi's silence is probably due to his precarious position: He  can neither deny nor confirm the speculation that Kim, despite  his own denials, used the newspaper interview to extend a feeler  on his comeback, placed ever so gently and ambiguously in the  political arena as well as in the minds of the general public.    Yi has already declared his intention to run for president  in  1997, and it is common knowledge that he was counting on Kim  Tae- chung to muster powerful support for him when the time  comes.    Hence his silence, as he would be most affected if the  69-year- old former DP chairman attempted a comeback.    Many political observers are looking no further ahead than  the next presidential election. Yi Ki-taek's status as the  leader of the No. 1 opposition party is already being eroded by  the rumors of a DJ comeback.    In fact, Yi's chairmanship of the Democratic Party has  always  been shaky at best. He has been able to manage the party, some  claim, only by riding piggyback on the DJ followers' faction.    By coincidence or design, however, DJ's followers -- or the  Tongyo-tong faction as they are called -- are increasingly  asserting themselves, expressing "displeasure" whenever Yi  Ki-taek states his intention to run for president in 1997.    But rumors of a DJ comeback are not working entirely against  Yi Ki-taek.    The Yi camp believes that the more people talk about DJ's  return, the more difficult it would become for Kim to make an  actual comeback. Kim's and his aides' denials of the rumours  are apparently being made out of a similar belief.    And if DJ's comeback proved difficult under the present  circumstances, the partnership between Yi and Kim -- however  awkward it may be -- would be maintained for some time.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / South leads race to beat VAT on fuel Householders have paid out a total of Pounds 990m to electricity companies and British Gas to avoid paying value added tax on future fuel bills. People in the south of England have participated far more actively than others in the race to beat the tax collector. A final count among British Gas and electricity companies by the Financial Times shows that 1.1m power consumers and 500,000 British Gas customers made advance payments ahead of the VAT imposition on April 1. The pre-payments will deprive the Treasury of at least Pounds 79m, since the VAT will initially be levied at 8 per cent. A precise figure is impossible to gauge because some of the pre-payments cover more than a year and from April next year VAT on fuel will rise to 17.5 per cent. Sweb, the electricity company serving the south-west of England, appears to have the most financially conscious customers, with 9.3 per cent of consumers paying in advance. Generally the participation rate was high throughout the south, with Seeboard, based in Hove, receiving advance payments from 7.4 per cent of customers and London Electricity from 5.6 per cent. That compares with a nationwide average for power and gas consumers of 4.3 per cent. The lowest participation rate in Great Britain was 2.4 per cent by customers of Northern Electric. In Northern Ireland, only 1.8 per cent of electricity consumers paid in advance. The participation rate among British Gas's 18m customers was also relatively low, at 2.8 per cent. The companies have markedly different policies on what to do with the interest they make on the money they have received. British Gas said it was difficult to speculate 'what the amount might be and therefore to what use it might be put', although it added that it was already involved heavily in community projects. London Electricity said it had 'no plans at present to do anything in particular with the money'. Norweb, serving north-west England, said it would not treat the money in any special way. However, Scottish Power said that none of the money would be added to profits. It will donate all the interest generated from pre-payments to 'disadvantaged groups within our area, particularly those most likely to have been affected by the introduction of value added tax'. Midlands Electricity said that 'as a direct result of pre-payments' it would give Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy Action, a charity. Most companies said they had incurred considerable expense in setting up the infrastructure to deal with pre-payments. Southern Electric estimates this at Pounds 700,000 leaving the net interest benefit after tax at less than Pounds 1m in a full year. Seeboard said any surplus after costs would be used to cut prices.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Money to burn?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-payments for domestic fuel                            Amount    As % of      No. of        As % of                          pre-paid     annual   customers      total no.

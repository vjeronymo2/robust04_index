			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Markets: Optional extras that bear watching - Serious Money FUTURES and options are creeping gradually into the main stream of personal finance. More and more funds are being launched which use the products - for example, bear funds, which allow investors to profit from a falling stock market. It is tempting to shy away from all these products because they seem either too complicated or too speculative. But futures and options can also be used for insurance. If you own BT shares, for example, you can buy a put option giving you the right to sell at, say, 400p. If the BT share price falls to 300p, you exercise your put and sell the shares at 400p. You have 'insured' against the risk of a sharp fall in the share price. If you bought a put without owning BT shares at all, that would be speculation. You would be gambling that the BT price would fall substantially so that the option would increase sharply in value. Of course, you have to pay for this right. The cost of an option, like an insurance policy, is called a premium. A call option to buy BT shares at 420p in August now carries a premium of around 19p. The existence of premiums creates another use for options; a way to get extra income. This is the technique Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial used to offer a 10 per cent income to investors. Its fund sells options to earn premiums, which it then pays out to investors as income. A new unit trust, from Shore Capital Stockbrokers and Providence Capitol, uses similar strategies. Options will be sold against the trust's shares, with the aim of generating option income of 10-15 per cent a year. Rather than being paid out to investors, this will be accumulated as capital gain (although a withdrawal plan allows those who want income to take out 10 per cent of their original capital each year). Naturally, the option income has its price. By selling the option, the trust has given outsiders the right to buy its shares. They will exercise those options if share prices rise substantially. Accordingly, the trust will underperform in a rising market. If share prices generally were to fall, the trust's portfolio would decline. The premium income would cushion the trust from part of the fall, but investors would still lose money. The trust would do best in a flat market, with shares barely moving. In such circumstances, it would receive its premium income but buyers would not exercise their options. How should investors view all this? Common sense suggests that, if it is so easy to earn 10-15 per cent a year in option premiums, everybody would be doing it, especially if you can earn only 6 per cent from cash. Therefore, this is either a market anomaly (which might close) or investors are taking some risk in order to earn the extra reward. One should note also the high charges on the fund, with the annual levy being 2 per cent on top of the 5.25 per cent initial charge. These will, inevitably, eat into investor returns. So, given the doubts, cautious investors should wait to see if this concept works in practice. After a year or so, it will be possible to assess the record rather than the theory.                            *      *      * A MORE conventional fund is on offer from Dunedin Fund Managers, namely, a Japanese investment trust. The Tokyo market certainly has bounced back from its 1992 lows, and those who bought into Japan last summer have done very well indeed. The problem is that the market there is very difficult to value. Price-earnings ratios, the traditional measurement yardstick in the UK and the US, are much higher in Japan - the Tokyo market's present p/e is 58, according to Datastream. At 0.8 per cent, dividend yields are much lower than in the Anglo-Saxon markets. For a long time, those who doubted the Japanese market's ability to sustain these stratospheric ratings were dismissed as naive by the cognoscenti. Sceptics were told that 'traditional valuation methods don't apply in Japan.' When the market fell from 38,000 to 14,000 over two years, the sceptics could afford to feel smug. Given that the Japanese government has played its part in encouraging the recent stock market rebound, are we witnessing a 'sucker's rally' which will prove to be short-lived? Not according to Dunedin. It believes Japanese corporate earnings are due for a substantial recovery, that interest rates are at exceptionally low levels, and that international investors have underweight positions in Japanese equities at present, and will wish to increase their holdings. Dunedin has a good record in Tokyo; its Japan Smaller Companies and Japan Growth unit trusts are, respectively, sixth and ninth in the sector over the three years to July 1. For private investors, Japan definitely remains a high-risk market. But those who have decided already to opt for Tokyo might be tempted by Dunedin's offer: 35 per cent of the manager's annual fee will be donated to Barnardo's for the first five years of the trust's life.</p>

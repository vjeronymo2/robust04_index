			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Joan Woodward Industrial surveys in places like south-east Essex are so common these days that they seem an unlikely foundation for management immortality. Yet the conclusions which Joan Woodward (1916-1971) drew from research into 100 medium- and large-sized firms in that part of England in the early to mid-1950s have ensured her a place in the pantheon of modern organisational thinkers. Together with others (including Tom Burns who featured in this column last week) Woodward made a lasting contribution to the school of contingency theory. This held that if companies were to perform well their structures should be appropriate to the technology they used, their product diversity, the rate at which they were changing and their size. Woodward's findings - notably that different types of production process had particular structures, management hierarchies, and 'spans of control' (numbers of people reporting to one supervisor) remain relevant today. 'Looking forward from Woodward to see in what directions our knowledge about organisations has been extended, one finds a bewildering array of empirical and theoretical work,' write former colleagues Sandra Dawson and Dorothy Wedderburn of Imperial College, London in their introduction to her classic Industrial Organisation, Theory and Practice*. 'But the contribution of Woodward is not obliterated.' Much of what she discovered has been incorporated into received management wisdom, while the recent shift towards services - an area in which she did relatively little work - means her significance is sometimes overlooked. It can be argued, however, that the contemporary debate on delayering and business process re-engineering - the latter a management approach made possible mainly by improvements in information technology - is a dramatic reaffirmation of her ideas. Later research by Woodward and others at Imperial - based in part on more detailed case studies of some of the south-east Essex sample - explored how companies exert control over their operations. They found that control systems could be categorised around two variables: the degree to which control was exercised either personally or indirectly (with the idiosyncratic supervisor on the spot at one extreme and impersonal administrative or automated procedures at the other); and the degree to which methods of control were either localised in each unit of a company or integrated and reconciled centrally. Operations and planning manager of a munitions factory during the second world war and consultant to a number of companies including Pilkington and Ford, the woman who became Imperial's Professor of Industrial Sociology in 1969 is perhaps a worthy role model for today's management academics. 'Her theory always came out of practical experience, she was always interested in the real world,' recalls Wedderburn. *Reissued in October by Oxford University Press. Pounds 14.95.</p>

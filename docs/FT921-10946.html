			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Letter: Back to the late payers Sir, With reference to your report ('Debtors may add Pounds 21 to community charge', January 31) on poll tax surcharges to cover the cost of non-payers, surely the answer to this manifest injustice is to index all poll tax debt with an interest rate that covers the financial expense of delayed collection plus court costs. If this were coupled with a discount for early payment, it would allow the local authority to borrow the shortfall on the open market and pass the cost directly back to where it belongs, the late payers.

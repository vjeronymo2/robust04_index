			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / ERM exit blamed for Tory poll woes The economic recovery has failed to revive the fortunes of the Conservative party because of a collapse in the government's credibility after Black Wednesday, according to research from Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank, and the University of Strathclyde. The research shows that on the basis of economic factors, were it not for the political fall-out from sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, the government's opinion-poll rating would be as high as 42 per cent. In fact, its standing is about 26 per cent. In normal circumstances, economic conditions such as low inflation, falling unemployment and low interest rates help the government's popularity. However, Mr Peter Spencer and Mr John Curtice, the authors of the report, say that 'contrary to the consensus view the beneficial effects of economic recovery have already been reflected in the opinion polls'. The report adds: 'All the indicators suggest that while the Conservatives' reputation for economic management survived the recent recession well, it has been destroyed by the debacle of sterling's leaving the ERM. In this, there are uncanny parallels between Black Wednesday and the damage done to Labour's reputation by the sterling crises of 1967 and 1976. On all three occasions there was an immediate collapse in government popularity, which in 1967 and 1976 were eventually followed by electoral defeat.' Kleinwort suggests that if the Tories were able to cut the basic rate of income tax from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, this would improve their poll rating by 7.5 percentage points. The report concludes: 'What the government now needs is not an economic, but a political recovery.'</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The end of unit trusts? - Share-issuing Oeics could take over Oeics - pronounced the way a pig might - are an unfamiliar sound to the ears of most unit trust investors but that is set to change. If all goes well, fund management groups will be able to market Oeics, or open-ended investment companies, from next summer. These are described widely as a 'modern' type of unit trust - the type unshackled by ancient trust law which has been a barrier to marketing unit trusts to the rest of Europe. But since Oeics have been years in the making, many fund management groups have hopped offshore to establish their marketing gateway to Europe from more congenial regulatory environments such as the Channel Islands, Luxembourg and Dublin. Having done this, they may choose to remain where they are. And because Oeics will have a different pricing structure from existing unit trusts, it could be - initially, at least - that their impact will be greater at home than abroad by forcing changes on the structure of existing unit trusts. Final details on the structure of Oeics are yet to be honed but they will differ from unit trusts in two significant ways. They will issue shares instead of units and they will have a single pricing structure instead of the present dual system. Single pricing At the moment, investors buy units at the 'offer' price and sell at the lower 'bid' price. The difference between the two, known as the bid-offer spread, is often in the range of 7-8 per cent although it can be much higher. Unit trusts have a dual pricing system because their underlying assets - the stocks and shares which the fund manager buys - also operate on two different prices. But the spread on a unit trust is much wider than that on stocks and shares because it includes the initial charge - the manager's sales levy, which is usually between 5 and 6 per cent - as well as stamp duty and brokerage. Under single pricing, an investor would pay the same figure no matter whether he wanted to buy or sell units - probably, mid-way between the bid and offer prices. Stamp duty would be payable on top and the manager would quote the initial charge separately. The annual management fee would, as at present, be stated separately. Yet, Jeremy Burchill, compliance officer at M&amp;G, the largest unit trust group, is concerned about the viability of the modern and the old living side by side. 'Since Oeics will have single pricing and will be sold to private investors, I think it is undesirable for the two different types of pricing to exist,' he says. Many in the industry expect single pricing for Oeics to result in single pricing for unit trusts as well. Some even believe that Oeics represent the demise of the unit trust. One said: 'In a few years, we will be wondering what a unit trust was.' Further steps are being taken along the path to deregulation. From Tuesday, newspapers - including the Financial Times - will not be publishing the 'cancellation' price, the lowest level at which a company will buy back units from an investor. This is used mostly by institutions which buy and sell units in far greater numbers than private individuals. More importantly, unit trusts will be able to impose exit charges on their funds. Because of a quirk in the rules they have, until now, been able to do this only on unit trusts sold within a personal equity plan. This flexibility has been used most effectively by M&amp;G in the marketing of its Managed Income Pep, which attracted around Pounds 500m within six months of its launch in January. With this Pep, M&amp;G eliminated altogether the initial charge but introduced five-year withdrawal charges instead. Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, says: 'We are likely to see more price competition as companies take advantage of greater pricing liberalisation.' This should be good news for private investors, but it also means they should be careful not to be swayed by the pricing structure on a fund but to choose a trust - or, indeed, an Oeic - based on their needs and the management company's performance record.</p>

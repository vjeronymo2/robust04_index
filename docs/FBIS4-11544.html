			<p>BFN     [Text] The possibilities in Cuba for expanding production  of high-quality lubricants under the Castrol name are on their  way to becoming a reality, according to Castrol executives  visiting Cuba. The company, Castrol-Cuba, today introduced two  guests of honor: Jim Alexander, director of the main office in  London; and Michael Viejo, financial manager of (Abeille-Life),  a branch of Castrol- Burmah. Both executives expounded on  prospects for producing greater amounts of lubricants under the  Castrol name.    Mr. Alexander has met, these past few days, with various  representatives of Cuban industry and government, and although  there were no specific contracts, there is agreement regarding  expansion of the relations that Castrol has maintained with Cuba  for over 30 years and that reached a zenith two years ago when  Cuba and Castrol polled their capital and formed the joint  enterprise [empresa mixta] Castrol-Cuba S.A.    [Begin Jim Alexander recording, in English, with  superimposed  translation into Spanish] I think that through further joint  efforts, we will be able to ensure that there will be many more  advances, greater development, in Cuban industry. [end recording]    Jim Alexander's visit shows the commitment of the firm  toward  its company in Havana, which means that the power of the world's  most important lubricant company is at Cuba's service.    Mr. Viejo, who is visiting to participate in the Isla chess  tournament, sponsored by Castrol-Cuba, which is under way here,  is taking advantage of the visit to learn about the banking  world, oil, industry, and insurance. This executive is confident  that he will be able to support projects and, in short, expand  Castrol-Cuba's relations.</p>

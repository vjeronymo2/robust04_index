			<p>BFN     [Text] The Conference on Stability in Europe in Paris is  coming to an end today. In an interview with our reporter, Edo  Zitnik, Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle assessed the  Slovene participation at this conference as follows:    [Begin recording] [Peterle] First of all, I would like to  express my satisfaction with the fact that Slovenia managed to  win full-fledged status at this conference. I am happy that  this conference developed in the direction of preventive  diplomacy.    [Zitnik] Will Slovenia be mentioned in the group of nine  Central European states that are the potential candidates for  future membership in the European Union in the conference  document issued this afternoon?    [Peterle] Slovenia will not be specifically mentioned in  this group of states bearing in mind that this group primarily  consists of the states that must resolve their minority issues  or neighboring relations, which Slovenia does not have to do.  This conference is not the institution at which it would be  decided whether Slovenia will progress closer to the European  Union or not.    [Zitnik] One should nevertheless point out here that, for  example, Poland and Czechia, which do not have minority  problems, are also mentioned in this group?    [Peterle] This is true. However, I do not see any danger  for Slovenia drawing closer to the European Union in this fact.    [Zitnik] Did Slovenia nevertheless tried to be included in  this group of states before the conference?    [Peterle] Slovenia proposed that it be mentioned, but later  did not insist on it when it was given assurances that this  mention does not have any special political connotations.

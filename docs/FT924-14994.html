			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Spellbound by leaves and bark - Television Does Rembrandt become more interesting if we know about his personal life - his bankruptcy, his troubles with clients, and with women? Most people would say that the more human an artist is made to appear, the easier it is to develop a taste for their art. That would seem to set a pretty clear agenda for those in the business of popularising the arts, which by definition makers of television documentaries about artists are. And yet in a fortnight that has seen a wealth of documentaries on artists, ranging from a mere 10 minutes to a full hour, all but one has taken the bold step of focusing firmly on the artists' work. The longest and quite the best of these was Channel 4's film, Two Autumns: The Work of Andy Goldsworthy in Scotland and Japan (shown on Tuesday 29 September). It lasted for 60 tranquil, spellbinding minutes, and for my tastes could well have run on longer. Producer Peter Chapman evidently had the services of a remarkably good cameraman and he in turn had the dream subject in Goldsworthy and his sculptures. Goldsworthy creates these in beautiful rural landscapes using leaves, pebbles, or strips of bark, siting them exactly so that they will be transformed by the first rays of sun in the morning, or the last light of sunset. Fringes of Japanese maple leaves, stuck around a black rock, blaze gold or red. Banners of leaves hung on branches turn into translucent green and black chequer boards. Goldsworthy exploits nature as a theatrical experience, one which can be repeated perhaps only once more on the following day, if the wind and current has not already torn apart his work. This film could itself quite properly be called a work of art. Here were beautiful images of the art-work and of the artist at work. Rather more unusually, here was an artist whose own commentary was genuinely illuminating - either that or he was so tightly edited that neither pomposity nor flakiness intruded. So how, then, does Goldsworthy actually live, a viewer might ask? Well, for one thing he sells photographs of his sculptures. But as to the stages in his rise to fame, his relations with dealers and clients, the economics of Goldsworthy's autumn visits to a Japanese village, let alone his private life - these mundane matters Two Autumns, with blissful discretion, left quite out of the picture. On that same rich evening you could have watched Omnibus (BBC 1), The Piero Trail, celebrating the fifth centenary of this generally beloved artist of the 15th-century Renaissance. This was a far more orthodox route into an artist's work, making ample use of 'talking head' academics, architects and artists to appreciate Piero's art and adumbrate some of the problems it raises. They did well although I slightly regretted the intrusion of John Mortimer on to the screen - must he always pop up whenever Italian culture is discussed? But within this thoroughly conventional framework, Anna Benson-Gyles had made good decisions about where to focus. It could have been Piero the man, his patrons and social world, an attempt to flesh out this still deeply mysterious figure. That would have been pretty enough, but also pretty obvious. Instead, we were introduced to Piero as one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his age, devising enormously complex perspectival schemes for his paintings. A three-dimensional recreation of the Urbino Flagellation, plotted on a computer, amply proved that point, even if it does not explain to everyone's satisfaction who is being flagellated, and who the dispassionate gentlemen bystanders are. This week, however, things had slipped badly out of focus for the Omnibus film celebrating Roberto Burle Marx who is a Brazilian landscape architect, garden-designer, town-planner, painter, and conservationist. Now in his eighties, Marx is evidently a real character. He likes to sing lieder accompanied by his wife and he gives superb Sunday lunch-parties at his matchlessly elegant house. Lots of elegant people attend and maybe they stroll about the matchless gardens. But of course, the main business is to gossip, laugh at Marx's jokes and eat his perfectly delicious food . . . So all this is filmed, and eats into the 50 minutes which therefore becomes much too short to tell us why Marx really is an important figure. Aerial views of a number of the gardens he has designed did almost nothing to give an impression of what the gardens are actually like. Admirers, prating on about Marx's historic, path-beating, mould-breaking importance, merely sounded like an uncritical chorus of adulation. It was a flaccid film precisely because it lacked focus, slewing around between the history of garden design since the 17th century, Marx's curriculum vitae, and his lunch guests. But there was a very good moment, when we realised that Marx and Rembrandt have, after all, much in common. We saw the white-haired maestro in his studio where, he assured the interviewer, he still spends days at a time 'working until I get tired'. What we actually saw, however, was the maestro looking on in his artistically bespattered T-shirt, while assistants applied paint wherever his finger pointed. What about taking the other tack, and forgetting about the artist altogether  -or in the case of Building Sights, the architect? Building Sights is BBC 2's Sunday evening 10-minute spot on 20th-century buildings. It has returned to our screens for a new series expanded this season into buildings in Europe. How well it works, just the perfect length to let an advocate abetted by a good camera team, make a case for the merits of a factory, airport, housing-estate, or power-station. Nor is it long enough to outlast the patience of any opponent of contemporary architecture broadminded enough to switch on. The proposers may on occasion look oppressively style-conscious, like Odile Decq, the French architect who this Sunday presented Jean Nouvel's Nemausus Housing at Nimes in France. Yet there is never much doubt that they are really committed to saying why that building really does make a point, and why they love it. Sometimes the architect gets a look in - but not this week or last week, a vintage slot for Iannis Xenakis who revisited the convent Sainte-Marie-la-Tourette which he built with Le Corbusier. But with only 10 minutes to play with, it is always what we see which counts.</p>

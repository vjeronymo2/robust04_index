Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that even if  the loopholes in the Oslo agreement have been closed, the  agreement with the Palestinians still entails great risks.    Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan said that he does not believe  that the Arabs will be able to keep the agreement. Eytan  anticipates further terrorist attacks and a struggle over the  roads.    Moledet chairman Rehav'am Ze'evi said that in Cairo, Peres  and Sarid had signed a capitulation agreement which did not even  meet Israel's security needs.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0830 GMT on 10 February  reports that "the leaders of the Jewish settlements in the Gaza  Strip are now holding an emergency meeting to decide upon their  reaction to the Cairo agreement. Knesset Member Ran Kohen, the  chairman of the Meretz Knesset faction, firmly rejected what he  called the right- wing's intimidation campaign against the Cairo  agreement. Kohen said that the agreement was a huge historic  achievement for Israel and for Zionism, because in addition to  opening the road to the implementation of peace, the  Palestinians had for the first time accepted security  arrangements on the basis of Israel's positions and with the  Israeli Army retaining overall responsibility."]</p>

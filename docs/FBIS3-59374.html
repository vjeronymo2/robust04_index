Provincial party and government leaders including  Liu Fangren [provincial party secretary] attended the meeting.  Governor Chen Shineng delivered a report entitled "Seizing the  Opportunity, Deepening Reform, Widening the Scope of Opening Up,  and Bringing About the Sustained, Speedy, and Healthy  Development of Guizhou's Economic Construction."    Chen Shineng stressed: [passage omitted] First, we must  seize the opportunity to speed up our development and the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We  must exert ourselves and carry out our work creatively. Second,  we must comprehensively and correctly understand the major  reform measures proposed by the central authorities and  comprehensively treat and analyze problems. On the one hand, we  must take the overall situation into account, cultivate a  long-term concept, correctly handle the relationships between  immediate interests and long-term development, carry out good  ideological work among the masses, and protect state interests.  On the other hand, we must effectively adjust the industrial  structure, concentrate our efforts on local economic  development, and maintain a steady increase in local revenues.  Third, we must profoundly study and understand the spirit of  the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and the national economic work  meeting. [passage omitted]    Governor Chen Shineng said: In 1993 local revenues amounted  to 5.19 billion yuan, an increase of 18.75 over the previous  year. In 1993 the province further implemented Deng Xiaoping's  important speeches and the spirit of the 14th CPC National  Congress, carried out the central authorities' macrocontrol and  regulatory policies, concentrated efforts on resolving  contradictions in economic life, and maintained a good economic  development trend in the course of overcoming difficulties.  According to an estimate, the annual GNP increased by 9 percent  over the previous year; the gross industrial output value  increased by 13 percent over the previous year; and the  production and marketing rate was 94 percent. The gross  agricultural output value increased by 4.1 percent. In 1993 the  province comprehensively fulfilled the national economic plan,  laying a foundation for this year's reform and development.</p>

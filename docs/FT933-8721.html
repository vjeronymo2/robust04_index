			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign demand helps fuel Nikkei advance ACTIVE buying by foreign investors boosted volume, and share prices gained marginal ground on purchases of large-capital and telecommunications-related issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 32.71 to 20,765.28, rising for the fourth consecutive day. It saw a day's high of 20,939.39 in early trading, but profit-taking brought it to a low of 20,708.47 in the afternoon. Volume jumped from 379m to 500m shares, its highest since June 11. Traders noted heavy buying by US mutual funds, shifting capital from US treasury bonds. Winners led losers by 665 to 314 with 183 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.95 to 1,686.18 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.44 to 1,283.74. A rise in overseas stock markets supported sentiment; conversely, the continued strength of the yen prompted some foreign investors to take profits. The dollar closed down Y0.40 at Y103.37, falling to a record low of Y103.20 in the afternoon. Some market participants were encouraged by the large number of bids accepted for the state owned East Japan Railway share auction. The JNR Settlement received a total of 18,670 bids, 14,508 from individuals and 4,162 from corporations. Successful bidders will be selected on August 26, with the public offering priced fixed on August 30. Nippon Steel, the most active issue, rose Y13 to Y383 on buying by overseas investors. Exporters were hurt, and energy-related issues lifted by the higher yen. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell Y30 to Y1,370, Sony by Y60 to Y4,370 and Toyota Motor by Y40 to Y1,610; but Tokyo Electric Power rose Y70 to Y3,820 and Cosmo Oil by Y27 to Y927. Continued hopes of a housing tax cut buoyed related stocks. Misawa Homes gained Y40 to Y1,240, Daiwa House Y20 to Y1,680 and Mitsubishi Estate Y10 to Y1,100. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 136.66 to 22,762.22 in volume of 76.5m shares. Traders said that volume rose as investors realised profits ahead of the September book closing. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets turned in mostly positive performances. Bangkok was closed for a public holiday. AUSTRALIA soared to a fresh post-1987 crash high after Channel Seven's debut boosted sentiment. The All Ordinaries index closed up 12.3 at 1,873.3. Channel Seven closed at ADollars 2.73 after listing at a 65 cent premium to the ADollars 2.00 issue price in volume of 16.9m. BOMBAY was sharply higher, in spite of stepping back from the day's best levels after mid-session profit-taking. The BSE index added 109.83 at 2,490.79. TAIWAN moved ahead after a wave of late buying, with the mood remaining positive ahead of the ruling Nationalist Party's congress next week. The weighted index wavered narrowly all session before ending 25.71 points up at 4,140.75. Turnover was a moderate TDollars 17bn after Wednesday's TDollars 26.62bn. NEW ZEALAND closed firmer, following strength on overseas bourses and to a partial bounce in Telecom. The NZSE-40 capital index ended 5.41 higher at 1,888.82, but off its intraday high of 1,899.55. Telecom firmed 6 cents to NZDollars 4.04 after a day's high of Dollars 4.08. MANILA moved ahead as local investors turned their attention to selected blue chip issues after taking profits on the newly-listed JG Summit. The market index rose 4.01 to 1,751.68. PLDT and Philippine National Bank each rose 10 pesos to 1,105 pesos and 337.50 pesos while JG Summit finished at 7 pesos, up from Wednesday's 6.80 pesos. HONG KONG had a listless day with second line China-related stocks continuing to dominate dealings amid a lull among blue chips. The Hang Seng index was 18.08 lower at 7,339.55 after opening up 54 points on London and New York's record highs overnight.</p>

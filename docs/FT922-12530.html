			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Baltic Exchange may move headquarters to Billingsgate MEMBERS of the Baltic Exchange, which was badly damaged by last Friday's IRA bomb in the City of London, hope to move into the renovated Billingsgate fish market while their own listed building is being repaired. Mr Peter Tudball, Baltic Exchange chairman, told a meeting of more than 700 members yesterday that the building would be saved, although repairs would take at least three years. Costs should be covered by the building's Pounds 75m insurance. The Exchange, which arranges most of the world's freight chartering and ship sales, would like to make a temporary home at Billingsgate, which was refurbished by Citicorp, the US bank, but never occupied. The alternative would be for the 60 broking firms that were in the Baltic Exchange to remain in their present temporary accommodation in the Lloyd's building and other City offices. More details on a possible deal with Citicorp, the leaseholder, are expected to be available next week, and a further meeting of Baltic Exchange brokers is planned for next Friday. The Baltic Exchange building took the full force of the blast and it was feared at first that it would have to be demolished. However, the basic structure, the trading floor and the marble pillars withstood the blast well. Damage caused by the bomb has left Ecclesiastical Insurance, the specialist church insurer, with one of its biggest losses. Damage to six churches affected by the blast has been provisionally estimated at more than Pounds 2m. The biggest claim in the company's history was caused by a fire at York Minster in the mid-1980s which caused losses of more than Pounds 4m. The churches affected by the bomb all suffered extensive damage, including the destruction of ancient stained glass. Meanwhile, loss assessors (acting on behalf of companies affected by the explosion), and loss adjusters (acting for insurers), are continuing to assess the full extent of the losses. Potential liabilities for lost rental income from buildings damaged by the blast could be more than Pounds 100m. Chartered surveyors believe that 15 buildings, with 1.3m sq ft of office space, have been badly affected and will be vacant for several months. Mr John Major told the cabinet yesterday of his concern that news coverage of IRA attacks was concentrating on the impact to buildings rather than on the personal tragedies involved.

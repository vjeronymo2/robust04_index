			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (5): Cartels under attack - Competition policy THE DENUNCIATION of Switzerland last autumn by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for condoning cartels came as little surprise to those familiar with the country. Prices for many goods and services are outrageously high compared with those in neighbouring countries, and for no apparent reason. According to the OECD's study, the average prices of goods and services for private consumption in Switzerland are 40 per cent higher than in the average in the 24 OECD countries on a purchasing power parity basis. Prices of goods and services for capital investment are 30 per cent higher. The main reason for these disparities is that Swiss markets are riddled with anti-competitive practices. The OECD found that price fixing or market sharing agreements existed in no less than 90 per cent of 72 industrial activities in the country. If this state of affairs seems difficult to square with the fact that Switzerland is a very open trading nation (except in agriculture), the answer seems to be that many importers are only too happy to join Swiss cartels, either directly or through their local distributors. Swiss leaders have long recognised that their tolerance of cartels will have to come to an end. The problem is mobilising political support to revise laws and regulations affecting competition. Swiss law does not expressly prohibit cartels. Rather, a plaintiff must prove that the effects of a cartel are, on balance, economically harmful, in order to win a legal case. In most cases, especially in prosperous Switzerland, that is difficult to do. There have been several cases in recent years - notably in the banking, insurance and cement sectors - where long and costly investigations have led to indecisive results. The latest drive for reform began in 1991 when the federal cabinet, in anticipation of the country moving towards integration with the European Community, adopted a new competition policy. Its thrust was that Switzerland could not hope to compete in world markets in the future without having competitive markets at home. The government's hope then was that the country would join the European Economic Area (EEA), the expanded free trade area linking the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with the EC. Then it would have to take on EC competition law, and the problem would solve itself. In the event, a majority of Swiss voted against joining the EEA last December 6, and so the government had to take matters into its own hands. A commission of experts was set up in December, and it has already submitted a draft reform for comments from various interested parties. A final draft is expected by the end of June and then it will enter the complex Swiss legislative process. The OECD called for a fundamentally revised competition law in which 'the protection of the competition process per se should be established as as an overriding objective.' But that is not going to happen. According to officials in Bern, the thrust of the reform will be to outlaw specific anti-competitive practices, such as output quotas, territorial divisions, boycotts, price maintenance schemes and price fixing. A further amendment would subject all competition cases to administrative law. At the moment, some are handled under civil law, which results in long drawn-out cases. The reason for taking this more specific route is that a change of general principle would involve a change in the Swiss constitution, and thus require a referendum. This would take a long time and might end up being vetoed by voters. In any event, the result of the planned reform will be largely the same. One of its main positive effects, according to Mr Andreas Limburg, who has just completed his doctorate on the subject, would be to simplify the investigation and enforcement processes. Thus, it would answer another OECD criticism that the Cartel Commission does not have adequate resources to do its job. In the future, the commission will not have to determine whether or not a particular practice is socially harmful. If there is proof of price fixing, for example, that will be sufficient for it to take action. The official objective is to pass legislation by year-end, but that looks ambitious. Opposition, which was muted during the run-up to the EEA vote, has now surfaced within the business establishment, and officials recall that the last attempt to reform cartel law began in the early 1970s and finally resulted in a new law only in 1985. The most controversial area is probably merger control. At the moment, companies are not obliged to notify anyone of their intention to merge. The Cartel Commission has the right to investigate mergers and can make recommendations on the merged company's future behaviour but cannot recommend or order divestiture. The argument against establishing a domestic merger control system is that the country's market is too small to be significant. Also, in the cases of very large company mergers, the companies involved will almost certainly have a sufficiently large presence in the EC that they will have to go through EC clearance procedures. This was the case, for example, for Credit Suisse's recent SFr1.6bn takeover of Swiss Volksbank and last year's takeover by Swiss Reinsurance of Elvia. Apart from revisions to the cartel law, several other actions to promote freer competition are in the works, such as liberalising the labour market, providing for mutual recognition of qualifications and eliminating various non-tariff barriers. Switzerland has an extraordinary array of NTBs, from special dimensions for refrigerators to unique anti-pollution specifications for cars. Yoghurt cannot be called yoghurt unless it is packaged in 180 gram, 250 gram, 500 gram or one kilogram containers. 'Any single item is not that important, but if we change a lot of things with a view to facilitating market access, we can have an effect,' says Mr Peter Saurer, head of the government's general economic policy office. Recently, the association of cantonal governments agreed in principle to opening up their SFr30bn annual public procurement market. Most cantons now have regulations stipulating that only local companies need tender, but they now realise they could save a lot of money by opening up to bidders from other cantons and even from abroad.</p>

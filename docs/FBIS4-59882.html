			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F> Oslo, by Hayim Zissowitz in Jerusalem -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning to Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres.    [Peres] Good morning.    [Zissowitz] We are speaking with you in Oslo following your  meeting last night with Yasir 'Arafat. Let us first talk about  his explanations, which the prime minister termed far-fetched.  Is that how you would describe them?    [Peres] Professor Hayim Weizmann used to say that silence is  golden. In other words, there is no doubt whatsoever that this  utterance was unnecessary, damaging, and infuriating, but words  are hard to take back; one can only explain them and apologize,  which is what Mr. Yasir 'Arafat did. Before entering the news  conference, the main point on which I insisted was that he  reiterate the following three commitments: that he remains  faithful and loyal to the Declaration of Principles and has not  deviated from it, that he calls for an end to the use of any  form of violence and terror, and that all disputed issues in the  future will be settled through political rather than any other  means.    He said all that, and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter  witnessed it. Of course, I cannot tell you that I am pleased  about the whole business. Indeed, as the prime minister said,  it was a mishap -- and a regrettable one at that. In our  meeting, 'Arafat explained to me that he had been arguing with  the Iranians and telling them: You talk about jihad. So, what  have you done with this jihad? I believe he has learned his  lesson with regard to the future.    [Zissowitz] The recurring impression is that Yasir 'Arafat  says certain things when he signs agreements, meets with  Israelis, and shakes their hands, and totally different things  in closed rooms.    [Peres] There is yet another test. To the best of our  knowledge, neither Yasir 'Arafat nor the PLO leadership have  lent their hand to the resumption of terror since the Oslo  agreement 10 months ago -- and this is also a fact. Of course,  the verbal mishap remains, but as far as we know, in the field  they have remained faithful to their commitment.    [Zissowitz] Nevertheless, they have not canceled the clauses  in the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's annihilation.    [Peres] Confusion persists on this issue. They canceled  them. The PLO leadership officially announced that the  Palestinian Covenant is not in effect for all practical  purposes; they used the word inoperative [last word in English].  Furthermore, 'Arafat said they will cancel them when the PNC  [Palestine National Council] -- which has the constitutional  right to do so with a two-thirds majority -- convenes, but at  the moment they are unable to summon the PNC. In our meeting in  Cairo, he reiterated his commitment to cancel them when the PNC  holds its first session in Gaza. Hence, we cannot say that they  have not abided by their commitment. I believe they have a real  problem to convene the PNC and to muster a two-thirds majority,  because there is no doubt that both the Arab world and the  Palestinian world are very divided. What is exceptional about  the PLO's position is not that they succeeded in mobilizing the  entire Palestinian world but that this is the first time the  Palestinians have renounced the path of violence, the path of  the mufti of Jerusalem, and turned to a path of compromise and  dialogue.    [Zissowitz] We occasionally get the impression that we rush  to forgive 'Arafat and forget what he says and what he does not  say, such as when he refrained from denouncing the terror  attacks in 'Afula and Hadera.    [Peres] My dear friend, only God forgives; people can just  pass judgment and remember. We do not forgive anything, and we  remain watchful in all spheres -- both the declarative and the  factual ones -- as well as with regard to his efforts to repair  the damage when there is a deviation, as in the current mishap  and his efforts to amend it. Indeed, he went out of his way to  amend it. Having said that, I do not want to justify anything.  Still, we take note of all these events, and we know the  precise nature of the partner with whom we signed an agreement.  I repeat: In practice, they have not deviated from what was  agreed.    [Zissowitz] Now that you mention terror, there was an  attack yesterday near Netzarim. The terrorists fled into  al-Shaja'iyah and the Palestinian policemen certainly did not  pursue them. This creates an entirely new situation in the  field in everything pertaining to fighting terror.    [Peres] Look, the Palestinian police is also being tested,  and it knows it. It realizes that if the police force proves  ineffective, nobody will support it. In other words, the  Palestinian police needs outside financial support and must  build its credibility in order to continue the negotiations.  Numerous major tests lie ahead of it, and I have reason to  believe that it will really make a supreme effort.    [Zissowitz] Do you also have reason to believe that the  Palestinian policemen will join the efforts to thwart terror and  arrest those who perpetrate it?    [Peres] I have no doubt about it. They do not have to do it  for us, but for themselves.    [Zissowitz] Sir, 'Arafat also talked about the discussion of  the fate of Jerusalem in the permanent arrangements.    [Peres] No, he did not talk about what we agreed. You know,  the whole business of a letter is a fiction.    [Zissowitz] Did you ask him why he said he had a letter and  on what basis he made such allegations about you?    [Peres] I think.... [pauses] Why should I explain  anything? I only know that there is no such letter and that  this was an unfounded allegation. As for Jerusalem, there is an  agreement which says that it is not included in the Gaza-Jericho  accord and that it is not part of the autonomy area. When we  proceed to discuss the permanent arrangement, they may raise the  issue for the agenda, just as they may raise any other issue.  If you remember, the late Menahem Begin also said that the  Palestinians may raise any issue. Our agreement, however, says  that the question of Jerusalem is not connected to Gaza and  Jericho and is outside the timetable pertaining to the autonomy.  As for the permanent solution, they may raise whatever issue  they want.    [Zissowitz] In the debate about the permanent arrangement in  Jerusalem, will Israel be prepared to show some flexibility?    [Peres] No, my position on the question of Jerusalem is  clear and totally inflexible. I say that Jerusalem is closed  from the political point of view and open from the religious  one. In other words, from the political point of view, there  will be no compromises and Jerusalem will remain Israel's united  capital. We will not turn Jerusalem into Berlin; there is no  way we are going to build or allow others to build walls in it.  From the religious point of view, the Israeli Government proved  to be the only government to have given worshipers of all faiths  free access to pray in the city without any intervention. I  believe one of the greatest achievements -- historically, not  just diplomatically -- is the fact that the Vatican signed an  agreement with us on mutual recognition with the status of  Jerusalem being what it is: a united Jerusalem. You know, this  is the kind of event that happens once in 2,000 years. We would  like to reach a similar agreement with the Muslim world. From  the religious aspect, everything is open; from the political  one, everything is closed.    [Zissowitz] I would like to ask you a question on an  entirely different issue. The State Comptroller's Office annual  report issued yesterday shows that governments come and go but  things remain the same and corruption is rampant.    [Peres] What corruption are you talking about?    [Zissowitz] You may not have heard all the details of the  report, but the State Comptroller's Office uncovered corruption  in all government ministries.    [Peres] It is not a matter of rampant corruption but of  human weaknesses. A person with wings, like an angel, has not  yet been created. In my opinion, a government should not be  judged by whether its members make mistakes or are corrupt but  by whether it fights corruption and mistakes. I believe this  government is determined to fight any occurrence of corruption,  nepotism, mistakes, and errors.    [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, I thank you  very much.</p>

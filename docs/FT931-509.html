			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Pounds 150m plan for opera house at risk THE AMBITIOUS Pounds 150m development plan for the Royal Opera House site in London's Covent Garden could face a setback tonight when a Westminster City Council committee is expected to seek assurances that sufficient money will be available to complete the whole project. The council, which gave planning permission for the four-phase plan in 1990, still accepts the merits of the redevelopment in principle, but is against piecemeal expansion. It is not convinced the opera house has sufficient funds to complete the project. A recommendation before the planning committee proposes acceptance of the second phase of the development, which is for a seven-storey building to include shops and a permanent home for the Royal Ballet, but only if certain assurances are given. The main assurance is confirmation that funding can be guaranteed for the complete project. If this is not forthcoming, the committee will demand a new design for the second phase that will be judged on its own merits rather than as part of a larger development. Acceptance of the committee's recommendations could delay the redevelopment plans substantially as the opera house's management seeks more funding. The redevelopment total of Pounds 150m is to be composed of Pounds 60m from commercial development of the site and additional retail opportunities, with the remaining Pounds 90m coming equally from public and private sources. The management remains confident that the money will be raised, but it is not yet clear where it will come from. The government has stated categorically that no further Treasury money will be made available, and the most likely source of public money is likely to be the national lottery's millennium fund when it is launched next year. Lord Sainsbury, a former chairman of the opera house and a likely private benefactor, is to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, shortly to advocate the merits of the development scheme and to seek Pounds 45m from the millennium fund in three annual tranches.</p>

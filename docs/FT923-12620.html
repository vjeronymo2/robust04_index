			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Treasury plans to overhaul its model THE Treasury has commissioned research into consumer behaviour with a view to improving its economic forecasts. Two outside teams of researchers have been called in to overhaul the section of the Treasury's computerised model of the economy that is linked to the way people borrow and spend. Warwick University and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are to examine these aspects of the model over the next year or so. They will be taking into account both the financial deregulation of the 1980s and also the reduced demand for credit by many consumers during the recession. If the research is suc-cessful, the results will be translated into mathematical equations and fed into the Treasury model - a vital tool used in forecasting the economy. The Treasury, like most private-sector forecasters, failed to forecast the extent of the 1986-88 boom and of the recession. In November 1990, the Treasury projected that there would be growth of 1 per cent in 1991. In the event, the economy contracted by 2.4 per cent. Behind the forecasters' failings has been lack of insight into spending by consumers - which accounts for two thirds of gross domestic product. Spending took off much more sharply than envisaged in the late 1980s, and has fallen particularly steeply over the past two years, partly because of the cost of servicing previous debts. Under the new contracts, Warwick University's macro-economic modelling bureau is to examine changes in credit constraints affecting consumers, leaving the institute to look specifically at the housing market and the links with borrowing. The work is part of an effort by the Treasury to shift more of the development of its model to outside researchers, rather than rely on its own economists. The Treasury said the studies would look in detail at the new information about consumer behaviour that has emerged in recent years.</p>

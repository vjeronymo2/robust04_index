			<p>BFN     [Text] Open criticism, which is unusual, erupted against  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leadership at a Dietmen's caucus  on 27 April. This followed reports that party Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa and a handful of party leaders had decided on a new  position on the question of the new parliamentary group  "Kaishin," which was the major reason why the Social Democratic  Party of Japan's [SDPJ] bolted from the coalition government.  Most of the Shinseito Diet members, even party executives, had  not been informed of the decision.    It was an eruption of discontent about the way a small  number  of senior executives like Ozawa have made decisions unilaterally  on policies and Diet operation matters in the past.    The man who opened the verbal attack was first-term Dietman  Kiyoshi Ueda. He asked for an explanation from party officials:  "The news media report that a retraction of the concept of  `Kaishin' is being considered. What is going on?" Acting  Secretary General Kozo Watanabe replied: "No such thing is  being talked about. We are now making final efforts to have the  SDPJ return to the coalition government."</p>

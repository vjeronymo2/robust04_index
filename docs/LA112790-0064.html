Losses were expected to reach into  the tens of millions of dollars. Three counties in western Washington were  declared federal disaster areas and others could be added to the list. Gov.  Booth Gardner has sought the declaration for a total of 13 counties. Rep. Norm  Dicks (D-Wash.) said he had received assurances for federal funds for the old  Interstate 90 floating bridge that sank in Lake Washington.  </P></p>

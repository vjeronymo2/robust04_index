These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1980). On December 10, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by Metropolitan Airports Commission under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On June 8, 1994, the Assistant Administrator approved the Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport noise compatibility program. Of the twenty two (22) noise abatement (NA) and land use (LU) measurers included in the program, thirteen (13) were approved outright, six (6) were approved on a voluntary basis, and the remaining three (3) were disapproved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of the FAA's approval of the Minneapolis-St Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain) Airport noise compatibility program is June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> John M.

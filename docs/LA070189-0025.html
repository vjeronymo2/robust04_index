			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAUER'S REMARKS  </P> <P> I'm writing my displeasure about the remarks made by Steven Bauer. He echoes a  sentiment that DEA agents should get diplomatic immunity to do their job in  Mexico. The very fact that U.S. law enforcement agents are openly working in  Mexico is an extremely sensitive and unconventional binational arrangement  between both countries. It's evident that Bauer's racist contempt and ignorance  about Mexico prevents him from grasping this concept.  </P> <P> The article also quotes producer Michael Mann's fears for his life if he were  to shoot the miniseries in Mexico. They are fitting remarks from the executive  producer of "Miami Vice," a series showing Latinos primarily as drug dealers  and continuing the slanderous stereotype of the greaser-bandido-cholo that has  plagued American popular culture.  </P> <P> I'm not sure who is at greater fault for the remarks in the article, the makers  of "Desperados" (who are trying to grab publicity), or The Times for so  uncritically relating their comments. The lack of editorial judgment seems  surprising since The Times recently has made honest and intelligent efforts to  deal with the issues regarding Spanish language media in the United States and  binational approaches to solving binational problems.  </P> <P> ISAAC ARTENSTEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

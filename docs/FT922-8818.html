			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (8): A trawl through history - The coastline means ports, tourism and the heritage business SCRATCH 'N SNIFF, orders the 'very smelly leaflet' about Grimsby's new National Fishing Heritage Centre. So you do - and the whiff of fish and engine oil rises up from the page. Opened a year ago, this imaginative museum, an attempt to plunge visitors into the sensations of 1950s North Sea trawling, has received an enthusiastic public response. It attracted 70,000 visitors in its first eight months, and has created almost from thin air a tourist industry for Grimsby, once the world's largest fishing port. The Pounds 3m development, funded jointly by the European Community and Grimsby council, promises visitors the chance to 'sign on' as crew members before travelling through an imitation Grimsby back street to the Arctic fishing grounds. 'You feel the pitch and roll of the ship, the urgency and excitement of the catch, the raw, icy blast of the wind . . .' promises the glossy brochure. More is in store: an 'exhibition', opening later this month, will allow visitors, securely on terra firma, to 'experience the harsh reality of being under enemy fire on the gun-deck of a trawler at war', before switching to the German side and cowering in a recreated U-boat being depth-charged. 'It's mine blowing,' screams the publicity. 'Feel the submarine shudder, hear the tortured metal fracture . . .' All this may arouse misgivings among those uneasy about Britain's heritage industry. There is indeed irony in recreating the dead trawling industry next door to a new Sainsbury's hypermarket; while Grimsby's nearby fish dock, somewhat tatty, as genuine backstreets tend to be, but at least still operating, is not deemed a tourist attraction. The fish dock is also fighting for government cash towards a Pounds 16m upgrading. But then, Billy Butlin perhaps ruffled feathers when, in the 1930s, he decided that Skegness, where he had set up his hoopla stall with a borrowed fiver, should become the site of his first UK holiday camp. And before that, the Earl of Scarbrough's agent probably alarmed Lincolnshire villagers in the 19th century when, on his recommendation, Skegness was developed into a seaside resort. Today, Skegness and Mablethorpe, the Lincolnshire coast's main resorts, and Cleethorpes, just inside South Humberside, retain their traditional British seaside character, despite some substantial investment, including the Pounds 27m spent by Rank Leisure on Funcoast World, successor to Butlins at Skegness. Lincolnshire and South Humberside Tourism - a body set up in 1990, with local authority, tourist board, private sector and Rural Development Commission backing, to promote tourism - estimates that Lincolnshire attracts 5m day-visitors and 7m overnight stayers annually. The organisation's manager, Mr Christopher 'Kipper' Scott, says tourism in Lincolnshire employs 28,000 people for part or all of the year, and generates a Pounds 310m annual spend. Believing that tourism in the area has development potential, he has launched a national advertising campaign. So far it has sparked 10,000 requests for the county's short breaks and main guide. At present, Lincolnshire tourism is concentrated on the coastal strip, which has traditionally catered for visitors from Yorkshire, the East Midlands and Lincoln. The area now has to compete with year-round theme-park developments such as Centre Parks' Sherwood Forest complex. A recent CBI report, Towards 2000 in Lincolnshire, suggested the county consider creating such a facility. Efforts are being made both to encourage more visitors to Lincolnshire, especially from East Anglia and south-east England, and to coax more of them into the county's many attractive historic towns and villages. Mr Scott is also wooing walkers and nature-lovers by emphasising the coast's nature reserves. Nor will devotees of Alfred Lord Tennyson escape Lincolnshire's entreaties: this year, the 100th anniversary of his death, he is being invoked to promote Mablethorpe, where he spent part of his youth. 'I think Lincolnshire has 'calm and deep peace' to offer,' ventures Mr Scott, in Tennysonian mood. Along the coast, in Grimsby, the local authority hopes tourists attracted by the National Fishing Heritage Museum will be persuaded to linger, and spend money, at the recently completed Pounds 50m Freshney Place shopping centre, a mixture of town centre refurbishment and redevelopment. Further rejuvenation of the Alexandra Dock, where the museum has been built, is also planned. Whimsy and nostalgia fade away north of Grimsby; the no-nonsense might of South Humberside's chemical installations and its large Immingham port complex have yet to be 'interpreted' by industrial tourism. The elegant Humber bridge attracts some tourists, but most developments here appeal mainly to local job-hunters. Kimberly-Clark, for example is developing a new Pounds 100m paper products plant at Barton, creating 750 jobs. The Humber estuary - consisting of the four main ports of Hull, Goole, Grimsby and Immingham and numerous wharves on the rivers Trent, Ouse and Hull - has seen trade rise by 50 per cent in a decade. It now handles 60m tonnes of goods a year, and regularly services 52 countries. The European single market looks certain to boost further the estuary's port activity. Markets serving 320m European customers - 740m if you include eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union - can be reached within 24 hours from the Humber. It already handles most UK trade to and from Germany, Belgium, Holland and Scandanavia. Further investment of more than Pounds 100m in the Humber ports is in the pipeline. With more than 100 berths run by more than 20 operators, many of the estuary's distinctive ports and wharves have established particular strengths in certain operations. One remarkable feature of the estuary is that, thanks to its rivers, it stretches 50 miles inland, allowing ships to be discharged close to major motorways and feeding into Yorkshire's canal network. Sadly, however, Britain's most inland port, Gainsborough, on the Trent, is experiencing problems, because twists in the river make it unsuitable for larger vessels. How long, one wonders, before the tourist influx arrives?</p>

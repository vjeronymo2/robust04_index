			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Sleepy Kids reports Pounds 155,927 loss Sleepy Kids, the children's animation and character merchandising group, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 155,927 in the year to October 31 1991. The result, the first since the company moved to the USM in December 1990, was struck on turnover of Pounds 183,840 and compared with a loss of Pounds 805,869 from turnover of Pounds 204,140 for the previous 15 months. Mr Keith Isaac, chairman, said that the group had decided to reflect a more prudent accounting policy by writing off development costs which had been shown as an intangible asset in last year's balance sheet. This had been dealt with by a prior year adjustment which charges Pounds 816,318 to the profit and loss account for the previous 15-month period as an exceptional item. This year's charge is Pounds 58,079. Mr Isaac said that Potsworth &amp; Co/Midnight Patrol, the company's first animation production, had been sold to 24 countries and negotiations for further sales were underway. Losses per share were reduced from 4.22p to 0.74p.</p>

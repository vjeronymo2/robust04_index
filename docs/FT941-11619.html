			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Algerian oil and gas discovery for Lasmo Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, yesterday announced a discovery in Algeria. The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US, Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at 4,900 barrels of oil a day and 6.3m cu ft of natural gas. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the partners were considering an early appraisal of the find. 'The prospects for a commercial discovery are quite good,' he said. Last year Lasmo and its partners announced an oil and gas find south of the latest discovery. Two more exploration wells are to be drilled in the area, which is in a relatively remote area south-east of the town of Hassi Messaoud. The discovery is about 50km from the nearest pipeline. Oil operations in the region have so far been untouched by the political violence directed against foreigners in Algiers, although American drilling crews are flown to the site directly from Texas. The new Algerian discovery follows an announcement last month that Lasmo's gas reserves off Indonesia, one of its biggest assets, had been upgraded by 13 per cent. See People</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Ramos will require all his talents to turn this turmoil into a victory: The past and future of the Philippines president-elect AT THE start last February of his campaign for the presidency in the Philippine election, Mr Fidel Ramos made an unannounced two-day trip to Zurich. For several days after his return he refused to discuss it, and some of his own supporters started to think that it might have mortally wounded his bid for the nation's highest office. There followed a wave of gossip that he had gone to Zurich to establish links with the Swiss banking system, well-known to Filipinos for providing sanctuary for funds being salted away by dictators, or that he was there for a Valentine's Day tryst. The cigar-chomping former general successfully deflected the issue (in fact he had gone to woo support for the Philippines from the international group of Christian Democratic parties) and went on to win the most hotly-contested election in the Philippines. Mr Ramos, aged 64, will need more of that talent for turning a crisis into a victory when he assumes the presidency on June 30. Even now, the former defence chief's election win is disputed by some of the losers who insist there was massive fraud. The Philippines does not need uncertainty at this time. Political stability, Mr Ramos acknowledges, is crucial for the new administration to sustain a nascent economic recovery from several years of coup attempts and natural disasters. Mr Ramos will find many allies in the business community. Several big names in business openly backed his campaign. This was hardly surprising. In 1987 amid intense doubts over whether Mrs Corazon Aquino could last her term because of incessant attacks by rebel groups in the military and by communist insurgents, some businessmen were privately pushing for a Ramos-led junta to provide a tougher hand in government. Unlike his predecessor who inherited a bankrupt republic in 1986, Mr Ramos will take over an economy that is, according to independent economists, fundamentally sound although a widespread electric power shortage is a severe handicap. It is on top of Mr Ramos's agenda in his first days in office, according to aides. Mrs Aquino's government reined in pre-election spending despite its open support for Mr Ramos. As of late-May, according to Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, the national government had a budget surplus of 4.2bn pesos (Pounds 97.7m). Interest rates, already down substantially from early-1991 highs, could decline further as a result. Inflation, hovering at 8 per cent, is likely to stabilise at its target of 7 per cent for the year. The exchange rate remains steady, as international reserves remain high despite a surge in demand for dollars after the lifting of the import levy on April 30. For Mr Ramos, stability will translate into a 'continuity of policies' that the Aquino administration adopted. This will include adherence to an International Monetary Fund-supported economic stabilisation programme, on which the Philippines' relations with the world financial community remains hinged. But 'stability' also has a negative connotation for Mr Ramos. During the election campaign, his opponents interpreted his promises of stability as a strong hand, and warned that he really meant to impose martial law to silence critics and political opposition. Opponents view him as another indecisive leader. As head of the paramilitary Philippine Constabulary during Mr Marcos's martial rule, Mr Ramos has been blamed for human rights violations traced to that group. The critics also recall that in the August 1987 coup attempt against Mr Aquino, it took Mr Ramos, then chief-of-staff of the armed forces, several hours to strike back. Nonetheless, when he did, his troops snuffed out the rebellion in hours. During the campaign, Mr Ramos repeatedly 'guaranteed' that he would follow the constitution in the exercise of his powers. But he says that his 'will not be a wishy-washy, flip-flopping leadership'. His 40-year experience in the military, he says, is just part of a 'well-rounded' government service. The military, he says, 'does not mean only pulling triggers, it is also involved in community development' that includes building roads and bridges in places that the private sector won't go because of communist insurgents. As a member of the Aquino cabinet until mid-1991, Mr Ramos was overseer of all government development programmes for western Mindanao region, one of the most depressed areas in the country. His motivation for 'people-oriented undertakings', he says, was sharpened by that experience. He did well in Mindanao provinces in the election. Consensus-building, Mr Ramos also says, will be an important facet of his administration. One of his first moves will be to form a council of economic advisers, which will be composed mainly of private-sector leaders. He plans to meet with this group once a month, to help him establish priorities concerning business and the economy. The result of Mr Ramos's trip to Zurich last February could come into play in his foreign policy thrusts. Mr Ramos appears poised to seek expanded ties with the European Community and with neighbours in Asia, as the Philippines prepares for a diversification in its external relations after the withdrawal of US military bases. Reports from Washington yesterday indicated that US aid to the Philippines would be reduced next year to a third of current amounts.</p>

According  to this law, the operation is to be concluded by the year 2000.  Speakers of the Bundestag groups of the Christian Democratic  Union, Christian Social Union, and Free Democratic Party of  Germany stressed that the cost ceiling set by the FRG finance  minister at 20 billion marks must be observed. This also  includes financial compensation measures for the affected cities  of Bonn and Berlin. The decision envisages that the "central  part" of the government functions will be moved to Berlin but  that certain "political fields" will remain in Bonn. [passage  omitted]</p>

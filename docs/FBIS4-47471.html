Sidorov, ``Kurchatov Institute'' branch of Russian Science  Center; UDC 535.375]    [Abstract] A Nd-glass laser set for thermonuclear fusion  consisting was built and tested, a set consisting of a master  oscillator and two successive amplifier stages with phase  conjugation and pulse compression. The oscillator operates in  the single longitudinal mode and single transverse mode. The two  amplifiers operate in the four-pass mode. The beam emitted by  the oscillator in pulses of 3 mJ energy and 25 ns duration  passes through a x10 magnifying telescope, a 12x12  mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture stop, and then two Faraday  isolators before entering the first amplifier stage. The active  medium here is a cylinder of neodymium glass 20 mm in diameter  and 300 mm long. This preamplifier stage includes a cell filled  with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, where an SBMS (Stimulated  Brillouin-Mandelshtam Scattering) mirror for phase conjugation  is formed by a focusing lens with a 50 cm focal length. After  four passes in this stage and with the energy of radiation thus  having been boosted to 3-4 J, the beam proceeds through a x3.3  magnifying telescope, a Faraday isolator with a 60x60  mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture, and then a x2.5 magnifying  telescope before entering with a 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/]  aperture the second amplifier stage. The active medium here is  an array of six slabs of neodymium glass 340 mm long with a  20x120 mm[.sup]2[/] large cross-section each. They are  optically pumped by seven rows of four IFP-5000 flash lamps  between each two slabs, distilled water thermally insulating the  slabs from these lamps. Each slab is followed sends radiation to  a cell filled with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, an SBMS mirror  for phase conjugation in the pulse compression mode being formed  in each by a 17 mm[.sup]2[/] large square lens with a 5 m  focal length. Upon entering this second amplifier stage, the  beam is thus split into six separate partial beams with a 17x100  mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture each. It then leaves this stage  with an about 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] large compound aperture,  the duration of radiation pulses having in this stage been  shortened 20 ns to 2 ns duration. The energy reflectivity of the  mirrors here is estimated at 50 %. Two tests were  performed: 1)  with direct passage of the beam passage through the second  stage, 2) with reflection of the beam first by only one lateral  face of each slab and then by their both faces. Direct passage  was found to cause breakdown of the active medium near the  lateral faces of the slabs, but radiation pulses of 20-25 J  energy were nevertheless coming from each slab. Reflection by  one lateral face resulted in a more uniform distribution of  radiation intensity over the beam cross- section and reflection  by both lateral faces resulted its most nearly uniform  distribution. In the latter case the divergence of the total  radiation beam was smaller than 0.1 mrad, while the energy of  radiation pulses from each slab still reached the 25 J level.  Such a laser set can be modified for simultaneous radiation  emission at two different frequencies. This can be achieved by  splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a  device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half- beam  to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas  and one containing a solid substance. Then while the beam is  being focused, a traveling interference pattern will form in the  focal plane owing to different radiation wavelengths in the two  half-apertures. Figures 3; references 3.</p>

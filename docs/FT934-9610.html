			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Mercury launches charge cards COMPETITION in the fast-growing market for telephone charge cards was given a boost yesterday with the launch of a range of cards by Mercury Communications, the main competitor to British Telecommunications. Mercury said its cards offered 'substantial savings' on long-distance tariffs compared with BT's Chargecard. It also offered new features such as the capacity to call from abroad without using an operator. Charge cards allow customers to use pay phones and private handsets other than their own and charge the cost to their home account, or that of their company. Mercury's long-distance charge card tariffs are generally lower than BT's standard tariffs, but BT last week made sharp cuts in its weekend tariffs for long-distance charge card users. BT also claims to have charge card agreements with more international operators than Mercury.</p>

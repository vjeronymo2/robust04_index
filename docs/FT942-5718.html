			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / US workers 'must share in decision-making' Sustained employee participation in decision-making is a critical factor in increasing economic performance, a panel appointed by the Clinton administration reported yesterday. The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, chaired by former labour secretary John Dunlop, spent a year on a comprehensive examination of US labour-management relations. In its 150-page report it found viable employee participation arrangements were rare because the structure of US labour law, little changed since the 1930s, makes managers wary of changing traditional decision-making hierarchies. The commission found that 40m to 50m US workers would like to participate in critical decisions on their job but have no opportunity to do so. 'Employee participation has grown and is designed to increase efficiency, performance and quality,' Mr Dunlop said. '(But) the high performance workplace may well be limited in the eyes of employers by our existing statutory arrangements.' The Commission also found that most sectors of American society support workers' right to unionise and participate in collective bargaining. The labour secretary, Mr Robert Reich, said business and government should be alarmed by Commission findings on the growing income gap in the US, currently the largest of any industrialised nation. Over time, this increasing difference between rich and poor, and educated and uneducated, would lead to a sharp erosion in both productivity and competitiveness.</p>

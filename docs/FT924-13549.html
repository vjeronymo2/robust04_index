			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Sihanouk to divide nation into separate controlled zones Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk said the only solution in dealing with the refusal by the radical Khmer Rouge guerrilla group to abide by the UN-sponsored peace plan was to proceed without them and divide the nation into separate controlled zones, AP reports from Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge yesterday refused to move despite a UN warning that Cambodian elections will be held by next May with or without Khmer Rouge participation. However, the UN peacekeeping chief in Cambodia expressed strong opposition to the idea of dividing the nation. Prince Sihanouk, head of a council grouping all four rival Cambodian factions, said dividing Cambodia would be the best way to settle the dilemma of the Khmer Rouge boycott of the election.</p>

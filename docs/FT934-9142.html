			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Treasury set to force severe cuts in sick pay subsidy THE TREASURY is set to force through draconian cuts in the government's contribution to statutory sick pay, raising the prospect of a significant increase in employers' labour costs. In recent weeks, the Treasury has been pressing Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to abolish entirely the Pounds 710m state subsidy to employers when staff go on sick leave. Whitehall officials believe Mr Lilley has managed to resist complete abolition of the subsidy, arguing that the government is publicly committed to containing industry's costs. But they think the Treasury has forced him to slash the subsidy from 80 per cent of an employer's total costs to 'well below' 60 per cent in the run-up to the Budget, to be delivered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in less than three weeks. The change, which will be fiercely opposed by industry, will require legislation in the forthcoming session of parliament, risking renewed unrest on Tory backbenches. In recent weeks, the Treasury has pressed for abolition of the sick pay subsidy altogether in an attempt to limit the outgoings of the Department of Social Security, Whitehall's biggest spending ministry. In the longer term, ministers also want to shift the cost of sick pay from the government to employers, and to encourage employees to take out private insurance policies. However, cuts in the subsidy will trigger increased costs for industry at the same time as many businesses are trying to emerge from the recession. The Confederation of British Industry, which has not been consulted by ministers on this issue, says it would be extremely concerned if the government went ahead with the cuts. The issue is certain to be raised at next week's CBI conference in Harrogate. Employers were able to claim the entire cost of sick pay from the state until 1991, when the subsidy was cut to 80 per cent. But in March the government admitted that it was considering further reforms. Whitehall officials have acknowledged that they would need to limit some of the extra costs to industry by combining a reduction in the sick pay subsidy with tax breaks for business. 'If you are going ahead with big cuts, you would have to find some other way to compensate employers,' said one official yesterday. However, officials also said that ministers were leaning away from legislation which would provide different levels of subsidy for certain employers, on the grounds that such a system would be too complex and expensive to administer.

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Technology: Games people play PHILIPS is counting on CD-Interactive to help boost its sagging consumer electronics business. But the success of its multimedia entertainment system depends largely on the availability of good software. Consumers must have enough interesting material to play on their CD-I machines or they will not purchase the hardware. 'Our job is to create experiences that are so compelling that it will make people want to engage in them,' says Bernard Luskin, president of Philips Interactive Media of America (Pima), the software subsidiary set up to produce programmes especially for CD-I. Philips has signed up 40 co-publishers to help with the task, including Time-Life Books, Rand McNally and the Children's Television Workshop, which produces Sesame Street, the long-running television series. Gaston Bastiaens, director of interactive media systems at Philips, is confident that film production companies and record businesses which own software rights will want to produce CD-I titles as another way of exploiting their assets. Pima has so far made about 50 CD-I titles. These have involved producers, developers and publishers working together. Production costs range from Dollars 150,000 to Dollars 350,000 for each programme. Like many other consumer electronics manufacturers, Philips expects software to be an increasingly important source of revenue. Although it is licensing its CD-I technology to several Japanese manufacturers, it is the software that will drive the profits, according to Bastiaens. Philips is committing itself to subsidising an entirely new segment in the software industry in order to support its new technology. Producing the software is expensive due to the vast amount of material that goes into each title, and the amount of time it takes to make one programme. Sales are not high enough yet for Philips to want to reveal figures, but CD-I is not expected to bring in much revenue for at least another two or three years. In the meantime, Philips faces the time-consuming and costly process of convincing consumers that its interactive media is worth spending Pounds 599 for a player and Pounds 15-Pounds 35 for a single disc.</p>

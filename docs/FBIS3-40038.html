The EU's proposal in the field of agriculture was also  completely unacceptable to Finland:    "Only 5 percent of agricultural production would be  covered,"  Under Secretary of State Veli Sundback said.    Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that the criteria for  receiving agricultural support are so numerous and wide-ranging  that Finland cannot accept the proposal, but will return with a  counterbid at the weekend after careful study.    In some areas, however, Haavisto was able to note forward  movement. A special protocol protecting the Lapps' way of life  was accepted by the EU. Foreigners will be granted the right to  buy leisure homes in Finland. The issue of herring fishing in  the Baltic Sea has also been resolved. This means that EU  citizens will be able to fish herring for use as mink and fox  food, with a promise of a review and an investigation of herring  stocks after three years. However, the issue of regulations  covering travelers remains to be resolved.</p>

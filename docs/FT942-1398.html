			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Management: Re-engineering's all the rage - Alan Cane reports on the popularity of a controversial business tool in the UK A majority of the UK's large companies claim they are already in the throes of business process re-engineering, the iconoclastic technique which promises ambitious performance improvements for companies prepared to undertake the drastic changes involved. In essence, BPR involves rethinking the way a company does business - or any part of its business - from the beginning, cutting out unnecessary stages and using information technology where appropriate to improve efficiency. It is necessary, management experts say, to give the improved performance necessary to remain competitive. There are substantial risks involved - it can be likened to rebuilding an aircraft in flight - so it is perhaps surprising that surveys, carried out by the Cranfield School of Management, and by the management consultancy Price Waterhouse in collaboration with the Financial Times, indicate separately that between 60 and 70 per cent of big companies claim to have undertaken, or are about to undertake, BPR. Even more surprising, only 7 per cent in the PW/FT survey saw it as a leading cause of business instability. The surveys indicate that IT directors may be enjoying a new prominence after a spell in limbo when their projects failed to deliver all they promised. Now they seem to be working with their chief executives to define and push through the changes needed for BPR. Most of the companies canvassed said they were attracted to BPR because of the potential savings. The Cranfield study, carried out among 40 senior managers from a variety of business functions, listed cost reduction, cycle time reduction (doing things quicker) and improvement in customer satisfaction as the chief drivers. The PW/FT survey, an occasional poll of 100 chief executives, revealed that 79 per cent were looking for improved performance, while 35 per cent saw BPR as a means of cutting costs through, for example, staff savings. None of the respondents saw it as a waste of time or effort and 24 per cent said BPR was essential to survival. Both surveys show that commitment to BPR from both the chief executive and the IT director is essential for success, but that support from the rest of the organisation is equally critical. The Cranfield study, directed by Chris Edwards and Ashley Braganza, observed: 'The rest of the management team needs to support the proposed change if it is to work.' There is evidence, nevertheless, that senior executives are not spreading their commitment to other staff: 'The organisation as a whole is barely aware of the existence of BPR when compared with the senior management,' according to Cranfield. It identifies this tendency for BPR to be seen both as an issue for senior management and, as an IT issue, as a substantial barrier to successful implementation. Indeed, 38 per cent of respondents to the PW/FT survey believed the chief executive had been the main architect of BPR while 28 per cent gave the credit to the IT director. One respondent to the PW/FT survey said: 'It would be difficult for IT to drive BPR. It must be generated from within the operational side of the business with IT providing support where possible.' A sound knowledge of the company, energy and a willingness to take a fresh approach are clearly needed. Some 60 per cent of those credited with leading BPR in their companies had been in post from one to three years. Thirty-five per cent had been there longer but only 5 per cent had been in post for less than a year.</p>

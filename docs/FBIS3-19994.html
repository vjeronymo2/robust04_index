According to the Cologne Institute of German  Economics (IW) industrial production in eastern Germany "is  growing." The Hamburg Archive for World Economy [HWWA] talks of  a "continuous recovery process."    According to the HWWA, the GDP of the new laender will  probably grow by 7 percent in 1994 (7.1 percent last year).  However, progress will continue to depend on "major financial  transfers from the west."    According to the analysis of the Hamburg researchers, the  construction trade, which increased its production by well over  10 percent in 1993, continues to be the most important economic  force. First, the demand from public and industrial sectors  dominated in 1993, then it was the housing construction sector  (increase by 70 percent). "However, the upswing, which was at  first almost exclusively concentrated on the construction sector  and private services, has broadened with the stimulation of  industry." Last year, the processing trade produced about 10  percent more.    In the opinion of the IW, the plastics-processing industry  is  the winner of the structural change in the past three years:  Output more than doubled. Production increased by more than 50  percent in steel and light-metal construction, the cement  industry, building materials, and cold rolling mills. The  production share of the 10 best branches of industry increased  from 30 to 55 percent, it was stated.    The leather industry suffered the sharpest decline:  According to IW calculations, the volume of goods decreased by  84 percent from 1990 to 1993. Another 11 branches had to cope  with production losses of more than 50 percent: Among them there  is also the machine-building industry (- 65.2 percent) and the  electrical industry (50.0 percent). IW economist Karl Lichtblau  says that the reason is "the economic decline in the west and  the stronger orientation to the world market, in contrast to the  construction sector, for example."    According to the HWWA, investments by enterprises in eastern  Germany increased by 13 percent in 1993, but they lost dynamism,  as compared to 1992 (20 percent). The unit labor costs of  collectively agreed wages, which amount to about 80 percent of  the western standard, are too high because of productivity,  which is 50 percent lower, it was stated.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRED SECURITIES ANALYST SUES DONALD TRUMP  </P> <P> Marvin B. Roffman, the securities analyst fired for his remarks about Donald J.  Trump's new casino, sued the real estate tycoon Tuesday, claiming that Trump  made defamatory comments about him.  </P> <P> Roffman also filed an action before an arbitration panel of the New York Stock  Exchange, charging that he had been wrongfully dismissed by the Philadelphia  brokerage firm, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., his attorney said.  </P> <P> The suit filed in U.S. District Court seeks more than $2 million from Trump for  defamation and wrongful interference in Roffman's employment.  </P> <P> He is asking more than $3 million from Janney Montgomery Scott on three counts  of wrongful dismissal, defamation and infliction of mental distress.  </P> <P> Martin Sobol, Roffman's attorney, said his client believes he was fired from  his job because "he was honest."  </P> <P> "He feels he was wronged," Sobol said.  </P> <P> Roffman declined to comment. John Barry, a Trump spokesman, declined to comment  until he had seen the suit.  </P> <P> Roffman, 50, a vice president at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, was  fired March 23 over his negative critique of Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort in  Atlantic City, N.J.  </P> <P> Roffman told the Wall Street Journal in March 20 editions that the casino would  flourish just after it opened in April, but "once the cold winds blow from  October to February, it won't make it. The market just isn't there."  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit, Trump sent a letter to Janney Montgomery President  Norman T. Wilde that said, "For a long while I have thought of Mr. Roffman as  an unguided missile."  </P> <P> In his suit, Roffman said Trump's letter "contained false and defamatory  material because . . . Roffman's statements in the Wall Street Journal were not  outrageous; he is not an unguided missile, unprofessional . . . and a bad  analyst."  </P> <P> Trump threatened Janney Montgomery with a lawsuit unless Roffman publicly  retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16-year veteran securities  analyst. Roffman initially signed a letter of apology, but took it back in a  second letter and was fired.  </P> <P> Janney Montgomery contended that he was fired because he violated company  policy by issuing statements to the press that had not been cleared and that  had not been disseminated to the firm's clients.  </P> <P> Janney Montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual Life Insurance  Co.  </P></p>

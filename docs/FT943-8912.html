			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Property heading up down by the river: Andrew Taylor reports on signs of rising house prices and increased office lets in London's Docklands What have Texaco, the oil company, Thalgo, a beauty products maker, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, and an unnamed Hong Kong purchaser of 25 Barratt homes got in common? The answer is that all four have decided in the past 18 months to occupy commercial premises or invest in London's former docklands. After more than four years of harsh recession the mood is sunnier in one of Britain's hardest-hit property markets. According to the London Docklands Development Corporation 800,000 sq ft of office space was let in the 12 months to the end of March, the biggest annual total since 1987 and 50 per cent more than the previous two years combined. Since January 500,000 sq ft has been let and there are firm inquiries for another 1m sq ft. Mr Mike Bignell, head of property development at the corporation, said: 'At this rate commercial lettings should top 1m sq ft this (financial) year for the first time in Docklands' history.' House sales and prices have also picked up. Barratt said it was selling homes faster than it could complete them at its riverside Sovereign View housing development next to the former Surrey Docks, where three-quarters of the 300 homes planned have been sold. A single Hong Kong investor took 25 earlier this year. Barratt is thought to have paid Pounds 1m an acre to acquire the adjacent 2.5-acre Pageant Steps site where it plans an Pounds 11m development of 83 luxury houses and apartments. Upriver at Bermondsey, Berkeley Group is thought to have paid the equivalent of Pounds 2m an acre for a quarter-acre riverside site where it plans to build 10 town houses. Prices are still about 20 per cent below their late 1980s peak but demand for Dockland property is rising, particularly from Far Eastern investors. The corporation estimated that house prices, which fell 35 per cent to 40 per cent from their peak, had risen about 15 per cent since autumn 1992. It said builders sold 700 new private-sector homes in the first six months of this year, leaving just 31 new units unoccupied, compared with an unsold stock of 1,500 new homes in 1988-89. The stock of unoccupied offices will take much longer to disappear. The corporation estimated that at the end of last month there was about 5m sq ft of empty commercial space, representing a vacancy rate of 39 per cent. Four-fifths of this empty space is on the Isle of Dogs, home of the massive Canary Wharf development which came out of receivership last year and is now owned by a group of banks. Lettings have increased sharply, with Canary Wharf more than 50 per cent let to tenants such as the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, London Underground, Mirror Group Newspapers, Credit Suisse First Boston and Texaco. Texaco moved last year from its former headquarters in Knightsbridge in London's West End, where its lease had run out, to a new 250,000 sq ft air conditioned building at Canary Wharf. It said: 'We were looking for world-class office facilities where we could house all of our 1,000 headquarters staff in a single building, which Docklands could provide. 'There was some concern about transport when the decision to move was taken in the late 1980s. In the event journey times for staff have been much less than expected following the opening of the Limehouse Link road - which provides a dual carriageway connection all the way into the City of London - and an improvement in reliability of the Docklands Light Railway.' Texaco has hired a Hovercraft to shuttle staff at peak travel times along the Thames from Charing Cross pier to Canary Wharf - a journey of about nine minutes. A more recent arrival is Thalgo Cosmetic, the UK subsidiary of a French beauty and health products group, which three weeks ago moved into offices at Millharbour on the Isle of Dogs. Miss Anna Doyle, UK operations controller said: 'We looked in the West End and the City but felt that Docklands offered us a very high-quality for a very competitive price. The proximity of London City Airport is an added bonus for a company with a French parent which has executives travelling back and forth. 'Road access to the City is now very good and the construction of the Jubilee Underground line extension will further improve communications with the City and West End.' The corporation said initial rents averaged Pounds 10 a sq ft. A good guide to the improvement in the market is a reduction in sales incentives with the rent-free periods offered by developers falling from three or four years to about a year to 18 months. Mr Bignell said: 'We will know that we are really getting somewhere when rent-free periods disappear altogether. This may not be too far away if current trends persist.'</p>

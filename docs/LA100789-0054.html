			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN ENDORSES CANDIDATE FOR 27TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEAT  </P> <P> Departing from his longstanding policy of remaining neutral in contested  Republican primaries, Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday endorsed Modesto City  Councilman Dick Lang in the race to fill a vacant San Joaquin Valley seat in  the state Assembly.  </P> <P> Lang, the 51-year-old principal of Modesto High School, is one of four  Republicans and three Democrats running in a special Dec. 5 race to succeed  former Assemblyman Gary Condit, a Modesto Democrat who was elected to Congress  last month to succeed Tony Coelho.  </P> <P> In addition to Lang, the other Republicans running to succeed Condit are  Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside, Turlock Mayor Brad Bates and Tracy Finance  Director Zane Johnston.  </P> <P> Democratic candidates for the vacant 27th Assembly District, which covers all  of Stanislaus County and the Atwater-Snelling region of Merced County, are  Stanislaus County Supervisors Pat Paul and Sal Canella and Condit's former  field representative, John Lazar of Turlock.  </P> <P> Deukmejian made no reference to any of the other candidates in his endorsement  of Lang as "an outstanding candidate (who) will be a great asset to the  California Legislature."  </P></p>

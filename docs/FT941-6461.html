			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Turkish lira continues to fall Turkey's currency crisis deepened yesterday, with the lira losing a further 7.8 per cent, following the official 12 per cent devaluation in January, writes John Murray Brown from Ankara. The central bank dollar rate of TL21,550, compared with a devaluation rate of TL17,250, is putting the economy under increased strain. A sharp increase in overnight interest rates, up to 200 per cent on Monday, has not slowed the depreciation and with reserves down 25 per cent since the start of the year, there is little room available for bank intervention.

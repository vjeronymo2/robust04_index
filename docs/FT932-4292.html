			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / HIV treatment trials show promising results PRELIMINARY trials of a treatment for HIV infection being developed by a Franco-US joint venture have shown that it boosts the immune system, helps prevent weight loss and can reduce the presence of the virus in patients' blood. But shares in Immune Response Corporation, the San Diego-based US partner in the venture, fell Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 16 in New York yesterday, after Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading Aids researcher at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned against over-enthusiasm. 'The data are quite promising and statistically significant. But the differences between those on vaccine and those on placebo are quite small. We mustn't explode into over-enthusiasm again,' he said in Berlin at the annual international conference on Aids. Dr Jonas Salk, the inventor of the polio vaccine, who is involved in the project, said HIV-positive individuals should not rush to their doctors to otain the vaccine. 'These are simply trends. But it is a first whiff of spring,' he said. The other partner in the venture, called Immunization Products (IPL), is Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, majority owned by Rhone-Poulenc of France. IPL has developed a therapeutic vaccine consisting of HIV virus which has been deactivated and then cultivated in human cells before being injected into patients. The vaccine is not designed to prevent infection, but to assist the immune system of patients who already have the virus. The trial involved testing 103 HIV-positive patients in nine US medical centres over 12 months. Before that, studies were undertaken which showed the vaccine does not cause significant adverse reactions and does not accelerate the virus's replication, said the company. IPL said additional studies were required to see if the vaccine slowed progression to disease and death. The company said the vaccine might be used in combination with other treatments such as AZT, the medicine offered by Wellcome of the UK. Dr Dennis Carlo, vice-president and chief scientific officer at IPL, said: 'These are a lot of significant trends in the right direction. We do not know what this means exacty. But we do know that the more virus you have, the faster the disease progresses. If you can affect the levels of virus, you should have an effect on progression to Aids and death.' The trials suggest the vaccine gives patients' immune system a statistically significant boost, says the company. Those given the vaccine experience relatively stable levels of virus, while those on placebo (a non-active dummy) experienced a 48 per cent rise in viral load. Some patients on the vaccine experienced a fall in the amount of virus in their blood. There was also a significant difference in weight loss between the two groups, with those on vaccine benefiting. Immune Response Corporation shares have been as high as Dollars 28 1/2 in the last 12 trading days. According to some Wall Street analysts, the sell-off was a technical reaction to the release of information that the market had already absorbed.</p>

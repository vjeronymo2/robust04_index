He said this was  explained by the war that is continuing on the territory of  Azerbaijan, by the crisis in the national economy, which is on  the verge of bankruptcy, and also by actions of various  political groupings, trying to destabilise the internal  political situation.    In order to pull the republic out of the crisis, Guliyev  believes, it is necessary to take urgent measures in two  directions: To urgently end the war in a way that would fully  guarantee the national interests of Azerbaijan, and to get down  to economic reforms. He stressed that the republic's leadership  remained dedicated to the peaceful settlement of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict. Guliyev expressed the hope that the  talks between the conflicting sides, currently under way in  Moscow with the mediation of Russia and the CSCE, would yield  concrete results. Guliyev also informed the parliament on the  intention of the Azeri leadership to take resolute steps to  strengthen law and order in Azerbaijan.</p>

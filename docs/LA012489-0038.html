			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft completed its acquisition of Western Union's Westar satellite  system, which includes three orbiting satellites and a fourth satellite  awaiting launch. Hughes did not disclose terms of the deal, but analysts have  valued the deal at $100 to $200 million. Stephen J. Petrucci, president of  Hughes Communications, said the Westar system will ease a shortage of capacity  in Hughes' Galaxy satellite fleet and provide a backup for commercial  customers.  </P></p>

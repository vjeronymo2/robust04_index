			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Czech government to pay compensation to WWII persecution victims The Czech government will pay Kcs1bn (Pounds 22.5m) to an estimated 10,000 victims of Nazi persecution during the second world war. However, the compensation will apply only to those who suffered in concentration camps and prisons, not to those uprooted and subjected to forced labour. The government continues seeking compensation from Germany. Six Turkish MPs, representing radical Kurdish groups, were charged yesterday and could face the death penalty if convicted for offences against the unity of the state. Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, said the MPs were surrounded by a 'cloud of terrorism' which linked them to the outlawed Kurdish Workers' party. The Slovak parliament yesterday called general elections in the autumn following the ousting the Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar in a no-confidence vote. The vote for new elections on September 30 and October 1, a year and half ahead of schedule, was unexpectedly unanimous after Mr Meciar dropped his call for a June poll. On Wednesday an interim broad coalition government headed by Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik was installed.</p>

The proposed revisions will allow foreign workers to remain  in Taiwan up to three years, one year longer than the current  limit.    COLA also proposed revisions which will allow foreign  laborers to apply for jobs offered by employers other than the  one that sponsored their entry into Taiwan. Currently, foreign  workers are legally bound to their employers and cannot seek  employment elsewhere on the island.    Other revisions proposed by COLA include a measure which  would require any enterprise facing a labor shortage to make a  public announcement about the shortage so that domestic workers  unions can take part in the recruiting process.    If an employer is found to have made a false statement about  the labor shortage, or fired workers after employing them, COLA  will be allowed to punish the employer under the revisions.    COLA Chairman Chao Shou-po said the revisions will address  many of the problems which have plagued the department over the  past few years.    COLA officials said they wanted to extend the maximum  allowed  time for foreign workers because the current limit is too short.  Workers now have to leave just after they have become familiar  with their working environment, they said, which limits their  contributions.    And to prevent foreign laborers from leaving their work  illegally, Chao instructed employers to deposit a certain share  of the workers' wages in a special account, which is returned to  the workers when they return home.    The revisions will be sent to the Executive Yuan for review  in March.</p>

			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: A second skin for astronauts - Worth Watching The skin-tight synthetic laminates worn by today's athletes could point the way to space suits which fit like a second skin. Researchers at United Technologies Corporation, of Hartford, Connecticut, are devising materials to make much lighter clothing for astronauts. Membrane films are available which separate gases, necessary to remove carbon dioxide. By the next century fabrics could be made from a genetically- engineered protein which would contract like muscle and apply constant, life-protecting pressure on the body.

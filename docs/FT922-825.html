			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Toronto judge adjourns O&amp;Y hearing on costs payments A TORONTO judge last night adjourned until Monday a hearing on the issue of how Olympia &amp; York Developments, the Reichmann family company under Canadian bankruptcy court protection, will obtain an estimated CDollars 40m (Pounds 18m) needed to pay its overhead and restructuring costs over the next few months. The adjournment came several hours after O&amp;Y proposed to its creditors a plan to sell an assortment of minor assets that carry a book value of CDollars 70m and are held by the Canadian parent company and it subsidiaries. The proposal was aimed at countering creditors' objections to paying most of O&amp;Y's costs without receiving any compensation. Lawyers for a number of secured and unsecured creditors objected to the O&amp;Y proposal, with the former arguing against putting up any fresh money and the latter saying the proposal discriminates against them. In the US, meanwhile, it emerged that O&amp;Y is hoping to raise at least Dollars 100m (Pounds 54m) by selling a minority shareholding in its main US property subsidiary to one or more investors. The possible sale of such an equity stake would be part of a complex US restructuring plan that began taking shape this week with the hiring by O&amp;Y of Mr Patrick Ahern, a former Lehman Brothers partner who has been named as chief restructuring officer in New York. O&amp;Y's US subsidiary is the only significant part of the Reichmann empire that has not been placed in administration or filed for bankruptcy protection. Mr Ahern was described by an O&amp;Y adviser yesterday as the US counterpart to Mr Steve Miller, the chief O&amp;Y bank negotiator. Mr Ahern will be working on the restructuring plan with US partners from Price Waterhouse, the long-time auditor of O&amp;Y, according to the O&amp;Y adviser. The O&amp;Y adviser said discussions were already under way with prospective investors who might buy a stake in the Canadian group's US company - Olympia &amp; York Companies (USA). He declined to name the possible investors. The Dollars 100m-plus will be needed by O&amp;Y by next year, to finance needed repairs, maintenance and tenant improvements on US properties. The talks with prospective equity partners are being handled by Mr John Zucotti, head of O&amp;Y's US operations. In a related development, O&amp;Y said that it had raised Dollars 32.5m as a result of the sale of an 11 per cent shareholding in Hyperion Partners, an investment fund. This cash could help O&amp;Y to avert the need to file in the near term for protection from creditors under US bankruptcy law. Mr Nigel Hamilton, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young, administrator to Canary Wharf, held a 'routine' meeting with representatives of the scheme's 12 main lenders in Toronto yesterday.</p>

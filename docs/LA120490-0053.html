			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS OPPOSING WATER TANK ON RIDGE  </P> <P> Residents in the Laguna Heights community have begun a petition drive to block  construction of a 2-million-gallon water tank on one of the city's highest  ridgelines.  </P> <P> While a water district official said the tank is needed to conserve water and  keep Laguna Niguel's hillsides green, residents say the ridge, which offers a  panoramic view of the Capistrano Valley, should be left undisturbed. An  equestrian trail frequented by joggers and walkers stretches along the hilltop.  </P> <P> "This ridgeline is one of the most beautiful in all of South County, if not all  of Southern California," said Kathleen Botros, a resident of the Palisades  development, a neighborhood in Laguna Heights. "This was one of the reasons so  many of us chose to buy here. This is just a real valuable community resource  we're talking about losing here."  </P> <P> Residents said the project, which is expected to take a year to complete and  would require the removal of 25,000 cubic yards of soil, would lower property  values and generally disrupt their lives while construction is under way.  </P> <P> Engineers have determined during the past year that the hilltop, which rises  700 feet above sea level, would be "the ideal location" for the reservoir,  according to a spokesman for the Moulton Niguel Water District, which serves  Laguna Niguel and surrounding cities.  </P> <P> The concrete tank would be 32 feet deep and 106 feet wide, but would be mostly  buried, said Carlo Habash, director of engineering for the water district.  However, a 50-foot wide section would rise above ground 6 feet at the highest  point, he said.  </P> <P> Although several bids have been received on the project, Habash said the tank  cannot be installed until the water district is granted right-of-way by the  Laguna Heights Homeowners Assn., which owns the property. But residents say a  project of such magnitude should not proceed without the blessing of the  homeowners themselves.  </P> <P> Diane Brizzard, who has carried anti-tank petitions throughout the area, said  the feedback she received so far indicates the community is opposed to the  project.  </P> <P> "I've gotten negative responses from everybody I've talked to," she said.  </P> <P> Minh Argabritht said residents are upset that the association did not notify  them earlier that such a project was in the works. "It took us by surprise."  </P> <P> Laguna Heights Homeowners Assn. board member Dave Cathcart said the board was  approached by the water district about nine months ago but said there was no  reason to advise homeowners until engineers could decide if the project was  feasible. The board unanimously supported allowing the water district to  conduct feasibility tests, Cathcart said.  </P> <P> "I would hope we could sit down and arrive at a meeting of the minds, so the  project could be completed with as little inconvenience and frustration as  possible," Cathcart said.  </P> <P> A 3-million-gallon tank is currently under construction in the nearby Bear  Brand Ranch area, Habash said. About 15 reservoirs have been built in the area  since 1974, but this is the first time there has been such a public outcry, he  said.  </P> <P> Water district officials will meet with residents on Thursday to explain the  project, Habash said. At a subsequent association board meeting, the district  will attempt to gain easement rights, he said. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: USM Texon close to flotation - Reducing debt of Pounds 93m seen as priority for shoe materials group USM Texon, the Leicester-based manufacturer of shoe materials and manufacturing equipment, plans to go public in the near future to reduce its Pounds 93m debt burden and provide greater freedom to exploit growth opportunities. No date has been set, but Mr John Foster, managing director, said that 'everybody is feeling that the time for an exit is near'. The company was created in 1987 as the result of a Dollars 115m (Pounds 75m) management buy-out from the former Emhart company of the US. Mr Foster would not say what value the flotation would put on the company, the world's largest producer of shoemaking machinery. But, with consolidated turnover last year of Pounds 179m, the stock market launch would be a substantial deal and a full listing. Timing would depend on market conditions and the development of a suitable financial record. The company's machinery business is emerging from a difficult period caused by recession and the collapse of east European markets; overall, it lost a total of Pounds 13m in 1991 and 1992. It returned to the black last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.7m. Profit would be higher this year, said Mr Foster, and would rise again in 1995. Orders in the machinery business had risen dramatically since April. The debt burden, which is about 70 to 75 per cent of capital, stems mainly from its Dollars 100m takeover in 1990 of the Texon footwear materials business. The annual interest bill, now running at Pounds 8.5m, delayed the restructuring of the machinery business, involving the closure in 1992 of its factory in Frankfurt. Mr Foster believes the world shoe machinery market, of which the company has a share of about 19 per cent, could recover from the current Pounds 250m a year to Pounds 350m by next year, returning to the 1989 level. The machinery business is benefiting from the company's development programme, which has transformed the product range over the past five to seven years through the use of proprietary software. 'None of our competitors has gone as far on elec-tronics as we have,' Mr Foster said. The less cyclical materials business is also developing new applications for its technology in air filtration and medical products. Mr Foster said there were opportunities for USM Texon in east Asia, where demand for machinery is growing as western shoe manufacturers seek more consistent product quality. The materials business has already set up a 60 per cent-owned joint venture in Foshan, China, to make cellulose. The company has discussed the planned flotation with a number of City merchant banks and Mr Foster said institutions, which own 89 per cent of the shares, 'won't be holding us back'. The remaining 11 per cent is held by management. USM Texon was called United Machinery Group until 1991. It will have to be renamed again when it goes public, to avoid confusion with the Unlisted Securities Market.</p>

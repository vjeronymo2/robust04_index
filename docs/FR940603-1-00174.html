			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> b. All easements and rights-of-way, except as shown on maps included in the Plans and Specifications, have been obtained from the owners of the properties across which the Project is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably be expected to object to such construction). The remaining easements and rights-of-way, if any, will be obtained as required to avoid delay in construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. All staking, except as shown on the maps included in the Plans and Specifications, has been completed and sufficient staking crews will be available to maintain stakes at all times in advance of construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Where underground distribution construction is required, permission has been obtained from state and local highway and road authorities to install underground distribution power facilities and set pedestals, if any, on the highway and road right-of-way in the Project area. Notwithstanding such permission granted to the Owner, each Bidder is responsible for ascertaining that the equipment, methods of construction, and repair proposed to be used on the Project will meet all requirements of public authorities having jurisdiction over highway and road right-of-way. The successful Bidder will be required to furnish proof satisfactory to the Owner of compliance with this requirement. If required by highway or road authorities, the successful Bidder will furnish to such authorities a bond or meet other guaranty requirements to assure the prompt repair of all damages to highways and roads and their associated rights-of-way caused by the Bidder during construction of the Project. This requirement is in addition to and independent of the Contractor's Bond required under this Contract. The acceptance of a bid from any Bidder is not to be construed as approval of the Bidder's equipment or proposed construction methods by or on behalf of the highway and road authorities. Bidders may obtain information concerning the requirements of highway and road authorities by communicating with the following  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.

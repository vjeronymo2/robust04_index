			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. STRINGS TIE UP DUKES AGAIN; NEWPORT BEACH FALLS TO LAST PLACE  </P> <P> For the second consecutive night, the Los Angeles Strings defeated the Newport  Beach Dukes in a Team Tennis match.  </P> <P> Friday at the Forum, the Strings' victory kept the Dukes out of a tie for first  place in the West Division. Saturday in front of 1,403 at the John Wayne Tennis  Club, the Strings (8-1) won, 25-24, and knocked the Dukes (6-4) into last place  in the division.  </P> <P> Ahead of the Dukes in the four-team division are the Stings, Sacramento  Capitals (7-3) and San Antonio Racquets (6-3). A week remains in the regular  season and only three teams from the division will make the playoffs.  </P> <P> The Dukes almost pulled out the victory Saturday, but Roger Smith and Marty  Davis lost to John Lloyd and Larry Stefanki in the final set.  </P> <P> The pair had rallied from a 4-1 deficit to tie the set, 4-4, but with Davis  serving at 40-30, the Dukes lost the game to go down, 5-4. Stefanki then served  out the set and match without losing a point.  </P> <P> The Dukes won three of the first four sets to take a 20-19 lead. Smith's  victory over Stefanki in men's singles put the Dukes ahead. Smith won, 6-5, by  winning the tiebreaker, 5-4, with an ace on the final point.  </P> <P> But it was the play of Amy Frazier early in the match that kept the Dukes in  contention in the late going.  </P> <P> Frazier struggled in the early games of her set against Robin White. Frazier,  who entered the match with the second-best women's singles record in Team  Tennis, had difficulty with her forehand and her first serves and fell behind,  4-1.  </P> <P> But Frazier, a committed baseline player, turned it around by going to the net  more times than she has all season, Dukes Coach Greg Patton said.  </P> <P> "Amy just graduated from high school, but she thinks like a Ph.D. Her forehand  was shaky so she went to the net," Patton said.  </P> <P> After White held serve to go ahead, 4-1, Frazier won five consecutive games.  </P> <P> To open the match, the Dukes' women's doubles team of Frazier and Sophie Amiach  opened the match by defeating Robin White and Anne White, 6-4. White and White,  Team Tennis' top-ranked women's doubles team, had defeated Frazier and Amiach,  6-3, Friday at the Forum, but the Dukes, ranked third, took control midway  through the set, breaking Robin White to go ahead, 5-3. Although the Strings  broke back, winning Amiach's serve at love, the Dukes then won the set by  rallying from a love-40 deficit. Frazier closed out the game and set with a  forehand return that handcuffed Robin White at the net.  </P></p>

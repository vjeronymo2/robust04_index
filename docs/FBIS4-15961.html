			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belarus Foreign Ministry has received an  official note from the Latvian Foreign Ministry asking for an  expalanation about Belarus Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka's  statements about the discrimination against Belarusians in  Latvia.    On 5 April, after the talks with UN Secretary General  Butrus-Butrus Ghali, Kravchanka stated that one of the main  subjects of the talks was how Latvia and Estonia carry out their  duties as regards Belarusians living there and the predicament  of Belarusians in those countries.    Kravchanka accused the two Baltic states and said that  Belarusians living in Latvia and Estonia suffer from certain  discrimination. He did not exclude the possibility of Belarus  proposing that the United Nations pass a resolution on the legal  status of Belarusians in the event it is not improved.</p>

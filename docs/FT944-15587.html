			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Banks wary of auditing deregulation New small businesses are likely to continue to be required by banks to have their accounts audited in order to borrow money in spite of a government initiative to reduce auditing burdens, the British Bankers' Association said yesterday. The association said banks would support the spirit of the government deregulation initiative by 'not normally' requiring audited information for small businesses exempted from such requirements under new legislation. However, it said banks were likely to continue to ask for audited accounts when a company had 'no regular or reliable management information,' or when there was no account history against which to measure ability to repay debt. Leaders of the association said this would probably include small business start-ups. Banks will also retain the right to call for audited information if terms and conditions of loans are not met, although this will be 'used sparingly'. The association insisted there was likely to be a significant change in the behaviour of local managers as a result of guidance being sent out by all large banks which will change policy to fit in with the government's initiative. Legislation has exempted companies with a turnover of less than Pounds 90,000 from having to have accounts audited, and those with a turnover of between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,000 can replace the audit with an independent accountant's report. Mr Paul Chisnall, an assistant director of the association, said banks had shifted towards a greater appreciation of the benefits of deregulation but he added that they would still have to 'look very closely' at small business start-ups because of a lack of account history. Banks were likely to want properly audited accounts in order to establish 'base figures' as they started up. Sir Nicholas Goodison, president, said that account audits were no longer regarded by banks as an 'essential tool' in monitoring small businesses because they reflected the past, and banks were more concerned with current cashflow. The Auditing Practices Board is expected later this week to publish guidelines on reporting requirements for accountants who have to provide independent reports as a substitute for audits in larger small businesses.</p>

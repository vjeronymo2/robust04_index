The National Commission of Guatemalan Widows [Conavigua]  said  Army troops have been visiting villages in the interior of the  country since last February to recruit youths.    Conavigua stated in a communique: "The mothers, sisters, and  wives of Guatemala protest once again against the abrupt,  indiscriminate manner in which the Army is implementing an  obligatory recruitment."    According to the report, youths are "captured" when they  leave school, mass, the market, or when walking in the square.    Conavigua has referred to the Army's recruitment as a  "brutal  hunt."    Conavigua also criticized the Army's never telling families  their sons have been taken to military detachments for  recruitment; therefore, relatives are kept in the dark for quite  a while regarding their whereabouts    Conavigua stated the persecutions were conducted such  municipalities as Coatepeque, Momostenango, Totonicapan,  Patzite, and El Estor, and in the country's interior, as well as  in other municipalities in the central Department of  Chimaltenango and the western Department of Quetzaltenango.    International human rights organizations such as the  Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office, which is the  independent human rights UN specialist in Guatemala, and the  Guatemalan Mutual Support Group [GAM] have requested the  government regulate or ban the current recruitment practices.    GAM consists of Colombia, the United States, Mexico, Norway,  Spain, and Venezuela.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar reaches new low again THE DOLLAR touched a new low against the D-Mark for the second day running as dealers were unprepared to support the US currency. However, the trend was one of disinterest rather than dislike and the foreign exchange markets were relatively quiet yesterday, writes Peter John. Meanwhile, the pound firmed slightly against the D-Mark, with some support being seen as it languished near to its ERM floor. The US currency opened mildly better, but dealers said there was no reason to buy it in spite of its relative cheapness and it continued to drift towards new lows against the D-Mark in early European trade. Disappointing news from the Commerce Department on new US factory orders, shipments and unfilled orders in July had little effect. The July data had already been superseded on Tuesday by the more significant August figures from the US National Association of Purchasing Managers. These suggested that the US economy is likely to remain weak in the run-up to the Presidential election in November. Mr Michael Feeny, a market analyst at Sumitomo Bank in London, said: 'If anything, the economic data from the US is weaker yet again this week. Just because they are cheap there should be no rush to buy dollars.' Traders said customer business in dollars was very low and one argued that a market equilibrium had been reached. He added that most serious positions had been taken and any changes between now and the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20 would be prompted by 'window dressing and scare-mongering'. The dollar hit a record low of DM1.3870 in Frankfurt. In London it closed at DM1.3905, off 30 basis points on the day. The US unit ended at Dollars 2.004 in London against the pound (compared with Dollars 2.002 in New York the previous night) and Y122.90 against the Japanese currency, after Y122.85 the previous day. In New York last night the dollar improved to DM1.3942 and the pound ended at Dollars 1.9993. Dealers said there were no reports of intervention from the central banks in the wake of the concerted intervention last week. Sterling paused for breath, with most dealers taking stock of the announcement that the Bank of England's reserves fell by around Dollars 1.3bn last month. This indicated stronger official support for the pound than most had anticipated, raising concern that the level of intervention in August is unsustainable. The pound firmed  1/2 pfennig to DM2.7875 as buyers came in at the lower levels. The Italian lira, which is also struggling near the bottom of the ERM ladder, saw support and held steady at L764.6 against the German currency.</p>

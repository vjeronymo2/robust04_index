A student's eligibility to borrow shall be considered to have been falsely certified by the school if the school_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Admitted the student on the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not meet the applicable requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit as described in paragraph (e)(13) of this section; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Signed the borrower's name without authorization by the borrower on the loan application or promissory note.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Secretary discharges the obligation of a borrower with respect to a loan disbursement for which the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the student for whom the loan was made received the proceeds of the loan either by actual delivery of the loan funds or by a credit in the amount of the contested disbursement applied to charges owed to the school for that portion of the educational program completed by the student. However, the Secretary does not reimburse the lender with respect to any amount disbursed by means of a check bearing an unauthorized endorsement unless the school also executed the application or promissory note for that loan for the named borrower without that individual's consent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relief available pursuant to discharge.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section relieves the borrower of an existing or past obligation to repay the loan certified by the school, and any charges imposed or costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan that the borrower is, or was, otherwise obligated to pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default on the loan after discharge, and is eligible to receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section is reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting agencies to which the holder previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Discharge under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section qualifies the borrower for relief only with respect to the amount of the disbursement discharged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Borrower qualification for discharge.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to qualify for discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this section the borrower shall submit to the holder of the loan a written request and a sworn statement.

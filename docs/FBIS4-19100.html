			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Ruediger </F> Moniac; place and date not given: "Ruehe -- NATO Air Strikes in  Bosnia Absolutely Necessary"]    [Text] [Moniac] NATO aircraft crush Serb-Bosnian tank  attacks on the center of Gorazde. Was this an appropriate  reaction, Mr. Ruehe?    [Ruehe] A human catastrophe on an immense scale is beginning  to emerge in Gorazde, as the city is in danger of falling into  the hands of the Serbs. The strike by NATO aircraft on behalf  of the United Nations was, therefore, absolutely necessary. At  the moment, the Serbs seem to be containing themselves, they are  not advancing any further. Obviously, the Serbs only understand  this clear language. Now everybody has to influence the Serbs  to stop their attacks. Russia can continue to play an important  role in this process.    [Moniac] Should the Serbs not have been stripped of the arms  that are now pointed at the Muslim enclave back in Sarajevo,  instead of only making them withdraw?    [Ruehe] The United Nations' military ground forces are very  limited and depend on the warring parties keeping the various  agreements. So far, the United Nations have had neither legal  nor practical opportunities to actively disarm the besiegers.  It is, therefore, all the more important now to exploit all the  opportunities in Bosnia where the United Nations can fall back  on NATO's resources. This means military air operations in  particular. Neither the civilian population nor UN troops must  come to harm in these missions.    [Moniac] Do German politicians have to restrain themselves  forever -- due to Germany's historical involvement in the  Balkans? Can it go on like this, although there does not seem to  be an end of the terrors of war in sight?    [Ruehe] German soldiers in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be part  of the problem rather than part of the solution, because their  commitment and their work would not be supported by all the  parties to the conflict. For this reason, we are not  considering a deployment of German soldiers there.    [Moniac] What contribution could Germany make, if a peace  plan were to come into force in former Yugoslavia?    [Ruehe] We should not speculate about a situation now that  must be established first and toward whose realization we are  all working.</p>

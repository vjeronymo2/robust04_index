			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: Hazel coppice grows anew - Country view No-one knows how many coppice workers there were in the UK before the second world war. But in 1956 there were only 300 and their numbers have steadily decreased, said Hampshire county council countryside officer Jonathan Howe. In Hampshire, however, the trend has been reversed. Howe says that 70 of the 190 full-time coppice workers in England and Wales work in his county. His team is reviving this ancient rural industry based on hazel, a species that, with oak, ash and yew, was viewed as a chieftain among trees in Celtic times. Hazel coppicing declined in the mid-19th century, pushed out by the millions of oaks planted to supply the expanding tanning and shipbuilding industries. It nearly died out after the second world war and the agricultural manpower crisis it brought. Since then much coppice has been bulldozed or poisoned, at first for agricultural purposes, then to make room for conifer plantations. The backbone of the revival in Hampshire has been the thatching industry and a renewed interest in hurdles for garden fences and outdoor screens. 'The industry has attracted new entrants in the last few years, and though some of the thatching spar makers have gone out of business with the general decline in the building trade, many have become hurdlemakers,' said Howe. 'Hurdlemaking is really picking up after the years of recession. People are realising that a good hazel hurdle should last 15 years - longer than its rival willow.' Each year Howe and his team attempt to bring 300-400 acres of coppice woodland back into rotation. They clear derelict coppice wood, replanting when necessary, and thin the taller, slower-growing deciduous trees. This is the busiest time of the year for the coppice worker. Most of the cutting is done between February and late April. Hazel rods cut at this time are sappy and usable for several months. Spring cutting also brings a bonus for the flora. 'The bluebell wood evolved under traditional coppice management,' said Howe. 'This country is the best in Europe for bluebells, which thrive in our oceanic climate,' said Howe. 'Violets, primroses and wood anemonies also thrive under the coppice system. They have lots of sunlight for two to three years. Then all is shade for the next few years until the coppice is cut. The alternative - the high forest system - kills off their abundance. Under this system there is a wonderful flush of flowers for two to three years, then as the conifers grow all becomes dark for 60 years.' After cutting, the hazel stools are left for seven to 10 years. 'After this time an acre of well-stocked hazel will produce 10,000 to 12,000 rods 10 ft to 15 ft in length,' Howe said. Hazel rods are ideal for pea and bean sticks. They are also used in river bank protection, using the traditional 'spiling' method - woven round wooden stakes. Curled hazel shavings are used in potpourri. 'We are developing new hazel products such as dog kennels, tree guards, rose arches, bowers, framed gates and bird hides,' Howe said. 'We are also attempting to bring coppice wood into the home once more. In the past it was not only used as the framework inside wattle and daub panels, but also for furniture. We are encouraging one or two designers to experiment with woven hazel panels in chairs and blanket boxes.'

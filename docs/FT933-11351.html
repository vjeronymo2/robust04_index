			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Campaign blow for Commission: Dismay in Brussels EUROPEAN Commission officials reacted with a mixture of dismay and apprehension to the Bundesbank's decision to leave its key discount rate intact at 6.75 per cent. 'It's war,' said a senior official close to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. Official disappointment at the modest nature of the Bundesbank cut was palpable. For most of the year, the Commission has been waging a quiet campaign for reduced European interest rates to lift the European economy out of recession and restore confidence to the goal of economic and monetary union. At times this year tension between Brussels and Frankfurt has surfaced. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, visited the EC capital last January and quashed the idea of a 'fast track' to Emu involving France, Germany and the Benelux, supported by possible changes in the 'convergence criteria'. At the EC summit in Copenhagen last month, Brussels officials counter-attacked. Many could barely hide their pleasure at the final communique's call for an early reduction in interest rates. When the Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by half a percentage point to 6.75 per cent ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo, the reaction inside the Commission was positive but guarded. One official explained that the size of the Bundesbank cut was less important than the promise that further reductions were in the offing. These expectations were deflated yesterday. EC officials now believe it is unlikely that Frankfurt will move its key rates until September.</p>

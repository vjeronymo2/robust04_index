			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Switches Ad Agencies: Eastern Airlines handed its $45-million  advertising account to the New York ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather.  </P> <P> The business was formerly handled by Lintas: New York, which had been the  agency of record since 1982. Martin Shugrue, recently named as the bankruptcy  trustee for the struggling unit of Texas Air Corp., said the change was  prompted by the airline's current opportunity to "make a new beginning" with  the direction of its marketing and advertising. The agency transition will take  place over the next 90 says, although Ogilvy will begin working on the account  immediately.  </P></p>

The tract contains an estimated 35.6 million tons of recoverable reserves. Coal quality, as received, averages 8,360 BTU/lb, 25.52 percent moisture, 10.03 percent ash and 0.97 percent sulfur. This coal bed is being mined in adjoining tracts by Western Energy Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FEIS addresses the cultural, socioeconomic and environmental impacts that would likely result from leasing these federal coal lands, the cumulative impacts of the coal lease application, and the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources involved with this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three alternatives are addressed in the FEIS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 1_(Preferred)_Lease the 2,061.00 acres of federal coal lands to Western Energy Company as applied for in the coal lease application with two additional mitigation measures: (1) Establish a 160-foot buffer zone to protect cultural properties; and (2) Plant trees in the buffer zone to screen the traditional cultural properties from intrusions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 2_(No Action)_Reject or deny the coal lease application. The federal coal lands would not be offered for lease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 3_(Cultural Resource Avoidance)_The coal lease application would be partially approved. Two cultural properties with values as traditional cultural properties and sites with intangible spiritual attributes would be avoided by excluding federal coal lands in and around these two sites from the coal lease application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public is invited to submit written comments on the FEIS, the FMV and MER of the tract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, notice is also given that a public hearing will be held on Wednesday, November 2, 1994, on the proposed lease sale, the FMV and MER of the proposed lease tract. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before 1 p.m., November 2, 1994.

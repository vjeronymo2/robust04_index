			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ELECTION  </P> <P> The recent election of the Soviet Congress of Deputies has generated some of  the most starry-eyed Western political commentary since the portrayal of Yuri  Andropov as a jazz-loving closet liberal. Although the election does represent  a departure from the previous status quo, we should not allow it to distract us  from the important continuities in the Soviet political situation. The election  did not alter the fundamental fact that Soviet political events reflect  primarily the interests and desires of the ruling elite.  </P> <P> In the past, Communist Party candidates' 90-plus percent majorities were taken  as a mockery of democracy. Boris Yeltsin's 89% seems to have fallen a point  short of the level necessary to raise eyebrows. Although the size of Yeltsin's  majority does not necessarily imply fraud or manipulation of the electoral  process, we should think twice before we take his election as evidence of an  emerging democratic process.  </P> <P> The entire Yeltsin scenario, from fall to resurrection, may well have been  orchestrated to maximize the political benefit to Mikhail Gorbachev. Yeltsin's  ostracism for being "more Gorbachevian than Gorbachev" was never very  convincing. Furthermore, the political latitude given to the Yeltsin campaign  -- including the organization of demonstrations -- represents a degree of  tolerance tantamount to an endorsement in the Soviet system.  </P> <P> The re-emergence of Yeltsin as the figurehead of a leftist movement offers  substantial political benefits to Gorbachev. Playing the leftist "opposition"  against the right will allow him to assume the role of the indispensable  moderate who can mediate between the otherwise irreconcilable extremes.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, with Gorbachev's passive blessing, has become the first Soviet leader  with a primarily popular, as opposed to a Communist Party, base of support. The  cultivation of a popular movement in a nation without a tradition of free  political expression represents a gamble of sorts. Such a movement could well  spin out of control, particularly in sensitive areas such as ethnic minority  affairs. The willingness to accept these risks probably reflects the depth of  Gorbachev's need to recruit support in the struggle against the conservative  entrenched bureaucracy. He knows that the genie of popular political expression  will be difficult to control once let out of the bottle; it would be even more  difficult for a Brezhnev-style conservative opposition to suppress.  </P> <P> When viewed in the contest of current political conditions, the recent Soviet  elections cannot be seen as a step towards popular democracy. They can be  viewed more accurately as a release of popular political pressure calculated to  strengthen the hand of the reformist leadership. The true test of the limits of  Soviet electoral politics will be the extent to which glasnost is extended to  potentially popular opponents of Gorbachev's policies of perestroika.  </P> <P> DANIEL J.

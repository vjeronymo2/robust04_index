			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: Talking books shake off Cinderella image  -The fastest-growing sector of contemporary publishing Too busy to sit down and actually read The Bible? Never mind. Now you can listen to it as you drive around the M25, south-east England's latter-day version of Dante's hellish circles. For Pounds 199, Isis Audio Books delivers an uncut version, 66 cassettes, requiring 85 hours of listening. For lesser sums you can have smaller segments. It is a great effort by the publishers but by no means 1994's most important development in the talking book market, which is the fastest-growing sector of contemporary publishing, expanding by an estimated 10 per cent annually. There are about 50 publishers of audio books in the UK. Much of the output is, sadly, inferior. There are notable exceptions, with some publishers - such as Cover To Cover, Chivers, the BBC and Penguin - producing exceptional recordings. But the 1994 Golden Microphone Award - if it existed - would unquestionably go to Naxos, the classical music specialist which has built a solid reputation for producing premium-quality CDs at budget prices. That such a carefully-managed label thinks this field, snobbishly disregarded by many chattering class members, worth entering, is the best indication that audio books are no longer publishing's poor relation. The Naxos label, which also offers some recordings on tape, is worth considering for several reasons. First, Naxos has gone straight into CDs - meaning superior production qualities - while other publishers are still locked into the antiquated cassette market. Second, price is a factor; a two-CD Naxos recording will cost you Pounds 6.99, while most other publishers charge Pounds 7.99 for a two-cassette book. Naxos also selects and produces its voices with great care; of the 20-plus Naxos books now available, all are read - performed is more accurate - by superb voices. And, while all Naxos books are abridged, a controversial matter, cutting has been handled sensitively. Thus, in the Naxos recording of Joyce's Ulysses (four CDs, Pounds 10.99, 4hrs 49mins), the accompanying leaflet explains what has been cut and why. At last a publisher is alive to the full range of audio possibilities. Naxos uses its vast catalogue of classical recordings to supplement its talking books with appropriate musical extracts, highlighting and complementing the mood of the spoken word. For example, for its version of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (read by Michael Sheen, three CDs, Pounds 8.99, 3hrs 43mins), Rachmaninov's 'The Isle of the Dead' is a fine choice for the text. Opting for a reliable brand name is generally - but not always - sensible. Choosing an unabridged audio book by the two best companies in the market, Cover to Cover and Chivers, is probably the wisest course. There are now so many versions of the same text available that selection can be a problem. For example, there are three new accounts of Middlemarch: Penguin's (abridged, four cassettes, Pounds 9.99) read by Harriet Walter; the BBC's (also abridged, four cassettes and Pounds 9.99) read by Ronald Pickup; and, by far the best, Cover to Cover's unabridged version (24 cassettes, Pounds 69.99) read by Maureen O'Brien. Walter is either unable or unwilling to use her voice to distinguish between characters. Ronald Pickup at least varies accent and rhythm but, if you can afford it, the best by far is O'Brien's version, which skillfully varies accent, intonation and pace. Abridgement continues to cause controversy but sometimes it is a positive merit. A good example is Terry Waite's Taken on Trust, his memoir of incarceration in Beirut. Chivers has brought out an uncut version, read by Waite, costing almost Pounds 50 for 12 cassettes. Waite's plodding delivery of his own ponderous text rapidly palls; on the page the dullness can be skipped. This is not so easy on cassette - which is why you may opt for Hodder Headline Audiobooks version, under Pounds 10 for two cassettes, also read by Waite. If you have the money and time for an unabridged story, particularly by classic authors who have powerful narrative skills on the page, then there really is no other publisher to go for than Cover to Cover, which this year has brought out some wonderful recordings. Miriam Margolyes brilliantly delivers Oliver Twist (12 cassettes, Pounds 34.99), as does Timothy West with Barchester Towers (14 cassettes, Pounds 39.99) and the popular Martin Jarvis gives a splendid performance in Great Expectations (12 cassettes, Pounds 34.99). Chivers also has an enviable, often highly entertaining, range of recordings. Gems this year include Olivia Manning's Friends and Heroes, the final volume of the Balkan Trilogy (10 cassettes, Pounds 37.95), two Flashman novels (Flashman and Flashman at the Charge, both eight cassettes and Pounds 31.95) read by Timothy West. Jeffrey Archer's Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less (splendidly read by Archer sound-alike Alex Jennings, eight cassettes, Pounds 31.95) is good for a long car journey . The relaunched Argo label, which has reverted to Polygram, has re-released some excellent material this year, including I, Claudius read by Derek Jacobi (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), and Three Men in a Boat, vivaciously handled by Jeremy Nicholas (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99). Laurie Lee reads Cider With Rosie (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99): one instance where the writer also proves to be an excellent reader. Other publishers fare less well, regarding the growth in audio book sales as little more than a chance to squeeze some extra cash from back lists. In this market, price and reader name is no guide to quality. The BBC generally never puts a foot wrong, and Alan Bennett reading his own Diaries 1980-1990 (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99) or William Hurt reading Paul Theroux's The Great Railway Bazaar (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99) are two fine examples of compelling texts matched with the very best readers. One slight disappointment is Kenneth Branagh's reading of Laurie Lee's As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99). His voice is too sterile, too contemporary, for the subject matter. From its much-hyped launch a year ago, Penguin has proved hit-and-miss. Perhaps the problem is over-production - more than 80 titles - combined with what appears to be a determination to go for well-known faces rather than the most appropriate voices. While Timothy Spall gives an hysterically funny reading of William Boyd's A Good Man In Africa (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), Fiona Shaw's reading of another Boyd novel, Brazzaville Beach, is comatose. For unintentional hysteria, try Roger Moore's rendition of Jack Higgins' Thunderpoint (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), where Moore does as fine a version of ham Nazi as you could wish for. Or borrow - for goodness' sake do not purchase - Kuki Gallmann's I Dreamed of Africa (two cassettes, Pounds 7.99), read by Isabella Rossellini. Famous film star she may be; but here she betrays not the slightest understanding of the English language.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Sealed with a kiss long ago Sir, Dominic Lawson ('Kissing in the European style', October 11) might be interested to know that kissing as a greeting is not a recent habit in Britain. Erasmus (among others) commented in a letter: '. . . Wherever you go, you are received on all hands with kisses; when you take your leave you are dismissed with kisses . . . wherever a meeting takes place there is kissing in abundance . . .' - Ep Erasmus I (translated from Latin, F M Nichols, London 1901-1918). Winifred Roll, D2 Albany, Piccadilly, London W1V 9RG</p>

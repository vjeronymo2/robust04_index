			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: BEEF INDUSTRY CHANGES EMPHASIS  </P> <P> The beef industry has convinced itself that it is now, at long last, a  "consumer-driven" industry. What that means in public relations language is  that the beef industry has convinced itself that it is now producing a product  that meets the demands of today's consumer.  </P> <P> Dr. Gary Smith, head of the Texas A &amp; M Animal Science Department and a  leading meat scientist, said at a recent conference in Seattle called "A Report  Card on Beef" that the beef industry has changed from a strictly  production-oriented business to a much more consumer-driven business.  </P> <P> For one thing, he said, consumers are now being supplied with leaner, more  closely trimmed cuts of beef. "The beef industry," Smith remarked, "has made  remarkable progress in repositioning its products as healthful and contemporary  in caloric content, and further progress can be expected in the future."  </P> <P> Another aspect of modern beef has come to light as the result of a Kansas State  University project funded by Denver's Beef Promotion and Research Board. It  indicates, for one thing, that the cholesterol content of beef is not affected  by the type of grain fed to cattle.  </P> <P> Of more interest to the beef consumer is the board's finding that the  cholesterol content of lean tissue in certain steaks, trimmed of external fat,  does not increase as marbling increases. This confirms the results of previous  studies indicating the cholesterol content of beef does not vary among  different cuts and grades. Therefore, the researchers concluded, customers can  select higher-quality beef cuts without the fear of getting more dietary  cholesterol.  </P> <P> Yet another study, this one conducted by researchers at a USDA center in  Nebraska, illustrates that the beef industry has a rich diversity of genetics  to produce whatever today's customer wants.  </P> <P> Researchers crossed sires from 13 different breeds with Angus, Hereford and  Shorthorn dams. As expected, breed was found to have a definite effect on  marbling. More interesting was the finding that even when fat content doubled,  flavor, juiciness and tenderness scores changed very little. "That leads one to  wonder," the study concludes, "whether a push for well-marbled steak is worth  the effort. Certainly noteworthy is the strong negative relationship between  marbling and retail product."  </P> <P> What all of these studies (which are funded by money from the "beef check-off"  program and the Beef Promotion and Research Board) are doing above all else is  sending a very mixed message to the consumer about beef.  </P></p>

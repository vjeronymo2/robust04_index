			<p>BFN     [Text] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid has warned that if  Yasir 'Arafat does not retract his remarks on honoring  agreements, Israel will not abide by the accord. Sarid, who has  been closely involved in the autonomy negotiations, says that  'Arafat's statements in the Johannesburg mosque earlier this  month on signing agreements has created a crisis of confidence.  The PLO leader, Sarid said, must declare his statements there  null and void and reaffirm his total commitment to the peace  process, in particular his support for a determined and open  fight against terror. The environment minister was interviewed  by Qol Yisra'el reporter Shulamit Schmerling during a visit to  Haifa.</p>

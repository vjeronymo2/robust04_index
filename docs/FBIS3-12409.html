			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 28 Feb (SANA)--The unified central command  of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]  and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has  said that the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and the  ensuing bloody repression is the bitter fruit of the Oslo  agreement. The command stressed that this agreement must be  foiled and that the political process must be rebuilt based on  the resolutions of international legitimacy that deal with the  Palestinian cause in order to reach a solution that secures the  Palestinian Arab people's national rights to repatriation and  self-determination and their right to establishing an  independent state.    In a statement issued following its extraordinary session  today, the command called for a halt to the current negotiations  within the framework of the Oslo agreement until the Security  Council resolutions that call for an end to settlement building,  which they consider illegitimate, are implemented; until the  Fourth Geneva Convention is applied in the occupied territories,  including Jerusalem; and until protection for the Palestinian  Arab people is secured.    The command demanded that the Security Council adopt clear  resolutions and a suitable mechanism to implement its  resolutions on settlement building.    In another development, the DFLP called on Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to directly intervene  with the U.S. Administration, Russia, and Europe in order to  take tangible steps in response to the bloody massacres against  the Palestinian Arab people, especially the crime at the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque--steps that similar to those taken in Bosnia.    In a message today, the DFLP called on Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to  adopt appropriate resolutions, especially in terms of tightening  the economic boycott of Israel to its maximum levels until a  comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian cause and the  Arab-Israeli conflict is reached. Such a settlement should be  based on the principle of full withdrawal for full peace, on  providing international protection for Palestinian people under  the occupation by deploying international forces under UN  supervision, an on rebuilding the bases of the negotiating  process on the Palestinian-Israeli track in accordance with the  bases of the Arab-Israeli negotiations between Jordan, Syria,  and Lebanon on one hand and Israel on the other.</p>

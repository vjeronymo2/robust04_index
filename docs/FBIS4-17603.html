			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Apr -- "We are constantly coming back to  the fundamentals of multilateral cooperation. We understand  that we are to live together and therefore want stability and  peace more than anything else," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said in conversation with Rasul Guliyev, chairman of  Azerbaijani National Assembly, today.    Karabakh is our common sorrow. The Russian plan is as  realistic as possible. We are offering an honest mediation  together with the CSCE and the United Nations, Andrey Kozyrev  noted. We can introduce CIS peacekeeping forces, and this will  not mean a Russian military presence but a peacemaking  operation, the Russian minister stressed.    Rasul Guliyev highly appraised the Russian Foreign  Ministry's  efforts. The Azerbaijani politician believes that economic  interests should be at the basis of bilateral relations. "Of all  CIS countries we have the deepest integration. Economic ties  should be strengthened but for this the war must be stopped,"  Rasul Guliyev noted.</p>

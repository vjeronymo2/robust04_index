			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "Japanese Waiting To See Whose </F> View of the Territorial Problem Prevails in Moscow"]    [Text] Tokyo -- For the first time in the past few weeks  top officials have remembered Russia and said something about  it. The occasion was the arrival of deputy Gennadiy Burbulis to  attend an academic symposium on regional security matters. He  was admitted to a reception at the premier's residence and to  the office of the head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.    The former Russian state secretary's visit to Japan last  September left behind the best possible memories in Tokyo, based  primarily on what Japan saw as Burbulis' constructive approach  to the territorial problem. For this trip the pragmatic hosts  did strip Gennadiy Eduardovich of the title of Yeltsin's closest  adviser, together with the description "influential," but they  were well-disposed toward the visitor nonetheless.    Judging by available information, the meeting with the  cabinet head lasted half an hour and was unremarkable. The  visitor, placing special emphasis on the Russian president's  efforts, set out to persuade the Japanese premier that the  course of Russian reforms is continuing and is not going to  change and that the new Russian Constitution that has been  adopted lays the foundation for Russian political stability and  creates an opportunity for the solution of a variety of  problems, including bilateral Russian-Japanese ones. The host  was rather more laconic and, having paid tribute to Yeltsin's  visit to Japan last year, expressed the cautious hope that the  reforms in Russia would actually develop and would not go off  the road.    Burbulis conveyed greetings to the Japanese foreign minister  from Kozyrev, who expressed a wish for regular meetings with the  head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry for their mutual benefit.  Inspired by the greetings, Minister Hata responded by saying  that he is prepared to go to Russia and is even planning such a  trip, although he strongly linked the fate of the visit and its  date to the results of the upcoming Russian-Japanese  consultations at the end of February. If the results of these  talks are satisfactory from Japan's viewpoint, Hata will  definitely go to Moscow. What will happen if that is not the  case the minister did not say, although it is easy to guess.    Hata's linking the Russian visit to the outcome of the  routine round of bilateral consultations with no  earth-shattering tasks on their agenda is something new in the  context of bilateral relations. It appears that the Japanese  are tired of Russian vagueness and, fearful of Moscow's  unpredictability, want to clarify matters, first by confirming  the vitality and validity of all the accords that were reached  during Yeltsin's visit to Japan last year. As far as one can  tell, the Japanese scenario for the upcoming consultations is  based on a kind of brief questionnaire demanding clear,  unequivocal answers and opening with the number one question:  Does Moscow acknowledge the existence of the territorial  problem and is it prepared to continue the substantive dialogue  on this problem?    In view of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's well-known stance  on  this question, which is at odds with the president's, it is  understandable that the Japanese should want things defined. In  this respect, the terms set out by the Japanese foreign minister  look perfectly logical -- you have to know who your are dealing  with: the Moscow that went to Tokyo with Yeltsin, or some other  Moscow, one that has altered since the parliamentary elections  and the establishment of a government of red directors.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Japan hopes to build on first quarter rally - Emiko Terazono finds equity investors are cautious Japanese shares have shown surprising resilience against the recent turmoil in global stock markets, the yen's volatility and domestic political instability. Share prices were supported by capital flows as overseas investors shifted their funds from south-east Asian markets to Japan. The Nikkei index rose 9.7 per cent during the first quarter and outperformed the rest of the Pacific Rim by 45 per cent. The lack of downside risk compared to other Asian markets and hopes of an economic recovery led by a rise in consumption later on in the year prompted buying by overseas investors. During the first two months of this year, overseas investors bought a total of Y2,250bn in Japanese stocks, countering heavy selling by domestic corporations which were selling their holdings to supplement slack profits. The question is whether the strength will carry on through the second quarter. Investors had initially hoped that domestic institutions would start allocating cash into the stock market in the business year following allocation meetings which started at the end of last month. However, with bond yields still around 4 per cent, views among analysts are currently mixed as Japanese institutions may choose to invest in the bond market instead of stocks. 'Market conditions are likely to remain stodgy,' says Mr Peter Tasker, strategist at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo. Although the expected weakness is unlikely to reward aggressive selling, he says, falling bond yields and the weakening yen, which supported stocks at the start of the year, will have less of an impact. Earlier this week Japan's leading life assurers, large lot investors in Japanese stocks, warned that they would remain cautious towards equities. Mr Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan, says that life companies find stock investments difficult to justify due to the low dividends, and that they will boost investment in the domestic bond market. NatWest Securities in London is more optimistic, believing that Japan is the place to be this year because of the strong likelihood of a recovery in the economy and corporate earnings. Mr Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, is 'neutral' about the market. Although he feels that stocks are looking over-expensive compared to bonds, the expected earnings recovery is beginning to become evident and will support share prices. Considering the sharp falls in corporate earnings over past few years, the recovery is likely to be huge. According to James Capel, the machinery sector is earning less than 1 per cent of its peak profits, the car sector less than 3 per cent and electricals less than 18 per cent. Even if the figures do not recover the peak levels of the 1980s, an earnings rebound will signal a jump of four to five times over the next few years. NatWest estimates the earnings rebound to be around 20 per cent for the year ending next March. Although the price to earnings ratio of around 100 looks expensive on the basis of such figures, it says, looking beyond 1995 the figure does not seem too high. For investors looking to place funds in the stock market, the over-the-counter stock market with its small growth stocks may offer favourable prospects. The immediate economic outlook on the other hand remains mixed, although some 'green shoots' indicate that the economy has hit the bottom of its current cycle. How much longer will the economy crawl along the bottom? So far the economy has been helped by a rise in consumption, led by an active housing market as real estate companies have started to put cheap condominiums on to the market at a time of low housing loan interest rates. Housebuying has surged, while sundries and durable good sales connected to the housing market have also risen. The current deflation is also encouraging consumption, at least by volume if not by value. Whether such activity can be sustained as more companies are forced to cut labour costs remains to be seen. Although companies will not move to lay off their labour forces, a jump in consumer spending large enough to pull the whole economy out of its doldrums is unlikely. Kleinwort Benson projects real consumption settling down into an annual growth of around 1 per cent. Mr Geoffrey Barker, economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, says that the volatility of the yen could prompt policy moves which would boost the economy. He forecasts that currency speculators are likely to step up activity ahead of the Group of Seven talks in Naples and next month's corporate earnings results. 'If the yen moves below Y100 it is likely to prompt a policy response, including a cut in the official discount rate and another supplementary budget,' he says. If economic figures released over the next few months confirm that conditions are steadily improving, Mr Barker says that the Nikkei could break the 21,000 level. But caution still prevails, and Mr Mikio Fujii of Nomura Securities says that technical resistance remains heavy around the 21,000 level on the Nikkei 225. 'We would need very large volumes to break through,' he adds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vyacheslav Morozov report under the "Special Services" </F> rubric: "Who Is Who in the Federal Counterintelligence  Service?"]    [Text] According to reports, today President Yeltsin is  scheduled to address a meeting of Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] chiefs.    Boris Yeltsin's particular attention to the special  services,  especially after the well-known October events, is a conspicuous  sign. The top state official's visits to the head offices first  of the Foreign Intelligence Service and now of the FCS prove  that all the persistent talk about upcoming transformations at  the special services that are allegedly designed finally to lay  to rest the very memory of the KGB is nothing more than idle  speculation.    Another side to the top level contacts with the FIS and the  FCS is that the president is undoubtedly placing increasing  emphasis on career specialists and minimizing the prospects for  the emergence of "aliens," such as Ye. Savostyanov, who is said  to be considering resigning, at these offices. Another  possibility is that the presidential staff was swift to react to  Gennadiy Zyuganov's eloquence at the 9 May meeting outside the  Lubyanka buildings, where he called on KGB officers to make  their choice. Those on high are also making their choice, which  is why it is hardly a coincidence that speculation has mounted  about high-ranking "old-timers" gaining clout in the FCS  leadership, particularly General Stepashin, FCS first deputy  chief, and Colonel General Safronov, who rose from the KGB ranks  to the very top. They claim that none other than Safronov is in  charge of the entire service's operational management, whereas  Stepashin has to put up with rather ceremonial functions. As a  matter of fact, the first FCS chief, N. Glushko, is still in  service, however inconspicuous his current presence might be.  Well, intelligence is too important a business to be entrusted  to amateurs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Plamen Enchev commentary: "Khan Kubrat on Hudson River"] </F>   [Text] After the "Bulgarian umbrella" and the attempt on  the life of Pope John Paul II, Bulgaria has again been on the  lips of journalists and its name printed on the front pages of  the world's press. Ironic as it may sound, this time the code  name is "Khan Kubrat" -- the vessel named after the founder of  the Bulgarian state. This name can now be found in the UN  Security Council's protocols. However, to judge by the noise  made by some people ignorant of geography, one would think that  the violator of the embargo on what is left of Yugoslavia did  not sail along the Danube but along the Hudson River.    Only on 15 March, after the world organization had already  expressed its opinion on the case, did Sofia remember to convene  the Government Commission on UN Sanctions, and charge various  departments with related tasks. From the official statement  after the meeting it is now clear that the officials who allowed  the scandalous escape or kidnapping of the vessel and the oil  tankers will be held responsible. The incident took place on 3  March. There is a saying that fits this situation -- it is  called locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.    What Sofia's reaction would have been if the UN Security  Council's statement had not been in our favor is interesting.  Perhaps we would again have adopted measures and programs on  observing the Yugoembargo.    The waiting position of the official authorities was evident  throughout the entire case of the fugitive vessel -- from the  first clear signs at the end of January that something was amiss  with the vessel and its cargo to the strange circumstances  surrounding the arrest and release of the majority of the crew.    Even more questions arise if you believe the stories of the  sailors who made the pleasure trip to Prahovo and returned home  unencumbered. Something is wrong with the whole scenario. The  Yugoslav side could not provide a satisfactory explanation  either, but of course this is understandable. More than 5,000  tonnes of oil are important for the state subjected to the  embargo, and in the eyes of the Serbs the high price is  justifiable.    The question, however, is what is the Bulgarian point of  view? Officially we declare that we observe the embargo, but, on  the other hand, our position regarding the criminal violations  that take place from time to time is, to put it mildly, a  position of purely registering the violations. We even reached  the point when foreign observers of the Yugoembargo claim that  Bulgarian customs officials are corrupt. So far no one has  officially confirmed these accusations. In addition, no one has  explained why the customs officials allowed the Khan Kubrat, for  which they were responsible at the port of Somovit, to escape.    On 15 March the port was closed to oil transporters. DUMA  has learned that there are at least 40 additional tanker-tugs in  this port, all of them of unclear origin and final destination.  Hundreds of railroad tanker cars, the property of phantom  companies, are traveling between various railroad stations. The  time bomb is ticking away, and when it explodes, the echo will  be heard in the city on the banks of the Hudson.    We have already been positively mentioned once in New York,  something that made us famous. Should we risk a second  assessment because of purely domestic reasons?    We have no solid guarantee that we will be praised again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311) and Chu Baoping </F> (2806 0202 1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- More than 3,500 staff  members and workers today [28 April] gathered at the Great Hall  of the People to celebrate the brilliant festival of the working  class and laboring people -- "1 May" International Labor Day.    Li Ruihuan, standing committee member of the Political  Bureau  of the CPC Central Committee; and Li Lanqing and Wei Jianxing,  members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,  attended today's celebration meeting.    The celebration meeting started with the majestic strains of  the national anthem. Zhang Dinghua, vice president and first  secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presided  over the celebration meeting. Wei Jianxing presented a report  at the meeting, entitled: "The Working Class Should Be a Model  in Promoting Reform and Development and Maintaining Stability."  On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council,  he extended festival greetings and cordial regards to workers,  peasants, intellectuals and other laboring people of all  nationalities and to commanders and fighters of the Chinese  People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police and public  security cadres and policemen who have heroically defended the  motherland and protected the people and the socialist  modernization drive. He also expressed his high respects to  model workers and advanced collectives which have made  outstanding contributions to reform, opening up, and the  socialist modernization drive.    Wei Jianxing said: Reform is the only way to make the  country strong and make the people rich. It represents the  interests and desire of the working class and people of all  nationalities of the whole country and is the own demand of the  working class. Only by carrying out reform, constantly  liberating and developing the productive force, promoting  economic construction, making all-round progress in society, and  building China into a rich, powerful, democratic, and civilized  country, can we continuously consolidate the position of the  working class as the masters of the country and benefit the  working class. The working class must consider reform as their  own task, firmly support reform with perseverance despite  difficulties, actively plunge themselves into the work of  reform, and continuously push forward the reform work. The  state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises are the pillar  of the national economy. Only when we have successfully carried  out reform in state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises  can we fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system  and establish a firmer material foundation for the working class  and the broad masses of people to be the masters of the country.  The working class should make its due contributions to  deepening the reform of enterprises, accelerating the  establishment of a modern enterprise system, and doing a good  job in improving the state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises.       Wei Jianxing emphasized: Both reform and development need a  stable social and political environment. We have started a  number of reform measures this year and taken a greater stride.  The reforms, involving a wide range of activities, will  inevitably touch some deep-rooted contradictions and encounter  many unprecedentedly complex circumstances and problems. They  will involve the readjustment of power and interest patterns. I  hope that the working class will carry forward the fine  tradition of taking the interests of the whole into account,  proceed from the overall and long-term national interests, and  make immediate, individual, and partial interests subordinate to  long-term interests of the whole, so as to maintain social and  political stability and ensure the smooth proceeding of reforms.    Wei Jianxing pointed out: One of our party's consistent and  fundamental guiding principles is to rely on the working class  wholeheartedly. In order to deepen reform, promote development,  and maintain stability, we should carry out this principle even  more seriously. Any thought or deed which violates this  principle is erroneous. He said: In order to rely on the  working class wholeheartedly, we must fully respect the role of  workers and staff members as the masters of their own affairs,  protect their legitimate rights and interests, and arouse their  enthusiasm and creativity. We should seriously study new  circumstances and solve new problems during the course of  implementing the principle, and enact adequate laws and  regulations to ensure the implementation of the principle.    Yang Xingfu, vice president of the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions, read to the meeting a "decision of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions on launching among the workers and  staff members across the country a campaign to learn from the  `top ten outstanding workers and staff members of the country.'"  Other speakers at the meeting included Bao Qifan, a  representative of national model workers and deputy manager of  Nanpu Harbor Affairs Company of Shanghai Harbor; Guo Linghua, a  representative of national model workers and electric welder of  Dalian Shipyard; and Feng Changgen, a representative of national  model workers and professor of Beijing Science and Engineering  University.    The following leading comrades also attended the meeting: Ni  Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng  Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Wan Guoquan.</p>

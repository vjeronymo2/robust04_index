			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Bosnia tension raised: Serbs put all-out war back on the agenda Fears that the war in Bosnia will escalate further were fuelled yesterday after Bosnian Serb leaders announced a full military mobilisation and Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the nationalist Russian leader, encouraged the Serbs to ignore western threats of air strikes. The army high command in the Serb-held region of Bosnia declared it was mobilising all the republic's available resources 'that would lead to a successful end of the war'. All able-bodied citizens would be drafted, and the economy placed on a war footing, the army command said. The call-up orders, which also include a summons for women to work in factories or do military service, appeared aimed at compensating for a shortfall in troops caused by desertions and the refusal of many refugees to report for military service. Coming amid evidence that the Croat forces in the area have recently been bolstered by up to 12,000 new troops from Croatia, and signs that the peace talks are effectively stalled, the declaration has prompted concern that both the Croats and Serbs are preparing for a final military carve-up of Bosnia. Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, yesterday warned that the developments pointed to impending all-out war in Bosnia, and made fresh appeals for protective Nato air strikes. Meanwhile, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said in New York last night that the continued presence of British troops in Bosnia would depend on how peace talks developed, military operations in general and humanitarian needs. He was speaking after two hours of talks with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali the UN secretary general. Mr Hurd, who was due to meet Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Washington today declined to join France in criticising US policy. Debate over Britain's long-term role in the conflict was fuelled on Friday by the murder of a British aid worker. The UK defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, is to fly to Bosnia next weekend to see the 2,300 British troops there. In a development that threatened to add a new level of tension into Nato's recent threat to use air strikes, Mr Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist Russian leader, warned that Russia would avenge any air strikes carried out against the Serbs. 'If a single bomb falls on the towns of Bosnia . . . .I warn (the western governments) that this means declaring war on Russia,' Mr Zhirinovsky said. He was speaking to a crowd of 2,000 in the Serb stronghold of Bijeljina, in the north-eastern corner of Bosnia, which he visited as part of a tour of Serb areas he regards as natural Slav allies for Russia since they share close cultural and religious ties. As if on cue, a Serbian military aircraft, in defiance of the UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, swooped over the town square and punctuated a string of speeches filled with vows to resist western pressure. Nato sources in Brussels yesterday played down Mr Zhirinovsky's melodramatic comments, pointing out that Serb leaders had been issuing similar threats during the course of last year. Although air strikes were unlikely to occur in the coming days - not least because the UN is first committed to attempting a peaceful reconnaissance mission to Tuzla - the alliance remained prepared to use defensive air power, an alliance source said.</p>

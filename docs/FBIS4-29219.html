			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The latest Japan-U.S.  semiconductor trade talks did not take up the issue of whether  or not to terminate a bilateral microchip pact after the July  1996 expiration, a senior Japanese Trade Ministry official said  Thursday [16 June].    "During the just-ended trade session, both parties agreed to  take time toward July 31 this year in studying the issue,"  Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry minister,  told a press conference.    Japan and the United States must decide whether or not to  end  the 1991 chip accord by the end of July.    The accord calls for Japan to maintain a "gradual and  steady"  increase in the foreign share of the Japanese microchip market  above 20 percent.    The two-day microchip trade talks followed an announcement  that foreign-made semiconductors continued to seize more than 20  percent of the Japanese market in the January-March period.</p>

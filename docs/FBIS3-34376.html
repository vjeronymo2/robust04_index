The Iraqis under leader President Saddam Husayn crowned this  war with a great victory and emerged from it stronger and more  capable, he added.    During a meeting today with a delegation from the Jordanian  Arab Democratic Party, led by Samir Habashinah, the party's  deputy secretary general and member of the Jordanian House of  Representatives, Ramadan said that the Iraqis will foil the war  of blockade and will emerge stronger. He pointed to what the  Iraqis have achieved in terms of marvelous and great victories  in their counterattack, represented by reconstructing what the  aggressors demolished and by foiling the aggressors' schemes  designed to deprive Iraq of both its livelihood and its elements  of strength, progress, and reconstruction.    Habashinah saluted the heroic stand of President Saddam  Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He also lauded their  confrontation of the largest aggression against the Arab nation.    Habashinah stressed that the Iraqis' firmness and adherence  to their principles and sovereignty are additional strength for  all the Arabs, who are struggling for their nation and its  sovereignty and progress.    The meeting was attended by the head of the Foreign  Relations  Office of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi,  secretary general of the Arab Popular Forces Conference.</p>

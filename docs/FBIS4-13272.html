			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu at the opening </F> of the Knesset summer session in Jerusalem -- live]    [Text] Mr. Chairman, Honorable Knesset, I would like to  begin by wishing a full and speedy recovery to those wounded in  yet another terrorist attack which took place today in  Jerusalem. One attack follows another and terrorism has become  a daily occurrence. Seeing as we are now opening the Knesset  summer session, I would like to remind you, Mr. Prime Minister,  of what you said at the beginning of the last winter session.  Seven months ago, eight days after signing the Oslo agreement  with 'Arafat, you stood upon the podium and declared that a new  era had begun. I am quoting the very words you used to describe  it: a new era. I continue to quote: Today, we are heading  toward greater opportunities and better times, toward days which  will be free of worry and nights which will be free of anxiety.  When the peace which we so yearn for arrives, our lives will  change completely and we will no longer have to live by the  sword. What has happened since then? What has happened is that  there has never been such a deterioration of personal security  in every city, town, village, and settlement in this country.  You, Mr. Prime Minister. You, and not me, mentioned statistics  before. I heard your statistics. You said that 161 Israeli  civilians were murdered during the six and a half years of the  intifadah. Sorry, I was mistaken, the correct number is 151.  Since the signing of the Oslo agreement, a period of a little  more than six months, almost 40 Israeli civilians were murdered.  According to my calculation, Mr. Prime Minister, this means  that since the signing of the Oslo agreement -- which you signed  in order to bring about an end to terrorism -- the rate of  murders and the rate of terrorism has increased fourfold. So do  not talk to us about days without anxiety. What you have  brought us with your government's stupid policy is days filled  with worry and nights consumed by anxiety. The good days you  promised us have turned into days of bloodshed and terror under  the shadow of terrorist attacks. Mr. Prime Minister, the  government has failed in the most important task of every  Israeli government, which is to protect the life of each  civilian; and this failure is a direct result of your policy.  You said that you did not change the rules of engagement for  IDF soldiers. Okay, I will not argue with you on that point  although that too is debatable. However, you did the following  things with regard to the other party. You, not me, released  thousands of terrorists into the streets. You returned hundreds  of deportees. We told you not to permit them to return. They  participated in accelerated courses in assembling car bombs in  Lebanon, yet you permitted them to return. You pardoned hundreds  of fugitives and let all the leaders of the intifadah return.  So what happens when you flood the streets with terrorists? Is  there really reason to be surprised by the tremendous upsurge in  terrorism, as indicated by the data you yourself provided? More  terrorists lead to more terrorism. Did you learn anything from  this? No, because you are going to continue. We have just been  told that you are about to release not 4,000, but another 6,000  prisoners. You talk about a historic process. Mr. Prime  Minister, you are about to enter history as the prime minister  who established a 9,000 member Palestinian terrorist army whom  you are about to arm with helicopters, armored vehicles, and  machine guns. You call this a security policy? It is a policy  that undermines security, it is a policy of insanity, of  disconnection from reality. I call on you to stop this policy  and bring it to a halt before there is more bloodshed.    However, since we are at the opening of a Knesset session  and I have reminded you of statements you made in the past, let  me recall other remarks you made at the same session on 21  September 1993, eight days after the signing of the agreement in  Washington. You said that you have firmly anchored this  agreement on three basic tenets. Let me quote the very words  you used from this podium to describe these three principles.  One, the PLO has committed to condemn and stop all acts of  terrorism and violence in Israel, the territories, and  everywhere else. Two, the PLO has promised to enforce the  cessation of terrorism and violence on all of its members and  prosecute anyone who breaks these commitments. Three, the PLO  has promised to annul all clauses in the Palestinian Covenant  denying Israel's right to exist and to bring about the official  abrogation of these clauses. Mr. Prime Minister, what is left  from all these commitments? You can make as many dismissive  gestures as you want. Let us see what happened. You said that  the PLO would stop terrorism. Okay, so we checked the minutes  again and noted down that on the same occasion on this podium,  eight days after the signing of the agreement, you said -- and I  quote: I would like to report that since the signing of the  Oslo agreement, the PLO has not carried out any attacks. Well,  Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to tell you that nearly eight  months have now passed since the signing of the Oslo agreement  and they have definitely perpetrated attacks. Let us see what  the PLO has done. First of all, the PLO -- and right now I am  not talking about people directly under 'Arafat's command, I am  talking about those who are not under his direct command --  these factions carried out nine terrorist attacks. They killed  five Israelis and wounded eight other people. Okay, they are not  directly under 'Arafat's command. So let us see what the Fatah  did. This is much worse, Mr. Prime Minister. When one makes  use of statistics it is advisable to examine the figures first.  For example, the Fatah, 'Arafat's own organization, carried out  37 attacks in which six people were killed and 14 others were  wounded. I would like to read out the names of Yuval Golan,  David Dedi, Hayim Weizman, Yitzhaq Rutenberg, Maurice Eisenstadt  -- who murdered them Mr. Prime Minister? Was it the Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement]? No, it was Fatah.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the prime minister who  murdered them? Was it the enemies of peace? No, it was the  supporters of peace, the Fatah people, the good guys. You  understand: There are bad guys, who are the Hamas, and good  guys who are the PLO. There are also even better guys among the  good guys -- that is Fatah, the cream of the crop.    Mr. Prime Minister, the first promise you made to the people  of Israel that the PLO would halt terrorism was not kept. Now,  with regard to the second promise that 'Arafat would take steps  to punish any of his people who continued to carry out attacks,  thus violating the new policy of putting a stop to terrorism --  that was not kept either. No action whatsoever was taken  against any of these murderers. 'Arafat did not say anything.  He did not bring them before a court, he did not expel them  from the organization, he has not even condemned the attacks.  One can occasionally drag out a condemnation from him much like  a dentist extracting a tooth from a reluctant patient. That is  really interesting. Obviously, the second condition that the  PLO would take steps against terrorists was not kept. Now for  your third promise: that 'Arafat would annul the Palestinian  Covenant calling for Israel's destruction. He has not canceled  the covenant nor does he intend to abrogate it in future. Mr.  Prime Minister, I heard a senior defense establishment official,  whom you sent to one of the Knesset committees, say that Israel  had solid intelligence data that they had no intention of ever  conceding anything. What are you proposing? Let us examine  that. Every single one of your assumptions, without exception,  has crumbled in the face of reality.    I understand that this bothers you, Mr. Peres. You wrote a  book about the new Middle East but what can you do if the old  Middle East comes back to slap you in the face? I know that  reality is hard to face. Because when you examine your  assumptions -- the PLO did not keep its promise to stop  terrorism; the Palestinian Covenant was not canceled; and no  punitive steps were ever taken against PLO terrorists -- they  all crumble in the face of reality. All I am asking for is that  the prime minister, who, as we have already seen, can take the  stage at any given moment, come up to the podium and simply  admit that he was wrong. Let him say: I was wrong and made  certain assumptions that did not come to pass. It can happen.  People can make mistakes.    Mr. Prime Minister, I heard that you held a telephone  conversation with 'Arafat two or three days ago. Let me ask you  exactly what you have to talk to that man about? Do you demand  that he revoke the Palestinian Covenant and stop Fatah  terrorism? Do you demand that he enforce these steps? Do you  ask for this? It is very hard to hear the truth but the people  already know the truth and no amount of shouting can hide or  obfuscate it. Mr. Prime Minister, I was also told that during  yesterday's cabinet session, you flexed a little, puny muscle  vis a vis the PLO. You said something, you gently chided them  that people were saying that the Fatah in Gaza is not behaving  nicely, that it has some sort of cooperation going. Look, I do  not want to offend the prime minister or the members of the  cabinet but I do not think that 'Arafat is overly concerned and  I will tell you why. It is because he sees and knows that every  one of the basic assumptions that you counted on, every one of  the promises he gave you are not being kept and you are not  demanding that he keep them. For him, the entire business is  pure bunk. To him, you personally as well as the entire Israeli  Government is nothing but a paper tiger. It has no value. It  is incapable of demanding or insisting on anything. It can only  make threats which are meaningless. You do not know how to  negotiate. Several days ago, I asked a group of Israeli  businessmen, who are not affiliated with the Likud -- actually  they are even closer to the Labor party -- whether they would  entrust negotiations over their private businesses and assets to  such a government. None of them said yes. Now, Mr. Prime  Minister, you have discovered something new. Mr. Prime  Minister, today I heard of your new discovery. You have  discovered that the PLO is cooperating with Hamas; or rather you  said that if it cooperates with Hamas then we will have to  consider taking steps. Have you suddenly discovered this today?  Did you not know this already? You have a delegation where  Fatah representatives are constantly and incessantly issuing one  ultimatum. They are demanding that we release the Hamas  murderers. A Hamas official appears at the ceremony marking the  30th anniversary of the Fatah's establishment. Now they meet  and say that when the Palestinian police, or rather army, is  established it will not act to prevent attacks against Israeli  citizens. This is Hamas and Fatah. I hear what they say and  then I hear your reaction. Who do you threaten? King Husayn.  Okay, so you threatened Husayn. But I ask you Mr. Prime  Minister, why do you not demand the same demands of yourself  that you demand from Husayn. Where is this cooperation between  these two terrorist organizations, Hamas and Fatah, taking  place? In Amman, Syria, Baghdad, or Tunisia? No, it is taking  place here in the territories under your control and  responsibility. It is taking place here in the Gaza Strip, in  Judaea and Samaria, and you are doing nothing. You are not even  condemning it or demanding anything. What you do is threaten  King Husayn. This is a government which makes threats that  nobody takes seriously. Everything is collapsing and  disintegrating. What do you do? What does the prime minister  do after all his basic assumptions collapse? The third basic  assumption was that the PLO would defend us against Hamas. The  prime minister told us several minutes ago and I quote: We will  not stop the peace train. What peace are you talking about? Do  you really believe this? This is self-delusion, it is not  peace. The government is deluding itself and deluding the  public. It is a process which will lead to an increase in  terrorism. It is a process of retreat. It is a process of  retreat which will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian  state along the 1967 borders.    Mr. Prime Minister, you may have a technical majority in  the Knesset, however, you tour the country occasionally and you  already know that you do not enjoy the support of a majority of  the Israeli public. You do not have a majority and that is  putting it diplomatically [Netanyahu interrupted by prolonged  heckling].    Mr. Chairman, you have to understand that this government  believes that its job is to prevent the opposition from voicing  its opinions. If the government can use its influence in the  media then great, but if not it can always scream to high  heaven. But I can hear what Hamas and Fatah said through all  the government's yelling. They said that not only will they  cooperate in murdering Jews -- they are not the murderers of  peace, they are the murderers of Jews -- but they also said  something else which is more important. They reiterated what  was once declared by Rafiq al-Natshah, a leading PLO official,  who said that they shared a joint long-term goal: the  liberation of all of Palestine. Therefore, from the point of  view of both Hamas and the PLO, the goal of this process, which  you insist on calling a peace process, is to establish a  Palestinian state which serves as an instrument for our  destruction. The distinction made by the government between  those Israelis who oppose and Israelis who support peace is not  only absurd but also patently false. There are no opponents of  peace among the Israeli people but there are many people who  oppose a false peace which is only designed to bring about the  establishment of a Palestinian state, to hand over the Golan  Heights to the Syrian tyrant, and following these concessions to  lead to a war which will be far worse than any we have  experienced until today. If one were to ask what is the most  fundamental and deepest difference between our approaches it is  this: The main difference between the left-wing Labor  government and the Likud is that the left-wing believes that  peace will be achieved by dwarfing Israel's stature and by its  capitulation to the dictates of tyrannical regimes and  terrorists; whereas we believe that peace can only be achieved  by Israel growing stronger within its present defensive borders.  We believe that this strengthening must be effected by  expanding settlement activity, increasing aliyah, and  bolstering, not weakening, the IDF's ability to meet the  challenges we may yet be forced to face.</p>

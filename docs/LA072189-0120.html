			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An Egyptian court sentenced a U.S. citizen in absentia to five years in prison  at hard labor for allegedly recruiting Egyptians to spy on Muslim militants on  behalf of U.S. intelligence. The indictment named the American as Nicholas  Edward Reynolds and said he was an officer in the CIA. The court also sentenced  Sami Youssef Ibrahim and his brother, Samir, who is still at large, to 10 years  each for passing on information detrimental to Egypt's national interests.  Defense attorney Maurice Sadq said the case was invented by Egypt's  intelligence services in order to exchange Sami for an American-Egyptian  engineer facing security charges in the United States.  </P></p>

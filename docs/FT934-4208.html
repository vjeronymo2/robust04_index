			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: An early Christmas - The Budget and You On Tuesday, the chancellor announced a string of measures that will help smaller businesses. Richard Gourlay assesses the changes It was greeted as the 'best budget for small businesses in years' and 'strong recognition of the problems that small businessmen and women face.' When Kenneth Clarke sat down after the first unified budget, there was little doubt that the small business community had enjoyed an early Christmas feast. Accountants, chambers of commerce and a host of lobby groups said almost all their pleadings had been accommodated. True, the chancellor did little with capital allowances to stimulate investment in a direct fashion. And there was no joy for those calling for a subsidised loan scheme for small companies. But there was much for small businesses to applaud, from measures to raise fresh equity for unquoted companies, moves to curb the late payment of debts and an assault on the paper work that can bury an entrepreneur. After many years of lobbying, legislation to bring in a statutory right to interest on overdue debts is on the horizon. Or is it? The chancellor could hardly have sounded more supportive of legislation. But almost before he had sat down the Department of Trade and Industry stressed that legislation was only one option. Weaker proposals, including the voluntary approach which many business groups say has completely failed would be considered during a four-month consultation period. The Forum for Private Businesses says that at any one time small businesses are owed more than than Pounds 50bn in overdue debts. This depresses cash flow for many companies struggling to raise funds from reluctant banks. The constant chasing of debts is also a drain on management time. But there are problems with legislation. The most fundamental is that it would not alter the balance of power between small suppliers and large customers. It would take a very gutsy supplier to pursue claims through the courts. Forcing companies to reveal the how much they were delaying payments might provide some form of moral suasion. Allowing suppliers to accrue interest and charge it, say when they ceased supplying a company, might add to the smaller business's armoury. Ultimately smaller businesses might be best served by the publicity that late payment receives. 'Legislation would provide something of a culture change in payment practices,' said Richard Brown of the British Chambers of Commerce. Small businesses will immediately benefit from modifications to the uniform business rate. Many properties in England and Wales are still covered by transitional relief to the higher rates that emerged from introduction of the UBR in 1990. The chancellor has halved the maximum increase in that increase. Owners of large properties will next year pay a maximum 10 per cent increase in their rates bill, where previously they were facing a 20 per cent increase; the rise for smaller businesses will be 7.5 per cent. The relief is only temporary. Small businesses in the north of England will be aware that they will bear a greater proportion of the total business rates burden after the next property revaluation in April 1995 because of the relative fall in property values in the south. The chancellor also gave an early Christmas to about 30,000 smaller companies. He has lifted the profits threshold below which the smaller company corporation tax rate of 25 per cent applies from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000. He has also widened the band for paying a marginal rate of 35 per cent to companies with profits between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 1.5m. Above this the full rate remains at 33 per cent. The chancellor also cut employers' national insurance contributions by one percentage point for staff earning less than Pounds 200 a week. The main rate fell 0.2 percentage points. One of the more notorious loophooles, however, has been closed. Companies will no longer be able to pay bonuses in kind and avoid NI contributions and PAYE. On sickness pay, smaller companies were also picked out for favourable treatment. The chancellor raised the level for full reimbursement of statutory sickness pay to cover companies paying Pounds 20,000 in national insurance bills. Previously the cut-off was Pounds 16,000. Companies will also be repaid within four weeks instead of the current six weeks. About 500,000 companies will be freed from the annual grind of preparing for a full audit. Companies with sales below Pounds 90,000 will no longer be required to produce any external verification of their accounts. The chancellor said that most companies with sales between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,00 will only need an independent accountants report. However, banks are likely to remain as anxious as ever to have independent verification of their clients' financial affairs before lending.</p>

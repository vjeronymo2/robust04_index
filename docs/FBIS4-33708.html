			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Beatriz Abreu] </F>   [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Finance Minister Rubens  Ricupero has asked his economic team to draft alternative  measures to prevent a sharp increase in interest rates during  the first months of the economic program. Ricupero is very  aware of President Itamar Franco's concern about this issue.  Franco has questioned high interest rates and wants to stave  off a possible conflict with Planalto Palace over the  establishment of interest rates in real terms (above the  inflation rate). The launching of the real is only some 20 days  away and the finance minister and his team are still trying to  explain to President Franco that the success of the Real Plan  will be in jeopardy unless the government implements a tight  monetary policy (restraint on money supply). A member of the  economic team conceded that "the question of interest rates has  long been on the mind of the president and the finance minister."    According to government advisers, the president has on  several occasions voiced concern about this issue to Minister  Ricupero. A member of the economic team noted: "It did not  reach the point where the president requested the team's  resignation." Experts believe Franco's concern is normal and  insist that "Ricupero does not champion high interest rates  either." They recall, however, that this is a delicate  question, since it led to the resignation of former Central Bank  President Paulo Cesar Ximenes, a staunch advocate of high  interest rates.    The members of the economic team believe, from a technical  standpoint, it is not advisable to implement low interest rates  during the first months of the Real Plan. They are seeking  alternatives also to counter a possible signal that the  government is betting on an economic downturn in the country  until the end of the year. Ricupero has been pressured from all  sides to desist from implementing a sharp increase in interest  rates as of 1 July. During his weekly meeting with businessmen,  they asked the government not to establish high interest rates  because it would only contribute to a renewed recession.  Ricupero's response has been the same for weeks: "The plan will  not foster a recession."    Ricupero has discussed with Franco and entrepreneurs a  concern raised by economists. According to the minister, high  interest rates are necessary to prevent speculation on the  financial market rather than to check consumption. "Those in  favor of high interest rates are afraid of a movement of  financial assets," he stated. His aides believe $6 billion,  which has been invested in the financial market, may easily be  funneled into other investments such as gold, the dollar, and  real estate, thus jeopardizing the success of the economic plan.</p>

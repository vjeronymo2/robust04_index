			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Rock Scarcely had one of rock's living legends shambled out of town for the next stop on his endless tour than another of the great and the good started his annual residency at the Albert Hall; this is the seventh successive year that Eric Clapton has held court there before his ageing admirers. As usual the show is effortlessly professional and wonderfully executed; Clapton takes no chances. He has surrounded himself with an outstanding band  -a five-piece outfit, with three brass drafted in for the last lap - which includes Andy Fairweather Low, ex-Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward, and Joe Cocker's pianist Chris Stainton. This year there is only one programme for all 14 concerts; 'rhythm and blues' is what the tickets promise, and that is precisely what the punters get, with rather more of the latter than the former. If at least 50 per cent of the audience was waiting him to launch into 'Layla' or 'Wonderful Tonight' what they got instead was a spin through the history of the blues from the 1920s to the present day. It begins with Clapton alone playing acoustic guitar against Stainton's piano and ends two hours later with his peerless electric sound cutting through the full band like a surgeon's knife. Nevertheless it took a while for the temperature to begin to rise. The first dozen songs, as Clapton moved through Robert Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters and Jimmy Rogers seemed respectful rather than engaged, and it was only Fairweather Low, seizing his one solo opportunity on Elmore James's 'Coming Home', who really took hold of the material and squeezed hard. Clapton then took the hint; a Howling Wolf group full of heavy dark guitar work, began the revival and numbers by Bobby Bland and Freddie King finally received the full treatment. The audience seemed to go home happy enough, though the irony of this immaculately turned-out white musician in his designer suit singing Bessie Smith and Robert Johnson should have hit a raw note somewhere in the hall.</p>

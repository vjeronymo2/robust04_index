			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Lose Your Turn: Parker Bros., the famous game maker, gushed over its new board  game, called "Careers for Girls." But then along came Susan Engeleiter.  </P> <P> The administrator of the Small Business Administration said in Washington,  D.C., the game has only six "careers": super mom, schoolteacher, rock star,  fashion designer, college graduate and vet, and she said it does not include  such careers as business executive, government leader, astronaut or scientist.  "If the Parker 'Brothers' were the Parker 'Sisters,' this game would never have  passed 'Go,' " she said.  </P> <P> Dogged: Ronald Reagan's autobiography, "An American Life," is a best-seller,  but sales are lagging behind those of "Millie's Book," the dog's-eye-view of  the Bush White House. "Millie's Book," ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, was No. 3  on this week's New York Times nonfiction best-seller list, five notches ahead  of Reagan's read. "It's a bit of an unfair comparison," growled Jack McKeown,  spokesman for Reagan's publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster. "They are appealing to  quite difference audiences."  </P> <P> Remember This: Convicted tax cheat Leona Helmsley's latest move might help her  shed her "queen of mean" image. Helmsley donated $300,000 to sponsor the  Helmsley Alzheimer's Alert Program to track down Alzheimer's victims who get  lost. "If more people . . . talked openly about Alzheimer's, the day for a cure  might arrive sooner," she said. Her husband, Harry, 81, was charged in the tax  case but could not help in his defense because he suffered from some memory  loss.  </P> <P> Love For Sale: Mary Lou Retton, the former Olympic gymnastics star, recently  appeared at three discount department stores in Dallas to promote "the official  Mary Lou Retton engagement ring." It is a replica of the diamond solitaire  Retton received from her fiance, former University of Texas quarterback Shannon  Kelly. The couple will wed next spring.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Labour Minister Li Borong has ruled out the  possibility of the setting up of Solidarity-type free trade  unions in the country. This is in spite of the imminent  completion of the drafting of the long-awaited Labour Law which  is aimed at giving greater protection to workers' rights.    Speaking yesterday at a National People's Congress meeting,  Mr Li said they hoped the Labour Law would be ready by the  middle of the year.    "This will have a major impact on (the development of labour  matters in) China."    More than 30 drafts of the legislation have been compiled by  the ministry and other relevant authorities.    Mr Li said they had also sought the views of some foreign  investors over certain provisions in the draft law.    China has stepped up the drafting of laws on the protection  of workers' rights in the wake of more complaints from workers  against their employers last year.    The Beijing leadership was made aware of the urgent need to  increase legal protection for the well-being of workers  following a spate of serious industrial accidents, including a  factory fire in Shenzhen last year. Under a new regulation  promulgated this year, joint ventures will also have to limit  the weekly labour time of workers to less than 44 hours.    Mr Li said some joint venture enterprises had used the  excuse  of heavy work orders to postpone the implementation of the new  work-hour requirement. Although the new rules came into effect  on March 1, he said there would be a grace period of two months.    "But if there are still cases of violations after that we  will handle the matter in accordance with the law."    The minister, however, played down the seriousness of the  growing unrest among workers during the past year, which was  largely sparked off by the deferred payment of workers' wages.    "Some of them might have difficulty in paying the salaries  of  workers. The Government has already taken measures to solve the  problem. I don't think there will be strikes. If workers have  something to say they can have dialogue (with the leadership) to  seek a solution," Mr Li said. "But I don't think it will be  possible to have independent trade unions, such as the  Solidarity, in China."</p>

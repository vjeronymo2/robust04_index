			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Instability may put debt plans at risk BANKERS said yesterday that increased political instability could jeopardise Algerian aims to refinance Dollars 23.4bn (Pounds 12.6bn) of external debt, but its immediate financing plans are unlikely to be disrupted. Tomorrow it is due to draw down the second part of a Dollars 1.3bn trade finance package signed earlier this year. Bankers could see nothing in the terms of the loan to prevent the funds from being transfered as planned. The loan will fund the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. Sonatrach, the state-owned LNG company, has also secured trade financing agreements with the Export-Import Bank of Japan. Around Dollars 5bn of Algeria's external debt is owed to commercial banks. In February, the government signed a Dollars 1.5bn refinancing agreement with a group of 130 banks and is committed to servicing and refinancing all external debt rather than calling for a restructuring. In the secondary loans market yesterday, Algerian debt obligations were trading at 87 per cent of face value in the morning but fell to 80 per cent by the close in London. The death of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf sent ripples through the market in loans to North African countries seen as vulnerable to a resurgence in Islamic fundamentalism.</p>

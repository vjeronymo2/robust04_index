			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Profits at Goodman Fielder flat at ADollars 169m Goodman Fielder, the beleaguered Australian food company where dissident shareholders are pushing for boardroom changes, yesterday disclosed another 12 months of static profits. This was the fifth successive year it has shown minimal bottom-line progress. Profits before tax and abnormals in the 12 months to the end of June rose marginally, to ADollars 168.9m (USDollars 125.6m) from ADollars 164.1m, while sales were ADollars 3.86bn, down from ADollars 4.71bn. However, a ADollars 17.8m abnormal charge, against last time's ADollars 109.4m surplus, lowered operating profits after tax and abnormals down to ADollars 93.4m from ADollars 182m. Basic earnings per share before abnormal items fell to 9.2 cents from 10.4 cents. After abnormals, they dropped from 16.1 cents to 8.1 cents. The company insisted the results picture had been muddied by disposals and acquisitions. It said the increase in pre-tax profits based 'only on current businesses and adjusted for timing' would have been 22 per cent. It also blamed the stronger Australian dollar for depressing earnings from international operations in local currency terms. Goodman said profits had picked up in its domestic baking and milling operations, while consumer foods had shown a strong improvement. The poultry division, by contrast, made an 'unsatisfactory contribution', and the ingredients arm was hit by falling gelatine prices. Mr Barry Weir, chief executive, said a 'significant earnings improvement' was budgeted for 1994-95, and 'further significant gains' in the following year. These would come from cost-reductions, baking industry rationalisation, some volume gains and the start of a turnround in Goodman's Asian businesses.</p>

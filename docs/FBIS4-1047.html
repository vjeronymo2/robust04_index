			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In the Central African country of Rwanda, a  Belgian and a Spanish transport aircraft have evacuated another  29 Westerners from a mission station near the town of Butare.  The evacuees were 18 Spanish and French nuns and 11 observers  of the United Nations. They were airlifted to the Kenyan  capital, Nairobi. Two Spanish nuns are reported to have refused  evacuation.    According to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders  [Medecins Sans Frontieres], Butare is the scene of intense  bloodshed. Yesterday dozens of injured people were brought to  the hospital in the center of the town, where a doctor of the  aid organization is operating. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the repatriation of Belgian Blue Berets who took  part in the United Nations mission in Rwanda is continuing. All  soldiers should be back in Belgium by this evening. Currently  there are still about 300 Belgian Blue Berets in the Kenyan  capital, Nairobi. [passage omitted] Besides the remaining  Belgian Blue Berets in Nairobi, our country also has 800  paratroopers in the Kenyan capital. They will stay in Kenya in  view of the tense situation in Burundi. [passage omitted]</p>

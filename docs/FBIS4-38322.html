			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Catherine Triomphe] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 28 (AFP) -- Authorities imposed a  one-month state of alert Saturday [28 May] over the breakaway  Caucasus republic of Chechnya following an overnight failed  assassination attempt against President Dzhokar Dudayev.    Dudayev emerged unhurt from a car-bomb attack near the  capital Groznyy in which his interior minister and deputy as  well as their driver were killed, a presidential spokesman said.  Sunday was declared a day of mourning.    The cabinet of the Moslem republic, which has declared  independence, met in emergency session after the attack to agree  the curfew's imposition.    Spokesman Movladi Udugov said a remote-controlled  booby-trapped Zhiguli car exploded as the president's motorcade  was passing late Friday.    Dudayev's Interior Minister Magomet Eldiyev, his deputy  Saidali Bateyev and their driver were killed, Udugov said. They  were travelling in the first vehicle of the motorcade. Dudayev  was in the second car, which was jolted by the blast.    It was not clear who carried out the attack. However, a  spokesman for Dudayev, whilst not directly implicating Moscow,  stressed an examination of debris from the attack showed the  explosives used were "of the same kind as those used by the  Russian secret service in operations of sabotage and terrorism."    But General Dudayev, who proclaimed Chechnya's independence  in 1991, also faced internal opposition from several camps and  observers believe one of his rivals could have carried out the  bombing.    Tension between Groznyy and Moscow has run high since  November 1991 when the tiny republic declared independence.    Dudayev was returning to the Chechen capital from his native  village of Zakan-Yurt, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, when  the bomb went off.    Two days earlier, Dudayev had put his armed forces on alert,  warning of "an attempt by Moscow to expand the implementation of  a state of emergency" along Chechnya's border with Ingushetia  "in the regions of Sunzha and Malgobek."    Chechnya, where even basic products are in short supply, is  a  mafia hotbed.    Three months ago, key opposition member General Ibragim  Suleimenov called for Dudayev's resignation and for "air strikes  on the republic's installations." He was arrested and jailed  two days later.    Dudayev refused to sign the Russian Federation Treaty and  the  republic boycotted Russian polls last December. Moscow  responded with an economic blockade.    Dudayev also imposed a previous curfew after about 1,000  armed opponents gathered in Groznyy's main square. Amid the  continuing standoff with Moscow, Dudayev had periodically put  the Chechen security forces on alert, a move he repeated on  Thursday.    Despite the resumption of bilateral talks in March,  Chechenya  and Russia remain at odds, with Gronzy several times accusing  Moscow's secret services of provocation. In March 1993, Chechen  authorities said Russia masterminded the killing of two of  Dudayev's advisors in London. One Armenian was eventually  convicted of the killings.</p>

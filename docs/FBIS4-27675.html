			<p>BFN     [Text] The Seoul District Prosecutor's Office yesterday  embarked on an intensive crackdown on publishing and printing  companies suspected of illegally copying and using computer  programs developed by foreign firms.    An investigation team led by Prosecutor Yun Hyong-yun, who  is  in charge of the protection of intellectual property rights,  obtained seizure and search warrants on 11 local firms for  full-fledged probe of their illicit business yesterday.    They include Tong-A Publishing and Printing Co., Samsung  Publishing and Printing Co., Morning Glory Corp., Art Box Co.,  and Taekyo Ltd. and so on.    The investigators were examining computers of the companies  to determine if they have used the foreign-made softwares they  duplicated in violation of the law pertaining to the  intellectual property rights.    The probe followed complaints [by] a group of foreign  companies filed against the domestic firms, Prosecutor Yun said.    "The prosecution is determined to terminate the illegal use  of computer softwares," Yun said, adding, the further  investigation will be made upon request from the  software-producing companies.    Yun indicated that the prosecution's further investigations  may focus on major companies which the foreign companies claim  are allegedly using their software without consent.    Those who copy foreign computer software illegally will face  punishment of fines up to 30 million won (35,500 U.S. Dollars).</p>

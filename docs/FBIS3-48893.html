The helicopter crossed illegally the Mongolian frontier  bordering on the Russian Federation on June 28 and up to now is  on the Buyant-Uhaa Airport.    According to a competent officer of the investigating board  under the Central Police Department by August 20 the general  board on ensuring state security by its former name had  instituted proceedings in connection with the helicopter and  carried out proper investigations. It was found that pilots of  the helicopter had returned home after taking it to Mongolia.  The other day Deputy Director of the Russian "Godli" firm B. B.  Gomboyev came to Ulaanbaatar with the purpose of receiving money  for the helicopter having been sold to the Mongolian "Oyuny  Undraa" firm. In response to it we have demanded to send here  their pilots having violated the law of the country, he said.    According to him, the Mongolian "Oyuny Undraa" firm did not  purchase the helicopter for itself but played only the role of a  mediator in the selling of the helicopter.</p>

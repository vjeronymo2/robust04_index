			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday Japan cannot call the use of nuclear weapons a  violation of international law, adding that doing so would risk  the efficacy of nuclear deterrence. "Japan has relied on the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. If it calls it (the use of nuclear  arms) unlawful, nuclear deterrence would be rendered  ineffective," the premier said.    Hata made the remarks at a House of Councillors Budget  Committee session in connection with a statement Japan submitted  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on June 10. Japan  has dropped from the document a phrase saying the use of nuclear  arms does not violate international law. The country had been  criticized at home and abroad after reports that it would  present a document including such a phrase.    In spite of the deletion, the government has not changed its  opinion that the use of nuclear arms cannot be called a  violation of international law since nuclear deterrence exists.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same session that  the  importance of nuclear deterrence cannot yet be denied, pointing  out that China recently conducted a nuclear test.</p>

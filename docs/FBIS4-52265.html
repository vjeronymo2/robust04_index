			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  summoned Japanese Minister to Seoul Hiroshi Shigeta and  protested Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's description of  comfort women, who were forced to supply sex for Japanese  soldiers during World War II, as "licensed prostitutes," Foreign  Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said Saturday.    The ministry's Director-General of Asian Affairs, Yu  Pyong-u,  called in Minister Shigeta and expressed regret over Nagano's  remark, which runs contrary to the Tokyo government's official  position on comfort women stated last Aug. 8.    Nagano earlier enraged South Korea and other Asian countries  by claiming in an interview with the MAINICHI newspaper that  Japan was not an aggressor in the war and that the "rape of  Nanjing," in which Japanese soldiers massacred thousands of  Chinese civilians, was "a hoax."    In a separate interview with KYODO News Service, he said  comfort women were licensed prostitutes and their use by  Japanese soldiers therefore could not be considered an insult to  women or discrimination against Koreans.    Minister Shigeta said he would report Seoul's protest to  Tokyo.    Historians say some 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were  forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers in  front-line brothels between 1932 and 1945. Tokyo has formally  admitted government involvement in running the brothels.</p>

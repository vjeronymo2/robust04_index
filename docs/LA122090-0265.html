			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> IRS DELAYS NELSON PROPERTY SALE  </P> <P> Country singer Willie Nelson won't have to put his land on the auction block  this month, but the IRS hasn't forgotten about him.  </P> <P> A Dec. 27 auction at the Travis County Courthouse won't take place as  advertised, Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman Jamie Stewart said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The IRS last month seized Nelson's properties in several states to ensure  payment of $16.7 million in taxes it says the Grammy award-winning singer owes.  </P> <P> Nelson says his tax problems were caused by poor handling of his finances by a  previous business manager.  </P> <P> Officials are continuing to compile a list of Nelson's holdings, Stewart said.  Once that accounting is completed, probably around the first of the year, an  auction or auctions can be set for all his property.  </P> <P> Fund-raising efforts have been undertaken for Nelson and donations have been  received from several states, organizers say.  </P></p>

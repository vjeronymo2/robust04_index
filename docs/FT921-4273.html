			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish pork exports set record IN CONTRAST to the general downtrend in the European pig producing industry, Danish pig farmers and slaughter-houses were able to boast unprecedented pork exports last year. Danish exports for 1991 reached a record level of 1m tonnes, an increase of about 11 per cent on 1990. Sales were valued at DKr20bn (Pounds 1.8bn), including DKr831m in European Community subsidies. At the same time, the pig farmers showed an increase in production in 1991 of 4.3 per cent, or almost 700,000 pigs, compared with the previous year. Increases in demand were seen in all traditional export markets except the US. Because of the large drop in the German pig herd, which resulted in an increase in demand for imports from German slaughter-houses, Danish exports to Germany rose by 26 per cent on the previous year. A total of 168,000 tonnes were sold to Germany with a value of DKr3bn. According to the Danish Federation of Pig Producers and Slaughterhouses, the boom in exports to Germany is expected to continue through 1992. Sales to the UK, traditionally the largest export market for Danish pork, rose by a comparatively modest 1.6 per cent on 1990 to 245,000 tonnes. Exports to European Community countries as a whole rose by about 10 per cent to 651,000 tonnes with a value of DKr11bn. After a particularly bad year in 1990, farmers have managed to recover lost ground in Japan with an increase in sales of nearly 30 per cent for 1991. According to the federation this reflects a recovery to 1989 levels rather than real growth in exports. Sales for 1991 reached 150,000 tonnes with a value of about DKr4bn. The only negative development in the Danish success story was a fall in US sales of 9 per cent to 86,000 tonnes for 1991. The drop was blamed on tough competition, particularly in the ham market, the falling US dollar and rising costs at home.</p>

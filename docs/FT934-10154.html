			<p>931106 FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exemption can't be carried forward WHERE disposals exceed a certain figure, is it possible to carry forward the annual CGT exemption figure from one year to the other? If so, will you please quote me chapter and verse to assist me in writing to my tax office, which does not seem aware of this point. No, the annual exempt amount (now Pounds 5,800) cannot be carried forward. That is why some people use it up by bed-and-breakfast transactions towards the end of each tax year. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

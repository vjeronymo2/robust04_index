			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Letter: Switzerland as model for the EC Sir, At the summit in Edinburgh the statesmen of the European Community undermined the foundation of the EC by granting Denmark exceptions. Copenhagen was successful in securing the requested exclusions - that is, a clear distinction between Danish citizenship and union citizenship, no adhesion to the third round of monetary union, and keeping its distance from the EC defence policy. One member of the EC has been released from unconditionally signing the Maastricht treaty, a document that was considered to be the crowning of the EC. In Edinburgh, the fundamental rule - same rights, same duties - has been once more sacrificed. At the end of the summit the leaders stated triumphantly that the EC has shown its ability to act efficiently - an activity likely to bring the bureaucratic monster closer to failure. What's in store for the future? The UK has its own opt-outs, and will ask for similar or the same exceptions as Denmark. The other 10 EC members will thus feel duped and prejudiced. They will become aware that an unconditional Yes to the Maastricht treaty was the biggest mistake they ever made. There are already many symptoms of crisis of the Community - trade disagreements with other great powers (such as the Gatt conflict between the Community and US) and a proliferation of internal quarrels (there were more than 900 infringements of member states last year), to mention only two of the main calamities. To add to this, now comes a Maastricht treaty with numerous holes in it. The European Community will remain a fragile torso unless it is remodelled in a federalistic, democratic European commonwealth, governed (as Nobel prize-winner Maurice Allais recently suggested) by a constitution like the one of Switzerland.

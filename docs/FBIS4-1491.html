			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 28 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] would not accept the Western Cape election result  until a range of poll-related irregularities were addressed by  the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], the party said on  Thursday [28 April]. Alleging electoral sabotage by the African  National Congress and IEC in the region, PAC Western Cape  premier-elect Patricia de Lille said 90 per cent of local IEC  personnel were aligned to the ANC.    At a news conference in the PAC's Salt River offices, she  said PAC complaints to provincial IEC officer Mary Burton, the  IEC Investigations Department and the National Operations Crisis  Centre had not been handled decisively.    "The PAC wishes to put on record that voting in the  Mitchell's Plain district...has been rigged. We suspect this was  done in conspiracy with IEC officials," the PAC said in an  official complaint to Mr Piet Colyn at the IEC's National  Operation Centre on Tuesday.    Claimed irregularities between April 26 and 28 included:     -  IEC officials at Hanover Park telling people which party  to vote for;    -  ANC party agents inside voting stations telling people which  party to vote for;    -  ANC supporters intimidating voters inside the Khayelithsa  resource centre;    -  The Marconi Beam polling station at Milnerton being shifted  to  a police station;    -  Party posters inside demarcated areas at three Gugulethu  polling stations;    -  Ballot boxes at the Nomsa Mpongwana school, site B hall and  Chumisa school in Khayelitsha, and the Westridge civic centre in  Mitchell's Plain, being opened for transfer to postal bags;    -  Two ballot boxes and a plastic bag being removed in a private  vehicle from the Linge lower primary school;    -  Three PAC party agents being refused access to the Somerset  West town hall;    -  Shots fired at a PAC canvassing table by "known ANC members"  at  Unathi, Crossroads;    -  PAC branch secretary Andile Makhala being stabbed by five  "ANC  people" for wearing a PAC t-shirt; and    -  IEC officials voting twice at the Ebutsheni school,  Khayelitsha.</p>

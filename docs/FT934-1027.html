			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (13): Changes leave their mark - Profile: The Wallenberg empire Just as Sweden itself has undergone the pains of recession and structural change over the past three years, so it has been a tricky time for the Wallenberg family, owners of the country's dominant industrial empire. Earlier this year, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading bank and a traditional jewel in the Wallenberg crown, plunged so drastically into losses that it was forced to appeal to the government for aid and appeared to be close to being nationalised. Meanwhile, profits have been sagging badly at Investor, the flagship holding company for the Wallenbergs' battery of blue-chip industrial investments, in large part due to falling earnings at Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group which Investor took over as 100 per cent owner in 1991. All this has happened at a time when the Wallenberg family, headed by Mr Peter Wallenberg, has had to adjust to the consequences of a spate of deregulation that has opened up Sweden's previously well-protected stock market to foreign investment. Although weighted voting rights have in many cases ensured Wallenberg control has not been shaken, Wallenberg-affiliated companies such as Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, and Ericsson, the telecommunications company, have been key targets for a flood of foreign buying of Swedish stocks. This has driven up share prices dramatically this year - but it has also introduced much greater volatility than previously was the case. The changes have left their mark on the Wallenberg empire. For Mr Wallenberg there was also the personal alarm of a bungled kidnap attempt by Russian mafia men during the summer. But under his direction, with his son Jacob and nephew Marcus closely involved, the family has so far largely sustained the remarkable extent of its power and influence in Swedish corporate life, a role that dates back to the end of the last century. Indeed, as the year draws to a close, the outlook across the extensive Wallenberg portfolio - which accounts for about one third of the Stockholm stock market's total capitalisation - is turning up somewhat. The threat that hung over S-E Banken earlier in the year has all but dissipated. Although the Wallenbergs hold slightly less than 8 per cent of the bank, it was a central pillar in the building of the family's industrial holdings and remains a prestigious part of the empire. Peter Wallenberg is chairman and has his office at the bank's staid headquarters near Stockholm's waterfront. S-E Banken, rescued from crippling loan losses by falling interest rates, staged an impressive surge back to operating profits in the middle of the year and was able to withdraw its request for state support in August. The Wallenbergs had to stump up their share of a SKr5.8bn share offering to help recapitalise the bank, but the prospect of its break-up or effective take over by the state has receded. Results at Incentive, an industrial group junior to Investor but an important part of the Wallenberg sphere, are also improving. Despite the dampening effects of recession in Europe, the benefits of the sharp devaluation of the Swedish krona over the past 12 months are paying off, along with those of internal cost-cutting measures. Profits in the first nine months of SKr345m were up 55 per cent compared with the same period last year. The Wallenbergs are determined also to hold fast to their core holdings through Investor. Here the outlook is less certain, with analysts querying whether a spate of portfolio rationalisations over the past two years will have to continue if the Wallenbergs are to sustain sufficient financial strength within the group. Investor is the muscle of the empire, grouping holdings in most of Sweden's best-known big companies. Saab-Scania is the only one 100 per cent-owned, but through Investor the Wallenbergs exert controlling or powerful influence in a list that includes Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux, the world-leading white goods manufacturer, Stora, Europe's biggest forestry group, Atlas Copco, the engineering group, and SKF, the world's largest maker of roller bearings. Slumping markets for its trucks and civilian aircraft have hit Saab-Scania this year, knocking a hole in profits and the intention that Saab-Scania would be the cash-generating engine of a streamlined Investor. Investor's pre-tax profits were down almost 90 per cent in the first nine months of this year to SKr216m. With net debt around the SKr8bn mark, Investor has this year stepped up a disposal programme, selling out its 10 per cent holding in Asea, the Swedish half of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, and a 2 per cent chunk of Stora. The company says it would like to get its debt level down to about SKr6bn, raising the question of whether another round of asset sales is necessary - and if so, whether a core asset may have to go. But Mr Claes Dahlback, the chief executive, is at pains to deny persistent market rumours that he is ready to sell a part of Investor's holding in Astra, which has rocketed in value on the stock market this year to the point where Investor's 10 per cent of the capital is worth 40 per cent of the company's total portfolio. What's more, Mr Dahlback says he is happy with the structure of the group at present. 'We are pretty close to where we should be. I don't see any major changes of portfolio in the pipeline,' he said. He appears confident that Saab-Scania will soon return to being the income generator it was always intended to be - generating the cash to drive down debt levels. 'We will stick to our guns. We are glad we own Saab-Scania. Maybe the timing (of the full takeover) was a bit unfortunate. But Scania is the Rolls-Royce of heavy trucks and I think the future is bright.' If, indeed, the Wallenbergs do emerge from the difficulties of recent years with their empire substantially intact, it is clear that its survival will owe much to the maintainance of the weighted share system. A threat at one time of regulatory moves in the European Union, which Sweden aims to join, to establish a 'one share, one vote' system now appears distant, if not invisible. It seems the Wallenbergs can continue to enjoy a system which, for example, gives them 45 per cent of the voting rights at Electrolux with a puny 1.3 per cent of the capital, and 22 per cent of the voting rights at Ericsson with only 2 per cent of the capital. When Investor sold out of Asea last June, the Wallenbergs ensured that their control of the company was maintained by a shuffle of weighted shares which beefed up Incentive's Asea holding. Mr Dahlback makes no apologies for the weighted share system, although he acknowledges that Investor would not exist in its present form without it. 'I get upset when I hear criticism of the system. This is a system that works well. In our view, companies benefit from having strong, responsible ownership.'</p>

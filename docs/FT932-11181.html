			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD was fixed at a fresh nine-month high of Dollars 356.15 a troy ounce on the London bullion market in the afternoon. After a quiet morning, the market rebounded when US investment funds took advantage of a weaker US dollar to buy gold on Comex. However, profit taking emerged, and London closed at Dollars 354.70, down Dollars 1.05. At midday Comex prices were mixed. 'The markets are overbought. We took them as high as they could go before bumping into resistance,' said one New York analyst. COPPER trading was erratic on the LME, with the market falling to fresh session lows in the afternoon before recovering some of the losses. Dealers said losses in New York were instrumental in pushing three-month metal below Dollars 1,850 a tonne against a background of poor US economic leading indicators data. Comex copper futures touched lifetime lows mid-morning. London's robusta COFFEE futures finished with losses of up to Dollars 17 a tonne as prices in New York arabica futures tumbled on widespread profit taking. The New York trade was expecting a decrease in US certified stocks, which increased by about 15,000 bags. Compiled from Reuters</p>

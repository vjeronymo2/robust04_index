			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First part of two-part interview with Vicente Ululu, Renamo </F> secretary general; Alcido Ngwenha, member of the Frelimo  Political Commission; Maximo Dias, Monamo secretary general;  Inacio Chire, PCN foreign affairs coordinator, by correspondent  Moises Mabunda; place and date not given]    [Text] [Mabunda] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]  President Afonso Dhlakama proposed, for the first time at  national level, what he has been saying privately for a long  time. He proposed a Government of National Unity [GNU], as we  revealed in our edition last week. We would like to begin our  round table asking the secretary general to give us more  information on this proposal.    [Ululu] The proposal made by President Dhlakama is aimed at  obtaining national reconciliation. We want Mozambique to belong  to all Mozambicans. We want unity, reconciliation, and the  participation of all Mozambicans...    [Mabunda] Those are the objectives that you have in mind.  What I would like you to do is to explain what Renamo means by  a Government of National Unity?    [Ululu] I am getting there. The idea is to prevent one party  from doing everything alone. We want a Government of National  Unity where everyone will have a role to play.    [Mabunda] In our edition last week we presented three  possibilities for a GUN. One, where the majority party, Renamo  or Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front], would be represented;  two, a government involving all parties; and three, a government  involving people from all ethnic groups in the country. To  which of these three does Renamo subscribe?    [Ululu] Well, our view is that there should be a GNU that  brings together all Mozambicans, regardless of their religious  beliefs or political ideologies. By doing this, we shall be  eliminating the old thinking that this country only belongs to  one party and cannot be governed by any other force. With the  establishment of democracy in the country and for national  reconciliation, we feel we should have a government of national  unity. There are people who talk of federalism and so on.  This means that there is an imbalance; others say that this or  that group has no participation in the government. These  gossips cause tensions and can bring about conflicts.    [Mabunda] We still do not understand each other. Mr.  Secretary General, give me a direct answer: for you, a  government of national unity is one which brings together  members of all parties or members of different ethnic groups?    [Ululu] The proposal is the following: We shall have  elections and the party that wins must not think that it won  alone. It should not only appoint individuals from that party,  but should also appoint other competent individuals from other  parties.  <H5>  Monamo's Views </H5>   [Mabunda] What does Monamo [Mozambique Nationalist Movement]  understand by a government of national unity?    [Dias] Monamo has a track record on the GNU or national  reconciliation or the union of the Mozambican family. This  record can therefore serve as a basis to explain this view. As  early as 1986 Monamo, in its work entitled "Immediate Peace,"  and in the letters it wrote to the president of the republic  and the president of Renamo, called for the establishment of  multiparty democracy, immediate peace, the establishment of a  transitional government for a minimum period of three or five  years, but not longer, in order to prepare free and fair  multiparty elections. Answering your question, this government  would be made up mainly of Mozambique Liberation Front and  Renamo elements; mainly Frelimo and Renamo elements because we  were at war. This government would then be completed with the  participation of other individuals with national prestige.  Thus, a government which would have brought about peace between  Frelimo and Renamo would make use of individuals with national  prestige to establish a strong, nonauthoritarian government.  This proposal was made in 1986 and it was a condition for  immediate peace.    During the protracted peace talks in Rome, Monamo once again  insisted on the establishment of a transitional administration  to organize the elections. This would eliminate mistrust and  subsequent accusations of electoral fraud. The government and  Renamo did not show any interest. Renamo preferred the system  of two administrations: one belonging to the government and the  other to Renamo in areas it controls militarily. Monamo held  various contacts at political, economic, and social levels at  both national and provincial levels. At a conference held at  Rovuma Hotel in 1991, we came to the following conclusion:  There is no party, neither Renamo that we knew reasonably well  nor Frelimo, that we knew well and the entire people know well,  that would be able to govern well. That included Monamo and  other political parties. What would be the solution? After the  signing of the General Peace Accord, after the holding of  elections, it would not be possible for a single political force  to present a good government and carry out a good public  administration. Thus, we conveyed our views to various  religious denominations, particularly the Catholic Church --  because even last Sunday during a mass, Cardinal Don Alexandre  said "it is necessary that we choose a strong government, a  government that gives orders and knows how to give orders." It  will not be the elections that will bring about a strong  government. Our people are not in a condition to choose a party  that would offer better conditions. Our people are more  concerned with their daily famine, they are not even interested  in politics....  <H5>  Now We Hear Voices Calling For GNU's Establishment </H5>   [Mabunda] In brief, does Monamo favor establishing GNU?    [Dias] Absolutely, but let me finish...what kind of GNU,  that  is the question you posed. As far as we are concerned, the  country is almost ungovernable. The economy is out of state  control, corruption has become increasingly more generalized.  All this means that there is a need for establishing a GNU.  The country is experiencing very serious difficulties, the  number of individuals who are both competent and honest is very  low, because of corruption. To establish a strong but  nonauthoritarian government, there is a need to form a GNU that  would make use of the available and effective political,  economic, and social forces. Unfortunately, it is only now that  we begin to hear authorized national and international forces  advising establishing a GNU. It is better late than never.    [Mabunda] I think we are still finding it difficult to  define  GNU. What does it mean for Monamo?    [Dias] It means to obtain what is good and useful in  Frelimo;  what is good and useful in Renamo; and what is good and useful  in other parties, representatives of social forces. There are  people in trade unions, churches, students organizations, and  company sectors that can be well utilized. Thus, we can form a  government of consensus that would be free from destructive  criticism, a government that would be supported by all. Not  even Renamo would raise a finger. Let us suppose that Frelimo  wins the elections, as it is claiming, and Renamo, Monamo, PCN  [National Convention Party], other parties, and so on... we  shall only try to find fault. If we participate in the  government, however, we shall be equally blamed for its  failures. We shall combine all our efforts. When there is no  one who is strong, capable... you cannot tell me that Frelimo is  capable because it has already proved that it is unable to  govern. Likewise, you cannot tell me that Renamo is capable,  because it is not....    [Mabunda] If I understand you correctly, Monamo favors  establishing a GNU more than holding elections?    [Dias] No, no. The transitional period has already passed.  I do not think that the Renamo president wanted to postpone the  elections. The Renamo representative is here....  <H5>  To Realize People's Wishes </H5>   [Mabunda] Mr. Ululu, a GNU before or after elections?    [Ululu] What Dr. Maximo Dias is saying is very clear. We are  about to hold elections. Elections are most important for  people to have their choice. What we are saying, however, that  a GNU is a government of harmony, where every Mozambican will be  able to make his or her contribution to the country's  reconstruction. There are two things that we need to see:  There are party views, that is party ideologies, and party  programs. When it comes to establishing a government, it is  something else...those who take part in the government need not  necessarily be party members, the government has to be formed by  responsiblle and competent people to realize people's wishes.    [Mabunda] Does the National Convention Party [PCN] want to  speak before Frelimo?    [Chire] Let Frelimo speak....  <H5>  Elections Must be the Point of Departure </H5>   [Ngwenha] For Frelimo, it is natural that people should try  to find and study various ways of guaranteeing the success of  the Mozambican peace process, which is so difficult and complex.  Our first aim is to guarantee the consolidation of peace. We  think that the fundamental instrument of this process is the  General Peace Accord. Our main concern, therefore, is to  guarantee that this accord is implemented. This does not  necessarily mean that we are dogmatically refusing to hear views  that could be useful for our country's future. The elections,  the acceptance of democratic rules of the game, are in our view  extremely important. That is why we could put the question this  way: GNU before or after elections?    The establishmentof a GNU would first of all naturally  signify discouraging the peace process; it would signify  renegotiating the General Peace Accord and we think that this  would be the beginning of a lot of problems. We, therefore,  think that the point of departure should be elections, despite  all the difficulties, all the shortcomings that may ensue.  Elections should be the point of departure -- the government  that will be elected, the program that will be voted for. In  Frelimo we make efforts to overcome our difficulties. We have  always said that we examine our form of governing. We have  experience, we know our mistakes, and perhaps it is because of  this that we are at an advantageous position. Who makes  mistakes must have be able to do better by learning from those  mistakes, but the person who has not made a mistake, he still  needs to learn. If you read the Frelimo Party sixth congress  report, you will see what Frelimo says about the whole process.  Thus, we guarantee that the program that we shall present to  the electorate will be a program that will ensure peace,  stability, and the normalization of the Mozambican people's  life. This being the case, the issue of the formation of a  national or coalition government depends mainly on the results  of the elections. This issue cannot be viewed before the  elections. We need to know the position of each party.    We, the parties, cannot be the ones to decide on this issue.  This would be dictatorship. What is the difference between this  and dictatorship? We shall have to submit our legitimacy to the  electorate. We must hold elections so that we can know who is  who and the elected party will have the responsibility to  maintain a machinery that guarantees peace, stability, and the  government operations.    In conclusion, I would like to ask those who defend a GNU  the  following question: Where in the world has GNU been successful?  What is its justification? Dr. Maximo Dias said Frelimo cannot  govern... it is not a permanent position... I even look at  myself and say: What do I have to do with that? I think that  we cannot see things that way, in the negative way. If we want  to obtain positive justifications for establishing a GNU, it  would be more advisable to see what is positive in parties, that  can unite us....  <H5>  GNU After Elections </H5>   [Mabunda] Is the PCN in favor or against a GNU?    [Chire] It is obvious that the PCN favors a GNU. From the  understanding that we have of the country, we think it would be  extremely dangerous for the country if we failed to establish a  GNU. It should be clear that we support a GNU after the  elections. All the same, we think this issue can be discussed  now, despite the Frelimo representative's feelings that the most  important thing is to guarantee the implementation of the  General Peace Accord [AGP]. We cannot postpone the discussion of  important issues because we are apparently going against the  AGP. In any case, the accord is not being fully implemented.  It is being constantly violated by the parties. The first  timetable was not implemented and the second one is not being  fully implemented. We should therefore be more moderate and  reflective when we speak of the AGP's implementation.    The Frelimo representative said that in the coming  elections,  the people will vote for a program. I do not think it is true  that the people will vote for programs, because they have not  even been able to digest the meaning of a multiparty system.  Most of our people are not even aware that there is a  multiparty system in the country. They do not know the meaning  of a political party, party program, or voting. The people will  vote into power the party with most resources, the party that  will be able to reach the most areas, the party that will be  able to maintain control over a specific part of the population.    The Frelimo Government will try to maintain control over  areas that have always been under its control, and Renamo will  do the same. Let us not speak of programs. We are in a country  where most of our people are peasants and are not in a position  to know the meaning of party programs. That is why, we propose  a government.... We should convene a meeting on this issue.  This meeting should be attended by parties, churches, and  organizations. We would obtain different ideas and proposals and  come up with an agreement. We are now defining the meaning of  GNU. Is that necessary or not? The thing is that even if the  parties reach an agreement on the issue, the final decision lies  with the ruling party. If it decides that there should be no  debate on the issue, then there will be no debate. We are not  respecting the rules of the democratic game, which always try to  seek a constant consensus. No matter how right we may think we  are, we must always seek a consensus.    There are countries which have adopted the system of a  minimum percentage. Let us say, for example, that the minimum  percentage is set at 25 percent, the party that obtains over 25  percent should be able to have a vice president in the  government. A party that obtains over 15 percent should be able  to have a minister. These are just examples. Everything could  be defined accordingly....    [Mabunda] As is the case in South Africa....    [Chire] Exactly.    [Mabunda] It seems there is an agreement....    [Ngwenha] There is no agreement....    [Mabunda] For those who support a GNU there is an agreement  that this is only possible after elections....  <H5>  The Opposition Does Not Always Understand What We Are Saying </H5>   [Ngwenha] Yes, there is an issue that I would like to  stress.  It is sometimes difficult to work with the opposition. There is  a tendency not to understand what is being said and this will  not help matters. It is not true that I said we should postpone  the discussion of important problems facing the country. It  would be unbelievable for a ruling party like ours, with its  responsibilities, to say that we must postpone the discussion of  important matters.    I would like to point out in clear terms: We accept the  discussion of important problems facing the country. It must  not be said that Frelimo refuses to discuss important problems  facing our country. It is normal for one to speculate and say  that one does not believe in this or that, but we must have more  objective criteria. It is not just enough to form a party and  claim to speak in the name of the people. Simply doing that  does not mean that a party is truly legitimate and represents  the people. There is a need for more objective, more acceptable  criteria. I think that is the advantage of democracy, which is  mankind's major achievement.    It is only through elections that matters can be defined.  The elected government has the responsibility to guarantee  peace, stability, and a national balance -- which could include  reconciliation and a broader government concept, provided it  works. For this, it is necessary that the parties discuss their  programs, find how their views coincide and differ, try to bring  their positions closer.    [Chire] I would like to clarify to Dr. Ngwenha that I did  not  say that he said that we should postpone the discussion of the  issue. I said that in my view, while it is important to see  that the AGP is implemented, we should not postpone the  discussion of important issues.  <H5>  Why Only Now? </H5>   [Mabunda] There is an issue that was raised by the Frelimo  representative. Dr. Ngwenha said the important thing is to  implement the AGP. On the basis of this, I would like to ask a  different question: Why is Renamo only now coming up with the  establishment of a GNU, Mr. Vicente Ululu?    [Ululu] What is taking place in Mozambique now is the  process  of evolution. When we discussed the AGP in Rome, we did not  reach agreement on every issue. If we were to discuss  everything in detail, we would have spent years and years, and  bloodsuckers -- forgive my expression -- would have benefited  from the situation. When we raised certain questions about the  Constitution, people began to say we did not want peace. They  said the Constitution cannot be discussed, but it is fundamental  for the Mozambican people. Thus, it was not discussed, but  there are many things in the Constitution that can be  questioned, as Dr. Maximo Dias has pointed out. The parties  agreed that there were two administrations in the country. To  answer your question, the issue is being raised now because of  the process of evolution in the country...  <H5>  Answering the Evolution </H5>   [Mabunda] What developed exactly between the signing of the  AGP and now?    [Ululu] I think many things coincided. When the issue of  state administration came up, the president of the Republic and  President Dhlakama met and agreed on the way elections should be  conducted.    There were undoubtedly two zones controlled by the rival  parties. As part of the implementation of the accord, the  parties agreed that those zones should be integrated. This was  a development, because two administrations were recognized in  Rome. Today we speak of GNU because we think that Mozambicans  can live together.    [Mabunda] Let us assume the PCN won elections in Mozambique.  Would it not like to rule alone?    [Chire] Not during this phase. We believe that the  resolution of the problems facing the country entail the  participation of many more people than those who are in the PCN.    [Mabunda] In any case, the PCN would have a program in  different fields. Would it appoint a Renamo minister to  implement the PCN program? How would this function?    [Chire] Mozambique would not be the first country in the  world with ministers from different parties. I know the  difficulty that exists in understanding certain things, because  we lack democratic experience. We have to understand things in  a different way because in democracy, it is normal to find  elements from other parties in the government. The PCN has a  program, but it would invite in members from other parties. It  would negotiate its program with other parties, in the country's  interest. If we establish a GNU, I believe the government will  have greater trust from the international community.    [Mabunda] What does Monamo have to say about this?    [Dias] Normally, when people speak of a GNU, it is because  there is a very serious social, economic, and political crisis  in the country. It is because the country has become  ungovernable, in a multiparty system. This is the reason, I  believe, why the Renamo president (he now understands the  country's reality) thought a GNU was fundamental for the country.    To speak of a GNU in terms of power sharing is completely  wrong. It will not work. In the present chaotic conditions of  the country, a GNU can work. When there is a public  administration crisis, the government does not govern,  politicians do not assume their responsibilities, our police do  not work, nothing works. It is not the fault of the party in  power, but it is because of the total chaotic situation in the  country.    That is why those who support a GNU say that we have to  sacrifice our party ambitions in the supreme interest of the  nation. To participate in a GNU means to sacrifice one's  political program. It means to sacrifice one's strategy for  power. Thus, if we are selfish, we shall say let Frelimo or  Renamo govern alone. We know however that no one would be able  to govern alone and it will be our people who will suffer.    We have had enough of experiments, and that is why even  Renamo supports a GNU. I do not believe that those who support  a GNU do so in order to share power. Monamo supports a GNU, but  the aim is not to share power.    It was agreed here that when we speak of a GNU, we mean  after  elections. The PCN proposed here that all parties, regardless  of their party programs, should hold a meeting to come up with a  consensus on the establishment of a GNU.    To sum up, there are two reasons that lead us to support a  GNU: In a serious economic situation, in a serious social  situation... it is not enough for Renamo President to say that  he will not return to the bush. Savimbi also said that. It is  not enough for Joaquim Chissano to say there will not be another  war. Wars are not avoided just because people say there will be  no war. The war results from circumstances on the  ground....There could be a madman in Renamo, a madman in  Frelimo, a soldier who will say: We have not lost the elections,  let us fight -- and shots could begin and never stop again.  This can be avoided if there is a agreement before the  elections that whether Frelimo wins or Renamo wins, there will  be no problems. We shall have a government in which everyone  participates, because of the serious economic situation in the  country. This government can be established on the basis of  different criteria: percentages, as was pointed out here by the  PCN president [as published], but for me, percentages are not  very significant. The elections are not 100 percent  democratic, because our people are not fully politically aware  and do not know all the parties existing in the country. We  should not forget that 80 percent of our population is  illiterate and has no access to radio. Thus, when we argue for a  GNU, it is because the situation is serious....    [Mabunda] Would the representative of the Frelimo Party  care to comment?    [Ngwenha] My comment is as follows: I cannot stress enough  that it is fundamental that the principal points in the accord  be complied with. I believe that such compliance must arise  from the political will of the various sides. We are still  faced with the problems of demobilization, administration of  certain areas, and the implementation of all other measures  which can guarantee a small margin for errors during the  elections. Important though it may be, that matter of striving  for a government that is effective and that can settle the  serious problems facing our country is no justification for  entering into compromises before the time: that could be a  strategy for each party to follow. For instance, should it win  the upcoming elections, Monamo's strategy will be to form a  government of national unity. That is Monamo's strategy.  Should Renamo think along the same lines, that will be Renamo's  strategy, but it is our belief that there is the need to respect  the electorate's wishes. There are people who will vote for  Renamo so that Frelimo is removed from power. We cannot tell  our electorate: vote for whom you please, but be sure to know  that such and such people will be in power, irrespective of the  result. It is important that we accept the rules of democracy  from the beginning and that we stop humiliating our people,  saying they know about this but not about something else. Such  humiliation I can accept when it comes from outside, but when it  comes from Mozambican people...such exaggerations can reflect a  certain ignorance about our people's abilities. We are going to  do things, and the people will show what they want when  elections come up and prove whether they can or cannot vote. I  would also like to say the following: we have often heard  people say that Angola's events must not be repeated here. I do  not know what was repeated or what should not be repeated in  Angola. What is happening in that country is that the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, is not  abiding by the rules of the game. Now, in Mozammbique, who is  it that does not want to accept the outcome of elections? Is  there a political will to accept elections? This has to be the  starting point and the rest is compromise. The type of  government that we will have in the future must reflect the  people's wishes. Then, we can enter into compromises. Frelimo  will be entering into compromises with Monamo and the PCN  depending, of course, on the outcome of elections...    [Ululu] Pardon me, but there are some things...namely, who  is  going to participate in the government after elections have been  held. Dr. Ngwenha has said that the people may feel humiliated  if they see a Frelimo official participating in a government run  by some other party...now, here we are talking about seriousness  and complete respect for the government of this country. As Mr.  Maximo Dias has indicated, the country is staring bankruptcy in  the face, experiencing an economic crisis, there is social  instability, and the police are incompetent...I have been very  clear in saying that when we go to elections, it is not the  party but the person who wants harmony in the country who should  participate. It makes no sense that Mr. Ngwenha should feel  humiliated if Renamo wins the elections and appoints him as head  of some department. This is a matter of rescuing the country  from its misery....    [Mabunda] There is one problem here and I am going to touch  on it again because I feel that it needs to be clarified. Let  us suppose that Renamo wins the upcoming elections and that it  invites Dr. Ngwenha, of the Frelimo Party, to implement Renamo's  program in the area of education. What if Dr. Ngwenha fails to  agree with that program?    [Ululu] There are other Mozambican people, there are many  other Mozambicans....    [Ngwenha] I would like to ask: This man Ngwenha has had no  votes, is on the sidelines, but Renamo selects him. Ngwenha  competed but received no votes....    [Ululu] He can be selected....    [Ngwenha] But, by doing so, you would be violating some  rules....    [Ululu] In this particular context, such a thing would be no  violation in a democracy. Dr. Ngwenha has just said that there  is some difficulty in working with the opposition. That is why  it is called democracy: it is indeed very difficult to work  with the opposition because it will oppose those government  plans that it deems to be incorrect....    [Chire] Naturally, I understand Frelimo's position. It is  the ruling party, it makes an apparent change for transition and  for democracy, and it creates a situation in which it continues  to control everything and it believes it can win the upcoming  elections. I think it is understandable that the Frelimo Party  should think it will win the elections. Dr. Ngwenha has talked  about political will, but Frelimo neither has now nor has ever  had the political will to change. We have not seen Frelimo show  any willingness to change, or any tendency to change....    [Ngwenha] But what is the direction of change?    [Chire] I shall answer that right now. I think that Dr.  Ngwenha, as a politican, knows that there is a set of  prerequisites that have not been met in Mozambique....    [Ngwenha] In concrete terms, what prerequisites are those?    [Chire] Now, you are becoming a journalist....    [Ngwenha] No, I would just like to know!....    [Chire] Let me tell you...because like this you are breaking  down my reasoning. I get very confused and we will end up  without dialogue...I do not believe that conditions have been  created in this country for a transition to a democratic  society. This is what happened: a cease-fire accord was  signed, it was written in the Constitution that there is  democracy as of today, a number of laws were approved and they  will apparently be good for a democratic society, but those laws  have not been implemented. The government has done nothing to  prepare society for that transition but you, the Frelimo Party  representative, are here telling us that the people know whom  they are going to elect. The people do not know what is  happening and are poorly informed. Those people who have said  for many years that they were the only ones, and that they were  the best, continue to say so today. That is not democratic  behavior. Democratic behavior is to say that there are a number  of parties, that each party has its own program, that our  program is as follows, and to give others the opportunity to  present their plans. To this day, all one hears is about  Frelimo and Renamo...now, what programs will the people choose?  Conditions are not in place yet for a democracy....</p>

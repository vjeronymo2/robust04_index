			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Palestinians kill four in Gaza Strip TWO Israelis and two Arabs were shot dead by Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday, in the worst attack since the Israeli government sealed off the occupied territories almost two months ago. The four men were trading vegetables outside a greenhouse at the Jewish settlement of Gadid, in the south of the strip, when gunmen opened fire from a passing car. The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and the Fatah wing of the PLO - usually bitter rivals for Palestinian support in the territories - took responsibility for the killings in an unprecedented joint statement.</p>

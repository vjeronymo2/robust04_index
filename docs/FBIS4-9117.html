			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, today welcomed British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's statement that the peace  process in Bosnia would be renewed soon. In an official  statement -- TANJUG received a copy of the text -- Karadzic said  that "the Serbian side is ready for talks, but only on the basis  of equality."    "This means that the international community must make a  step  forward in connection with the sanctions, imposed on the entire  Serbian nation, before any talks could start," stressed  Karadzic. He specified that the international community must  ensure that this time the Muslims negotiate with good  intentions. The Muslim military offensives will no longer be  tolerated and the Serbs will respond to them with resolve. In  this context Karadzic reiterated that the Muslims caused the  latest clashes by launching an offensive from Gorazde a month  ago and that "they remembered Gorazde was a safe area only when  they suffered a setback in their offensive." The international  community should have inquired what a Muslim army division in  full combat gear was doing in a safe area, said Karadzic.    In order for an "agreement to be likely," as suggested by  Hurd, the international community ought to "stop playing the  Muslim game of war and peace" and it must oppose the Muslim  right to veto every peace plan which had already been agreed  with the European Union and the United Nations. "The  international community ought to make it quite clear to the  Muslims that their impossible ambition to control the entire  Bosnia, as a method of sabotaging peace, will not longer be  tolerated," said Karadzic. "Peace will come to Bosnia only when  the international community accepts the obvious truth that the  Serbs have the right to self-determination just like the other  ethnic communities," said Karadzic, concluding that "immoral and  totally counterproductive sanctions and threats of force cannot  conceal this obvious truth."</p>

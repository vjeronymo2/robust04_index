			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Letter: Ambiguity over provision of careers guidance is wasteful Sir, Howard Davies is right in saying Training and Enterprise Councils should not be directly involved in providing careers guidance, but should be strategic overseers ('Dear David: shall I stay on at school?', July 7). What is surprising is the suggestion that this is controversial. The 1993-94 Guidance to Tecs from the departments of trade and industry and employment states: 'Tecs should as a rule contract out provision of services rather than deliver it directly.' The president of the board of trade's introduction makes clear: 'I do not see Tecs as the direct deliverers of services where these are available from others.' Ambiguity between enabling and delivering services is perpetuating a confusing, wasteful and inefficient patchwork of services in both careers guidance and the whole panoply of business and enterprise services. This masks the true effects of public spending, and distorts the influence of the marketplace. Richard Brown, director of policy, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1</p>

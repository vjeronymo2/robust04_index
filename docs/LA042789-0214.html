			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NUGGETS FANS DAWDLE OVER TICKETS  </P> <P> The Denver Nuggets have sold fewer than 6,000 tickets for Game 3 of the  first-round playoff series with the Phoenix Suns.  </P> <P> The first two games in the best-of-five series will be played Friday and Sunday  nights in Phoenix. Game 3 is Tuesday night at Denver's McNichols Arena.  </P> <P> "This is the fifth year I've been in Denver, and all five years it seems like  the same story," team President and General Manager Pete Babcock said. "Whether  we're coming off 54 wins or 37 wins, no matter what the extreme, it seems that  our fans want to wait and see what happens before they buy tickets."  </P> <P> The Nuggets plan to break with tradition and televise all home playoff games,  regardless of turnstile count.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> ITT to Establish ESOP: ITT Corp., the focus of recent takeover speculation,  will institute a $700-million employee stock ownership plan designed to put  about 11% of its shares in workers' hands, Chairman and Chief Executive Rand V.  Araskog said at the company's annual shareholders meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla.  The plan should boost the defenses of the diversified New York-based services  company against a takeover or leveraged buyout, although it adds to its nearly  $3-billion debt, said spokesman James Gallagher. Araskog said the voluntary  employee ownership plan will hold about 12 million shares. The plan would add  to the 3.5% of shares already owned by its 47,000 U.S.-based salaried  employees.  </P></p>

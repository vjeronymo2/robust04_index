			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bibby puts Pounds 75m flotation on ice after offer from AB Foods J Bibby &amp; Sons has put the imminent Pounds 75m flotation of half its business on ice while it considers an offer for its agricultural division from Associated British Foods. The division was one of four that was to form the new company whose flotation was announced last October. It was a means of cutting Bibby's debt, which stood at Pounds 122.8m at the year end following the ill-fated Pounds 82m acquisition of Finanzauto, the Spanish distributor for Caterpillar in July 1992. The offer from ABF, the milling, baking and grocery products group which has substantial cash balances, is conditional on due diligence and negotiation on price. But Bibby hopes to be in a position to give a clear message to shareholders about the future at its delayed annual meeting, which has now been set for March 30. Bibby, which is 79 per cent owned by Barlow Rand, the South African group, also released first quarter results yesterday which showed a recovery in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.29m to Pounds 3.46m. However, operating profits from the agricultural side fell from Pounds 731,000 to Pounds 580,000. Analysts said the sale of the agricultural business could raise Pounds 20m, although ABF might need to spend more on restructuring the business. They said it would fit well with ABF's animal feeds activities which derive from both its milling and British Sugar businesses. ABF has made two acquisitions in the field recently, KW Agriculture and Yorkshire Country Feeds. Mr Harry Bailey, finance director, said there was 'no grand strategy' to become a leader in the industry, but where ABF could see a sensible addition at a price to give a good return it would make acquisitions. Bibby's first quarter figures showed turnover static at Pounds 210m (Pounds 209m). Earnings per share were ahead from 0.52p to 1.22p.</p>

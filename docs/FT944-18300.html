			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Asarco takes Dollars 30.7m charge Asarco, one of the largest integrated copper producers in the US, is taking a Dollars 30.7m after-tax charge to third-quarter earnings to pay for environmental clean-ups. The charge, equal to Dollars 45.5m on a pre-tax basis, largely results from a settlement between Asarco and the City of Tacoma, Washington, and surrounding communities over the clean-up of a smelter site.</p>

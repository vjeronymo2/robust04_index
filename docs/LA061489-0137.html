			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHEERING CROWDS AGAIN GREET GORBACHEV;  </P> <P> 'BRAVO!' SHOUTED AS SOVIET LEADER TOURS HIGH-TECH GERMAN STATE  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was mobbed by West German well-wishers for  the second straight day today as he visited Stuttgart to view the high  technology he needs to modernize the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> A crowd of 5,000 gathered behind barriers across from the New Castle state  residence where Gorbachev spent more than two hours talking with political and  industrial leaders of Baden-Wuerttemberg, one of West Germany's most prosperous  states.  </P> <P> Before his formal meetings with local leaders and a tour of a robotics and  industrial machinery exhibit at Stuttgart University, the Kremlin leader  mingled with the crowd and signed autographs to thunderous cheers and cries of  "Bravo, Gorby!"  </P> <P> "I like Mike," "Greetings, Gorby" and "New Thinking, No New Weapons,"  proclaimed some of the signs hoisted by well-wishers.  </P> <P> Referring to the cheering receptions he has been accorded at all of his public  appearances, Gorbachev said, "This has really pleased all the Soviet people."  </P> <P> Inside New Castle, a reconstructed 18th-Century palace that houses two  government ministries, Gorbachev praised Baden-Wuerttemberg Premier Lothar  Spaeth and the people of his state for their pioneering role in joint economic  ventures with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "I want to note that the people of your state have been out in front,"  Gorbachev, on the third day of his West German visit, said during the brief  welcoming ceremony.  </P> <P> He said the crowds on the cobblestone square in front of the building  personified the rapprochement between West Germany and the Soviet Union after  years of tense relations.  </P> <P> "This is more than feelings. This is evidence of the great changes that have  taken place," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> Spaeth praised Gorbachev's role in pressing for a "common European home" with  more cooperation between East and West.  </P> <P> "No one has worked as much as you have to make this possible," he said.  </P> <P> But Spaeth -- tapped as a possible West German chancellor -- also noted that  Germany remains divided into two states and that the Communist East is fenced  off by barbed wire and the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> "The building site for the European House is not yet finished. There are still  barbed wire and walls. But despite this we must begin," Spaeth said.  </P></p>

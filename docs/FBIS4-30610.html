			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- Japanese business leaders  voiced anxiety Monday [27 June] about the yen's vigorous surge  against the U.S. dollar in recent days, fearing a fallout on the  fragile economy.    Many leaders pinpointed yet another political crisis  triggered by the resignation of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Saturday as a factor which drove the yen above the 100-to-the  dollar level in Monday dealings in Tokyo.    They expressed hopes that the political tempest will be  calmed and the yen stabilized, while calling for boosted joint  intervention by major economic powers.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said the yen's surge is "a regrettable matter both for  the Japanese and global economy."    Other leaders said the yen's renewed strength would rid the  Japanese economy of the little vitality it has to recover.    Even officials in the electric power and retail sectors,  which can benefit from a stronger yen, are worried that high-yen  drawbacks will outweigh merits.    In the long term, the leaders also said, the high yen will  accelerate the hollowing out of Japanese industry, encouraging  further shifts to overseas production and boosting unemployment.    To bring the yen under control, the business community urged  an end to the political turmoil and more powerful actions by  financial authorities in major countries.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations, noted the United States could take  measures to stop the dollar's fall, such as reducing the budget  deficit and a raising interest rates.    Itochu Corp. President Minoru Murofushi also suggested the  Bank of Japan lower the official discount rate to discourage  yen-buyers.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Food for thought - The Week Ahead MONDAY: Analysts expect Christian Salvesen, the distribution and specialist hire group, to report interim pre-tax profits up modestly from Pounds 41.1m to between Pounds 42m and Pounds 42.5m, representing some recovery since January's profits warning. Problems at Aggreko, the specialist plant-hire business which has been the engine of growth in recent years, have been addressed and its European operation is expected to have done well. But food performances probably will be flat. TUESDAY: Severn Trent is expected to report interim profits about 7 per cent ahead to Pounds 157m. Investors will be looking for a substantial improvement at the group's waste services division, Biffa, along with information on cost control. WEDNESDAY: Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer and owner of the Safeway chain, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 206m. This marks an increase from Pounds 199m previously, after re-stating the figures to allow for the group's decision a year ago to start depreciating its store values. The group, which in October sold 101 of its remaining Lo-Cost discount stores, is thought to be improving net margins through tight cost control. THURSDAY: Seeboard will kick off what is expected to be a controversial interims season for the England and Wales regional electricity companies (RECs) when it reports. Profit figures for the first half of the year are always of limited significance but the RECs' dividend rises inevitably provoke criticism. Seeboard is expected to be relatively restrained, with analysts forecasting rises of about 16 per cent. But some of its peers are likely to go beyond 20 per cent. The Labour Party seems bound to renew calls for a windfall tax on utilities. THURSDAY: Another hefty re-structuring charge will depress pre-tax profits at Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, by Pounds 280m to around Pounds 650m for the year ended September. A similar charge a year earlier cut profits to Pounds 630m. The City hopes GrandMet will spell out what the charge, announced in October, will entail. The other key area is the performance of IDV, its spirits business, particularly in the US. THURSDAY: Hanson's full-year figures Thursday are expected to show a modest increase in pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1bn before disposal gains of more than Pounds 300m. Underlying earnings per share are forecast to show little change at 14p. Strong growth at the operating level will have continued in the fourth quarter, with trading profits rising by almost a third in the year. But the impact will have been largely offset by a Pounds 250m swing in the interest bill. This stems from the increase in US debt following the Pounds 2.1bn acquisition of Quantum Chemical at the start of the year, combined with lower income on Hanson's sterling deposits. Hanson has signalled already that it will pay a fourth quarterly dividend of 3p, making a total for the year to 11.7p - a rise of 2.6 per cent. THURSDAY: Forecasts for Royal Bank of Scotland's pre-tax profits for the full year centre on a range between Pounds 508m and Pounds 528m (Pounds 258m last time), taking account of the payment announced last year to Peter Wood, chief executive and founder of Direct Line, the group's motor insurer, of Pounds 21m and the extra Pounds 50m from Royal Bank's disposal of its stake in 3i. Forecasts for the full-year dividend range from 12.5p to 13.8p, against 11p. The interim dividend was 4p.</p>

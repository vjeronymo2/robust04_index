			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bid to end sugar strikes in Jamaica and Barbados NEGOTIATIONS between mill operators and labour unions began yesterday in Jamaica and Barbados with the aim of ending strikes which have crippled the sugar industry in the two Caribbean islands. Seven of Jamaica's nine mills have been closed by a dispute over wages. Spokesmen for the industry said yesterday that if the stoppage does not end in the near future it will threaten achievement of this year's production target of 230,000 tonnes. Reduced output will also curb the island's ability to meet its quota commitments to the European Community and the US. While the unions are asking for wage increases of 200 per cent, mill owners are offering 50 per cent. In Barbados the industry, which was shut down for several months because it ran out of money, has been unable to start this year's harvest because of another pay dispute. The unions are asking for an increase of 8 per cent, but Barbados Sugar Industry, the owner of the island's mills, is suggesting a wage freeze because of the weak state of its finances. It owes the state-owned Barbados National Bank about Dollars 87m. No new credit is being granted as the government has agreed with the International Monetary Fund to cut the public sector deficit. Barbados's sugar industry has seen its production fall in recent years. The 1991 harvest yielded 65,774 tonnes, the lowest in 60 years. The industry has been having difficulty meeting its quota commitments to the EC and the US and satisfying domestic demand.</p>

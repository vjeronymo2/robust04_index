			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Pakistan's army stays neutral PAKISTAN'S army denied at the weekend that it sought to intervene in the country's political crisis, before the 16th anniversary today of the imposition of martial law by the late General Zia-ul-Haq. The army insisted in a statement that it was neutral in the bitter six-month power struggle between President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and denied that it had urged Mr Sharif to end the dispute or call elections. Mr Nisar Ali Khan, petroleum minister and a special assistant to Mr Sharif, said the army had not raised the need for mid-term elections. But he said the army had expressed its concern, adding that this anxiety could be removed if the president were to step down. 'The country can only have stability if the president leaves office,' he said. In the latest tensions between Mr Sharif and Mr Ishaq Khan, the government claims that the president is behind the refusal of the provincial government in Punjab to comply with a parliamentary resolution imposing direct federal rule on the province. The battle over the Punjab is now widely seen as the most difficult test for Mr Sharif. It was the Punjab which was once seen as Mr Sharif's most important base and largely responsible for his political rise. Mr Altaf Hussain, provincial governor and Mr Manzoor Watoo, chief minister, have both defied Islamabad's initiative to seize control.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Dawson to axe 205 Scots jobs: Clothes maker shuts 2 plants DAWSON International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, best known for its luxury Pringle and Ballantyne brands, is to shut two Scottish factories with the loss of 205 jobs. Most of the cuts are in the Pringle of Scotland division. Its four-year-old, purpose-built factory at Dumfries will close at the end of next month. Pringle's workforce will shrink by 10 per cent. Mr Nick Kuenssberg, chief executive of Dawson Premier Brands, the company's luxury and sports clothes division, did not blame the recession for the closures. 'The two factories did low-margin, own-label work. It's a matter of improving margins and getting more from expensive knitting machines.' The Dumfries plant employs 268 people in lambswool knitting. Jobs will be offered to 63 workers and the remainder offered redundancy. The other factory, at Arbroath, employs 40 people finishing clothes for the Pringle label. All are being offered jobs at a Dawson plant nearby. Earlier this year the Dumfries factory took on 30 staff to cope with demand for its autumn ranges. 'At that time we had not finalised our plans,' Mr Kuenssberg said. Since then, a strategic review has identified 'a surplus of manufacturing facilities at (Dawson's) Dumfries factory'. The factory was built on an industrial estate greenfield site and opened officially in 1988 by the Princess Royal. 'At the time, the market was steaming away,' Mr Kuenssberg said. Production for the McGeorge label would have been trebled if the factory had ever worked at full stretch. He said the closure was 'a disaster for Dumfries but good for the business and the shareholders'. Reorganisation costs were provided for in this year's accounts, but now there will be an additional charge of Pounds 1m to reflect the fall in the value of the Dumfries property. After the reorganisation, Pringle of Scotland will have about 1,840 employees. These are the first job losses at Dawson Premier Brands since the start of the year when 100 were cut at the Blackwoods carpet yarn operation.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kwik Save hit Stores group Kwik Save slid 9 to 546p as securities houses stressed their sell stance ahead of figures on Thursday. There is a market consensus for full-year profits of around Pounds 130m, and Yamaichi's Mr Bill Myers echoed the thoughts of several when he said many superstore majors now offer what Kwik Save alone used to offer. In a sell recommendation which hit client's desks yesterday, Mr Myers said: 'Without a change of strategy, profits are set to plateau at about Pounds 130m for many years.' J. Sainsbury, which also reveals figures this week, slipped 3 to 398p on concern over the price fighting among the leading food retailers. Analysts expect interim profits tomorrow to come in around Pounds 445m. Calluna, the Scottish-based designer and manufacturer of miniature hard disk drives, made an impressive stock market debut. The shares, placed at 65p, and sponsored by Albert E. Sharpe, the Midlands stockbroker, opened at 87p and raced up to close at 92p, with 9.6m changing hands. The current vogue for on-market share buybacks continued as Macro 4 shares moved off their 1994 low point of 423p, closing 11 higher at 434p after the company instructed its broker SG Warburg to buy in 1.1m shares, or just under 5 per cent of its issued capital. Just before the close of trading Macro announced that it had bought in 844,000 shares at 430p apiece. The market's 100 points-plus upsurge over the past three sessions injected renewed confidence in the financial sectors, where recently battered merchant banks and investment management groups attracted keen interest. Hambros, which followed SG Warburg in announcing a profits warning early last month, extended Friday's strong performance, closing a further 6 higher at 234p, while SG Warburg advanced 8 to 614p. Kleinwort Benson rose 7 to 488p and Schroders 25 to 1360p. Edinburgh Fund Managers jumped 14 to 723p, M&amp;G Group 22 to 955p and Mercury Asset Management 14 to 628p. Switching out of Abbey National and into TSB, thought to have been triggered by Credit Lyonnais Laing, saw the latter move ahead 7 to 226p and the former finish 5 lower at 416p. The two quoted Premier League football clubs gave good performances on the stock market as well as on the field. Manchester United moved up 12 to 657p after closing the gap on the premiership leaders and ahead of their European Champions League match against Barcelona on Wednesday. Tottenham edged up 6 to 124p. British Aerospace tumbled 11 to 446p, with one dealer taking the view that the VSEL bid saga 'is all over bar the shouting; BAe has been outmanoeuvred by GEC'. Brewer Whitbread jumped 15 to 172p as some chart-based analysts argued that the stock had broken through into a new trading range. Property and shipping company P&amp;O improved 10 to 636p, with dealers reporting a good two-way pull on the stock ahead of the official opening of the Channel tunnel. Traders said investment institutions were taking a stand on the effect that the Channel tunnel would have on ferry traffic and dealing accordingly. A certain amount of bear closing saw troubled Channel tunnel group Eurotunnel bounce 4 to 235p in the Units. Transport group NFC suffered slightly after it was announced that its former chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock is suing the company for Pounds 1.3m in compensation. The issue is unlikely to hit profits but did dent sentiment and the shares shed 3 1/2 to 178p. NFC also said it was in talks with John I. Jacobs to sell some of the assets of its BRS car delivery unit. Jacobs rose 4 to 63p. Daily Mail and General Trust 'A' fell 30 to 983p after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission blocked its proposed acquisition of T. Bailey Forman, publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post.

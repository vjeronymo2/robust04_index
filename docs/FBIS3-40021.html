I Do </F> Not Know....'"]    [Text] "What I am doing now does not have much to do with  rationality, but really has more to do with Don Quixote," is how  Ruth Marti, chairman of the Party of East German Unity (OPDE),  speaking in Berlin yesterday, described the attempt by over  2,400 members to mobilize non-voters and potential right-wing  voters before the land elections in the former GDR "to assume  political responsibility for shaping the new German state." In  its document on general policy guidelines, the OPDE presents  itself as a "social-liberal alternative" for representing the  interests of east Germans -- and is evidently also an  alternative to the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism].    "Still a leftist -- I do not know," said Ruth Martin,  pre-empting a question from journalists, as she explained the  OPDE policy guidelines. What is obvious is that many of the  party stances and demands could just as easily appear in a PDS  (election) program and in Gysi's "Ingolstadt manifesto," where  they have to some extent been formulated in both a more detailed  as well as a more intelligible manner. Thus, the lawyer  described the inevitable question about what separates the party  from the PDS as being among "those that I hate most."    Nevertheless, her answer seemed plausible: Among the  potential non-voters in the east -- and she estimates that they  could account for as much as 40 percent of the electorate there  -- are many people who would never vote for the PDS and would  rather vote for the right. "We do not want to take away  concerned voters from anyone," she said, but added  self-confidently that the establishment of the OPDE to represent  eastern interests has already led to "a review within the PDS."    At the same time, the OPDE does not have any illusions about  something similar occurring in the SPD [Social Democratic Party  of Germany], the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], and FDP [Free  Democratic Party]. "The old parties do not represent the  interests of the Germans in the east," is the first sentence in  the policy guidelines. However, their members, says Dan  Mechtel, a 22-year-old law student at Humboldt University,  include social democrats, Christians, and liberals. That is why  he also sees no grounds for concern.    Ruth Martin stated clearly what does concern the OPDE: "Well  over 2 million citizens are unemployed in the east....  Thousands of scientists have been fired, artists do not receive  work, and research capacity has been extensively reduced.  People have not only lost their jobs, but have also lost their  social ties."    This is something that the party does not want to counter  with nostalgia for the GDR, but by citing the constitution,  "which we want to develop and defend." Equality before the law,  but with certain special rights for the disadvantaged east  Germans, is the main thread running through the policy  guidelines that culminate in the slogan "one people, one law,  one state," which does, of course, trigger negative associations  among journalists.    The party explicitly states that it supports a "social free  market economy," but stresses the word social. She demands that  "industrial core areas" should not only be preserved, but with  an eye to the markets in the east -- Ruth Martin said: "I want  to take the train to Beijing" -- new ones should also be  developed.    At the same time, the party also wants to protect  manufacturers and traders from the excessive might of western  concerns and demands conditions that would enable an east German  middle class to emerge.    The OPDE calls itself the party of "human dignity and social  justice." One of the ways in which this goal is to be achieved  is through the "partial recognition of GDR laws on land  ownership," which affects 50 percent of families in the east.  "The fundamental human right to housing" should be secured  through genuinely social housing construction projects and  should not be linked to "the possibility that those on higher  incomes have of living well."    Demands "that our country should once more be favorably  disposed toward families and children" occupy a central place in  the guidelines. The abortion law should be removed from the  criminal code, says Dan Mechtel, and protecting the lives of  children should be made a part of family law and "a duty for  both parents." Ruth Martin wants, above all, to motivate women  into being participants in the life of society once again.  "They must enter politics and achieve equality that way,"  states the document.    Further on, the party demands "rights for the younger  generation that would enable it to represent itself,"  apprenticeships and jobs for all young people, and  "scholarships, irrespective of parents' earnings, that amount to  at least as much as social assistance payments."    Apart from the work involved, the OPDE chairman said that  the  greatest handicap to crossing the 5-percent hurdle is to find  partners -- "It is a grueling job; I have never worked so hard."  Does that mean that she will now give up participating in the  Bundestag elections? The established parties do not think much  of the modified OPDE demand that 5 percent of the votes in one  of the laender should suffice to be represented in the  Bundestag. That is why the party will concentrate on elections  at the land level, beginning with the forthcoming elections in  Saxony-Anhalt.</p>

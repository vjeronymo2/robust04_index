			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Slow puncture of the Japanese real estate bubble THE DETAILS of Britain's new economic policy remain shrouded in Treasury mystique. But one clear message emerged in the chancellor's letter to the Treasury and civil service select committee: the UK government will no longer ignore the macroeconomic messages emerging from the housing market. The chancellor intends to monitor a range of asset prices, 'paying particular attention to periods when house prices are falling or accelerating sharply'. Of course, it is now a little late. The inflationary danger signals from rapid house price inflation should have been spotted back in 1985 and 1986. But during the subsequent two years interest rates were cut in an attempt to prevent sterling from rising above DM3 rather than raised to rein in property-related credit demand. By the time British interest rates were increased to double figures, the house price bubble was already bloated and ready to burst. Nor was this a peculiarly British mistake. The bulk of Japan's asset price inflation occurred in the period 1985-87, as the charts show. Yet the Japanese monetary authorities cut the official discount rate in 1987 in an attempt to stabilise the dollar's collapse, ignoring the inflationary dangers that this large rise in property prices implied. Yet movements in property prices can be destabilising when they are falling as well as rising, as the chancellor's letter suggests. So what should the current pattern of property prices be telling policymakers? The charts are taken from the the September issue of the International Bank Credit Analyst. They suggest that it is policymakers in Japan who should now be paying particular attention. The monetary authorities in the US, UK and Australia have all been watching the deflationary impact of falling land prices for some time, and cutting interest rates accordingly. Commercial prices peaked first in the US but they have fallen furthest in the UK where interest rate cuts have so far been relatively modest. But the plethora of empty commercial real estate in the financial districts of Sydney, London and in many US cities are testimony to the severity of the commercial real estate collapse that continues to undermine bank balance sheets and restrict the availability of new lending. Consumers have also been hit by falling property prices. Nominal house prices across southern England have fallen by more than 25 per cent since the end of 1988, eroding the real value of household wealth. More than 1 in 10 UK homeowners with mortgages now owe more than their house is worth at current prices. But the charts suggest that, relative to consumer prices, house prices in the US, UK and Australia may still have some way to fall. UK house prices are still high, relative to average earnings, and the low level of housing transaction in the UK suggests that house prices may have to fall further. In Japan, however, the charts suggest that the bursting of the land price bubble is only now getting under way. The rise in Japanese land prices was so extreme, and transactions in the land market have since dried up to such an extent that, after falling between 20 and 40 per cent from their peak, land prices remain at unrealistically high levels. The problem for Japan's policymakers is that neither the Bank of Japan nor the commercial banks know how far prices would have to fall before the adjustment is over. Some commercial bankers talk of further falls of 30 per cent in real estate prices, estimates that Bank of Japan officials describe as highly plausible. Yet the evidence from the US, UK and Australia suggests that prices may have to fall twice as far as these estimates suggest. If prices do finally fall far enough for speculators to re-enter the market, the real estate losses for Japan's banks will be much higher than the Y7,800bn (Pounds 36.4bn) of non-performing loans that the Ministry of Finance reported last March or the Y15,000bn which commercial bankers estimate the ministry's latest study will reveal. For Japan's banking industry, the domestic pain is still to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

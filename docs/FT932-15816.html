			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Jamaican party to boycott parliament JAMAICA'S opposition Labour party is to boycott sittings of the island's parliament and will not appoint any senators, in protest at the conduct of last week's general election in which the People's National Party was returned to office. Mr Edward Seaga, Labour's leader, has also asked the government to dismiss the police commissioner and to set up a public inquiry under the island's chief justice to study the conduct of the election. The poll was marred by clashes between party factions and the stealing of ballot boxes and papers from polling stations, mainly in Kingston, the capital. Mr P J Patterson, prime minister, has rejected Mr Seaga's call for an inquiry, saying the law allowed any citizen to take cases of electoral malpractice to the courts. He said also that if Mr Seaga did not appoint opposition senators he will be failing in his duty as opposition leader, and should stand down in favour of someone else. The office of the director of elections reported yesterday that the official counting of votes was continuing, and that official declarations had given the PNP 49 and Labour six of the 60 seats contested last week.</p>

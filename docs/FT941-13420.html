			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / N-test ban talks start Formal United Nations negotiations began yesterday on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, now supported in principle by all five declared nuclear weapons states. The treaty, which could be ready in two to three years, is seen by western governments as an important part of efforts to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation after the Cold War. The talks are being handled by an ad hoc committee of the UN Conference on Disarmament, which has 37 members including the nuclear weapons states - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France. On the first day of its session yesterday, the conference gave the committee a formal mandate to 'negotiate intensively' a universal and 'effectively verifiable' test ban treaty. In a message to the conference, President Bill Clinton called for the negotiation of a treaty 'at the earliest time'. Mr John Holum, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said yesterday a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) was 'an immediate priority' for the US administration, which has made the fight against nuclear weapons proliferation a central foreign policy concern. Non-nuclear weapons states see the CTBT as a test of the nuclear powers' commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament. One reason for the US policy reversal on testing is the belief that a CTBT, or progress towards one, will help persuade developing countries to extend and strengthen the bedrock Non-Proliferation Treaty when it comes up for renewal next year. Separately, the US is opposing Iraq's admission to full membership of the UN disarmament conference, though it says it will not oppose the inclusion of North Korea.</p>

			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New peak for Dow on bullish economic news Wall Street AFTER trading slightly lower in early dealings in spite of positive economic news, investors set aside their concerns about rising bond yields and pushed share prices to new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 12.02 up at 3,692.61, eclipsing the previous record of 3,687.86 set last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.27 at 469.10, the American SE composite added 1.13 at 482.57 and the Nasdaq composite was up 4.51 at 783.77. New York SE volume was 256m shares and advances outscored declines by 1,071 to 958. Trading got off to a slow start, with investors troubled by early declines in bond prices which were triggered by a stronger than expected report on October manufacturing activity from the National Association of Purchasing Management. The latest in a string of positive economic data, the report pushed the benchmark 30-year bond down three-quarters of a point, lifting the yield back above 6 per cent. But the purchasing managers' report was bullish for stocks. The NAPM said its index of manufacturing activity rose from the 49.7 seen in September to 53.8 in October. Any reading above 50 is taken as evidence that the manufacturing sector is expanding. Strong readings in manufacturing orders and production, and lack of growth in manufacturing prices, were seen as particularly encouraging. After a slow start, the figures eventually proved bullish enough to lift equities out of their morning doldrums, and in spite of continued concern on Wall Street about overvalued stocks, blue chip and cyclical shares moved into record territory late in the day. McDonnell Douglas jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 98 1/8 in busy trading after the aircraft manufacturer and defence supplier reported net income of Dollars 142m for the third quarter, an impressive turnround from the Dollars 42m loss incurred in the same period a year ago. The company's earnings were boosted by a one-off tax-related gain of Dollars 41m. Car manufacturing issues remained in demand in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports. Forestry product stocks, hit late last week by negative comments from a brokerage analyst, rallied strongly. International Paper advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 61 3/4 , Georgia-Pacific Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 and Louisiana-Pacific Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 38 3/8 . Dean Foods rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 1/8 after stating that it would be acquiring the Birds Eye vegetable business from Kraft General Foods for about Dollars 140m. Compaq put on Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 68 3/4 in busy trade after the computer group announced further price cuts in its leading products. Canada TORONTO followed a five-day winning streak with a mixed performance yesterday in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index receded 7.5 from its record high to 4,248.0, but rises led falls by 405 to 384 after volume of 57.6m shares. Nine of the 14 stock groups rose, led by transportation, up 2.99 per cent. But gold shares fell 3.44 per cent after the gold bullion price sank in sympathy with silver, which plummeted after Xerox unveiled a new graphic arts film this weekend which does not use silver.</p>

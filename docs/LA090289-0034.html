			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY  </P> <P> Robert Koehler's Aug. 18 review of the Colony Studio Theatre's production of  "Guys and Dolls" was unnecessarily harsh in its reference to the orchestra.  I'll agree that "there's no substitute for a full-bodied orchestra," but in a  99-seat house, that's impossible. Any more than two musicians is unusual, and  11 players is nothing short of remarkable.  </P> <P> Perhaps Mr. Koehler should restrict his reviews to the Dorothy Chandler  Pavilion, where space and budget permit more Wagnerian musical forces.  </P> <P> NATASHA (BOOTS) WALKER, Irvine  </P></p>

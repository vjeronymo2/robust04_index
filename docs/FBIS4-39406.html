			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- "We shall not prolong the  voucher privatisation," head of the Russian state property  committee Anatoliy Chubays told a press conference here today.  This means that the ongoing voucher privatisation process will  end on June 30. Chubays stressed that "it will be rounded off  with flying colours by June."    He told the press conference that he signed an order today  to  auction off 63 enterprises, which will be sold for privatisation  vouchers. They include the "Apatite" production society, the  Leningrad "Svetlana" association, the "Beryozka" trade house,  and the "Norilsk Nickel" concern". This will allow the future  share-holders to make use of their remaining vouchers. As many  as 126 million vouchers out of the issued 148 millions have  already been used. Chubays noted that the actual size of  dividends received for invested privatisation vouchers proved to  be not as fantastic as initially expected. They fluctuate from  10 to 200 percent a year.</p>

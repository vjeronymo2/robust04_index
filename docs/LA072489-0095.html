			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THATCHER SHAKES UP CABINET IN ATTEMPT TO HALT SLIDE IN POPULARITY  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed new foreign and defense secretaries  today, fired two other Cabinet ministers and switched around several more in  the biggest government shake-up since she won power.  </P> <P> Thatcher named John Major, one of the least-known members of her 22-member  Cabinet, as the new foreign secretary. He replaces Sir Geoffrey Howe, who was  moved to a vacant post as deputy prime minister and the governing Conservative  Party's leader in the House of Commons.  </P> <P> The prime minister, battling to halt her government's slide in popularity, also  put new appointees in an array of major posts including the portfolios for  Northern Ireland and the environment. Reporters had waited eagerly outside  Thatchers residence at 10 Downing St. for word on the Cabinet shuffle. Thatcher  fired her harassed Transport Secretary Paul Channon, who had been accused of  bungling bomb warnings before Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Scotland on  Dec. 21, and Social Secretary John Moore.  </P> <P> The two other Cabinet ministers to depart -- Defense Secretary George Younger  and Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young -- said they were resigning to  resume business careers.  </P> <P> Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King was named defense secretary in an apparent  reward after four years as Britain's top official in the embattled province.  </P> <P> The appointment of Major as foreign secretary marked a meteoric rise from his  former Cabinet post as chief secretary to the treasury, the No. 2 financial  official.  </P> <P> The 46-year-old son of a circus trapeze artist was raised in poverty in south  London's run-down Brixton District, never went to college and worked as a  building laborer before making a career in banking.  </P> <P> He entered Parliament in the May, 1979, general election that brought Thatcher  to power and ousted a socialist Labor Party government.  </P> <P> The move of Howe, 62, to deputy prime minister was widely regarded as a  demotion from one of the most prestigious jobs in the Cabinet.  </P> <P> Thatcher also brought into the Cabinet another member of the class of 1979,  Christopher Patten, a rising star from the party's liberal wing, as the new  environment secretary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Party Chairmanship  </P> <P> Reflecting anxiety at the government's drop in the polls and its drubbing in  elections for the European Parliament last month, Thatcher shifted Education  Secretary Kenneth Baker to the chairmanship of the Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson will take over from Channon as transport  secretary.  </P> <P> Parkinson's move is the latest step back up the government ladder after he  resigned in disgrace as trade and industry secretary in 1983 following a sex  scandal with his secretary. He was brought back into the government two years  ago.  </P></p>

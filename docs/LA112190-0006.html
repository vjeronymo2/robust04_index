			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACCIDENTS IN ANGELES FOREST  </P> <P> This article really chaps my hide! Signs listing every possible danger? There  is already a plethora of man-made signs, i.e., graffiti, trash and destruction  of flora by boobs who should get their recreation in MacArthur Park or  Disneyland.  </P> <P> How about signs in really dangerous areas? Example: "Jogging in the freeway  lanes may be injurious to your health."  </P> <P> And get off the backs of the fine people of the Forest Service. In 30 years of  hiking, picnicking and camping in the Angeles, I have found them to be helpful,  friendly and dedicated. Dealing every day with willful destruction, druggies,  drunks, speeders, illegal shooters, lack of funds and lack of personnel is no  picnic.  </P> <P> DON RANKIN, La Crescenta  </P></p>

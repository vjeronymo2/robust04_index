Oktay added that, before the time of the present coalition  government, this figure had been between 800-900, and that now,  according to the report from the Office of the Chief of Staff,  22 terrorists were being arrested every day.    Oktay denied the rumors that prisoners in Diyarbakir state  penitentiary would be moved to another prison.    He said that he was not at all satisfied with the conditions  in Turkish prisons.    He also stressed that, since terrorists were imprisoned in  the province where they were sentenced, the government should  increase the capacity of penitentiaries in areas were terrorism  was most intense, because transferring prisoners was both  difficult and dangerous.    Meanwhile, chief prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor  of the State Security Court, met in the Justice Ministry under  the supervision of the justice minister to discuss the problems  of prisons in which terrorists were kept, and ways of avoiding  jail breaks, the ANATOLIA news agency reported.    The 36 chief prosecutors agreed that jail breaks had greatly  disturbed the public, and that recent measures had reduced the  number of incidents and allowed the guards some advance warning  before a prisoner tried to escape.    They said that there were two laws waiting to be passed by  the Grand National Assembly, and that once they were approved  measures would be taken to prevent all jail breaks.    The chief prosecutors meet five times a year, and will  continue to do so.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Markets: 'Advice' that you can do without - Serious Money UNBIASED financial advice is hard to get. Unlike the legal, medical and accountancy professions, where most people's worries are confined to whether the adviser is clever or affordable, the financial services industry is warped by a peculiar and intractable distortion - commission. It is dominated by the large life offices which pay commission to salesman to sell their products. The rationale is the old industry adage that people do not buy insurance - they must be sold it. Sale by commission is not confined to insurance products. It extends to other investments such as unit trusts and even to deposit-based savings such as some tax-exempt special savings accounts (when sold through an adviser). There are two particular problems with the commission system. One is that people do not know what proportion of their premiums is being used to pay the commission - ie, they do not know the overall 'cost' of their investment. The other is that payment by commission causes a potential conflict of interest for the adviser, who might have to choose between giving good advice and earning a living. The Financial Services Act, which established the regulatory system, tried to address some of the problems by dividing those who can sell products by commission into two categories: the 'tied' agent, who can sell only the policies of one company, and the independent financial adviser, who can choose between products offered by the whole industry. Tied agents must declare their affiliation before selling a product. This will be familiar to many people who have taken out a mortgage in the past five years, since almost all the large banks and building societies are tied to a single life office. There can be few people who would consult a doctor if they knew he was paid by the drug companies to sell their medicine. He might be under pressure to meet a sales target for a certain number of headache pills if he did not want to be fired. This would hardly seem a desirable state of affairs. Yet, the life offices are good at producing surveys showing consumers are happy with the commission system. This is because many people do not appreciate the way the system works. Say, for instance, you want an endowment policy. Would you prefer to pay an adviser to sell it to you or would you rather have the life company pay the adviser? Given that question, you might choose the latter. But, in fact, you end up paying the adviser either way because the life company pays him out of your premiums. Although there are many hard-working and scrupulous commission-based independent financial advisers, there are also many who are not, as the plight of those misled into buying risky home income plans (see page IV) has demonstrated amply. But the information gathered suggests that the greatest problems have been caused by the tied agents and direct sales forces of the life companies. Anthony Nelson, economics secretary to the Treasury, who this week took an important step to improve the system, said he had been alarmed by the high lapse rates in the life industry - an indication as sure as any that people are being sold policies they are either do not want or cannot afford. A report by management consultant AKG showed that, in 1991, up to one quarter of new life and pension policies lapsed within a year of their sale. Policies sold by a direct sales force or a tied agent have the highest lapse rates. The action Nelson has taken is to order the regulators to draft rules obliging both tied agents and IFAs to reveal the amount of commission they receive when they recommend a product. He also wants companies to tell consumers the effect the charges will have on their investment, by stating the amount by which their investment is reduced as a result of the charges. In ordering these and other changes, he has acted upon and extended the scope of recommendations made by the Office of Fair Trading in March. The industry is still drawing its breath before deciding what to do, but most IFAs and life offices are not pleased. IFA Promotion, an association representing the interests of IFAs, said yesterday: 'We are somewhat disappointed that the chancellor sees commission disclosure as vital to the consumer.' Standard Life, one of the largest offices, has been blunter. 'The chancellor's decisions are not what we were hoping for, especially in relation to disclosure of commission and longer term surrender values,' said spokesman Tom King. But the Consumers' Association is delighted. The Treasury's action is certainly good news for the consumer, but the life insurance industry has been adept at turning adverse circumstances to its advantage. The danger is that the industry will adopt policies which will succeed in frustrating the spirit of the Treasury's action when the new rules are drawn up. Finally, the measures still do not confront the central problem of providing unbiased advice to those who seek it. Consumers can go to fee-based advisers. This is a small market although it would expand were the commission system eroded. Until this happens, consumers will have to continue their hard search for unbiased financial advice.</p>

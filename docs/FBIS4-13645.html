			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi, 22 Apr (MENA)-- The newspaper  AL-ITTIHAD of Abu Dhabi today reports that Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat will pay an urgent visit to Jordan next week to  meet for the first time with the leaders of "Hamas" [Islamic  Resistance Movement], which recently offered a truce with Israel  in return for the latter's withdrawal from the occupied  territories and its dismantling of settlements.    The paper welcomes the visit, noting that it is the first  time 'Arafat has met with Hamas leaders, particularly Muhammad  Nazzal and Ibrahim Ghawshah, to prepare for full reconciliation  between the PLO and the Movement.

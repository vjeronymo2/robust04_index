			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Russian space mission Russia yesterday launched two cosmonauts into orbit aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, keeping alive a space programme in urgent need of financial support from the west, Reuter reports from Moscow. The spacecraft is scheduled to link up with the Mir orbital space station tomorrow, using, for the first time, a manual docking system, rather than the previous automatic mechanism which failed on an expedition in 1991.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Letter: Fire-fighting halons should not be banned Sir, In welcoming, in your editorial 'Saving the ozone layer' (November 26), the progress of the bureaucrats implementing the 1987 Montreal Protocol in relation to the use of CFCs in refrigeration, you may not have noticed that the ban on the production of halons for fire-fighting  - itself introduced as a proposal at the 11th hour in 1987 - has been brought forward by six years to January 1994. This is despite no effective substitute for the two most widely used halons, 1211 and 1301, having been developed yet. The timing of this announcement was particularly ironic, coming as it did in the week after the great fire of Windsor Castle. These halons are ideal where computers, archives and, yes, works of art, are to be protected, being as they are not only very powerful fire killers but also neither wet nor powdery. Unused halon fire extinguishers pose no threat to the ozone layer. When used for fighting fires they are quick and effective and thus prevent large quantities of carbon dioxide being generated by burning timber, etc. The fire-fighting halons are environmentally friendly and should not be banned.

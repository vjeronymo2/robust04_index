			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT JUST WON'T GO AWAY  </P> <P> Alarms are being sounded about the perils of complacency regarding the AIDS  pandemic. The new warnings come from the State AIDS Leadership Committee and  the National AIDS Commission during meetings in Los Angeles.  </P> <P>  -- Geographical shape of the epidemic is changing:  </P> <P>  No end to the continuing increase in new AIDS cases in California is foreseen  in studies that look as far ahead as 1993, four epidemiologists told the state  committee. The epidemic is spreading from San Francisco, where new cases peaked  last year, and Los Angeles, where new cases will peak later this year, to the  rest of the state, where a majority of the new cases will occur commencing in  1993.  </P> <P> Any leveling off of new cases will depend on controlling the disease in the  intravenous drug community as it has been controlled in the homosexual  population. Leaders of the National AIDS Commission were skeptical about  avoiding an outbreak from the drug community, pointing to New York City and  Bangkok, Thailand, which have witnessed almost explosive spreads of the disease  among drug users, and from them to the general population.  </P> <P>  -- Complacency is putting new populations at risk:  </P> <P>  Heterosexual complacency is a continuing problem. In San Francisco, new  infections in the gay community were quickly reduced through educational  programs, but among heterosexuals in San Francisco, there has been no general  behavioral change, according to health officials. Many, perhaps most,  Californians take the risk of engaging in sex without using condoms. There has  been a slight decline in sexually transmitted diseases, with the exception of  the resistant strain of gonorrhea, which could indicate a modest increase in  condom use. But the gonorrhea annual case load is still around 80,000, and  syphilis has increased in two of the last three years, indicating widespread  behavior that places people at risk of AIDS as well. The risk of a further  spread is indicated also in an ominous increase in AIDS among women and  children. While homosexual and bisexual males continue to constitute the great  majority of cases, the most rapid increases have been perinatal cases, up 113%,  and women, up 86% last year. Women constitute only 3% of the total AIDS cases  in the state, but the risk varies by region. In San Bernardino County, 10% of  the AIDS cases, and 25% of those infected with HIV, are women.  </P> <P>  -- Containment is crippled by fund shortages:  </P> <P>  The state's health system drew criticism from Dr. David Rogers, vice chairman  of the national commission, which heard some very dismaying testimony. Los  Angeles County reported that it has available only 1% of the funds required to  undertake early intervention programs that can extend by years the lives of  persons infected with HIV. And there are waits as long as eight weeks for the  outpatient clinic at the County-USC Medical Center. San Bernardino County,  which has chosen to spend no county funds on HIV programs, relying on state and  federal money instead, has no outpatient clinics for the county's more than  7,000 HIV-infected persons. San Diego, reporting 500 new AIDS cases in each of  the last two years, is desperately short of funds, in part because of its  limited share of state money. By 1992, more people will be living with AIDS in  San Diego, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties combined that in  either San Francisco or Los Angeles. Orange County relies on federal grants to  mount a coordinated program for the more than 14,000 thought to be  HIV-infected. The epidemiologists forecast a peak in new cases this or next  year in Orange County, barring an outbreak from the intravenous drug community,  now accounting for 5% of cases.  </P> <P> The message of the hearings adds up to a warning that the worst is yet to come.  But most public health facilities are unprepared. And that lack of preparedness  inevitably will impair the ability of the entire health system to serve all the  sick, not just those infected with HIV.  </P></p>

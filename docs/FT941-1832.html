			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Stocks react calmly to FOMC rise in rate Wall Street US stocks reacted with relative calm yesterday to a signal by the Federal Reserve that it had decided to nudge up short-term interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.30 lower to 3,862.55, after jumping about seven points on the Fed's announcement that its policy-making committee had voted to add reserves to the banking system. Analysts said the statement was an indication that the central bank was lifting its target for the federal funds rate for the second time in two months. Other important market indices also showed little change on the day, defying forecasts of a sharp downturn on the news of a rate increase. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 0.26 better at 468.80, while the American SE composite inched 0.96 ahead to 471.73. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.95 to 796.35. NYSE volume, at 282m shares, was moderate. Advancing issues led declines, 1,015 to 929. Investors were tentative as the market opened, as attention was fixed on a policy meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Most analysts were expecting the members of FOMC to vote for a further tightening. But the morning brought no indication of a shift to tighter money, and blue-chip stocks, in parallel with bonds, moved moderately higher in early trading. The Fed's announcement finally came during the mid-afternoon and the reaction was immediate. In the bond market, prices across the yield curve jumped amid relief that the long-anticipated Fed action had finally come to pass. Stocks also improved, but the upturn was more modest and short-lived. By the close, the Dow industrials were barely changed on the day. Among individual issues, Alcoa added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 78 3/8 and Disney was up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 46 3/4 , but Philip Morris lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 on news of a congressional recommendation to raise federal taxes on cigarettes. In pharmaceuticals, Merck dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 30 1/2 on reports that its cholesterol-reducing drug would soon face competition from a cheaper product from Sandoz. Bristol-Myers Squibb, down Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 53 1/8 , was also hit hard by the news. On the Nasdaq, investors showed a lack of confidence in Novell's decision to mount a challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the market for personal computer software. The stock slumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 20. Mexico Mexican stock prices rallied sharply after Mr Manuel Camacho Solis announced he would not run for the president, putting to rest speculation that has rattled the bolsa in recent weeks. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares gained 128.91 points or 5.41 per cent to end at 2,511.92. It was the biggest one-day percentage rise since January 1991. Canada Toronto stocks closed higher in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was up 28.38 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 4,551.88, with advances edging declines 424 to 423. Volume rose to 67.28m shares from 62.36 shares. Trading value was CDollars 706.8m.</p>

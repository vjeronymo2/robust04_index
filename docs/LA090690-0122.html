			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> 11 ARRESTED IN DRUG BUST  </P> <P> Police last Friday arrested 11 people at a suspected cocaine "rock house" on  West Montana Avenue, three weeks after city officials threw a block party aimed  at reclaiming the crime-plagued street from cocaine dealers.  </P> <P> The suspects, ranging in age from 23 to 47 and charged with mostly drug-related  violations, were taken into custody after police served a search warrant at an  apartment located on the street's 100 block.  </P> <P> Officers said they seized 19 rocks of cocaine, one rifle, two handguns and more  than $400 cash.  </P> <P> On Aug. 9, lollipops, cookies and punch were served to more than 100 of the  street's residents, who cheered when Police Chief Joseph Santoro warned drug  dealers to pack up and get out of town.  </P> <P> "Apparently, they weren't listening," Santoro this week said of the dealers.  "(But) this is just the beginning. We won't give up until we've made Montana  Avenue a place where people can feel safe and raise their children."  </P></p>

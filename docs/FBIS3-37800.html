			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksandr Potemkin and </F> Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Krakow, 23 Feb -- If all Russo-Polish talks go as  well as the present talks, the path to friendship and  cooperation will be covered much faster. That was how Andrey  Kozyrev and Andrzej Olechowski, the foreign ministers of Russia  and Poland, summed up the progress and results of the bilateral  talks that ended here late in the evening on 22 February.    During the meeting, the whole spectrum of relations between  the two states was examined, said A. Kozyrev, replying to  questions from ITAR-TASS correspondents. A number of very  interesting initiatives were put forward, covering the economy,  culture and social relations between our countries.    Unfortunately, the Russian minister noted, many specific  accords reached during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit  to Warsaw last August have not been fully implemented. That is  why the present talks are extremely important. We have met in  order to "puff along," as Mr. Olechowski says, that is, to urge  these processes on. We are on the right path, A. Kozyrev  pointed out when appraising the state of bilateral relations.  In the Russian minister's opinion, the part to be played by  Poland and other Central European countries in building a united  Europe is very important. Equitable Russo-Polish cooperation  should be a substantial factor in it.    Our states official relations "do not look at all bad," A.  Olechowski observed. The task now is to fill them "with  benevolent content." Mr. Kozyrev and I have discussed a number  of concrete actions and have made a number of concrete  decisions: "We are thinking about some, we are working on  others, and we have agreed on a third group." All that is the  "puffing along," as my counterpart put it jokingly, the  development of our relations .    Commenting at the request of the ITAR-TASS correspondent on  the thoughts of the Polish mass media on the present role of  Russia -- as "adversary or partner of Poland," A. Olechowski  said: "Neighbors should never be adversaries. The question now  is how to pave the way as quickly as possible from relations of  neighbors to relations of very good neighbors, and then to  relations of a friend." It is understandable that it is  impossible to achieve this in a few days, but we should try to  achieve it as quickly as possible, the Polish minister pointed  out.    Speaking about Russia's attitude to the problem of Poland  joining NATO, A. Kozyrev noted that this question had been  discussed "in a very confidential and realistic way." It is now  necessary to concentrate on participation in the "Partnership  for Peace" program, the minister said. There was no ruling out  one country or another joining NATO. And these countries should  find their own way to making a decision. It is possible, he  pointed out, that Russia may join NATO too. But there may also  be other options. A machinery of interaction of the partners  has already been created now. This is the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council, A. Kozyrev pointed out.</p>

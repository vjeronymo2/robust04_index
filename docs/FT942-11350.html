			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Sri Lanka shares fall on fears for government Sri Lankan shares have fallen sharply this week amid concerns about the stability of president DB Wijetunga's government. The sell-off was prompted by Mr Wijetunga's decision late last week to cancel a visit to China to deal with the turmoil in the ruling United National Party, and by a big May Day rally organised by a united front of opposition parties and attended by over 100,000 people. Evidence of the dwindling popularity of the UNP and strong support for the left-inclined opposition parties, headed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, unnerved investors. Even though share prices rallied on Wednesday and yesterday, after a 4.5 per cent fall in the all-share index on Tuesday, the mood remains nervous. Businessmen and brokers fear that political turmoil could continue for months, with presidential elections due later this year and a general election in early 1995. Mr Alavi Mahroof, a Colombo stock exchange broker, said: 'Local investors are worried about current political trends'. Share prices rose sharply last year, fuelled by strong economic growth and a surge of foreign investment caused by the worldwide fashion for investing in emerging markets. The market gained more than 70 per cent in dollar terms in 1993, according to data by the IFC, a member of the World Bank, but so far this year it is down 3 per cent. Equities have since fallen back, heavily influenced by the increase in US interest rates and domestic political upheavals. Mr Stanley Jayawardena, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the market watchdog, said: 'A correction was bound to come. But this is also a reaction to political events'. The political storm began in March when the UNP suffered its first electoral defeat in 17 years in provincial polls in the island's southern province. Mr Wijetunga, who succeeded the assassinated president Ranasinghe Premadasa last May, reacted with a string of populist financial hand-outs, including tax cuts and food-stamps for schoolchildren. But he could not take the wind out of the sails of the opposition parties, which sense a potential victory in the presidential and national polls. Meanwhile, a temporary change of leadership has breathed new life into the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the former president who heads the party, has been forced to go to hospital, leaving the field open for her firebrand daughter, Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the main speaker at the May Day rally. Colombo has also suffered an unwelcome reminder of the continuing war with the Tamil Tiger separatist guerrillas in the north. Terrorists planted bombs in luxury hotels in the capital last month, causing little damage but potentially harming the tourist industry.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SUN' AND SEE  </P> <P> I was very disappointed in Carolyn See's review of "The Sun in Capricorn."  After recounting glowing quotes from other authors, Ms. See writes, "On the  other hand, the Watermark press operates out of Wichita, Kan. . . . " What if  she had said, "On the other hand, the book was written by a black (or Jew or  woman) . . . " It is just another form of discrimination.  </P> <P> And she doesn't stop there. See finds it so inconceivable that a book of any  merit could be published in Wichita that she concludes by saying, " 'The Sun in  Capricorn' was published in Wichita. That has to tell you something." What does  she say when Simon &amp; Schuster publishes a book she dislikes, "Gee, I can't  imagine why it isn't good. After all, it was published in New York."  </P> <P> It makes no difference that Wichita is "not the publishing capital of the  United States"; a book review should be based on the merits (or lack thereof)  of the writing, not on petty regional stereotypes.  </P> <P> Good luck, Watermark! You're going to need it.  </P> <P> QUETA MOORE, EL SEGUNDO  </P></p>

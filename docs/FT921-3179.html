			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (7): Why the cap did not fit - The banks must become more professional TEN YEARS ago, a Nigerian import permit was a licence to print money. In the early 1990s, industrialists say sourly, banking licences have assumed that role, primarily because a five-tier foreign currency market provides endless opportunities for profitable arbitrage. Bank licences, issued so freely in 1989 (16) and 1990 (25), were cut off last year, though not until another 14 banks had been approved, taking the total to 120. Although the central bank (CBN) opposes the issue of new licences, so intense is the political pressure from vested interests that a further round of licence approvals is expected soon. UntiI this month, the newer banks continued to thrive against a background of rapid credit expansion and the wholly-artificial foreign exchange auction system in which all are winners. Before the naira was floated in the first week of March, all 120 banks quoted the same buying rate. The Dollars 60m available weekly was allocated among them on a pre-determined basis, which entitled the big three clearers  -First Bank of Nigeria, United Bank for Africa and Union Bank of Nigeria - to Dollars 2.5m each. A second tier of half a dozen banks got Dollars 1.1m each, while at the other end of the spectrum, about 60 of the newer, small banks were each allocated Dollars 242,000. This combination of guaranteed access to foreign currency, a generous spread between deposit and lending rates - estimated at six percentage points last year, down from 7.3 points in 1990 - and easy access to funds, reflected in rapid money supply growth, enabled many banks to report improved earnings last year. But for some - notably the largest banks - the imposition of prudential guidelines translated into a steep decline in profits. Last year, Union Bank's assets rose more than 40 per cent to N13.2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), but its profits collapsed to N14.4m from N127m in 1990 while at UBA profits fell almost N100m to N16.7m. Although UBA more than doubled net earnings to N407m from N186m in 1990, the guidelines meant bad debt provisions of N390m compared with only N69m the previous year. Most of the older banks were forced to make similar, if less dramatic, provisions. The blame for these should not be laid at the door of the bankers. The fact is that the mature banks have long been treated as a kind of political football - their chief executives appointed and removed by federal and state governments and the quality of their loan portfolios undermined by politically-dictated lending. The young banks have the edge in several respects - very little political intervention, and much smaller, more manageable workforces and loan portfolios. Furthermore, they have not been in business long enough to get themselves into the kind of problems that now threaten the viability of some of the state-owned banks. Deregulation, which began in 1987, was partially reversed last year when, in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing, the central bank imposed a cap of 21 per cent on lending rates. It soon backfired; in a system where credit is controlled by way of lending ceilings on banks (except those with advances of less than N50m), credit growth overshot the official target of 10.6 per cent growth by a huge margin, reaching 42 per cent. While some mainstream banks stuck to the 21 per cent cap, many others did not, using front-end fees, commissions and other non-interest charges to lever up their effective return. The authorities ended up the worst of all worlds, positive real interest rates in excess of 20 per cent in the first half of 1991 while money supply was out of control, expanding more than 38 per cent. In January, the CBN abandoned the cap - which it had always said was only temporary - but is now trying to squeeze the spread between a bank's cost of funds and its lending rate to 5 per cent. As a result, prime rates have risen to around 23 per cent for the commercial banks and 27 per cent for merchant banks. With the year-on-year inflation rate having climbed sharply from 5 per cent in the first quarter of 1991 to 20 per cent by the year-end, real deposit rates are now negative, and the same will soon be true of real lending rates. The signs are that inflation will accelerate rapidly during 1992, mainly in response to last year's excessive credit creation and the resumed slide of the naira. A year ago, the CBN set targets of 10.6 per cent for credit expansion during 1991; because the budget was meant to be in surplus, there should have been no public sector borrowing from the banks, while the ceiling for private sector credit provided for growth of 13.2 per cent growth. In the event, government borrowing surged 69 per cent during 1991 while private sector credit was up 26 per cent. In an effort to curb inflation and stabilise the exchange rate, the CBN says it will tighten monetary policy in 1992. The private sector credit growth target has been raised to 16 per cent 'to provide an appropriate stimulus to the economy'. With the public sector borrowing ceiling raised 7.7 per cent, aggregate credit growth is projected at 12.5 per cent - up two percentage points on last year's target, but well below the 42 per cent actually experienced. But credit creation is not going to slow down unless public expenditure - and inflation - are brought under control. Private sector borrowing is rising sharply as working capital requirements increase with inflation and devaluation. During 1992, the CBN is committed to shift increasingly from direct controls to market-oriented techniques for controlling the supply. The abolition of the interest rate cap was a first step in this direction, as was the requirement that banks now hold 20 per cent of their deposit liabilities to the public in treasury bills and certificates. Other instruments of indirect monetary control to be used more actively during 1992 include the 30 per cent liquidity ratio, including treasury bills, and the 3 per cent cash reserve ratio. The CBN plans to expand its open-market activities and to that end - much to the disgust of some bankers  -is calling for the creation of a discount market with up to five discount houses, operating on the London model. In spite of their distaste for discount houses - which banks see as an unnecessary intermediary - some of the top banks are getting together to establish a discount operation and the CBN hopes that at least three discount houses, which it sees as essential cogs in the wheel of indirect monetary management, will be open for business within a few months. The much-predicted shake-out and rationalisation of the banking system will not materialise - bankers say - unless and until the foreign currency market is reformed. If the naira float is even remotely clean, then the new banks are going to face a far tougher competitive environment. In the past they relied on guaranteed access to foreign currency both as a source of profit and a vehicle for attracting deposits. Precisely how the CBN is going to manage the new system is unclear but it appears that it will sell dollars to the market - not necessarily on a regular basis - at market-determined rates. The conventional wisdom is that in the short-term, the naira will stabilise around N15 or N16 to the dollar, but the medium-term prognosis for the currency is grim, with substantial further devaluation probable in 1993/4. Few of the new banks have a deposit base worthy of the name, implying that with the liberalisation of the foreign currency market they will be have to rethink their tactics. This will not be easy at a time when tight money will be the order of the day. Three developments will sort out the men from the boys over the next couple of years - a competitive foreign exchange market, monetary restraint and indirect monetary management. As and when these measures take root, so banking in Nigeria will become more professionalised and traditional virtues, such as a large deposit base, will start to count once again.  -----------------------------------           NUMBER OF BANKS  ----------------------------------- 1980                        26 1985                        40 1987                        50 1988                        66 1989                        81 1990                       107 1991                       120  ----------------------------------- Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  -----------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------            BANK CREDIT (NBN)  --------------------------------------------- Year   Private   Government   Total        Sector      Sector  --------------------------------------------- 1985    13.7       19.0       32.7 1986    17.4       19.4       36.8 1987    19.8       22.3       42.1 1988    25.1       27.0       52.1 1989    30.8       21.6       52.4 1990    36.6       30.4       67.0 1991*   46.0       50.0       96.0  --------------------------------------------- * Provisional  --------------------------------------------- Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  ---------------------------------------------</p>

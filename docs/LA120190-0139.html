			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS SETTLE SUIT AGAINST BUILDER  </P> <P> A group of condominium owners who claimed they were the victims of shoddy  workmanship have reached a $7.5-million settlement with the developer, the  plaintiffs' attorney said.  </P> <P> The agreement calls for a cash payment from Quail Ridge Associates to the Quail  Ridge Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> Quail Ridge Associates is a joint venture between Newport Beach-based  builder/developer Konwiser Corp. and the National Life Insurance Co. of  Vermont.  </P> <P> Built in 1977, the 144-unit Quail Ridge complex is located at Associated Road  and Rolling Hills Drive in Fullerton.  </P> <P> In a 1985 lawsuit against the developer, the homeowners alleged major  construction defects, including corrosive soils, inadequate foundations,  inadequate compaction of soil, expansive soils, plumbing defects and defective  balconies. During the litigation, the homeowners contended that at least $12  million would be needed to repair the condo complex. But Quail Ridge Associates  argued that repairs could be made for $4 million.  </P> <P> "To my knowledge, this is one of the largest up-front cash settlements in  Orange County's history," said Wes Davis, the plaintiffs' attorney.  </P> <P> As part of the settlement, retired Judge Jerrold S. Oliver of Judicial  Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ruled that the homeowners can move  ahead with plans to sue the insurance companies that represented Konwiser Corp.  for an additional $5.5 million, Davis said. The companies to be listed in that  suit include Maryland Casualty Co., Commercial Union Insurance Cos., Argonaut  Insurance Cos. and Mission American.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Quail Ridge Associates did not return calls from The Times.ERIK  HAMILTON  </P></p>

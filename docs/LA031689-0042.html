			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The National Weather Service announced a major modernization program that  officials said will streamline the agency by eliminating more than 100 local  offices and reducing the staff by 800 but producing improved forecasts. The  weather service will go from about 250 local offices to just 115 when the  changeover is completed about 1995, said Albert W. Friday, the weather service  director. He said the shutdowns will be gradual and most will not occur until  1993 or later. Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher  announced that weather service stations will remain open until the  modernization process is complete, putting to rest rumors that 70 or more  weather stations would close this year due to budget constraints.  </P></p>

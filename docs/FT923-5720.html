			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: National rate differential is diversion Sir, Lex (August 25) repeats the argument for dollar bearishness dominant in the market today: that 'any immediate narrowing of the short-term interest rate differential looks highly unlikely'. A narrowing of that differential is not necessary for the dollar to bottom out. An awareness that it stands at its maximum is sufficient. Sooner or later activity in the US will pick up and that in Germany decline: that is almost a certainty, and the market will realise it. The expectation of an eventual narrowing is much more important than the narrowing itself. The market is currently reluctant to consider the likelihood of narrowing, mainly because such expectations have been frustrated in recent months. The market could also move its focus to many other subjects. Market sentiment can turn round quickly and unpredictably. Moreover, to earn the present 6.5 per cent differential, one needs to hold D-Marks for one year. But the dollar has been known to move by 4 to 5 per cent in just 24 hours at times during the last 10 years. Finally, capital flows are provoked by portfolio decisions. The rising interest rate differential has increased the proportion of D-Marks that agents want to hold. As that proportion is approached, capital flows taper off, in spite of the differential remaining the same. Frank Boll, managing director, Ecofis, Beatrijslaan 39, 3110 Rotselaar, Belgium</p>

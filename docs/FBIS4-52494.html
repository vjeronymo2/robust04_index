			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii denied Wednesday [11 May] that Group of Seven (G-7) major  nations have agreed to take joint action in their credit  policies. "There were no such talks at a G-7 meeting of finance  ministers and central bankers in late April... [ellipses as  received] or after that," Fujii told a regular press meeting.    He was referring to a report by a major Japanese daily  quoting U.S. monetary officials as saying Japan, Germany and the  United States agreed on concerted moves on interest rates in  line with the recent joint G-7 intervention to stem volatility  in currency rates. But, Fujii reiterated that G-7 nations will  continue taking "appropriate, timely" action in the currency  markets.    The Bank of Japan continued to take a loose stance in the  money market to send the key overnight unsecured call rate down  to record low levels Wednesday.    Meanwhile, the German Bundesbank is expected to cut its  discount rate overnight and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is  widely speculated to raise the discount rate next week.    The Japanese and German credit easing helps the U.S. dollar  rise, while the U.S. is tightening its credit to prevent  inflation.    Pressed by reporters on whether his concern over the yen's  rise has eased somewhat, Fujii acknowledged that the yen's rise  in fact has a "deflationary impact on exporters." But he  omitted using the word "concern" as he has in the past.    Fujii said he is "not pessimistic" about the economy as a  whole and noted that currency rates are one of the factors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K. Ya. Kondratyev, K. Varotsos, International </F> Center for the Environment and Remote Sensing imeni Nansen, St.  Petersburg; Applied Physics Faculty, Athens University; UDC  558.88.042.4:551.534]    [Abstract] Nimbus-7 TOMS data collected daily over a  13-year period (January 1979 to January 1992) was used to  analyze total ozone variability over St. Petersburg. Average  monthly total-ozone values were subjected to Fourier analysis in  order to calculate the amplitude, phase, and relative  contribution of each of the three first harmonics to the overall  total-ozone variability. The principal conclusion reached by the  researchers is that heterogenous chemical reactions result in a  modification of the usual chemical processes in the Arctic  circumpolar vortex, which in turn enhances total-ozone depletion  of anthropogenic origin. The effect is also seen in the middle  latitudes as a result of the movement of air masses from the  polar latitudes when the circumpolar vortex breaks down. A  negative gradient obtains for active chlorine away from the  pole, and the movement to the middle latitudes stimulates  processes that destroy ozone.

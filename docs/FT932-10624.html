			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (1): Glory can be regained - After one of the most difficult periods in recent memory, hopes are high that the industry will return to break-even by the end of the year. Now mergers may be needed to create companies with the muscle to take on the world again High up a mountainside on Vancouver Island, a small group of lumberjacks employed by British Columbia's Canfor Corporation are doing their bit to help Canada's forest industry regain its past glory. They are clearing a splendid fir, cedar and hemlock forest in a way designed to maximise profit and minimise waste. Trees have been felled with stumps just a few inches above the ground so that as much timber as possible can be turned into the high-quality veneers and decorative panels for which Canada's coastal forests are famous. Many of the fallen trees, which might have been abandoned as debris a few years ago, are now being loaded onto a truck to begin their journey to a pulp mill. But the Canfor workers' performance also leaves a good deal to be desired. A truck driver carelessly trims 18 inches off a valuable yellow cedar log, greatly diminishing its commercial value. A forester complains that workers have yet to learn how to move the precious logs - worth as much as CDollars 40,000 apiece - without damaging the wood. The scene on the shorn Vancouver Island forest is a metaphor for Canada's entire forestry business. Shaken by a series of commercial, social and political jolts, the industry is in the throes of its biggest upheaval ever. It has already made wrenching adjustments, from corporate shake-ups and improved environmental practices, to new products and closer scrutiny of labour relations. There is near-unanimity, however, that more is needed if Canada is fully to recapture the respect it enjoyed in the days when Abitibi-Price of Toronto was the world's biggest newsprint producer and British Columbia's lumber mills spurred the Allied war effort with wood for Mosquito fighter-bombers. 'Change is not going to stop,' predicts Mr Ronald Oberlander, Abitibi's chief executive. Forestry remains a pillar of Canada's economy. With products ranging from commodity-grade pulp and planks to fine papers and moulded parts for car doors, it is the biggest manufacturing industry, contributing 8.5 per cent of gross domestic product and employing over 1m people. British Columbia, on the west coast, specialises in lumber. Interior sawmills produce mainly for the US housing market, while plants along the coast are geared to more sophisticated products, mainly for Japan. In central Canada, Ontario and Quebec are the bastions of the pulp and paper industry. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the east coast are also sizeable producers, and activity has increased in recent years in Alberta. The hallmark of the Canadian industry, especially in British Columbia, has always been the superb quality of its raw material. Taking almost a century to reach their full height, the trees - grown in the damp and cold northern climate - produce timber with an exquisite grain. The long, strong fibres make some of the finest papers in the world. But in the 1970s, users began to discover that faster-growing trees in the US South, Brazil and other warm parts of the world could be turned into many of the same products, at much lower cost. The quality might not have been as high, but it was acceptable enough for Canadian suppliers to start feeling the pinch of competition. Canada also began falling behind its traditional Scandinavian rivals in adapting forestry practices and mill processes to increasingly stringent environmental standards. It was slow to catch the newsprint recycling wave which swept through the US in the 1980s. Left with relatively small and outdated mills, the Canadian industry was gradually transformed, in the words of Mr Dan Miller, British Columbia's forestry minister, from a price setter to a price taker. The industry's shortcomings came home to roost with a vengeance in 1990 when over-capacity around the world compounded stagnant demand for pulp, newsprint and many other types of paper. The slump in prices coincided with mounting pressure on Canadian companies to make up lost ground on the environmental front. Customers have increasingly demanded pulp with little or none of the chlorine traditionally used as a bleaching agent. Environmental groups, especially in western Canada, have mounted emotive campaigns against the toxic effluents spewed out by pulp mills and the 'clear-cuts' which can transform a scenic mountainside into a pile of matchstick-like debris. Left-of-centre governments in British Columbia and Ontario have stepped up the pressure by reducing allowable cuts in provincially-owned forests and imposing new pulp-mill effluent targets. Broader economic policies, such as higher taxes and restrictive labour legislation, have made life even more uncomfortable. The result is that the Canadian companies have found themselves squeezed simultaneously from several sides. They have had to cut costs and rejig their business strategies while spending heavily to modernise mills and improve environmental standards. Pollution-abatement spending has soared from about CDollars 100m a year in the mid-1980s to CDollars 700-800m in the early 1990s. According to Price Waterhouse, publicly-listed Canadian forestry companies have swung from a combined net profit of CDollars 2.4bn in 1989 to net losses of CDollars 2.5bn in 1991 and about CDollars 1.2bn last year. Mr Mike MacCallum, a PW partner in Vancouver, predicts there will be a combined 1993 loss of about CDollars 500m. About 800,000 tonnes of uneconomic newsprint and 300,000 tonnes of pulp capacity have been taken out of production in the past three years. Leading companies such as Abitibi-Price, Fletcher Challenge Canada and Montreal-based Domtar have sharpened their focus by selling off peripheral businesses. The industry has something to show for the pain it has endured. Some pulp mills have already met effluent guidelines due to come into force in 1995. Fifteen newsprint mills are now equipped to use recycled paper as a feedstock, compared with only two in 1991. In the forests, companies are moving to smaller, less visible clear-cuts. Some have belatedly invested in cable log-hauling systems which require fewer roads and minimise damage to the logs. But much still remains to be done. Mr MacCallum says that 'we have some very efficient plants, but because they're small, we have twice as many workers per tonne as are being used elsewhere.' Mr Doug Whitehead, president of Fletcher Challenge Canada, adds that, to be successful, 'you've either got to be really big, or small and niche-picking.' Whether the industry can sustain its new-found enthusiasm for change and sacrifice may depend on trends in the marketplace. Record lumber prices - stemming mainly from fears that more and more trees will be declared out-of-bounds to loggers - have given a welcome lift to corporate earnings in the past six months. The North American newsprint market is showing signs of life as economic recovery takes hold. Pulp producers, who have recently taken the hardest knocks, are also crossing fingers that the worst will soon be behind them. Rising profits and a spate of recent equity issues will give Canadian companies the financial resources they have lacked in recent years to spread their wings. Signs of an impending spate of mergers and acquisitions have begun to emerge. MacMillan Bloedel, the biggest west coast producer, now has no controlling shareholder following the public offering last February of a 49 per cent stake held by Noranda Forest. Stone Container of Chicago has signalled a willingness to sell at least part of wholly-owned Stone-Consolidated. Abitibi-Price is nominally 82 per cent owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer. But O&amp;Y's shares are controlled by its creditors, and are likely to be put on the market at some point. Many see a few sizeable mergers and takeovers as a way for Canada's forestry companies to build on the progress of the past few years. The survivors would at least be equipped with the muscle they need to take on the world again.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Granada goes on the offensive in LWT bid Granada, the leisure and television group, last night went on the offensive in its hostile takeover bid for London Weekend Television, now worth more than Pounds 700m, with a new appeal to LWT share-holders. In a letter to them, Mr Alex Bernstein, Granada's chairman, said the closing price of 553 1/2 p for Granada's shares on Thursday valued each LWT share at 664p, a premium of 79p, or 14 per cent, to the LWT share price on the last dealing day before the offer. Granada's shares rose 26p to 579p yesterday, an increase that took the value of the share deal past Pounds 700m. Mr Bernstein warned in the letter: 'We believe that if you reject our offer the current level of LWT's share price is unlikely to be sustained.' The offer was extended for two weeks after the first closing date of December 29 when Granada received acceptances covering 2.31 per cent of LWT's equity to add to the 17.5 per cent it already held in the London ITV company. Investors were waiting for the Granada offer to be sweetened but the pressure to make an improvement was reduced by the collapse of LWT's takeover talks with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. The talks under which LWT would have taken over Yorkshire, and Anglia Television would take over Tyne Tees, were scuppered earlier this week when Anglia rejected the plan at a board meeting. The Anglia rejection came despite proposals that would have meant Anglia receiving a share of any combined profits from Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. The proportion was to have been determined by the amount of money each company put into the deal. In his letter Mr Bernstein renewed the Granada claim that LWT, with only 'one business activity of any significance' had neither the size nor the resources to take full advantage of new opportunities. Granada pointed out that brokers were forecasting pre-tax profits for 1993 of between Pounds 35.5m and Pounds 37m for LWT. 'Even if the estimate of profit before tax for 1993 were some Pounds 45m, implying earnings per share of 27.8p, you should ask yourself how sustainable an increase of that magnitude would be', the Granada chairman wrote. LWT will publish its profit forecast next week but there are signs that the company is preparing a surprise defence to try to keep its independence. Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading has extended its investigation into the deal.</p>

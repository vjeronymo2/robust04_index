			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRIENDLY RIVALS ROOT FOR EACH OTHER AT GIRLS' 4-A CROSS-COUNTRY MEET  </P> <P> Married couples often find themselves at odds, but the "rivalry" waged between  the girls' cross-country teams from Buena and Channel Islands highs has knotted  more ties than it has loosened.  </P> <P> There is no animosity breeding between the two Southern Section 4-A Division  teams. Instead, Bulldogs' Coach Steve Blum and wife Debbie Blum, the coach at  Channel Islands, have created a bond between the programs, which engage in a  friendly rivalry from year to year.  </P> <P> "We've done a lot of things together with our teams on purpose," Debbie said.  "I try to encourage his kids in the middle of races and he does the same thing  for my kids.  </P> <P> "We help out each other a lot with information, strategies and ideas. We don't  hide anything. We don't have the football mentality, we're runners.  </P> <P> Both Buena and Channel Islands boasted championship teams this year.  </P> <P> Under Steve, in his seventh year as coach, the Bulldogs claimed their seventh  consecutive Channel League title and placed second in the 4-A championship  Saturday behind five-time winner Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Channel Islands won its second Marmonte League crown in a row and finished  fourth in the 4-A final under Debbie, a fifth-year coach at the Oxnard campus.  </P> <P> "It's really been neat . . . having somebody to bounce (ideas) off of," Steve  said of having two championship programs in one household. "Most people don't  have that luxury."  </P> <P> Or the luxury of having four runners with personal-best times under 15 minutes,  45 seconds on the three-mile course at Mt. San Antonio College, the venue of  the Southern Section championships.  </P> <P> Camarillo's senior foursome of Abe Valdez (15:13), Shawn Goetzinger (15:26 last  year), Derek Kite (15:33 at the Mt. SAC Invitational in October) and Chad  Malesich (15:43) paced the boys' team to its first 4-A title after placing  third in 1986 and '87 and second last year.  </P> <P> Goetzinger, normally Camarillo's No. 3 runner, was ailing and finished 19th in  the 4-A and fifth for the Scorpions.  </P> <P> "I couldn't be happier," Coach Mike Smith said of his team's victory. "Shawn  had bronchitis and flu all this week and missed two days of practice. To come  and gut it out for the team is really special to me."  </P> <P> Valdez led Camarillo's charge with a second-place finish, one second behind  Dave Hartman (15:12) of Canyon.  </P> <P> Camarillo and Buena, ranked first and fifth, respectively, in the state  Division I, will make a run at the boys' and girls' team titles at the state  championships in Fresno's Woodward Park on Saturday.  </P> <P> Westlake's Jeannie Rothman, who recorded a personal-best 18:01 to finish second  in the 4-A final, will run in the Division I race.  </P> <P> Nordhoff's girls' team, which had been running in the shadow of Frontier League  rival Agoura, finished fourth (130 points) in the 2-A championships behind  three-time winner Agoura (47), Arroyo Grande (83) and Irvine Woodbridge (98).  Junior Dascha Spellman (19:09) led the Rangers with a sixth-place finish.  </P> <P> Fillmore freshman standout Maribella Aparicio made a triumphant entrance to  high school cross-country.  </P> <P> Not only did she win the Tri-Valley League title ahead of favored sophomore  teammate Nikki Shaw, Aparicio clocked 19:03 at Mt. SAC to claim the 1-A title.  </P> <P> Sophomore Jamie Kendig, fifth in the 1-A at 20:04, paced La Reina (140) to a  seventh-place finish in the team standings. Thacher (151) placed eighth and  Fillmore (233) was 11th.  </P> <P> Nordhoff and Aparicio qualified for the state Division II championships and  Thacher advanced to the Division III meet.  </P> <P> Oak Park's John Castner (16:20) finished sixth in the boys' 1-A final and will  compete in the state Division III race this weekend.  </P></p>

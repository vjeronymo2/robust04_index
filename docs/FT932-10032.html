			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Division Group float becomes a reality BRISTOL-BASED Division Group has become the first company involved with virtual reality computer technology to float on the Stock Market. Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester broker, yesterday placed 15.4m of the shares at 40p each. The placing is equivalent to about 45.6 per cent of the capital and values the group at Pounds 13.5m. The shares are expected to begin trading on Monday. Some 1.65m shares were sold on behalf of existing shareholders who are retaining a substantial portion of their present holdings. The balance was sold by the group to raise about Pounds 5m net. Division has developed a complete virtual reality system based on personal computers. In the year to March 31 1992 the group recorded a loss of Pounds 107,000 on turnover of Pounds 1.08m. In the five months to March 31 this year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 19,000 on turnover of Pounds 746,000. The funds raised through the placing will be used to boost marketing and fund research and development.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / For now, I say rejoice If there is ever a time to be starry-eyed, this is it. The world is witnessing one of the most remarkable elections in history. The decent response, surely, is to rejoice. Yes, I know about the bombings. They are dreadful. There will probably be more of them. It may be that they are an inevitable part of the process. We must weep for the victims. The perpetrators must be hunted down. Yet these vile acts are not the whole story. They do not cancel out the remarkable transformation that begins today, namely the voluntary transfer of power from Afrikaner to African. They disfigure, but do not obscure, the light over the southern sky. Cynicism may be one of my stocks-in-trade, but not this morning. This is an hour in which to celebrate, to sing Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika - God Bless Africa. Such inspiring moments are, heaven knows, rare enough. South Africa needs all the blessings, from the highest sources, that prayer can send its way. The gloomy news from the dark continent is drearily familiar. Governance of the new sub-Saharan states by their inhabitants has not brought the jobs, houses and general prosperity that was promised when the colonial powers withdrew. Everyone in South Africa knows this, and many fear that there, too, majority rule may fail. Perhaps it will. It would, however, be uncharitable to condemn the new administration before it has even begun. We should, at least for a few minutes, set aside such pessimism. Meanwhile, keep your fingers crossed. The outside world has a continuing interest in ensuring South Africa is stable. Tribal warfare remains a global phenomenon. What is happening in the republic's polling booths is therefore a prelude to an unprecedented experiment in tribal peacemaking. A polity whose foundations rested on fantastic theories of ethnic exclusion has, under pressure, dissolved itself. It is to be replaced by a non-racial 'new South Africa', whose interim constitution is designed to ensure power is shared between the leading parties and, by extension, between black, white, Asian and mixed-race clans. Even the white right, an irreconcilable section of which may be responsible for the bomb blasts that began on Sunday, has been offered talks about an unspecified form of Afrikaner self-determination. Perhaps rapprochement between the mainly Xhosa-led ANC and the Zulu-led Inkatha, will be harder to arrange, but the stated intention is that past transgressions shall be forgiven, that a fresh start be made. Should we take these tortuously-negotiated protestations of virtue at face value? In a sane world the lofty idealism expressed by Mr Nelson Mandela and Mr F W de Klerk would be read with envy in Belgrade and Belfast, and all stations between. If that pair of unlikely bedfellows does not understand the dangers of ethnic strife, nobody does. Mr de Klerk, the outgoing president of South Africa, was among many who tried to keep the peace by separation and domination. That failed. Mr Mandela, his putative successor, knows the horror of attempted ethnic cleansing in his country. The wars in Natal between Zulu and Zulu have at times been echoed by inter-tribal skirmishes in other provinces. Yet for all its flaws, the African National Congress has always preached non-racialism and tolerance. Mr Mandela's political life is being crowned by the inclusiveness with which he is attempting to embrace his people. That he may now be given the opportunity to put such principles into practice is a 20th century marvel, equivalent to the collapse of communism. To appreciate this, you have to remember the ethnic gradations formerly instilled in the consciousness of most young South African 'Europeans'. All whites, however ignorant, were at the top of a clear hierarchy. The mixed-race or 'coloured' community came next. They were followed by the Indians, who had arrived to work Natal's sugar plantations. The Africans came last. In 1948, when the Afrikaners won the election that kept them in government until yesterday, even liberal South Africans would argue solemnly about how many generations it would take to raise the lowest of these layers to the level of the highest. In liberal theory, the franchise would be offered to those who owned property, or had matriculated. Many proponents of apartheid believed that equality was biologically impossible. As a young reporter in Johannesburg I received calls from Mr Mandela, for example to plant the story that the buses to Alexandra township were to be boycotted or, later, to call the boycott's end. The supposedly illiterate township people received the first message, and walked. When the ANC declared victory over the bus company, they rode. Yet we had no non-white journalists on the paper. Bars were for white men only. We drank brandy and coke and talked of what we knew, of Afrikaner police who shot Africans for the sport of it. Even on the liberal Rand Daily Mail it was initially a revolutionary act to refer to blacks as 'Africans', rather than 'natives', or 'Bantu', or worse. Today everyone is a 'South African'. This simple fact should outweigh immediate forebodings of what might go wrong. Plenty will. The authoritarian instincts of certain ANC politicians are evident. To assume the new government will behave with democratic propriety would be worse than starry-eyed; it would be soppy. No one with common sense believes the living standards of most Africans can quickly be raised. The personal ambitions of several potential successors to Mr Mandela as the organisation's leader are as those of politicians everywhere. The outstanding virtue of the new South Africa, its renunciation of ethnicity, cannot be guaranteed. Yet the pursuit of ethnic harmony is an urgent task for the coming century. The most obvious, burning, example is in eastern Europe, with Russia itself a close second. Across the continent, there is a sniff of resurgent fascism. The US, in which discrimination is unconstitutional, still suffers the effect of slavery on black attitudes to the family. In Africa the awful slaughter in Rwanda is openly tribal. The government being elected in South Africa this week may disappoint its people, but it will do a service to the world if it demonstrates peaceful management of a heterogeneous society is possible.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / People: Movements in the beerage David Moffatt, finance director of Hanson Amalgamated Industries, has been appointed group finance director of Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer. The move underlines the acquisitive ambitions of Howard Hodgson, the entrepreneur who became Hoskins' largest shareholder and chief executive two months ago. Hodgson, who bought a 9.6 per cent stake in Hoskins from Barrie Hoar, the company's former chairman, said in August that he planned to embark on a series of acquisitions to expand into associated business areas. He used such tactics during the 1980s to expand his family firm of funeral directors into the UK's largest quoted funeral services company. Moffatt, 41, has worked for Hanson for the past seven years, having been employed previously by Imperial Group which Hanson acquired in 1986. According to Hodgson, Moffatt's 'experience, particularly in the field of acquisitions and operational control, will complement that of the rest of the Hoskins board'.</p>

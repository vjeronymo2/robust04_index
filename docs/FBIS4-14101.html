			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho negotiations, has  stated that the Palestinian and Israeli teams will go back to  their leaders for consultations on the subjects that have been  talked about and then meet once again to prepare the final  version of the agreement for implementing self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho.    Speaking at a news conference today, Sha'th said that it is  not possible now to set a final date for signing the agreement,  although the two sides are trying to deal with the issues left  from last week and want to finalize the negotiations by the end  of the week, if possible. The Palestinian official added: We  are working day and night to get it over with as soon as  possible.    Dr. Sha'th stated that 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo tomorrow  evening and will meet with President Husni Mubarak on Thursday  morning. He added that 'Arafat will hold talks with Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher.    Dr. Sha'th noted that he will represent President 'Arafat at  a small ceremony to be held at Cairo Airport in the presence of  Musa and Christopher to mark the arrival of the first group of  Palestinian police vehicles donated by the United States to the  Palestinians. There are 200 vehicles, he added. He pointed out  that the remaining vehicles will arrive at Port Said within two  weeks, noting that the first group, which will be transported by  air, will be available for use by the Palestinian police once  the agreement for implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord is signed.    Dr. Sha'th expressed the hope that during U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's visit to Egypt beginning tomorrow the  two sides will finalize all parts of the agreement, except for  two or three items that will be endorsed by President Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Sha'th  welcomed any effort made by the U.S. secretary of state during  his tour, saying: We welcome the role of the U.S. cosponsor in  promoting the negotiations.    Asked whether President 'Arafat will meet with the Israeli  Foreign Minister in Cairo, Dr. Sha'th said he did not know if  Peres will arrive in Cairo some time after tomorrow. If Peres  does arrive, he might meet with 'Arafat. However, such a  meeting has not been confirmed.    Dr. Sha'th said the two sides are working to find solutions,  clarify all matters, sign the agreement, and work out any  pending details. He said: We do not want to divulge the  details of the progress in the negotiations now. Perhaps all  details will be announced in two days. He added: We are trying  our best to finish the negotiations.    Dr. Sha'th indicated that he is "optimistic" by nature.  However, this is a very difficult process in which the  Palestinians are seeking justice.    Regarding the date the Palestinian police will enter Gaza  and  Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that some forces will begin their  duties after the signing of the agreement and that 6,000  Palestinian policemen will be deployed in the two areas one week  after the signing.    On the meeting between PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud  'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, and Chief Israeli Negotiator Gen. Amnon  Shahaq, Dr. Sha'th said the two sides reviewed the course of the  negotiations before Abu-Mazin left for Tunis today. He added  that Abu-Mazin could return to Cairo tomorrow with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat.    Dr. Sha'th said that a team of legal experts will revise the  items of the agreement in light of the Palestinian documents  next week. The team consists of Dr. George Sealam [name as  received], a U.S. professor of international law, and Dr. Mufid  Shihab and Dr. Salah 'Amir, two Egyptian professors of  international law.    On the criticism by [former chief Palestinian negotiator]  Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi of the current negotiations, Dr. Sha'th  said the PLO welcomes objective opposition within the democratic  framework serving the Palestinian people's cause. He added: We  respect Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi and appreciate his view. What we are  doing now is only a small step on a long road to achieving our  goals.</p>

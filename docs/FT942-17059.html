			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Fowler rejects referendum jibe: Party chief says Major will stay, whatever happens in local elections Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, yesterday sought to distance the prime minister from the outcome of the local elections, making clear that Mr John Major would stay in office regardless of the result. With backbenchers speculating that only an unexpectedly good performance could stave off a leadership challenge, Sir Norman flatly denied that the local elections on May 5 were a referendum on the prime minister's leadership. Sir Norman said that while Mr Major would play a leading role in the campaign for the local government elections, the referendum on the prime minister had taken place at the general election in 1992. Asked whether the prime minister's leading role in the campaign was not a high-risk strategy given poll evidence, Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, replied: 'One of the joys of John Major is that once he gets out among people, people recognise in him the kind of greatness and leadership which he gives us.' Downing Street said the results of the local elections would have no bearing on the future of the prime minister, who was said to be determined to remain in office and win the next general election. Sir Norman, speaking at a press conference to launch the Tory campaign for the local elections, was forced on to the defensive over questions that the party was demoralised. 'We are being told that we are going to do badly,' he said. 'We were told we were going to do badly in 1992 at the general election. We were written off. 'I am entirely content that people should take a sceptical view of our chances. We are going to fight these elections very hard indeed, as hard as we can. I very much hope - and I believe - we will have gains.' But Sir Norman resolutely refused to predict where he expected the Tories to make gains on May 5. Sir Norman said the party would fight the local elections as a choice between 'high-quality services at a value-for-money cost from Conservatives or expensive Lib-Labbery'. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, accused Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, of 'sunning themselves on the Mediterranean' instead of taking part in the Conservative campaign. Labour has also been careful to play down its chances of making big gains, stressing that their successes in the last round of local elections in 1990 represented a high mark in its vote in many boroughs. The last European elections were in 1989 when Conservatives were losing ground, but not on the scale of their defeats a year later when the council seats were last fought.</p>

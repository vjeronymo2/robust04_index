			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: All-round growth lifts GUS 9% to Pounds 213m Great Universal Stores, the mail order, retail, financial services and property group which recently enfranchised its shareholders, yesterday reported a 9.4 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits - underpinned by higher trading profits in all four main trading divisions. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 194.8m to Pounds 213.2m in the six months to September 30 on turnover ahead by 11.5 per cent to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.25bn). Earnings per share increased to 14.3p (12.9p) and the interim dividend is raised from 3.44p to 4p. Operating profits, including Pounds 28.6m (Pounds 27.5m) in net property rental income, increased by 16.6 per cent to Pounds 155.9m (Pounds 133.7m). Net interest receipts declined to Pounds 51.6m (Pounds 58.5m) resulting in an overall trading profit of Pounds 207.5m (Pounds 192.2m.) Profit on the sale of investments and property after professional fees of Pounds 2m for the capital reorganisation implemented in October, contributed a further Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.6m). The core home shopping division, which includes the Kays and Great Universal mail order catalogues, boosted trading profit by 22 per cent to Pounds 68.5m (Pounds 56.2m). That was achieved on turnover which jumped to Pounds 818.4m (Pounds 780.5m) reflecting a vol-ume increase, mainly in the UK. The Burberrys &amp; Scotch House division also performed well and lifted trading profit by 54 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 8.5m) on turnover up 20 per cent at Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 71.2m). The overseas retailing division made a modest increased contribution with operating profits rising by 10 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10m) on turnover of Pounds 88.2m (Pounds 83.3m). The consumer and corporate finance, banking and business information operations also performed well, lifting their trading profits to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 18.4m). Among these operations GUS said General Guarantee experienced strong demand for both consumer and corporate advances, particularly for cars and other vehicles. Rental income in the property division increased by 7.2 per cent from Pounds 25m to Pounds 26.8m despite the number of rent reviews being at a low point in the 5-year review cyle. The group generated a Pounds 140.7m positive underlying cash flow from trading activities during the first half and maintained a virtually ungeared balance sheet which included Pounds 1.12bn of cash at the end of September. COMMENT GUS's shares closed 9p down at 573p yesterday, perhaps reflecting some disappointment that following enfranchisement, there were no further developments on corporate structure. The results themselves were solid, in line with expectations, and reflect the benefits of the group's continuing investment in technology. Pre-tax profits this year should be about Pounds 510m producing earnings of about 33.7p per share. At current prices the shares are trading on a forward p/e of 17 and, despite a pronounced run over the past year, appear to have little downside risk.</p>

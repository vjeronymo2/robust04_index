			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Muslim Extremist Group in Perugia, </F> Police Says"]    [Text] Perugia, May 4 [ANSA] -- Anti-terrorist police units  in this north-central town on Tuesday [3 May] found two  apartments which they said were probably being used as support  bases for Algerian Muslim extremists of the Islamic Salvation  Front (ISF).    Police officials said about 15 people living in the two  apartments have been placed under investigation for falsifying  papers and receiving stolen goods after searches in the  apartments revealed false passports and identity cards and an  unspecified number of cellular telephones, car stereos, cameras  and other electronic equipment.    Also confiscated were Arab language newspapers and ISF  propaganda leaflets, as well as "dozens" of videocassettes  showing people wearing ski-masks and demonstrating how to use a  variety of weapons, police said.    The nationalities of those under investigation, most of them  between the ages of 20 and 25, were not revealed but  investigators said they did not believe the group was preparing  any attacks or engaging in paramilitary training.</p>

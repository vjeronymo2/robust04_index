			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 25 (MTI) -- The presidium of the  Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) has tendered its  resignation.    In its place, the KDNP National Board elected a smaller  interim presidium with a six-month mandate in Budapest today.    The National Board re-elected Laszlo Surjan as party  chairman.    In the May elections, the Christian Democrats won 22 seats  in  Hungary's 386-member parliament, corresponding to 5.7 per cent  of the mandates. Both the party leadership and the members were  dissatisfied with the result.    The mandate of the interim presidium will expire within 60  days after the municipal elections this autumn but not later  than on December 15.    Surjan told the press that the KDNP would hold a national  meeting in autumn to discuss the party's political renewal,  decide on structural changes, and revise the party rules.</p>

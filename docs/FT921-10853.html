			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Governors clash with Bush over growth DEMOCRATIC governors clashed yesterday with President George Bush, criticising the growth package he presented last week as inadequate to deal with the economic problems of their states. Governor Roy Romer of Colorado, chairman of the National Governors' Association, sharply attacked Mr Bush at a White House meeting yesterday for not cutting defence spending enough and for disguising the cost of his budget proposals with accounting gimmickry. Mr Romer also accused the president of presenting a partisan programme under a bipartisan veil. 'We're concerned about the budget that you've laid out, we're concerned that it does not provide the revenue to do what is anticipated there, and we're concerned that some of those may end up on our backs,' Mr Romer complained. Mr Bush also faced an onslaught from Governor George Sinner of North Dakota over the fair distribution of the burden of taxation. 'I think you could tax the wealthy a lot more, and the fact is that if we continue into this sewer of debt, our children and the families that are suffering today, that's nothing compared to what the family of tomorrow will suffer,' Governor Sinner said. Mr Bush will not unveil the details of his plan to reform health care until Thursday, but already came under attack from Governor Jim Florio of New Jersey. 'The approaches that are being offered by the White House will just compound the problems,' Mr Florio said. Mr Bush's budget also came under attack from Democrats in Congress, with Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, leading the onslaught. Mr Sasser complained that the administration's plan to cut Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27.6bn) from defence spending over the next five years represented an inadequate recognition that the Soviet Union had broken up. 'It would seem to many unbiased observers that the reward for peace is modest indeed,' Mr Sasser said. He said the Pentagon's plans for reducing its force structure from 18 to 12 active army divisions and from 10 to six reserve divisions had been devised at a time when the Soviet Union was fielding 190 ground divisions. But Mr Richard Cheney, the defence secretary, counter-attacked, demanding that Congress give him greater freedom to make the defence cuts he wanted instead of compelling him to buy equipment he did not want.</p>

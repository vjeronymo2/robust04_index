			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 19, BNS -- Russia will definitely not  be admitted to the Council of Europe [CE] before next year,  parliament Deputy Chairman Tunne Kelam told reporters today  after his return from Poland.    Kelam, who holds the post of CE Parliamentary Assembly vice  president, attended May 16-18 sessions of CE Parliamentary  Assembly committees in Warsaw.    The parliament deputy chairman affirmed at the news  conference that the session of the joint committee focused on  expansion of the Council of Europe. Three members of CE  Parliamentary Assembly start June 13 a fact-finding mission to  Russia to put together a report to the council on the situation  there. Kelam said the joint committee suggested the three be  accompanied by persons who are better informed about the state  of affairs in the former Soviet Union. "Attention must be paid  also to Ukraine, and Moldova, too, has applied for CE  membership," Kelam told reporters.    Kelam said the bureau of CE Parliamentary Assembly discussed  how Estonia has been fulfilling its obligations as a CE member.  He noted that, according to the report presented to the bureau,  Estonia has done its best. Besides, the country will most  probably ratify the European Human Rights Convention before the  end of the year, he added.    The Warsaw meeting approved a draft agenda for the upcoming  assembly session, which includes expansion of the Council of  Europe and its relations with the United Nations, as well as  reports by the leaders of several European states. "Also, during  the session Secretary General-elect Daniel Tarschys will assume  his post," Kelam noted.    During his stay in Poland Kelam met with the deputy chairman  of the Polish parliament to discuss setting up groups of friends  of Estonia and Poland in the two countries' legislatures.    On his way back from Warsaw the parliament deputy speaker  stopped over in Stockholm where he met with local Estonians.</p>

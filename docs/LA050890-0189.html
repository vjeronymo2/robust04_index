			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DRAKE FLUNKS AS EX-PLAYER SUES  </P> <P> Former basketball player Terrell Jackson has sued Drake University for fraud,  alleging the school reneged on a promise to provide him an education.  </P> <P> Jackson was recruited by former Coach Tom Abatemarco in 1988 after attending  several schools, including Minnesota and Cincinnati.  </P> <P> He quit the team this winter in a dispute that led to the resignation of  Abatemarco, now an assistant at Colorado.  </P> <P> Jackson, 22, seeks punitive and compensatory damages in a suit filed in Polk  County District Court that also accuses Drake of breach of contract, negligent  misrepresentation and violation of Jackson's civil rights.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleged Drake lured Jackson with promises of academic support to  complete his degree, then made it virtually impossible to receive an education.  The suit alleged the school, through Abatemarco and his staff, asked Jackson to  plagiarize term papers, urged him "to register for classes that detracted or  conflicted least from the basketball schedule and would provide high grades  essential to maintaining academic eligibility regardless of their academic  worth."  </P></p>

The Moslem formations appear to  be trying, without success, to provoke a major conflict and  blame it on the Serbs, the sources believe.    Moslems are attacking on many fronts throughout that former  Yugoslav republic, TANJUG learns from the Bosnian Serb Army.  Moslems are keeping under steady small arms and mortar fire the  Serb localities and positions in the area of Doboj in the north,  specifically at Gradacac and on Mts. Ozren and Vlasic.    Moslem assaults are continuing also in the east, in the area  of Gorazde and along the Drina River which forms the boundary  with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). Moslem artillery and  infantry have intensified operations against Foca in the  southeast and against Serb defence lines from the directions of  Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija in central Bosnia.    Bosnian Serb Army sources say that the latest Moslem  operations are an effort to link up the Moslem enclaves in  Bosnia and enlarge the territory under Moslem control  preparatory to linking up with Serbia's region of Raska  (Sanjak), where half the population is Moslem, and then with the  Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, where ethnic Albanians are  the majority population.</p>

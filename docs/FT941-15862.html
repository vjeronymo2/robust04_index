			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Cazenove man to head exchange: New chairman says market has 'no divine right to exist' Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at stockbrokers Cazenove, and newly-appointed chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has identified competition as the main challenge facing the City's central marketplace. 'The main challenge is the competitive element,' he said. 'We are all quite clear that, politically, competition is the name of the game and I have no quarrel with that as long as it is fair competition.' The stock exchange yesterday confirmed that Mr Kemp-Welch will become its chairman on July 14, following the retirement of Sir Andrew Hugh Smith. The exchange faces potential competition from companies such as Tradepoint, set up by a group of former exchange employees, and Reuters Instinet, which has already gained about 1 per cent of the business formerly transacted on the New York Stock Exchange. Unlike the exchange, they are not registered investment exchanges and, as designated service providers, are subject to less rigorous regulation. 'The stock exchange has no divine right to exist,' Mr Kemp-Welch said. 'It will only be dominant if it is efficient and cost effective.' He said that the exchange had much to learn from the US-based Nasdaq, which has become the world's second most active exchange after only 20 years. 'The lesson of Nasdaq is what can be achieved from a standing start if you can provide that efficient, cheap marketplace,' he said. Mr Kemp-Welch declined to elaborate on any plans to further reduce costs at the exchange and said that Sir Andrew deserved 'full marks' for having already achieved significant cost reductions. 'But there is always scope for further curbing costs,' he said. He said that another major task would be to ensure that the exchange's Seaq International system for trading international securities maintained its role as the dominant exchange for cross-border investment activities. He said that bringing Seaq into line with new European Union rules would be an important task. Mr Kemp-Welch will retire from Cazenove at the end of April. In addition to his role at Cazenove, he has been a non-executive director of the exchange and of several other companies including Savoy Hotel. He will become part of the new senior management team with Mr Michael Lawrence, the finance director of Prudential, who becomes chief executive on February 1. 'In an ideal world, the job will require one half-day each week. I will give it as much time as it needs,' Mr Kemp-Welch said. 'That could turn out to be a six or seven day a week job, but not all of every day.'</p>

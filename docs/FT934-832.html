			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking reverses early advance in shares - Market Report The widely predicted downward correction in UK equities started yesterday, triggered by a sharp fall in British government bonds and bond futures. The downturn in the second half of the equity session, which left the FT-SE 100 Index finally 22.5 off at 3,342.4, contrasted with a burst of strength at the market opening when the overnight ticker disclosed the traces of the substantial cash move into shares signalled in the equity futures markets on Monday. Equity traders, seeking out the identity of the overnight dealer, focused at first on reports that a large US investment bank had been involved. But it was later suggested that a London merchant banking and investment house might have been acting for a client in switching around Pounds 230m from UK gilts into equities. The aftermath of the trade continued to roll through the stock market yesterday afternoon. The Footsie jumped 13.7 to above 3,378 in early trading, but soon lost impetus as the market absorbed the big overnight trade. The announcement of a Pounds 767m deficit on Britain's non-EU trade in November had little impact at first, but weakness in equities increased as the gilt-edged market gave ground. Losses in gilts and, more significantly, in bond futures, began to cancel out early firmness in the March futures contract on the Footsie. A cooler trend in other European bourses, topped by a fall of 10 Dow points early in the new session on Wall Street, left London to move slowly towards the close of business. The final reading on the Footsie was just above the day's low, however, and traders saw yesterday's fall as little more than a very modest technical reaction after a successful market run. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slipped a mere 3.5 to 3,706.9, indicating that there had been little selling across the broader range of equities. Non-Footsie business made up around 64 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 756.1m shares. On Monday, Seaq volume of 748.9m shares returned Pounds 1.53bn in retail, or customer, business worth. The utilities sectors, which have been strong market leaders this month in response to higher dividend payments, fell back as the UK government spelled out its intentions to end the domestic monopoly for British Gas. Attention continued to focus on the consumer sectors, where investors hope to see evidence of a strengthening economy in the shape of higher Christmas spending in the shops. There was some support for the main line store groups, which have been lagging behind the market. Food retailers, however, suffered renewed fears that a price war could recommence. Profit-takers appeared among the banking and insurance stocks, although merchant banks, which are benefiting from booming securities markets, continued to attract buyers. Market analysts remained bullish for UK equities over the near and medium terms, with forecasts gathering towards the Footsie 3,600 area sometime in 1994; Strauss Turnbull yesterday set its mid-year target at 3,450 to 3,600. Confidence is based on expectations that base rates will be reduced again in the new year, although some analysts have begun to warn that rates could start rising again towards the end of the year - Strauss believes rates could return to 5 1/2 per cent at the end of 1994, after falling to 5 per cent earlier in the year.</p>

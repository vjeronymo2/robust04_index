			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BACK TO THE HYPE  </P> <P> Universal's got a lot riding on its big fall release "Back to the Future II" --  due out Nov. 22. The original "Back to the Future" (1985), you'll recall,  grossed over $200 million domestically. So promo for "II" is already upon us:  </P> <P> * Three impressive billboards -- two here, one in N.Y.C.'s Times Square -- are  up, with giant digital clocks counting back the hours until the film opens. (It  gets an early premiere Nov. 20 at the Universal City Cinemas to benefit Tripod,  a nonprofit organization for hearing-impaired children.)  </P> <P> * "BTTF II" digital desk clocks went out to the press back around Labor Day.  Other promotional tie-ins on tap: Futuristic sunglasses for $1.99 with certain  Pizza Hut orders; DeLorean car models (microsize $2.49, a radio-controlled car  for $49.99 and a battery-operated, drivable one for $159) from Toys 'R' Us,  which will also have T-shirts, baseball caps and a skateboard; and models of  futuristic Texaco gas stations based on one seen in the film -- offered at  Texaco stations, natch.  </P> <P> * An official "Back to the Future" fan club, run by the same folks who operate  the authorized Lucasfilm and "Star Trek" clubs. For $9.95, you get a magazine,  logo patch, photo and stickers.  </P> <P> * The novelization, with an initial print run of 400,000-plus copies, hit book  stores late last month. Sue Martin  </P></p>

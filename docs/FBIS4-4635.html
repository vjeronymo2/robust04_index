			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Chong Pyong-chin from Washington] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 2 April that the ROK and the  United States are prudently examining a method of not linking  the exchange of special envoys of the North and South to the  third round of high- level DPRK-U.S. talks. In the past, our  government had adhered to the position that the exchange of  special envoys is a precondition for holding the third round of  high-level DPRK-U.S. talks.    A high-ranking government official accompanying Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu to the United States to seek ways to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue said on 2 April: "In a  series of talks between high-ranking U.S. officials and Foreign  Minister Han, the United States presented such a proposal. In  this connection, our side said that we will prudently examine  this after consultations with our related ministries."    This official pointed out: "With the announcement of the  statement by the chairman of the UN Security Council [UNSC], the  North Korean nuclear issue will go from the level of ROK-U.S.,  North-South relations to the UN level of multi-faceted  consultations. Therefore, the United States felt that the  exchange of special envoys of the North and South should no  longer be a stumbling block to resolving the nuclear issue."    This official added: "During the discussions at the UNSC,  the Chinese side also indicated that since it will actively play  mediator so that North Korea can accept reinspection of its  nuclear facilities, the demand that the exchange of special  envoys be a precondition for the high-level DPRK-U.S. talks  should be withdrawn. Since the exchange of special envoys of the  North and South is one of the methods to guarantee North Korea's  nuclear transparency, if the nuclear transparency is guaranteed,  our government's view which regards the exchange of special  envoys as a prerequisite for the DPRK-U.S. talks, can be  reexamined."    In this connection, another high-ranking government official  said: "The North-South issue must be resolved at a higher  stage. If the nuclear issue is resolved, the exchange of special  envoys will also be realized naturally." He hinted that the  examination on not linking the exchange of special envoys to the  high-level DPRK-U.S. talks is being carried out positively.</p>

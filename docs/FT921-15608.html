			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe's airlines focus on cutting costs - Daniel Green assesses the improvement in the shares of Continental carriers This week's announcement of rising traffic volume and capacity for December by KLM, the Dutch airline quoted on the Amsterdam stock exchange, rounds off a year of improving prospects for many European air carriers. This has been reflected in the share price performance of some of the biggest carriers: KLM and Lufthansa strengthened steadily in the second half of 1991, both in nominal terms and against their local markets. The reason is that airline profits are cyclical. 'Historically, volume growth has picked up strongly during economic recoveries,' says Mr Mark Simpson, European airlines analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The business is capital-intensive and so profits are highly geared towards volume. This time, sector analysts believe a change in the way European airlines are run will add impetus to the turnround. 'Airline managements have focused on controlling costs as never before,' says Mr Simpson. The outlook for revenues, and the extent to which costs can be cut, vary from airline to airline. Staff cuts, for example, are easier at airlines with lower levels of state control. KLM is 34 per cent state owned and the shares have outperformed the local market by 62 per cent over one year. It has embarked on a cost-cutting strategy that aims to increase productivity by 23 per cent over three years. Furthermore, 80 per cent of its revenues come from long-haul flights, according to UBS. Such routes are more profitable than short-haul, have shown faster growth over recent years and are insulated from uncertainties over the speed and depth of European Community sponsored deregulation. In the short term, KLM's year-on-year growth statistics will look particularly good because the long-haul market slowed most during the Gulf war a year ago. Some of KLM's share price strength has been a consequence of discussions about a possible link with the UK's British Airways. Mr Tim Coombs at County NatWest believes the shares will do well in the long term even if the deal falls through, since KLM is likely to join forces with another airline anyway. Lufthansa is 51 per cent state owned; the shares have outperformed the local market by 34 per cent over a year. As with KLM, a high dependence on long-haul routes will lead to good year-on-year growth figures. Staff rationalisation may be more of a problem, at least until the German government gives up control. Although there are plans for privatisation, political and financial obstacles remain, such as links with the government pension scheme. Swissair, 20 per cent government owned, is less geared towards long-haul travel. The shares have performed in line with the local market over one year. 'There is also uncertainty over how Switzerland will participate in European liberalisation of air transport,' says Mr Coombs. Its relationship with Delta, with which it has 5 per cent cross-shareholdings, has become uncertain since Delta bought Pan Am's Frankfurt operations. 'Delta might set up a European hub in Frankfurt which could damage Swissair's plans for feeder routes for Delta's transatlantic flights,' adds Mr Coombs. DDL is the Danish partner in SAS and 50 per cent held by the Danish government. Alitalia is 85 per cent owned by the Italian government. Both are heavily dependent on short-haul routes and management flexibility is limited by the public sector stakes. Alitalia shares underperformed by 14 per cent over 12 months and DDL's by 10 per cent over the same period. There is still some scope for further share price rises across the industry: KLM, for example, is trading below its price two years ago. Much depends on whether the cyclical recovery in volume expected for 1992 is enough to outweigh overcapacity on some routes. If it is, that would set the scene for fatter margins in 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on </F> 24 January; place not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the most compassionate and the  merciful. My dear countrymen, peace be upon you. At the time  of the establishment of Pakistan, the founder of Pakistan, the  great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah said Kashmir is the jugular  vein of Pakistan. Ever since independence day, the hearts of  the Pakistani people are with the people of Kashmir till today.  The settlement of the Kashmir issue in accordance with UN  resolutions for the Kashmiri people has been the cornerstone of  our foreign policy.    Announcing my priorities after being elected prime minister,  I described the settlement of the Kashmir issue as my foremost  priority. Only a day after taking my oath as prime minister, I  went to Cyprus in order to hold discussions with the  Commonwealth leaders on the Kashmir problem. During my minor  pilgrimage to Mecca, I drew the attention of the rulers of Saudi  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates toward Indian atrocities in  Kashmir. The Kashmir problem remained a priority for the  government even during my visits to Iran, Turkey, China, and  Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Thank God the world is  getting apprised of the human rights violations in Jammu and  Kashmir. India, until now, has not refrained from using every  inhuman machination to crush the Kashmiri people's movement. We  initiated a dialogue with India to bring home our stand to the  world. The objective of the dialogue was to find a solution to  Kashmir issue by peaceful means, not by violence, and in  accordance with the UN resolutions. We hoped India would lessen  tyranny and repression in occupied Kashmir, but, regrettably,  this was not done. As many as 50 innocent people were martyred  in Sopor only a day after the announcement of the start of the  new round of negotiations. The announcement about the lifting  of the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine was not found to be  correct. Even today, Indian forces are present around this  sacred shrine and are destroying its sanctity. Despite  negotiations, Indian atrocities continue in occupied Jammu and  Kashmir. India's objective appears to be something different.  By staging the show of a dialogue, India wants to distract  international public opinion and attention from its atrocities  in order to crush the Kashmiri people's struggle free of  international pressure. This is not acceptable to Pakistan. We  cannot leave our Kashmiri brothers and sisters alone nor can we  allow the intensification of repression under the cover of  negotiations. India will have to end tyranny and repression in  the Kashmir Valley to prove its sincerity. Negotiations will  remain devoid of any results until the number of Indian troops  in the Kashmir Valley is reduced, until innocent Kashmiris are  released from Indian jails, and until international human rights  organizations are allowed to go into Kashmir.    My dear countrymen, we will continue the process of  mobilizing international public opinion against India's  continued atrocities against our Kashmiri brethren. Pakistan  will identify human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir at  the UN Human Rights Commission. I, myself, will put forward  Kashmir's case at the Human Rights Commission on 1 February.  The objective of our efforts is to mobilize international  public opinion and to awaken the international conscience. We  know that international public opinion adopts double standards  on certain occasions. The world community has not been able to  take any effective step in connection with Bosnia; and even in  case of Kashmir, the world's record is not that good. We,  however, have to continue our political, diplomatic, and moral  efforts in this changing world. We are confident that these  efforts will ultimately be crowned with success and the  Kashmiris will definitely achieve their right of  self-determination, God willing. We know that nobody can crush  the spirit of freedom.    When the Indian foreign secretary came to Pakistan, I told  him that negotiations with us will be fruitful only when India  is ready to find a political solution to the Kashmir problem;  but Kashmir is presently burning. The Kashmiris are being  massacred indiscriminately. As soon as the Kashmiri people  adopted the path of struggle to achieve freedom from Indian  subjugation, a reign of terror was let loose against them.  Youths, children, and the aged are being made targets of  violence. They are being made the targets of bullets in spite  of the fact that they are unarmed.    Women are molested and thousands of innocent people are put  behind bars. May I ask what is their fault? Their only fault  is that they demand the right of a plebiscite. Giving them the  right of plebiscite was decided by the United Nations as far  back as 1948. Both India and Pakistan are committed to this  decision. India has deployed 600,000 troops in the Kashmir  valley to deny the Kashmiris the right of a plebiscite. Two  more divisions are now being sent there. After all, how many  more troops will they send there? When the United States could  not control Vietnam by its forces; when the Soviet Union could  not control Afghanistan; how can India overcome the Kashmiri  fighters? India cannot hide its failures by raising a new iron  curtain [preceding two words in English] in the new world.  Amnesty International, Asia Watch, Physicians for Human Rights,  International Federation for Human Rights are only a few  organizations who have provided documentary proof of the Indian  atrocities. Members of Parliament of various countries have  raised their voice against the human rights violations in  Kashmir. These voices are getting louder with the passage of  time.    We will also raise our voice in unison with the Kashmiri  people's voice to carry forward their movement. The Kashmiri  people's anguish is our anguish. Their struggle is our  struggle. To express solidarity with this struggle is our  obligation as well as our right in accordance with international  law. We constituted the National Assembly's Committee on  Kashmir to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people's  struggle and to draw the attention of international public  opinion to the Kashmir issue. All political parties are  represented in this committee, which is a proof that the  Pakistani nation has complete ideological solidarity on the  Kashmir issue. The committee is headed by the veteran  politician, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, whose political experience  is a treasure for all of us. The National Assembly's Committee  on Kashmir has decided that a total strike will be observed in  Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir on 5  February. The Government of Pakistan fully supports this  decision. While supporting this call, I appeal to the people of  Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir to  observe a protest strike on 5 February. This strike will  provide proof that the Kashmiri people want to settle the  Kashmir issue through a plebiscite in accordance with UN  resolutions.    Kashmir is a jugular vein of Pakistan, and we will not allow  our jugular vein to be trampled upon by brute force. The 5  February strike will show to the world that the people of  Pakistan and our Kashmir brothers and sisters are inseparable  nations. The present democratic government considers Kashmir  not only a part of Pakistan's history, but also its heritage.  The people's government has the same stand on Kashmir as that  of the founder of Pakistan, Great Leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah,  and as that of the people's leader -- Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The  people are aware that in the past the people's leader, Zulfiqar  Ali Bhutto, had infused new life into this issue and highlighted  it at the international level. I will move forward with your  help, taking with me the mission [preceding word in English] of  these two personalities. I as a mother, sister, and daughter  understand the sorrow of every mother, sister, and daughter of  Kashmir and offer prayers for the success of every father,  brother, and son of Kashmir. I want to assure the Kashmiri  brothers and sisters that the people's government considers the  freedom of Kashmir a sacred duty. We want every Muslim of this  soil to live an honorable and free life. A Muslim, whether from  Bosnia, Palestine, or Kashmir, does not live a complete life  without freedom. Today every Muslim wants to see Kashmir  independent and, God willing, that day is not far when Kashmir  will be with us. I want to assure all of you that whatever  happens, no power on earth can prevent us from extending moral,  diplomatic, and political support to the Kashmiris in their  movement. The blood of martyrs is proof that we will not  deviate from this pledge.    Long Live Pakistan.</p>

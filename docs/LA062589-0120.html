			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: A FEW TIPS FOR ENTERING NEW WORLD  </P> <P> Boys and girls, men and women, guys and dolls, straights and gays, people of  color and bland people, abled people, disabled people and those too lazy to  work for a living, amigos and bubbelehs, artsy types and rip-off artists,  avowed communists and Satanic cultists, atheists and crystal healers, feminists  and misogynists, libertarians and vegetarians, computer hackers and hack  writers, trendies and nerds, Deadheads and skinheads, sadists, masochists and  those caught in the middle:  </P> <P> Here in the United States, diversity is our most important product. We used to  make cars and clothes and steel, but now we leave that to other, less  interesting people.  </P> <P> You have asked me to speak today because you hope I will help you make sense of  the world. You hope I will use wit and humor, yet make a meaningful point. But  I will not use wit and humor, and I will not make sense of the world. My point  here is that betrayal is a basic fact of life.  </P> <P> You have heard a lot about how my generation from the '60s is different from  your generation in the '80s, how we wanted to save the Earth while you only  want to save yourselves. Some of you were burdened by your parents with names  like Sunshine and Rainbow and Jennifer that you've had to change to John and  Jim and Jenny P.  </P> <P> Well, I'm here to tell you it's OK. I want to validate your existence. I'll  also validate your parking without violating your space.  </P> <P> As a graduate of this high school, you have earned the right to call yourself a  high school graduate, with all the rights and prestige that infers. But with  rights come responsibilities. In a few years, you will be old enough to drink  -- but will it still taste as good? Soon, you will be able to cross state lines  -- but can you think of a reason why? Soon, you will get to vote for the people  who run this country. Then you can share in that great democratic experience  known as regret.  </P> <P> As you go forth, you are probably worried about the spread of sexually  transmitted diseases. And if you weren't worried about it, we have tried our  best to remind you of it every day these past four years.  </P> <P> In my generation, we believed in sexual liberation. "Make love, not war" --  that was our slogan. We had festivals and human be-ins where people danced  uninhibitedly in nothing but their head bands and love beads. But it wasn't  really that great. Some of them had terrible bodies, and were really awful  dancers. So don't feel you missed anything. Technology has provided safe  alternatives for your generation, such as phone machines, computers and good  fax.  </P> <P> After graduation, some of you will enter college. Others will enter the  economy. And some of you will refuse to leave your room.  </P> <P> Those who go quietly will find a time of peace and prosperity, but there are  uncertainties in the economy. Some of you are probably wondering where to put  your money should you be fortunate enough to earn any. I would recommend a  balanced portfolio -- some blue chip stocks, a mutual fund, a small amount of  cash and a few close friends in Tokyo.  </P> <P> I know that graduation speakers are supposed to exhort the young to solve the  problems of their time. So I would encourage you to make sacrifices, to forgo  personal wealth, to have a career in public service -- to be the next Jim  Wright or John Tower.  </P> <P> Now, I hope I haven't left you with the impression that I'm negative about the  future. Actually, I feel the future looks much brighter because you are in it.  If my generation taught me anything, it's this: Beware of world savers. Also,  don't follow leaders, and look out for parking meters.  </P> <P> Those of you who were named Dylan will know what I'm talking about.  </P> <P> What I do hope is that each of you will find yourself a little job, get  yourself a little place to call home and find somebody to love. It really isn't  all that complicated. Then you'll wake up and hear the birds singing and see  the sun rising and smell the roses blooming. Create your own world and you'll  have one worth saving.  </P></p>

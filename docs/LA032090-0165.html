			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BARTY TO PAY; CLAIMS VICTORY  </P> <P> Actor Billy Barty claimed a victory even though a county Small Claims Court  judge ordered him to pay one of his former writers $1,328.  </P> <P> Barty said he considered Monday's decision a win because he didn't have to  award 10% of future syndication profits for his show, "Short Ribbs," to  writer-producer Bill Winckler.  </P> <P> "It went fine, it went very good, I was very pleased at the judge's decision,"  Barty said by phone after he was ordered to pay Winckler $1,300 in disputed  salary and $28 in court costs. Laughing about the stir the case caused, Barty  added that the publicity hadn't hurt his career. "This has gotten about as much  publicity as Zsa Zsa and I didn't even slap anybody," Barty said. "But I  wouldn't slap anybody. I'd hit them in the knee."  </P> <P> Winckler, who had sued Barty for $2,000, said he was satisfied.  </P> <P> Thirteen episodes of "Short Ribbs," described as a "Saturday Night Live" for  "little people," aired on Orange County-based cable station KDOC last fall.  </P></p>

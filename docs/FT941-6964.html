			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / How to Spend It: Tiles re-emerge Decorative tiles have been somewhat out of favour in the last few years  - not grand enough for the Baroque school of decorating and much too sweetly pretty for the minimalists. They must be due for a revival. Marlborough Tiles is a small company making high-quality ceramic tiles which are widely stocked throughout the UK. Those whose tastes run to the rustic and charming can choose the pretty florals whilst those who prefer a little wit can go for the trompe l'oeil (plates, teapots, tureens, jugs). The panels are sold in sets - the trompe l'oeil plate, for instance, takes four tiles and would cost Pounds 17.63. The hyacinth panel needs nine tiles and costs Pounds 52.88. They can be used as panels in work-tops or splashbacks. Marlborough Tiles is at Elcot Lane, Marlborough, Wiltshire SN8 2AY. Ring 0672-512422 for stockists or to place orders.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis to Aid Public Comment on the Provisionally Accepted Consent Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'') has accepted, for public comment, from Kiwi Brands Inc. (``Kiwi'') and Sara Lee Corporation (``Sara Lee'') an agreement containing consent order. This agreement has been placed on the public record for thirty days for reception of comments from interested persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After thirty days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's investigation of this matter concerns Sara Lee's and Kiwi's 1987 acquisition of the ``Esquire'' brand of chemical shoe care products and related assets from Knomark, Inc., then a subsidiary of Papercraft Corporation, and Sara Lee's and Kiwi's 1991 acquisition of the ``Griffin'' brand of chemical shoe care products and related assets from Reckitt &amp; Colman.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agreement containing consent order would, if finally accepted by the Commission, settle charges alleged in the Commission's complaint that the acquisitions substantially lessened competition in the sale in the United States of chemical shoe care products used in the maintenance, cleaning, and protection of shoes, through grocery stores, drug stores, and mass merchandisers, sometimes referred to as the mass market channel, and that Sara Lee undertook the acquisitions with the intention and effect of restraining, lessening, or eliminating competition, or acquiring or maintaining market power in the same market. The Commission's complaint further alleges that the acquisitions had and will have anticompetitive effects and that, in making the acquisitions, Sara Lee and Kiwi violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order accepted for public comment contains provisions that would require that Sara Lee and Kiwi divest the ``Esquire'' and ``Griffin'' brand names and related assets to Hickory Industries, Inc., within one month of the date the order becomes final. If the transaction with Hickory Industries, Inc., is not consummated within one month of the date the order becomes final, then the order would require Sara Lee and Kiwi to divest the Esquire and Griffin assets to an acquirer that receives the prior approval of the Commission and in a manner approved by the Commission within twelve months of the date the order becomes final. The purpose of the divestiture is to assure the continuing use of the Esquire and Griffin assets in an ongoing, independent, viable operation engaged in the sale of chemical shoe care products in the United States, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from each of the acquisitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If Sara Lee and Kiwi do not divest the Esquire and Griffin assets within the time periods described above, the Commission would be entitled to appoint a trustee to effect the divestiture of the Esquire and Griffin assets to an acquirer or acquirers approved by the Commission and in a manner approved by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a period of ten years from the date the order becomes final, the order would also prohibit Kiwi and Sara Lee from acquiring, without prior Commission approval, stock in or assets of an entity engaged in the manufacture of chemical shoe care products in the United States, or the distribution or sale of chemical shoe care products through the mass market in the United States. Acquisitions, for investment purposes only, of less than 1 percent of the outstanding stock of a publicly-traded company would be exempt from the prior approval provision. Acquisitions of certain assets valued at less than $100,000 would also be exempt from the prior approval provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For acquisitions of stock in or assets of an entity engaged in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of chemical shoe care products in the United States by Sara Lee or Kiwi for which prior approval would not otherwise be required by the order, the order would require that Sara Lee and Kiwi give notice to the Commission before consummating the acquisition. Acquisitions, for investment purposes only, of less than 1 percent of the outstanding stock of a publicly-traded company would be exempt from the prior notice provision, in addition to being exempt from the prior approval provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the consent order and any other aspect of the acquisition. This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify its terms in any way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

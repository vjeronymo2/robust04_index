			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (8): Global upturn must come first - Economy ANYONE glancing at the roaring Australian stockmarket might conclude that boom times are just around the corner, writes Nikki Tait. In reality, however, Australia is waiting anxiously for world economic growth to pick up - and finding that any marked improvement is slow to arrive. In some respects, Australia looks to be in better shape than bigger, recession-hit counterparts. Gross domestic output, which grew by an average annual rate of over three per cent in the 1980s before slumping badly in 1990-1 and 1991-2, recovered to a rate of 2.5 per cent in the last fiscal year. Government forecasts have suggested that a slightly higher percentage increase - 2.75 per cent - could be in view for the current 12 months, although some analysts view the figure as over-optimistc. Even on the pessimists' figures, however, Australia still stands ahead of Japan, West Germany or the UK, and probably on a par with the US. In short, no rip-roaring boom, but conditions could be worse. Inflation - an Australian bugbear for most of the 1980s - has also ceased to be an immediate worry. Consumer prices rose by a miserly 0.3 per cent last year, one of the lowest price rises seen in the industrialised world. This figure, admittedly, has already increased; the September consumer price index suggested a 2.2 per cent increase, year-on-year. It will jump further as a result of indirect tax increases in the government's latest budget. But the underlying inflation remains subdued. In spite of these fairly positive trends, however, the economy still faces a couple of big problems. For a start, the growth which is occurring generally owes more to public sector spending than private sector investment. Interest rates may be at their lowest levels for over a decade, but according to a recent survey by Commonwealth Bank, published in the late summer: 'Since the peak in business investment in the September quarter of 1989, private expenditure on plant and equipment has fallen by about 32 per cent, while non-dwelling construction has declined by around 44 per cent'. Meanwhile, retail sales remain weak, with September's value only 0.8 per cent higher than in August and volumes down 0.6 per cent. And, while there were signs of a strong, double-digit surge in both new car registrations and in housing finance in September, most pundits interpreted these numbers as a fluke - probably inflated by customers nervous about possible fiscal changes. It is true that Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, has outlined a strategy which should reduce the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-7, or ADollars 5.8bn. But not everyone agrees that this aim is achievable. The government's heavy reliance on indirect tax rises to fund its promised tax cuts has prompted debate over the eventual implications for inflation and growth. As Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac Bank, puts it: 'We believe the government's growth forecasts are, on average, too optimistic and expect that, for no other policy changes, the 'target deficit', will be missed by Dollars 2-Dollars 3bn, or 0.5 per cent of GDP.' Perhaps the biggest headache - especially for a Labor government which is still closely bound to the union movement - is how to tackle the high levels of unemployment which persist at present without throwing the deficit reduction strategy way off course. The unemployment rate is stuck in double-digit figures - although it did edge down from 11.1 per cent to 10.9 per cent in September. However, few economists think that it will drop significantly in the near-future. In part, this pessimism stems from the industrial restructuring, which has followed the reduction in Australia's protectionist tariff barriers. Jobs losses have been most marked in some of the 'old' manufacturing sectors, while self-employment has actually risen. In the long-term, there are hopes that a balance may be struck: that the growth of higher value-added, export-oriented industries, and a more entrepreneurial breed of small businesses - supplying 'outsourced' services, for example - will mop up some of the labour surplus. For the moment, however, dislocation is the order of the day. All that said, a couple of brighter spots shine through these clouds. First, the corporate sector has been undergoing a cathartic overhaul. This has been spurred partly by recession, partly by the need to address overstretched balance sheets, and partly by broader political decisions, such as the tariff changes. In the main, this has reduced, rather than added, jobs and brought little net new investment. But it has produced a significant upturn in profitability. According to the Australian Financial Review, net profits from 500 listed companies whose financial year ended on June 30, rose by 98 per cent. Sales, by contrast, grew by only 4.5 per cent. Secondly, there has been a marked difference in economic performance between the different states and territories. Western Australia and Queensland have been well ahead of the pack, while growth in New South Wales has lagged the national average. This is usually attributed to the resource-based activity in the former two states, and the presence of more traditional (and hitherto protected) manfacturing operations on the east coast. But at the end of the day, some meaningful improvement in economies of the country's leading trading partners, such as Japan, looks neccessary before Australia enjoys any real lift. Many analysts caution that this could be slow to develop, and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Ecnomics has recently forecast a further three per cent fall in commodity prices in 1993-4, although a tumbling exchange rate could leave them higher in Australian dollar terms. All this may change by 1994-5. But, as one analyst has concluded: 'The issue is whether the Budget strategy can deliver enough economic growth in the short-term to enable Australia to hitch a ride on the upcoming locomotive of world economic growth.'</p>

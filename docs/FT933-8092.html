			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / US may brand Sudan as terrorist state MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is preparing to place Sudan on the US list of states accused of sponsoring terrorism, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. An announcement could come as soon as today, they said. The US has been increasingly concerned about Sudan's ties to Iran and radical groups and this is to be the basis of Mr Christopher's decision, the officials said. But the determination also comes after an ABC Television report on Monday that US intelligence officials believe top government officials of Sudan were involved in a plot earlier this year to blow up the United Nations, FBI headquarters and two tunnels in New York. Citing intelligence sources, ABC television news said federal agents, after monitoring Sudan's mission to the UN for two months and from other evidence, felt the government of Sudan was involved in the alleged plot last June. The ABC report named two Sudanese intelligence officers as the link between Sudan and the alleged plot. The report said US officials believed the men helped five other Sudanese residents of the US who were indicted in the bombing conspiracy. There is no evidence that Sudan's ambassador to the UN, Mr Ahmed Suliman, was involved, the ABC report said. Mr Suliman in June denied that the mission had anything to do with the planned bombings in New York, and said that terrorism was 'alien' to his country. Mr Christopher was 'expected to make an announcement about his decision within a matter of days,' a State Department official said. Another official said Mr Christopher was 'preparing to conduct the necessary notification of foreign governments and members of Congress' that Sudan has been placed on the terrorism list.</p>

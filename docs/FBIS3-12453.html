			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to unidentified </F> correpondents, followed by questions and answers, in Algiers on  28 February--recorded]    [Excerpts] The brother president, Abu Ammar [Yasir  'Arafat], was received this afternoon by His Excellency Algerian  President Liamine Zeroual at the palace of the republic. The  meeting was attended on the Algerian side by Foreign Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri; Mr. Ahmed Ouyahia, secretary of state for  Maghreb affairs; Mr. Hedi Messaoudi, head of the Arab Affairs  Department at the Foreign Ministry. It was attended on the  Palestinian side by brothers Nabil Sha'th, Nasr Yusuf, and Hakam  Bal'awi, members of the Fatah Central Committee; and the  ambassador of the State of Palestine in Algiers.    After his meeting with His Excellency Algerian President  Liamine Zeroual, the brother President Abu Ammar made the  following statement to reporters:    ['Arafat] I put the president in the picture about the great  conspiracy that took place in the form of the hideous massacre  of our worshippers who were performing the dawn prayers inside  the holy al-Ibrahim mosque and also about the collusion and the  conspiracy in which elements of the Israeli Army and armed  settlers were involved.    This reminds us exactly of what happened between the French  Secret Army Organization and the Algerian settlers, as if  history were repeating itself in both Algeria and in Palestine.  I asked the president for Algeria's support in the Security  Council and in international circles in order to confront this  hideous conspiracy, which is an attempt to obstruct the peace  process and the Israeli withdrawal from our land and our homes.    It is obvious that this conspiracy had many objectives. It  aimed at undermining the safety of the Palestinian national.  Hence, our insistence at the Security Council on rapid  international protection for the Palestinian people, for our  children, our women, and our Islamic and Christian holy places.  I would like to remind everyone that this is the second  massacre inside our holy places. Let me remind you of the  massacre which occurred inside al-Aqsa mosque in holy Jerusalem  some time ago, and now this massacre in al-Ibrahim mosque in  Hebron, in addition to other Islamic and Christian holy places.    Therefore we asked at the Security Council--we insist on  it--for an international commission to investigate the crime and  for the dispatch of international troops to protect our people  from these conspiracies in which elements and units of the  Israeli Army are involved with armed settlers. This has now  become of paramount importance.    I also put the president in the picture about the atmosphere  which is ablaze inside our occupied land. There is a sweeping  revolution and there are continuous clashes between us and the  Israeli Army and also between us and Israeli settlers. It is  noticeable, as is clear on all TV networks, that the patrols  walking the streets are from the Israeli Army and Israeli  settlers. On this very point, I would like to make clear that  the Israeli cabinet meeting produced only empty words, and it  would be appropriate to quote the saying, what a great to-do  with precious little to show for it. It was nothing more than  that.    Therefore, I call on the world community, the Russian and  U.S. peace conference co-sponsors, the European Union and all of  the European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states,  and the Arab countries to assume their responsibility to protect  the Palestinian people and to force the Israeli Government to  withdraw immediately from our Palestinian territories, starting  with Gaza and Jericho and followed by the remainder of our  occupied territories so that we can effectively establish our  independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its  capital. God willing, this will happen soon. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is the fate of peace  after this massacre?    ['Arafat] Undoubtedly it should be clear, and I am  addressing  this talk to the whole world and the Russian and U.S. peace  conference co-sponsors, that peace is blowing in the wind. It  is clear that the Israeli side has no intention to be committed  to what they have signed, and there is an attempt to evade the  deadlines and the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.    [Correspondent] What are the decisions made yesterday after  the meeting... ['Arafat, interrupting] In fact, we still  are [pauses]... I have come only to brief the president and go  back to continue the meeting today because the matter is serious  and we are discussing all of its aspects.    [Correspondent] What is your stance, especially after the  withdrawal of some countries from the peace talks, Syria and  Lebanon, for example?    [Unidentified person to 'Arafat] Syria and Lebanon announced  the withdrawal of their delegations from Washington today.    ['Arafat] It is the same story, I have withdrawn all of the  delegations, not only from Washington--my brother Nabil Sha'th  from Taba, and Cairo and from Paris. We are convening all of  the delegations, and I am going back [not further clarified]  because all of the delegations are meeting now. That is to say,  yesterday and today I have been meeting my brother heads of  delegations to Washington, Taba, Paris, and Cairo to look into  all details of this situation in the light of the developments  and this massacre which is not only a massacre: It is a massacre  and a conspiracy, an organized operation exactly like you have  experienced in Algeria between the Secret Army Organization and  the French settlers.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Tokyo's hotels adjust to the one-cent yen THE SIGNBOARD at the wood-panelled foreign exchange counter of Tokyo's Imperial Hotel yesterday told the whole story. Those with dollars to sell would get just Y99.75 per greenback. For the first time, the yen was worth more than a US cent. According to Mr Akihisa Inaba, a manager at the hotel: 'Many Americans came to look, but when they saw the board they just shook their heads and said 'No, not today'.' Whether next week will be any better remains to be resolved between the country's new coalition government and the currency speculators who are punting on wholesale rates for the dollar breaking Y100 and going even lower. Japanese officials are trying to talk down the yen as car makers and others tremble at the impact of its appreciation on exports. But those feeling it first are in the hotel lobbies. As the Imperial's cashier gestured obligingly for photographers capturing the unprecedented exchange rate on the board behind her, one American businessman muttered while he checked out, counting out small change: 'I don't know why I carried around all this stuff.' Another visitor put him right on the value of the lightweight aluminium coinage, which Japanese in an otherwise tip-free society happily discard into jars beside cash registers in convenience stores. 'Listen, when I got here last week I ignored it too. Now it stays in my purse because I know it's worth something.' American tourists have not been easily deterred by the strength of the yen in recent years, and the number visiting the country as holidaymakers last year grew by nearly 3 per cent to reach almost 300,000. Their habits are becoming more frugal, however. On their way to witness a tea ceremony at the Imperial, Mrs Rachelle Levy and her son Frank from Des Moines, Iowa, sought refreshment at a pavement vending machine which dispensed a can of Coke for a bearable Y110, rather higher than the Midwest going rate, but about a fifth of Tokyo hotel prices. 'It contributes to an inferiority complex if you can't buy things as easily as in your own country,' said Mr Levy. 'You feel a bit second-class.' The only advantage, according to his mother, is that a rate of Y100 to the dollar 'makes things easier to work out - we've been computing on that basis anyway.' The basis on which the Imperial Hotel computes has been thrown a bit by the latest surge in the yen. Just under 10 per cent of its guests are Americans, most of whom are on business and are not spending their own money. But at Y33,000 a night for a room and occupancy dropping anyway because of the economic downturn at home, 'we assume this year there will be fewer autumn bookings from abroad,' says Mr Inaba. 'We are thinking what to do about it.'</p>

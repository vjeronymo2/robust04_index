			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry said here today there is no sense of  imminent military crisis in the Korean peninsula.    "In my judgment," Perry said at a Pentagon news briefing,  "there is no military crisis at this point between the United  States and South Korea on one hand and North Korea on the other  hand."    He described the political situation in the Korean peninsula  as "a very serious problem." "But we are pursuing that not with  military options but with diplomatic options," Perry added.    However, he claimed that "we will make and are making  prudent  and appropriate defensive precautions, but we will do them in a  careful way."    The United States has decided to move forward the deployment  date of Patriot missiles in South Korea. The Patriots will be  in South Korea and deployed in about a month.    "Our rationale for moving the timing up was not because we  thought there was an imminent danger," Perry explained, "but  because we were concerned that with the way the political  developments were going and that there might be a confrontation  point or a crisis point later in the year."    The secretary said the United States is monitoring this  situation very carefully and consulting extensively with South  Korea about any defensive measures needed.    "If and when the United Nations decides to authorize  sanctions" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  Perry claimed, "at that time we will certainly want to increase  the defensive measures."    Perry announced that he will travel to South Korea next  month  to discuss "a number of short-term measures" that are being  taken to improve the readiness of the 34,000 U.S. forces  stationed in South Korea.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pursuing the guidelines of the government  antinarcotics policy in 1992 and 1993, the Armed Forces and the  National Police [PNP] seized 17 tonnes of drugs, worth over $100  million.    In drug enforcement operations during the first two months  of  this year alone, 4,369 kg of drugs, including cocaine paste and  cocaine hydrochloride, have been seized.    The Armed Forces had sole responsibility for the struggle  against terrorism until 1991, while the PNP were responsible for  drug enforcement.    This situation changed in 1992 when President Alberto  Fujimori's administration stated that the Armed Forces and the  PNP, under a single command, would handle the planning,  implementation, and supervision of drug enforcement to increase  efficiency.    According to a report by the Interior Ministry and the Joint  Command, 8,000 kg of narcotics, including 595 kg of cocaine  hydrochloride and 7,471 kg of cocaine paste, were seized in  1992. Additionally, 185,895 kg of chemicals used to process  drugs were destroyed.    Joint military-police operations in 1993 were crushing:  8,432  kg of cocaine paste and 441 kg of cocaine hydrochloride--as well  as 90 metric tons of chemicals, including sulfuric acid and  sodium carbonate--were seized.    The success of the antinarcotic strategy during the first  two  months of this year is undeniable because 3,733 kg of cocaine  paste, 6 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 31 metric tons of  chemicals have been seized. Some 99 percent of this was seized  in a single operation two weeks ago in the Boca Manu-Madre de  Dios area.    The National Customs Superintendency Antinarcotics Brigade  represents another significant pillar of drug enforcement in  Peru, seizing 822 kg of narcotics between 1990 and 1993. In  1993, this special unit seized 293 kg of cocaine hydrochloride,  24 kg of cocaine paste, and 400 kg of chemicals.    It must also be mentioned that cocaine hydrochloride is  worth  $75,000 per kg and cocaine paste is worth $1,500 per kg on the  international market.    The drugs seized in 1992-93 by the Armed Forces and the  PNP--16,000.879 kg--is worth about $100 million.    The PNP Antinarcotics Directorate reported that 3,180  operations were carried out and 4,195 traffickers were captured  in 1992. In 1993, 5,000 traffickers were arrested during 3,640  operations.    The Air Force intercepted 34 small planes used by  trafficking  rings to carry drugs in 1992. In 1993, another 29 small planes  and 28 airstrips were seized.    Within the context of drug enforcement in Peru, 67 metric  tons of drugs have been burned during the past 13 years by the  Interior Ministry Executive Agency for Drug Control (OFECOD).    Of this, 12,000.054 kg of narcotics, including 11,191 kg of  cocaine paste, 537.400 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, and 325.850  kg of marijuana, were burned in 1993. This is the largest  quantity of drugs burned recently.    Additionally, 60,310 kg of cocaine paste, 2,554 kg of  cocaine  hydrochloride, 4,696 kg of marijuana, 26 kg of opium, and 7 kg  of poppy, among other drugs, were burned between 1981 and 1993.  The smallest quantity of drugs, involving barely 1,441 kg, were  burned in 1987. Of this, 1,125 kg was cocaine paste, 5 kg  cocaine hydrochloride, and 311 kg marijuana.</p>

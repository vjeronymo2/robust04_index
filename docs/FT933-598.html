			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Innovation in a cut-throat world  -Nikki Tait finds out how Gillette emerged a little better than the rest TO most people, Gillette is a quintessential consumer products business which, by implication, ought to be obsessed with market shares and marketing strategies. It comes as a surprise, then, to find Mr Al Zeien, its chairman, drawing parallels with the pharmaceuticals sector, where product innovation rules. 'If you study a pharmaceuticals company,' he says, 'the chairman will show you all the bar charts, and say: 'Here is where we started out with drug XYZ 10 years ago', and it has a bar which runs into 1996. 'Here's a drug we introduced six years ago', and that runs into 1999. And so on. 'We're not that different. If you take our blade business, we introduced Trac-II in 1972 and we're still selling it, still adding capacity on a worldwide basis, although in the more developed markets, the tails are running down. It's a bar on the pharmaceuticals chart.' Mr Zeien can think of two products, already designed, which he knows will not be brought to the market by Boston-based Gillette until the latter half of the decade. He also mentions a research programme for a product that has a launch date after 2000. 'Now that doesn't sound like a packaged goods company, does it?' It doesn't, yet it is easy see why Gillette managers should be so keen to play up the product side of their business. Time and again, the capacity to produce timely innovations has rescued Gillette when problems loomed. The most recent instance was in the late 1980s. For decades, Gillette held a commanding position in the shaving equipment market, seeing off challenges from the likes of the UK's Wilkinson Sword, which pioneered a stainless steel blade in the 1960s. But in the 1980s sales of disposable razors - which are generally less profitable for manufacturers - exploded, due mainly to the efforts of France's Bic. Eventually, they came to account for over half the shaving market's turnover, compared with about one-fifth at the start of the decade. Gillette clung to a leading position in the disposables market, but its margins were squeezed. The company attracted the attention of predators: first, Mr Ronald Perelman, the Drexel-backed financier who took over cosmetics company Revlon, and then Coniston Partners, a New York-based investment outfit. In the process of seeing off these threats, Gillette bought out share stakes and took on about Dollars 2bn of extra debt. It also overhauled operations and axed some 2,400 jobs, about 8 per cent of the workforce. The company's salvation emerged from its UK research laboratories. Four years ago, Gillette launched its Sensor razor - a product which had been conceived years earlier and whose spring-mounted twin blades are designed to follow the shape of the face, producing a closer, more comfortable shave. Research, engineering and tooling cost around Dollars 200m; Gillette then wagered big-time, sinking the bulk of its advertising budget into the product. There is clear evidence that the gamble paid off. Sensor has taken about one-fifth of the US market, and can justly claim to have reversed the disposable sector's inroads. Equally important, the new razor has improved Gillette's margins: one analyst estimates that the first-quarter operating margin in the North Atlantic shaving products division was about 41 per cent this year, compared with 34 per cent in 1990. Gillette has since produced a 'Sensor For Women', and is rolling out an upgraded Sen-sorExcel product later this year. The refined SensorExcel adds a skin guard and incorporates an 'improved' handle, and will be launched in Europe. It will also sell at a useful 15 to 20 per cent premium to the basic Sensor. But the attempt to think along pharmaceutical industry lines - and concentrating on evolving product 'families' - has not just been a strategy for developed markets. Mr Tony Levy, vice-president of Gillette's international group, points out that the objective in less-developed countries now centres on buying into a market which is dominated by 'low-technology' blades, and then steadily pushing it towards more sophisticated (and higher margin) products. 'Plank one is to go from a low double-edged blade to a cartridge system, which is three or four times the price,' he says. Latin America is Mr Levy's favourite example. Back in the late 1970s, Gillette commanded over 80 per cent of the region's shaving equipment sales, but 92 per cent were in the form of double-edged blades. By 1992, he claims, double-edged blades were down to 32 per cent, and cartridges had risen to 68 per cent. The total market value, meanwhile, had increased from Dollars 192m to Dollars 586m. Mr Zeien may seem a little disingenuous, making so much of the product side of its business and emphasising the extent of the differentiation, just as consumer industries generally are under attack from own-label rivals. But he also notes that the emphasis on product development is supported by a complex management structure which has been in place for years. Gillette calls this 'matrix' management, a concept which was first developed at Braun, its German-based appliance subsidiary. Essentially, the idea is to split the development of a product category from the day-to-day marketing. 'We have strategic business units, which are responsible for the product lines,' explains Mr Zeien. 'That is, the product development, central marketing approach, and for the R&amp;D. And then the tactical marketing is done by geography.' In the blade business, for example, the product development side is headed by Mr Robert Murray, vice-president of the North Atlantic shaving and personal products group. But the 'actual tactical marketing and selling' in the US is the immediate responsibility of Mr Ronald Rossi, president of the North American division. There is little doubt among analysts that Gillette's approach has produced a core razors business which is well-run and highly successful. Last year, it accounted for about 38 per cent of Gillette's Dollars 5.2bn sales, but 68 per cent of group operating profits. What is more questionable is whether some of the company's past diversification moves - into toiletries, for example - have been equally suited to the same philosophy. Mr Zeien admits that there have been mishaps in the past, but he points out that the toiletries division has now been stripped down to five brands, compared with more than twice that 10 years ago. He sees no reason not to add another arm to the group, which already encompasses stationery products, the Oral-B toothcare division, Braun and cosmetics, as well as the core razors operations. Assuming, that is, that the right business can be found. 'We are not interested in businesses which are not susceptible to technical innovation, where products can't be differentiated. It would have to be a business which depends on capturing customers rather than selling products.'</p>

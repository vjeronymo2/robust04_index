			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Stereotyping Arab women Sir, I was taken aback by Bronwen Maddox's piece, 'Cairo women worlds apart from UN ideologues' (September 10). Her decision to visit two Cairo hair salons to cull opinion about women's reactions to the population conference gave her the same narrow view that she would have had in London or New York had she sought out women with 'coral-coloured nails' to match their coral dresses. This is not to say that personal appearance is unimportant, but surely we have moved beyond this stereotype by now? Egyptian women's participation in public life since the turn of the century and in the modern workforce for some 150 years is well-documented. Had she wished, she could have, as I have on my visits to Egypt, visited a university to meet women professors and department heads, a newspaper office to meet women journalists and editors, a farm to meet women agricultural labourers and owners, a factory to meet women workers, many companies to meet businesswomen and chief executives, and any government or UN office to meet national and international civil servants. Bronwen Maddox would not necessarily have found consensus about the population conference. But with all of these women she could have engaged in intelligent debate on the issues facing men and women in Egypt today, rather than imposing a one-dimensional view of women on herself and her readers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter from Slovak President Michal Kovac: "A Broader </F> Coalition--The Path to Stability"]    [Text] We carried in NARODNA OBRODA the full text of an  open letter from HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia]  officials and deputies to the president of the Slovak Republic  dated 8 January 1994. It raised objections to the idea  expressed by the president in his New Year address of forming a  broader coalition. Yesterday, a reply was delivered to our  editorial office. We are publishing the letter in full:    "I have read your open letter of 8 January 1994. I respect  your right to an opinion and to criticize the president's public  addresses. Nevertheless, I believe that it would have been  decent if you had asked me to answer your questions in a  personal letter to me, rather than in an open one, or if you had  invited me to a private meeting so that I could explain any  misunderstanding before you took a public stand.    It is not customary for a president to answer open letters  in  the press. I have decided to take this course because of the  particular significance of the problems that you presented in  your letter. In the meantime, other voices have been raised on  the same problems, accusing me of wanting to cast doubts on the  position and work of the government. This is utter nonsense and  the product of unfounded mistrust, which I must categorically  reject.    You yourselves ask several questions that seem to blend into  a single one: You ask me whether other parliamentary parties in  addition to the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party]--that  is, parties that do not have any credit for the establishment of  the Slovak Republic--should be represented in the coalition.  Let me recount several basic facts.    The results of the elections in June 1992 facilitated the  formation of a government purely on the basis of the program of  the HZDS and the SNS. This government had the support in the  Slovak parliament not only of 74 HZDS deputies but also of 15  SNS deputies. Because of this and also because of the votes of  some Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies, it was  possible for the Slovak parliament to adopt the Declaration of  Sovereignty of Slovakia and to approve the Constitution of the  Slovak Republic.    We did, however, need votes from other parties in the  Federal  Assembly to pass the Law on the Demise of the Federation and  other related laws. We succeeded, as is well known, in obtaining  votes from the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS] and  again from the SDL. Therefore it was possible to terminate the  function of the federation by peaceful and constitutional means  and start on 1 January 1993 on the road of independent state  existence. The demise of the federation ended the first  postelection phase, and the emergence of the independent Slovak  Republic on 1 January 1993 started the second. In this second  postelection phase, during which the silent coalition fell apart  and eight deputies left the HZDS club, there are much more  difficult and long-term tasks that require, among other things,  the consolidation of all forces and their participation in  carrying out historic tasks. There is no point in incessantly  recalling who wanted or did not want what prior to the elections  and during the first postelection phase. Instead, we must ask  who and under what circumstances is ready and willing to  participate in building the Slovak statehood and solving vitally  important problems. We need to invite partners rather than  produce adversaries. Such work requires peace, stability of  government, a Slovak Partnership for Peace--that is, a  partnership of all the significant political forces and trust  and support from abroad. This could be achieved if the  government were constantly supported by 80-90 deputies. Given  the present coalition, we know that consistent support can be  expected from 74-76 deputies. It is enough to continue with  makeshift government solutions and improvisations that enable it  to survive on a month-to-month basis. It is not enough, however,  for us to seek in a peaceful atmosphere and with the maximum  support of hundreds of thousands of people the conceptual and  profound solutions to the problems of the economy and internal  security and to receive sufficient trust and support from abroad.    I appealed in my New Year address for a peaceful and  conceptual way and for stability of government, which requires  the consistent support of at least 80-90 parliamentary deputies.    In this spirit, I spoke about the need to form a broader  coalition government. That is why I am calling for such a  government. It is my duty. The responsibility of the HZDS  implies the movement's obligation to form such a government. It  is the duty of not only the HZDS chairman or the HZDS leadership  but of the entire HZDS to do everything in its power in the  interest of finding a solution to the vitally important needs of  our citizens, to create political stability in the country and  accord among political and nonpolitical forces.    Its election victory granted the HZDS a single  privilege--namely, the right to form a stable government and  guarantee a peaceful atmosphere and the necessary support for  its work in parliament and public administration.    Whether we like it or not, the exercising of this privilege  puts an end to the differentiation between those who wanted an  independent Slovak state and those who did not, those who voted  for the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Slovak Republic and  the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and those who did not,  those who vociferously call for early elections and those who  oppose them, those who support the government and those who  criticize it and incessantly question its acts. According to  our democratic Constitution, regardless of whether we are in the  government coalition or the opposition, we are all equal, and  that applies not only to deputies but to all citizens,  regardless of whether they voted for the HZDS, the KDH [Slovak  Christian Democratic Movement], the SDL, or Coexistence. To ask  for other privileges in addition to this is undemocratic and  anticonstitutional.    You ask who is to be in the coalition that I am postulating.  Again, I can only give you a general answer, but I know that a  coalition can only be formed with the help of those political  entities present in parliament. Who will form it depends on  whether the HZDS will aim for a broad coalition, with the  support of at least 80 deputies, for instance, or a broader  coalition, with the support of, say, at least 90 deputies.  True, within the broad coalition, the election results would  definitely have to be taken into account, both in the  composition of the government and in its policy objectives.  This would not mean in either instance--and with the  parliamentary mechanism it is not even possible--a denial that  the HZDS emerged from the elections as the strongest political  force. If a broader coalition government is considered, then it  is solely because such a situation transpires in parliament as  to make it a necessity. While, at the beginning of 1993, it was  possible to choose between a noncoalition and a coalition  government, today a coalition, and it seems a broader coalition,  government is unavoidable.    I again repeat that personal dislikes of people at the head  of individual parties and movements must not stand in the way of  the formation of a stable and operational government.    I would be glad if these words could convince you that, with  my idea of the need for a broad coalition in my New Year  address, I did not in the least intend to cast any doubts on the  government. This is precisely the reason that I refer to a  broader coalition government. I see in it a guarantee of a  greater and more stable support in parliament and in the public.  Only such a government can guarantee internal stability, raise  the international credibility of our state, and contribute to  the creation of a calm, human, and working atmosphere in our  country. We can achieve this only if all of us consistently put  the interests of Slovakia and its citizens above the interests  of individual people, parties and movements, and other groups.</p>

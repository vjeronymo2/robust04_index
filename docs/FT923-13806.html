			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Boost for rented housing sought THE GOVERNMENT is to hold talks with institutional investors to see whether a fresh initiative can be taken to build up the private rented housing sector, Sir George Young, housing minister, said yesterday, David Barchard writes. 'My vision is of good-quality, professionally managed accommodation for rent, backed by long-term institutional investment,' he told the Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'I believe that there is now a consensus that the time is ripe for a fresh initiative and I have invited to my department representatives of major institutional investors to identify how we convert this consensus into homes.' He told mortgage lenders to tell their customers that there is a range of options if their circumstances change and they fall into arrears. The minister believes that will help to build confidence in people about to enter the housing market. Sir George sharply rebuked critics of the mortgage-rescue scheme agreed between the government and lenders last year. 'The mortgage-rescue package is forecast to rescue 55,000 people, many more than originally forecast last December,' he said.</p>

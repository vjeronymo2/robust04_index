			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Sprint and EDS to continue talks after merger fails Sprint, the US telecommunications group, and Electronic Data Systems, the world's largest computing services company, said yesterday that they had abandoned negotiations for a Dollars 30bn merger but were still exploring other forms of strategic relationship. The merger talks failed because of a disagreement between the two sides over the value to be placed on Sprint, according to sources close to the negotiations. Mr Les Alberthal, chairman of EDS, and Mr William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint, said yesterday that they still believed the convergence of their two industries would create tremendous opportunities. While a merger was no longer being discussed, 'there may be other ways we can work together to achieve strategic objectives'. Sprint, the third largest US long-distance operator, is believed still to be seeking an alliance with a European telecoms group to further its international ambitions. It has been in talks with the French and German state telecoms operators, but the discussions do not appear to have influenced the failure of the EDS deal. Sprint, based in Kansas City, Missouri, declines to confirm or deny the European discussions. But one source claimed yesterday that European partners had been looking at a significant equity investment in Sprint or the combined Sprint/EDS group. One European analyst said: 'Sprint needs an alliance to be credible outside the US: but it needs a cash injection if it is to go anywhere, which makes a Franco-German link up very attractive.' A merger with EDS might have led to the creation of an information services powerhouse, with a market capitalisation of Dollars 30bn and annual revenues of more than Dollars 20bn. The immediate reason for the collapse of the merger was money. The proposal under discussion involved EDS shareholders getting one new share in the combined company for every EDS share. EDS thought Sprint shareholders should get 1.1 shares in the new business, while Sprint demanded 1.3. EDS seems to have been surprised at the premium demanded by Sprint in what had been billed a 'merger of equals'. However, some Wall Street analysts said yesterday that a deal at 1.1 ratio could have meant a 10 to 15 per cent dilution in Sprint earnings per share, while a 1.3 ratio might have added to first year earnings. Dallas-based EDS has held discussions with numerous potential telecommunications partners in recent years - including British Telecom - but in the past found it hard to clinch alliances because of its unusual ownership structure. BT has since forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, the second largest US telecoms group. EDS is a subsidiary of General Motors, which retains ownership of its assets, while holders of a special type of GM stock, known as class E, have a claim on EDS's dividend stream. To help the Sprint merger negotiations, GM said last month it could consider spinning off full ownership of EDS to Class E stockholders through an exchange of class E stock for new EDS common stock, provided this was tax free.</p>

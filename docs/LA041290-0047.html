			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE: HOW TO FIND THE BEST EQUIPMENT  </P> <P> First-time computer buyers face a daunting task. Valid, unbiased guidance is  hard to find for a purchase that ranges from expensive to very expensive.  </P> <P> The best approach is to divide and conquer. Break the process up into a series  of smaller decisions and you'll more easily control what you are doing.  </P> <P> First, where to buy? If you are a student, faculty or staff member of a college  or university, you probably can get the best price through the school. But  selection may be limited, and you may have to wait some time for delivery.  </P> <P> If you work for a large company, chances are that you can buy through the firm,  either from an employee store or with a referral from the company's purchasing  department. You'll probably get a better discount than you would walking into a  store on your own. Again, selection may be limited.  </P> <P> If neither of those options is available, you have your choice of going to a  computer store, shopping at a discount or warehouse store (selection will be  very limited and usually aimed at the lowest end of the market) or buying from  a mail order vendor.  </P> <P> Shoppers new to computing who lack the help of an experienced relative or  friend are better off going to a computer dealer, even if they pay a little  more.  </P> <P> You shouldn't trust computer advice you get from a discount store employee, and  you are strictly on your own to set up the computer and install software and  accessories.  </P> <P> There are many reputable mail order houses advertising in the computer  magazines and often the order clerk can give good advice, particularly about  which pieces of equipment work best together. But if something is wrong with  the machine when you get it, making an exchange is really inconvenient.  </P> <P> The best way to choose a dealer is to follow recommendations of others who  already have purchased. If that's not possible, look for dealers that have been  in business for five or more years. (You can look up old newspapers on  microfilm at the library to find which stores were advertising in past years.)  </P> <P> Now that you know where to buy, what should you buy?  </P> <P> You are assured of being firmly in the mainstream of personal computing if you  buy either an Apple Macintosh or an IBM computer or one of the many machines  compatible with IBM.  </P> <P> The IBM and Macintosh worlds are separate, however. Neither family of computers  can run software designed for the other. So buy the one you are most likely to  use at work or school.  </P> <P> However, either IBM or Macintosh can communicate quite well with larger  computer systems at the office, if those systems allow outside access by  telephone.  </P> <P> Macintosh is the easiest computer to use and the easiest to buy because there  are fewer choices to make. It also tends to be the most expensive, especially  compared to many of the IBM clones.  </P> <P> The big advantage of the Mac is that its programs use graphic images --  pictures of file folders, a page of text, or a program's logo -- to help you  understand what you are doing.  </P> <P> A mouse is used to control a screen pointer and to highlight commands and  images on the screen. Many tasks are performed simply by pointing at a name or  image, clicking the mouse button or dragging the image across the screen to  another location.  </P> <P> For instance, files are erased by dragging their images to a symbolic trash can  at the bottom of the screen.  </P> <P> Macintosh computing tends to be more expensive because Apple has no competitors  to force its prices down. Also, its graphics need more computing power to run  satisfactorily and also, you really do need an expensive laser printer to put  all that fancy typography and imagery properly onto paper.  </P> <P> The IBM world is much more confusing.  </P> <P> Most IBM and compatible computers use programs that are written for the MS-DOS  operating system. MS-DOS is special software that does the basic housekeeping  of the computer, allowing its keyboard, disks, screen and memory to all work  harmoniously.  </P> <P> Most versions of MS-DOS require you to type commands to perform tasks. There  are no catchy images on the screen for you to drag around as on the Macintosh.  Thus if you want to get rid of a file, you type the command ERASE followed by  the directory location and name of the file. It is quite a powerful and  efficient way to do things, actually, but it is harder to learn.  </P> <P> A more powerful operating system, called OS/2, that has graphic images and lets  more than one program run at a time, is available. But it requires a fast  computer with lots of memory, and there is not much software available for that  system. However, it looms on the horizon and you'll likely find computer  salesmen urging you to buy the more powerful computers.  </P> <P> Before you get talked into buying too far beyond your present needs and  abilities, remember that anything you buy today will be superseded with faster  -- and probably cheaper -- models within a year. It has always been that way in  personal computing and it shows no signs of ending.  </P> <P> Three families of IBM and compatible computers are available, based on the  microprocessor that serves as the brains of the computer. The least powerful  have Intel 8088 or 8086 chips and are usually priced around $1,000 to $1,500  with a hard disk for extended file storage and a monitor.  </P> <P> These are the machines on which Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect became leading  business software for millions of workers, and they still are just fine for  basic word processing, basic spreadsheet and small database applications. But  they are too slow for complex word processing, spreadsheet, database and any  graphics programs such as desktop publishing.  </P> <P> Next are the 80286-based computers, which are often found in the $1,200 to  $2,000 range for basic configurations with hard disks and monitors. They have  enough power to run graphics software and can be expanded to handle OS/2.  </P> <P> They are losing a lot of their luster as bargain-priced performance machines  these days because for just a few hundred dollars more you can buy the same  computer equipped with an Intel 386SX chip. The 386SX is a slightly detuned  version of the popular 80386 chip and if you can get it without much of a  premium over the 286 chip, it is better to have it. You need to be aware as you  go shopping that as you go up the performance scale, everything goes up in  price.  </P> <P> Add a laser printer -- absolutely worth the money -- and even a basic computer  system comes in at about $3,000 to $3,500 with just a small selection of  software. If it's Macintosh, figure on $5,000 to $6,000. And if you're a closet  techie just waiting to break out, you'll be amazed at how quickly you could  spend $15,000.  </P> <P> MS-DOS users need the least amount of RAM. The basic 640 kilobytes is fine  until you get into complex graphics or big spreadsheets or programs that work  with Microsoft Windows. The next jump should be to 2 megabytes. Consider 4  megabytes the bare minimum for OS/2 and add more if you can afford it.  </P> <P> For Macintosh, I'd recommend 2 megabytes unless you do complex graphics. Then  it's 4 megabytes for black and white and 8 megabytes for color.  </P> <P> For disk storage, 20 to 30 megabytes is fine if you only use one or two  programs and don't do graphics. If you intend to collect software, become a  power user, or get into desktop publishing or other graphics software, you  can't buy too much disk storage.  </P> <P> Finally, should you buy IBM or a compatible machine? There's is no  technologically "right" answer to that. Design and construction quality of IBM  and the many name-brand compatibles is high.  </P></p>

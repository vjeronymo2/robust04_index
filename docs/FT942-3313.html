			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Bradford Property ahead 52% to Pounds 31m Bradford Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted property company, announced a 52 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 30.7m for the year to April 5. Net assets per share increased from 170p to 184p, based on directors' estimates that the value of Bradford's property had risen to Pounds 261.2m at April 5. 'There are signs of recovery,' said Mr Nigel Denby, company secretary. 'We are anticipating some rise in prices in the next 12 months, although it is unlikely to be dramatic.' Much of the increase in profitability stemmed from a rise in property dealing sales from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 28.8m. This included a Pounds 7.87m exceptional property dealing sale from the sale of 9 acres of land at Martlesham, near Ipswich, for the construction of a superstore. If the figures were adjusted to eliminate the exceptional profit and exceptional pension contribution costs of Pounds 1.18m, the underlying increase in pre-tax profit would be a 19 per cent rise to Pounds 24.1m. Mr John Burgess is to retire as managing director at the end of April 1995, when he will be 61. Mr Burgess has been managing director for the last 18 years. He will be succeeded by Mr David Baker and Mr Tim Watts, who will be joint managing directors. Mr Baker, aged 54, joined the company in 1963. He will be responsible for property dealings. Mr Watts, aged 34 and a chartered surveyor, will be responsible for the operational management of the property portfolio. Net bank borrowings were reduced from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 8.3m. Earnings per share rose by 52 per cent, from 9.4p to 14.25p. A proposed final dividend of 3.6p makes a total for the year of 6.5p (5.4p). COMMENT Bradford's seemingly relentless ability to turn out large dividend increases has helped defend its share price from the turbulence afflicting the rest of the property sector. So far this year, its shares have fallen by 8.7 per cent, just over half the decline suffered by the rest of the sector. But yesterday the shares were marked down by another 9p to 221p as the market reacted to a disappointingly modest rise in net asset value. Assuming that this reaches 200p per share this year, the shares are on a 10 per cent premium to net asset value, which seems precipitously high compared to the rest of the sector. But Bradford's strength lies in its ability to grow its dividend. Assuming another 20 per cent rise this year, the shares are yielding 4.3 per cent, which should provide a degree of support to the share price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 15 Jan, CANA -- Caribbean  Community (Caricom) secretary-general, Edwin Carrington, says  1994 will be "a critical year" for the 13-nation economic group  because of challenges presented by the new General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA).    The new GATT, concluded last month after seven years of  tough  bargaining under the so-called Uruguay Round, will govern  international trade into the next century. NAFTA, on the other  hand, is expected to shape future trading relations among  countries of the western hemisphere, including Caricom's 13  members.    "Our priorities in the region must take into account these  important developments," Carrington told CANA during a visit  here this week. If Caricom is not "effectively strengthened" to  deal with these changes, he warned, the region will face the  prospect of marginalization in the world Community.    "Unless Caricom is effectively strengthened, it cannot take  an effective part or play an effective role, or protect itself  effectively or take advantage of the opportunities, withstand  the challenges or deal with the challenges that will emerge from  these international developments," Carrington said.    As the first priority for this new year, he said, Caricom  should move speedily to establish the proposed single market and  economy. The second priority was deciding how the region will  deal with NAFTA which took effect on January 1 and links the  United States, Canada, and Mexico in a free-trade zone. NAFTA, a  United States idea, envisages the eventual creation of a  free-trade zone embracing all democratic and free  market-oriented countries in the hemisphere.    Carrington said NAFTA was an important issue for Caricom  countries because the bulk of their trade and investment  relations are with North America, in particular the United  States. He indicated the United States was setting tough  conditions for considering a Caricom request that some key  regional exports, including garments, sugar, and petroleum, be  granted temporary parity with mexico in terms of access to the  U.S. market.    Because these Caricom exports do not enjoy duty free access  to the U.S. under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), Caricom  producers fear they will lose out to Mexican competitors in  these areas because Mexico has an advantage under NAFTA. If its  request for same treatment as Mexico is granted, Caricom hopes  to use the period -- three years is the time proposed -- to make  necessary adjustments and to negotiate participation in NAFTA if  it decides to go that route.    ".... The U.S. is saying ...Before we can give consideration  to the question of parity, we would like to know how you stand  on intellectual property rights, ... What are your conditions of  worker rights, what is the status of democracy and good  government, what is the CET (Caricom's Common External Tariff)  going to be on critical products like rice, what about  investment guarantees for our investors in your countries,  ...What is your macroeconomic framework and policy?"    "All these they are demanding just to talk about the  question  of parity, which is a temporary limited concession, before we  get to the next stage of the question of full NAFTA membership  if we so decide," Carrington told CANA.    The Caricom secretary-general said Caricom's approach to  NAFTA is linked to the Association of Caribbean States (ACS),  expected to be established in July. Membership will be open to  all countries within and bordering the Caribbean Sea, including  some Central American states.    "...Those countries of Central America which are covered by  the Caribbean Basin Initiative face exactly the same challenge  like we face with respect to NAFTA," Carrington said. "What are  trying to do right now is ... Design a machinery to work  jointly with them. We agreed in principle so to do, but the  machinery for doing is now being established."    The Caricom secretariat plans later this year to mount a  number of seminars dealing with NAFTA and the new GATT for  various regional sectors.</p>

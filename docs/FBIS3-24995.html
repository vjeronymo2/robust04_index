An authoritative source told AFP that "it is the best  solution," adding that the appointment of Boubacar Keita, former  minister of foreign affairs, "should cool tempers." The new  prime minister offers certain guarantees to both camps -- the  ADEMA big shots and President Alpha Konare -- which have been  been flying at each other for several months now. The former  camp wants a "powerful government" and the latter is criticized  for its April 1993 choice of Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow,  who represented the civil society.    As a founding member of the executive committee, ADEMA's  highest political organ, the 49-year-old Keita is a "man of the  fold," as the party's radical wing was demanding. However, he  is also a trusted aide of the head of state, and was the deputy  director of his presidential campaign, and then his spokesman  after the 1992 elections.    ADEMA's leaders who intend to "govern alone" will be  reassured by the fact that Aboubacar Keita is a "politician."  They will interpret his appointment as "a step by the president  toward the party," an authoritative source in Dakar told AFP.  Immediately after his appointment, Aboubacar Keita hurried to  reappoint the government of his predecessor with the sole  exception that Mrs. Sy Khadiatou Sow, member of ADEMA and  currently governor of Bamako region, succeeded him as minister  of foreign affairs.    This decision has been interpreted as a gesture made to  reassure the other parties in government that Mali cannot  entertain a new political crisis, less than two years after  Alpha Konare's accession to power. Today, the leaders of the  presidential group affirm that "basically, there was no reason"  to ignite another ministerial reshuffle, three months after the  previous one which was marked by the strengthening of the  presence of radical members of ADEMA.    The abrupt departure of Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, who on 2  February presented the fait accompli "because he felt abandoned  by all," according to his aides, did not permit the president  "to push his analysis further."</p>

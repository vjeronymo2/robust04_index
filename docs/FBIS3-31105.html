			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Srpska assembly,  has been speaking at the opening of a sports event on Mt.  Jahorina, near Sarajevo, to mark 10th anniversary of the  Sarajevo Olympics:    [Begin Krajisnik recording] The international community --  the same one that 10 years ago, with its call for peace,  entrusted to us the holding of the greatest international sports  competition -- is today calling for bombing and war. It is  threatening us, without any reason. It is threatening us  because we are to blame for opposing denigration and  destruction. We are guilty because we wanted, like all other  peoples of the former Yugoslavia, to preserve our freedom and  state. We will reply to their ultimatums in the same way as our  forebears did. We do not accept the ultimatum. We want freedom  and peace. We have opted for freedom and are resolved to defend  the honor of the Serb nation with all available means. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian rubber output forecast to fall by 25% INDUSTRY OFFICIALS expect Indonesian rubber output to fall by about 25 per cent in the first six months of 1992 as a result of low prices and natural disasters that have forced many producers out of business, reports Reuter from Jakarta. 'Unfair pricing in the world market, and tight money and natural causes at home made producers think the business is no longer lucrative. Lower output is inevitable,' said Mr OK Cornel, chairman of Gapkindo, the Indonesian Rubber Association. Of about 90 processing plants in the country, 20 are no longer active. The rest have reduced their working hours. Indonesia, the world's second largest natural rubber producer, produced 1.26m tonnes last year. Mr Cornel said first-half output by smallholders, who account for 80 per cent of production, would fall as much as 25 per cent. That of state plantations would probably drop no more than 10 per cent, however, because they had better facilities. Haze from forest fires in the past few months had hampered photosynthesis which in turn reduced rubber production, he said. Output has also been hit in some areas by drought which lowered the level of rivers which smallholders use for soaking and transport. Another Gapkindo official said many growers had given up land to developers for real estate and golf courses. 'There's nothing that can stop them but better prices, otherwise forget it. They need more cash to survive,' he said. Many processing plants are producing at only half capacity. Indonesia's two-year-old tight money policy has raised processing costs by up to 35 per cent and the recent rise in fuel prices added another 15 per cent. 'It is really a burden. Many more processors will cut production or shut down. Results in the second half are likely to be worse,' the Gapkindo official said. Traders said prices for Standard Indonesian Rubber 20, the country's main export grade, had risen by 6 to 7 cents to 84 cents a kilogram because of shortages in the past few weeks.</p>

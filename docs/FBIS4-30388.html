			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said  today that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata will affect every country because it will drive up the  value of the yen. Suphachai said this while in Seoul as member  of the prime minister's delegation. He said the impact on  Thailand might not be great because the higher value of the yen  will benefit Thai exports to Japan. However, frequent changes  of government in Japan could change the Japanese policy of using  Thailand as the base for entry into Indochinese countries,  affecting its continuity.    [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Regarding frequent changes of  government in Japan, we are concerned about a couple of points.  First, the policy of using Thailand as the gateway to Indochina  -- to induce investment from Thailand to Indochina -- has  already changed three times, and we are concerned about its  continuity. Second, we, and the prime minister himself, tried on  several occasions to schedule a visit to Japan because there  were several issues to discuss. Our trade deficit with Japan  now totals no less than $4 billion and Japan is a country with  which we have a priority to solve trade problems. Our trade  problem with Japan is just as big as with the United States. A  visit which was postponed several times is not good for us. If  Japanese economic growth continues as normal, opportunities for  Thai goods will be quite good. Also, there is assistance which  we seek from Japan on a few issues. For example, Japan is  considering assistance in small and medium industries. There  will be a meeting on this issue in October to organize  assistance to our small and medium size industries, such as the  spare part industry. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said:    [Begin recording] [Prasong] If the resignation of the Hata  government is true, contacts, particularly trade and so forth,  will not halt but the hesitation and lack of confidence over  stability in Japan will slow down everything. Trade and  economic cooperation will continue unaffected, but confidence  will be affected... [interrupted by correspondent, who is  unheard]. The LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] has been the  government party all along. Therefore, the party will again lead  the government. It is a matter of who will become the party  leader. [end recording]    Regarding the Japanese invitation for the prime minister to  visit in September, the foreign minister said once an invitation  is issued it becomes a commitment for the country regardless of  whether the government is still in power.</p>

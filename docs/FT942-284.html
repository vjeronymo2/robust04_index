			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Tietmeyer stresses need for political consensus The planned European monetary union will not be able to survive in the long run unless it is underpinned by a deep political consensus, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president. 'If we create a monetary union . . . and this proves to be a failure, this will be a very, very sad result for Europe,' he told the Financial Times yesterday. 'I am not sure this will not bring the whole integration to a very dangerous situation.' Mr Tietmeyer, who has often in the past appeared concerned that implementation of the Maastricht Treaty so far had concentrated on economic matters to the neglect of political integration, stressed that he wanted actively to help bring the union into being. Monetary union was not a technical issue, he said. Because it involved participants in sharing risks and advantages, it had to be built on a broader-based political union, he said in an interview. He also showed his unease that some European central banks had not yet gained their independence. Both the political establishment and the public had to learn what it was like to appreciate and live with the merits and disadvantages of an independent central bank, he said. Mr Tietmeyer said he regretted that independence for central banks had not been made a requirement for this year's start of stage two of economic and monetary union. Meanwhile, the existing EU had to be broadened for historical reasons. 'I cannot think in the longer term that we can live in a Europe where we close the doors to a country like the Czech Republic,' he said. 'On the other hand, I cannot see in the foreseeable future a situation where all the Maastricht treaty conditions . . . for monetary union will be met by all countries,' he added. 'I do not think it likely that monetary union will be possible with all the present or future members from the beginning.' On recent turmoil in international financial markets, and last week's support of the US dollar, Mr Tietmeyer said events in exchange markets could not be controlled fully by intervention.

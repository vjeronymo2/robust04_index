			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel  (Christian Social Union) now sees the beginning of a lasting  economic upswing in the FRG. At the beginning of a Bundestag  debate on the latest spring report by the economic research  institutes on Thursday [28 April], the finance minister  rejected, however, the institutes' demand for a real easing of  the tax burden on the companies to support economic growth.  Such pre-financing models are out of the question, the finance  minister said. There will not be any tax reductions "on tick."    However, the corporate tax reform and the easing of the  burden on families must not be postponed, Waigel announced.  This will be financed by the reduction of possibilities for tax  write-offs. Pointing to the latest discussions of the industrial  countries in Washington, the deliberations of the East Europe  Bank in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the German-British summit,  Waigel stressed that it is internationally recognized that  Germany, like Japan, has achieved the greatest success in  reducing the structural deficits. Thus, the FRG will also  fulfill the criteria for entering the third stage of the  European Monetary Union with a common currency in time.    Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  of  Germany Bundestag group, on the other hand, stated that the  economic engine is "still just crawling ahead." The structural  problems of the country have not changed. The report confirms  the "chancellor's failure" in shaping the economy and in  reducing the high unemployment. The growth for all of Germany  of 1.5 percent, which the institutes mentioned, is a swallow,  but one swallow does not make a spring. Klose called for a  supplementary tax that spares the lower income groups, as well  as for renouncing the solidarity surcharge for all people  eligible to pay tax.</p>

			<p>Syrian         press coverage of the joint press conference held by         Presidents Clinton and al-Asad at the conclusion of their         summit meeting in Geneva on 16 January suggests that Damascus         sought to achieve at least two objectives in its coverage: to         emphasize the comprehensiveness of an eventual Middle East         peace settlement, while obscuring the notion of normalizing         relations with Israel, and to embellish al-Asad's role in the         peace process and his status as reflected in President         Clinton's remarks.      On 16 January 1994, at the conclusion of the Geneva summit,  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton held a  joint press conference in which both presidents made opening  statements.  The entire press conference, including President  Clinton's remarks, was carried live on the Damascus Syrian Arab  Television Network and was published in the 17 January editions of  the Arabic-language Damascus dailies AL-BA'TH, organ of the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party, AL-THAWRAH, and TISHRIN.  An English text was  also published by the English-language Damascus daily THE SYRIA  TIMES.      An examination of the official U.S. Government text of President  Clinton's statement and the corresponding Syrian versions, both  Arabic and English, reveals discrepancies that, in several  instances, change the emphasis of President Clinton's original text.  The three Arabic-language Damascus dailies carry the same text of  President Clinton's statement.  The English text published in THE  SYRIA TIMES is basically identical to the Arabic version but  contains some inconsequential stylistic changes.  They all digress  from President Clinton's original by omitting, substituting, or  reformulating some of the President's ideas.      Below are examples of the most noteworthy discrepancies between  the official U.S. text of Clinton's statement and the Syrian  version, which is translated from the Arabic text, except where  noted.  The portions between slantlines are where the texts  differed.  The examples below are arranged in the order in which  they appear in President Clinton's statement.   U.S.:      From the first days of my administration, the achievement             of a comprehensive peace //between Israel and its Arab             neighbors//,based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and             338 and the principle of territory for peace has been             //one of the highest foreign policy objectives.//   Syrian:    Since the first days of my administration, the             achievement of comprehensive peace //in the region             based// on Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of             land for peace was (one of) //the priorities of my             administration.//   U.S.:      ....I'm now pleased to have had this opportunity to hear             personally President al-Asad's views about how to best             make this year a year of breakthroughs.//   Syrian:    //I am personally happy to have held this meeting with             President al-Asad and to listen to his point of view on             the best ways to make peace.//   U.S.:      During our meeting //I told President al-Asad// that             I was personally committed to the objective of a             //comprehensive and secure peace that would produce             genuine reconciliation among the peoples of the Middle             East.//  I told him of my view that the agreement between             Israel and the PLO constituted an //important// first             step by establishing //an agreed// basis for resolving             //the Palestinian problem.//  //I also told// him that             I believe //Syria is the key to the achievement of an             enduring and comprehensive peace that finally will put an             end to the conflict between Israel and her Arab             neighbors.   Syrian:    During our talks, //I assured// (akkadtu li-) President             al-Asad// that I was personally committed to the             achievement of //peace in the Middle East,// and I told             him that the agreement between Israel and the PLO             constituted a //first step toward creating a basis for//             resolving //the conflict.  I assured him that Syria's             role is a decisive one if we want to produce a real and             lasting peace in the region.//   U.S.:      President al-Asad, as you have just heard, shares this             objective: not just an end to war, but the establishment             //of real and comprehensive peace with Israel that will             ensure normal, peaceful relations among good neighbors.//   Syrian:    President Hafiz al-Asad, as you have just heard, shares             this objective with me: //the achievement of a lasting             and comprehensive peace.//   U.S.:      Crucial decisions will have to be made by //Syria and             Israel// if this common objective is to be achieved....             Accordingly, //we pledged today to work together// in             order to bring the //negotiations that started in Madrid             over two years ago to a prompt and successful             conclusion. //   Syrian:    Decisive decisions have to be made by the //concerned             parties// for achieving peace. . .Today, //we have worked             together// to make the peace //negotiations that started             in Madrid a success.//   U.S.:      //Critical issues// remain to be resolved, especially the             questions relating to withdrawals, to peace and             security--//excuse me--the question of relating             withthdrawal to peace and security.//   Syrian:    There are //numerous problems// (THE SYRIA TIMES text has             "several problems") that must be solved, and there are             //questions relating to withdrawal, peace, and security.             We shall try to find solutions to these questions.//   U.S.:      President al-Asad and I also discussed the state of             relations between the United States and Syria, and             //agreed on the desirability of improving them.  This             requires honestly addressing the problems in our             relationship. //  Syrian:    We also discussed bilateral relations between Syria and             the United States, and we //agreed to improve these             relations.//  We want that.  //This requires making             efforts to improve these relations.//   (QUESTIONS AND/OR COMMENTS, PLEASE CALL CHIEF, AFRICA/LEVANT  BRANCH AT (703) 733-6408)  ENEAG/15 Feb/POLCHF/NEASA Division/PF 15/2050z Feb</p>

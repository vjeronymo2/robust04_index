			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Jovan Divjak [ethnic Serbian  deputy commander of B-H Army] spoke about the current  military-political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  agreement between our country and Croatia at a roundtable  discussion organized by the Liberal Bosnian [as heard]  Organization today.    According to Divjak, the pressure exerted by the United  States, and especially the Vatican, on Tudjman has yielded  results. The cease-fire agreement reached with members of the  Croatian Defense Council [HVO] is mainly being observed.  Generals Delic and Roso [of the B-H Army and the HVO,  respectively] should meet in Split or Geneva in two days to  define the principles of the military agreement.    According to this agreement, there would initially be a  joint  command for the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO. This  command would later be transformed into an unified command. The  day when the third side will enter the federation is not far  away, Divjak said.    The enemy's attempts to cut through the forces of the 2d and  3d Corps by capturing Maglaj and attacking Vozuca from Olovo  have failed. The offensive on Bihac and the Cazin Krajina has  not yielded results either. The cases of resistance to  mobilization, a lack of military discipline, and crime have  become increasingly frequent in the [Serbian] occupied  territories. It is thought that [leader of the Bosnian Serb  military] General Mladic is out of favor as he did not succeed  in accomplishing his aims in Sarajevo, the Krivaja valley, the  Posavina region, and the Neretva valley. General Milovanovic is  being mentioned as his replacement.    What is also important is that two brigades under the  command  of Fikret Abdic have refused to take any further part in combat  actions against the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation  in the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is very good. The front with  the HVO has been freed. The 7th Army Corps has been founded in  the Vrbas valley. According to Divjak, the founding of a corps  that would assume responsibilities in the Drina valley is also  being considered.    Divjak stressed that the social situation of the fighters is  very bad. The question of accountability for the loss of some  territories has also been raised. The key person responsible  for the loss of Mount Igman is under investigation.    General Divjak particularly emphasized the differences  between demilitarization and protected zones. The  demilitarization of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be discussed only  after Serbia and Croatia have been demilitarized. The  demilitarization of Sarajevo cannot be discussed while enemy  soldiers are around the city, Divjak said. Just because the  street cars have started operating, or because there was a  soccer match between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Sarajevo  teams we must not neglect the situation in Maglaj and Mostar, or  the humanitarian situation in the republic. This is having  adverse effects on other places in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Divjak  said.</p>

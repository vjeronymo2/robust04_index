			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Brussels battle over telecoms at crucial phase THE advent of the single market on January 1 marked a small step in the liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry. Some of the business of carrying computer data was opened to competition. The industry and its customers barely gave the change a second thought. Their executives were busy lobbying Brussels over plans for far more dramatic deregulation: the opening up of the business of carrying ordinary telephone calls, a market worth Ecu90bn (Pounds 73bn) in 1990 and valued now at an annual Ecu110bn. At stake is control of a fast growing industry. Turnover in European telephone calls is rising by more than 8 per cent a year, according to Daiwa Institute of Research in London. This industry is dominated by a handful of state-owned monopolies. They earn almost 90 per cent of telephone revenues in the EC. The European Commission wants this to change. It has called for representations from suppliers, customers and governments on how far liberalisation should go. These submissions should be filed by the end of this month. The Commission has asked for views on four alternative proposals. One would be to freeze the process of liberalisation, reversing present policy. The second approach would call for Brussels to bring in centralised rules to cut the cost of calls - a policy which would contradict the EC's new emphasis on subsidiarity, or making decisions at the lowest level of government. The other alternatives - which seem in practice more likely - would be to decide on either a partial deregulation or sweeping changes of the kind introduced in the UK. The Commission has said it wants to see at least some further deregulation. But many member states are opposed to this. Views spread from the strongly free-market British Telecom and Mercury Communications, the UK post and telecommunications organisations (PTOs), to the pro-state monopoly governments in southern Europe. Executives in London and officials in Brussels now suggest that the anti-liberalisation governments are bending to the will of the free-marketeers. This would be no mean victory. Voice telecommunications represent the core of an industry still seen in many countries as an arm of government. The debate is heavily influenced by ideology and emotion. Publication of the Commission's plans was twice delayed last summer, partly because of concern about its impact on France's Maastricht referendum in September. The conservatives have already lost ground. The Commission has pushed through reforms in the non-core activities of the PTOs. Legislation opening up the equipment market, for example, was approved in 1988. Countries that a decade ago were once staunch opponents of liberalisation have allowed a measure of competition since the late 1980s. The UK remains the only EC country with two PTOs, but Germany and France have introduced competition into mobile telephony and in satellite links. Last week, a subsidiary of the US company MCI Communications received French government approval to run an independent satellite telecommunications network in France. 'In a matter of a very few years, attitudes have changed,' says Mr Jonathan Rickford, BT's director of government relations. The UK, which deregulated in the early 1980s, 'used to be regarded as a piece of Anglo-Saxon eccentricity. Now it is seen that that is the way the world is going.' None the less, recent political moves suggest that obstacles to deregulation may increase. In the EC commission, responsibility for telecommunications has passed to Mr Martin Bangemann, who adds it to his industry portfolio. Mr Karel van Miert, a Belgian socialist, has taken over competition policy from the free-marketeer Sir Leon Brittan. Both Mr Bangemann and Mr Van Miert believe competition should not be the overriding factor in policy decisions - a sentiment in line with the attitude of some state telephone monopolies. EC commissioners intend to approve a draft proposal on deregulation by early March. This would be presented to telecommunications ministers on May 10. Commission officials concede it will take a year or more of detailed negotiations before legislation is approved. But, depending on the outcome of negotiations during the next few weeks, Europe's will to make real progress in deregulation will be tested very soon.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Katsman: The First Russian Commercial Bank </F> Has Made Its Appearance in Europe: The Stolichnyy Bank Is  Opening a Branch in Holland"]    [Text] Unofficial but  reliable sources in Holland announced yesterday that the central  bank of the Netherlands, De Nederlandshe Bank N.V., has granted  permission to the Stolichnyy Bank to open a branch in Holland.  Although representatives of the Stolichnyy declined to either  confirm or deny this information (saying that they had no  official confirmation from the Netherlands Bank), there are no  grounds for doubting its reliability. Thus, the Stolichnyy has  become the first Russian commercial bank to receive permission  to open a branch in Western Europe.    The history of founding a Stolichnyy bank branch in  Amsterdam  goes back over two years and was rife with unexpected twists and  turns. At first, its opening had been projected for back in  February 26th of last year. At the time, however, the Central  Bank of the Netherlands refused to grant Stolichnyy the required  permission, stating that it did not have a new license from the  Bank of Russia (Stolichnyy had received its license in 1989 from  the then still existing USSR Gosbank.). Despite turning in all  the documents on time, the procedures for the bank's  reregistration for a new license at the Central Bank (CB) took  eight months instead of the usual three and were completed only  in October of last year. Reasons for the delay are still not  clear. According to the official version, the CB prolonged the  reregistration because it conducted a supplementary verification  of the Russian bank's activities. However, according to  information given to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the CB's decision for a  necessary "supplementary verification" was preceded by a visit  to the Bank of Russia by Ministry of Internal Affairs employees,  who voiced their disinterest in a quick reregistration of the  Stolichnyy bank, expressly because of the bank's desire to open  a branch in Holland (attempts by controlling organs of the  government to limit the possible flow of Russian capital abroad  by every means is well known). To summarize, the Stolichnyy bank  received permission from the CB of Russia to open a bank branch  only in December of last year, but the Bank of the Netherlands  provided the necessary permit only now.    In any case, in the Stolichnyy Bank itself, where  correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY obtained this information  from unofficial sources, no one would comment on this issue,  stating that in the absence of an official notice from De  Nederlandshe Bank N.V., they could neither confirm nor deny the  information.    Nevertheless, representatives of the bank announced that  inasmuch as the Netherlands Bank has no formal reasons for  further delaying the granting of permission to the Stolichnyy  Bank, it is very plausible that this actually occurred.    Thus, it would be hardly premature to conclude that the  first  (not counting the former Soviet banks abroad) full-fledged  branch of a Russian commercial bank in Western Europe will be  the bank branch of the Stolichnyy in Amsterdam. The bank has  already put in over one million dollars to create this branch,  but these expenditures will have to pay for themselves very  quickly. For example, the bank is counting on attracting clients  by giving preferential rates for service in its Dutch branch,  which in part will allow Russian capital to be returned to its  own economy. In addition, the branch bank will be a Dutch  juridical person. This means that the doors of unified Europe  will be open to it, and more and more banks can spin off from it  to other countries.    [Boxed item]    At present the network of full-fledged branches of Russian  commercial banks abroad consists of a branch of the Inkombank on  Cyprus, the Cyprus branch of the Vneshtorgbank, and the branch  of the Russian Commercial Bank in Zurich, as well as former  Soviet banks abroad.    With regard to foreign representatives, many Russian banks  have them, for example, Tokobank and the Industriya-Servis (both  on Cyprus), Inkombank (in Switzerland), the Eskado Bank (in  Sweden), and the St. Petersburg Bank (in the USA).

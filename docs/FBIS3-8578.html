Four SLD members: Piotr Ikonowicz, Andrzej Lipski, Cezary  Mizejewski (Polish Socialist Party -- PPS) and Stanislaw  Wisniewski (All-Poland alliance of Trade Unions -- OPZZ) were  expelled from the caucus after they violated the caucus  discipline in the budget vote.    "I want to stress clearly that we are not forming an  opposition. we will create the PPS circle, but we will still be  supporting these activities of the cabinet, which will aim at  the implementation of the SLD programme," said Lipski.</p>

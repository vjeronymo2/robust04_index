			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> BUSH OPPOSES 'BIG GREEN' PROPOSITION;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN: PRESIDENT SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE IS NOT NEEDED. EPA CHIEF  CALLS GOALS 'LAUDABLE' BUT SAYS MEASURE IS 'NOT ESSENTIAL.'  </P> <P> Even as he sought to wrap himself in the mantle of the state's environmental  movement, President Bush announced Saturday that he is opposed to Proposition  128, the "Big Green" environmental proposition on the California ballot.  </P> <P> Moments after the President said at a rally for Sen. Pete Wilson's  gubernatorial campaign that the initiative was not needed to protect the  environment, his chief environmental adviser sidestepped an opportunity to join  Bush in opposing the measure. While voicing some criticisms, William K. Reilly,  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said he found its goals  "laudable."  </P> <P> The President delivered a speech offering unqualified, if unspecific, support  for environmental issues, during an invitation-only tree planting ceremony on  the California Lutheran University campus. Afterward, at a public political  rally on the campus, with Wilson at his side, he said that "to keep our  environment green, we don't have to be Big Green."  </P> <P> Bush had not previously expressed himself on the statewide measure.  </P> <P> Proposition 128 is an initiative backed by a variety of environmental groups.  It would phase out a number of cancer-causing chemicals used in pesticides and  products that harm the ozone, limit the discharge of toxic chemicals into the  ocean, require safeguards for oil tankers, and streamline enforcement of  anti-pollution laws.  </P> <P> On a day of both political and environmental symbolism, Bush hailed the passage  of the first federal clean air bill in 13 years, describing the measure  recently completed by Congress as "the most significant air pollution  legislation in the history of this country." He said he would sign it, as  expected, within a few days.  </P> <P> "We are on the verge of a new era for clean air," he said as he took the  symbolic step of turning over a spadeful of loose soil at the base of an  already planted oak tree on the campus of the 31-year-old private college.  </P> <P> To deliver the message of environmental protection and lend his presidential  coattails to Wilson three days before the election, Bush went considerably out  of his way. He flew into Southern California aboard Air Force One on Friday  night after a campaign appearance in Sioux Falls, Iowa. Immediately after the  appearance with Wilson, he headed to Albuquerque, N.M., and Houston.  </P> <P> Reilly joined the Bush Administration after a career in the mainstream of the  environmental protection movement. When asked about Proposition 128, he found  himself caught between the President's opposition and the support the measure  has received among environmental activists.  </P> <P> Apparently trying to politely leave some space between his position and Bush's,  Reilly said he had taken no position on the proposition.  </P> <P> "Many of the goals are laudable," he told reporters after attending the campus  rally. He also said that it had not been scientifically proven that Proposition  128's limits on pesticides were necessary and that its regulations would only  be established at "substantial economic cost."  </P> <P> "It will have a tremendous influence on the rest of the country," he said,  referring to the impact California initiatives, including those limiting  taxation, have had on national politics.  </P> <P> "If Big Green does pass, we will work with it, trying to ensure it is  integrated into our national laws," Reilly said.  </P> <P> But, he said, the measure is "not essential."  </P> <P> On Saturday, Gov. George Deukmejian in his weekly radio broadcast also urged  voters to oppose Proposition 128 as well as Proposition 134, the so-called  nickel-a-drink alcohol tax measure.  </P> <P> The environmental issues arose on a sparkling autumn morning -- picture-perfect  for Bush's focus on the environment and the symbolic planting of a sapling  beside a grove of eucalyptus trees.  </P> <P> The clean air bill that Bush said he would soon sign is considered one of the  major pieces of legislation to come out of the 101st Congress. It makes changes  in a 13-year-old air pollution measure, at a cost to industry and individuals  that has been estimated at between $25 billion and $35 billion annually.  </P> <P> Bush said it would remove 56 billion pounds of pollution from the air each  year.  </P> <P> The measure was approved only after compromises were hammered out between  environmentalists and those fearful of its impact on the economy, as well as  those concerned that it would too strictly limit the automobile industry.  </P> <P> The President said it would "cut in half the emissions that cause acid rain,"  the tree-killing pollution caused when airborne pollutants mix with moisture in  the skies.  </P> <P> "It will cut the emissions that cause smog in our cities, so that by the end of  this century more than 100 major U.S. cities will have cleaner, healthier air,"  he said.  </P> <P> He praised its encouragement of the use of "alternative fuels," such as those  derived from agricultural products rather than from the world's limited and  polluting fossil fuels.  </P> <P> "The time is right, the people are ready, and industry is responding," Bush  said of the development of alternative fuels.  </P></p>

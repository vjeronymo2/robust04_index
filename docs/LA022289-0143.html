			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> POLICE SEEKING LONG BEACH REAL ESTATE BROKER IN SLAYING OF RIVAL  </P> <P> Police today were seeking Long Beach real estate broker Vincente Lapid OCampo  for murder in the death of a rival broker last week.  </P> <P> The murder charges were filed at the Long Beach district attorney's office  against 45-year-old OCampo after police discovered blood on the carpet of his  West Willow Street office that apparently matched that of Arlene Lee Chee, 46,  of Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Chee disappeared last Wednesday after leaving her offices at Century 21 Fortune  Realty in Long Beach for a noon appointment with OCampo. Chee's body was found  Thursday night in the trunk of her Mercedes-Benz. She had been shot once in the  head.  </P> <P> OCampo was one of Chee's first employees when she opened her office in the 2500  block of Pacific Avenue in Long Beach in 1982. Chee fired OCampo that same year  and he set up his own real estate firm.  </P> <P> Police said OCampo may have been angry with Chee because she recently hired one  of his agents. Police believe OCampo may have fled the Los Angeles area.  </P></p>

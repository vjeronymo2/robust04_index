			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bad year for Japanese carmakers JAPAN'S carmakers yesterday revealed the extent of the problems which have hit the industry during the past 12 months. Fuji Heavy Industries announced a Y4bn (Dollars 30.9m) loss; Daihatsu Motor reported a 65 per cent plunge in pre-tax profit; and earnings for the year to the end of March at Nissan Motor were down 46.7 per cent. Only Mitsubishi Motors reported a profit increase - a slim 0.6 per cent to Y50.5bn - and it forecast that profits would be flat this year, as domestic demand is expected to remain weak. Nissan's Y87.8bn pre-tax profit was bolstered by a Y38.8bn gain from the sale of securities. It also reported extraordinary gains of Y46.6bn on the sale of Tokyo property to a subsidiary. (Executives say that deal will be reflected in consolidated accounts by increased borrowings.) Nissan also reported a Y44.5bn extraordinary loss arising from the closure of its unprofitable Australian assembly operations, announced in February. From October, it will only export cars to Australia. The cause of most companies' problems, however, was downturn in the domestic market. Passenger car registrations have been falling since the final quarter of 1990, just as makers' new production capacity came on line in expectation of rapid sales growth. Nissan's sales for the period rose 2.3 per cent to Y4,270bn, though vehicle sales were down 1.5 per cent by volume, and domestic sales 3 per cent lower. Strongest growth was in automotive parts, with exports 26.3 per cent higher in line with increased production in the US and UK. Mr Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice-president, said although domestic sales were 'very slow', the UK-based European operations were 'doing well'. However, the company is forecasting a further sharp fall, to Y40bn, in pre-tax profits this year, and virtually unchanged sales . The situation is more serious at Fuji Heavy, despite Nissan's request for it to produce 40,000 vehicles last year. Even including that order, unit sales were down 1.2 per cent and, by value, sales rose 9 per cent to Y823.9bn. Fuji Heavy is forecasting a profit of Y4bn for the current year, ending a run of two consecutive losses. However, the forecast is based on an optimistic sales estimate of Y900bn, which appears to take for granted a strong recovery in the industry late this year. Daihatsu, which has close links to Toyota Motor, is also in difficulty, having reported a 0.5 per cent fall in sales to Y783.4bn and a 4.4 per cent decline in sales by volume. The company is a specialist in mini-cars, sales of which have been hurt by tougher parking regulations in Japanese cities. The company reported a loss of Y900m related to its decision to retreat from the US market and to concentrate on Europe. For the current year, Daihatsu forecast that profits will remain at around Y4.5bn on a 3.8 per cent increase in sales to Y820bn. Mitsubishi Motors, following the successful release of a new range of recreational and luxury models, reported that its exports rose from 617,933 units to 644,161 units, and that total sales value rose by 10.4 per cent to Y2,554bn. But even Mitsubishi, which has experienced strong growth despite the downturn, expects sales for the current year to be up by a modest 1.7 per cent.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (18): Radical steps pay off - Profile: Chrysler Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US carmakers, has been rejuvenated since the end of the 1980s by a far-reaching restructuring and a series of highly successful new product launches. Virtually written off as a serious competitor in the world industry at the start of the 1990s, Chrysler is achieving record profits, and is being regarded by rivals, including some Japanese carmakers, as a new benchmark for global competitiveness in the world auto industry despite continuing concerns about the quality of some of its cars. Last year the group achieved a record pre-tax profit of Dollars 3.8bn, a quadrupling from the Dollars 934m earned in 1992 and a big recovery from the pre-tax loss of Dollars 910m suffered in 1991. Pre-tax profits in the first half of 1994 jumped again by 57 per cent to a record Dollars 3.14bn. Chrysler's reforms were driven by dire necessity, but Robert Eaton, group chairman and chief executive, insists Chrysler was 'the first automaker to recognise that basic changes were taking place in our industry, and we were the first to prepare for them. 'We began by cutting costs and eliminating waste while preserving future product spending. We sold non-automotive assets. And we began to get lean. But as we trimmed our workforce, we also reorganised into (chassis) platform teams that design cars faster and more efficiently.' Chrysler learned much from the production systems of the Japanese carmakers, and the lessons it has put into practice are commanding close attention in Tokyo, where the Japanese car industry itself is under pressure to cut costs. Toyota has recently completed one of the most rigorous examinations it has ever carried out of a competitor's car with a so-called 'tear-down' or dismantling of Chrysler's Neon small family car to analyse its low-cost construction. The leading Japanese carmaker was not complimentary about the Neon quality levels, but it praised the way the engineering had been simplified to cut cost. According to Earl Hesterberg, vice-president of Nissan Motor in the US, the Neon is forcing Japanese carmakers to wonder if some of their stringent and costly quality measures are too high. 'It looks like they (Chrysler) did some really smart things. We are all re-examining our product specifications now.' Faced by a renewed financial crisis at the end of the 1980s Chrysler was forced to take radical steps to reform its organisation, and one of the keys to its recovery has been the way it incorporates its suppliers into the design, development and engineering process for new vehicles. 'We view our suppliers as an integral part of a value-added chain . . . we call it the extended enterprise,' says Robert Lutz, Chrysler president. 'We treat suppliers as fully-fledged members of our platform (individual car range) teams. We have totally scrapped the old system of auctioning off contracts to the lowest bidder. Instead we set an overall 'target cost' for a given vehicle. And then we work with pre-selected 'supplier-partners' to arrive at mutually agreed costs for that vehicle's parts and components.' A study released earlier this year by Harbour &amp; Associates, the US automotive analysts, claimed that Chrysler was the most profitable vehicle maker in North America last year out-earning its nearest competitor by more than Dollars 500 per vehicle. Chrysler had the lowest total production costs of the five carmakers in North America examined in the survey, which attributed Chrysler's lead to dramatic improvements in product development costs, which had helped to offset Ford's advantage in assembly costs. The study showed that Chrysler's product development costs were Dollars 357 less per car than Ford's and Dollars 290 less than GM's, giving Chrysler a big advantage when it launches new vehicles. Chrysler had also achieved significant cost savings in particular in its assembly operations and purchasing activities. Despite the scale of the transformation there are still concerns that Chrysler quality levels have yet to match its financial performance. The group has introduced a series of new products in the past three years, but it still lags behind the competition when it comes to defects per car and customer satisfaction. It failed to gain a single place in this year's list of top 10 cars for initial vehicle quality compiled by JD Power, the leading US automotive consumer research group. None of Chrysler's cars exceeded the industry average. In this year's new car customer satisfaction index all of the group's four brand names Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and Eagle were below the industry average, a position that contrasts sharply with its strong performance in the light truck market, where it matches Toyota at the head of the league table. Its car operations have been troubled during the year by a series of product recalls involving some of its newest vehicles. During the summer the company formed a special group comprising its top 25 executives to seek solutions and to focus on improving quality. Despite the quality problems Chrysler has continued to perform strongly in the US market. It increased its US car and light truck sales by 19.9 per cent last year to 2.047m in a market that rose by 8 per cent. It raised its market share to 14.7 per cent, the highest level for 23 years. Chrysler is still overwhelmingly dependent on the North American market, having been forced by an earlier financial crisis to sell most of its foreign operations at the end of the 1970s. It is now aiming to double its retail sales outside North America, however, to 200,000 by the end of the decade. It increased sales outside North America by 45 per cent last year to 109,100 (including fleet and government sales) and exceeded 100,000 retail sales for the first time since it re-entered international markets in 1987. It is still a small player in foreign markets, but according to Tom Gale, Chrysler vice-president of design and international operations, the company is launching more new products in international markets in the next three years than at any time in its history with the introduction of at least six new left-hand drive and four new right-hand drive models by the beginning of 1997.</p>

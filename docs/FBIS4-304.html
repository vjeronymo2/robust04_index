			<p>BFN     [Text] The motives behind the state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal have been criticized by the Pan-Africanist  Congress [PAC]. PAC President Clarence Makwetu said the  declaration of the measure had nothing to do with the clamping  down on violence in the area. Mr. Makwetu was speaking at the  celebration of the 35th anniversary of the PAC in Soweto.    [Begin Makwetu recording] The real intention of the  emergency  is to force the opponents of the African National Congress and  the National Party in that region to tow the line. It all goes  to show what kind of government we will have should the ANC ever  be elected to rule this country. It also goes to show what type  of rule we will have should the National Party scrape through  with some seats in the proposed cabinet. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Lords defeat for crime bill measure Government plans to switch compensation for crime victims to fixed-tariff payments were rejected by the Lords last night. Peers voted by 131 to 113 to remove the provisions from the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. The government immediately announced its intention to reverse the defeat when the bill is returned to the Commons. The Home Office estimates the defeat could result in the doubling of the cost of compensation to Pounds 500m a year by the year 2000.</p>

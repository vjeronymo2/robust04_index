			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: The Globe revealed Sir, Gerald Cadogan is to be congratulated for his report, 'Theatres in old London' (April 25), when he heartily recommends that Mr David Mellor, our new heritage minister, take an interest in making more of the remains of the original Globe Playhouse. Not only should the minister take active steps to reveal more of the site to provide greater archaeological research but he, and all others concerned, should plan for future public access and, thus, put in place for common appreciation yet another piece of the English language's cultural jigsaw. And what a fine complement it would be to the rebuilt but authentic Globe, just a few yards away. Sam Wanamaker, The International Shakespeare Globe Centre, Bear Gardens, Bankside, London SE1 9EB</p>

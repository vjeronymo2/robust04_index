			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: Risks no reason to delay aid to Bosnia Sir, I am sick and tired of comments that everything to do with helping Croatia and Bosnia 'entails some very real political and military risk', according to Mr Robert Mauthner's article 'Air-drops to land in a political minefield' (February 25). I am maybe naive, but has anyone ever joined in any war without 'some very real political and military risk'? Are the soldiers being trained to be afraid of risk, afraid of fighting, being shot at and shooting? The reason why people don't join the army is because it is a risky occupation, which is also one of the reasons why they do. So far the British have done their best to postpone any kind of real help to stop victimisation of Croats and Bosnians because of the risks involved. Fair enough. Therefore it is true that the Moslems' last hope were the Americans; so why don't the British, if they themselves are afraid to help, allow someone else to do it? They now say the American air-drop would stop the preace process. What peace process? Within recent days the Serbs have destroyed another part of Sarajevo. The Serbs have never yet stopped aggression for any peace negotiations (ie going back to Lord Carrington's endless famous cease-fires in Croatia). So how can US air-drops start something that has never stopped? War cannot escalate any further against Croats and Moslems. It could prove troublesome to the Serbs and Serbs don't like to be troubled, as they keep warning the west. It seems to me that, in order not to annoy the Serbs, we condemn them on the one hand and let them get away with murder on the other, and why shouldn't Serbia vote for a war criminal to be their leader? After all, crime does pay, as their leader Milosevic has proved and the west has allowed for far too long. Silvia Miskulin, 3 Wentworth Court, Wentworth Avenue, London N3</p>

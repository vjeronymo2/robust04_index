			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COST OF THE B-2 STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> "One small step for defense, one giant leap for deficits." As usual Conrad hits  the nail right on the head regarding the B-2 bomber (July 18).  </P> <P> In an ad commemorating the U.S. landing on the moon, Rockwell International  claims: "20 years later America's imprint on history is deeper than ever."  That's right, never before has the U.S. had a deficit as high as we have now.  So, the Air Force is imposing "strict military secrecy" on the "significant  growth of the B-2 cost." Are we already living under a military dictatorship?  </P> <P> The B-2 bomber does not bring us one iota closer to space exploration. It does,  however, bring us closer to financial disaster.  </P> <P> HENRY BRUNELL  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

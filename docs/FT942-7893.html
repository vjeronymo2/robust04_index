			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Inching towards the chasm in Crimea: John Lloyd on the historical and political forces at play in rising tension between Russia and Ukraine When Nikita Khrushchev handed Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 to commemorate Russian-Ukrainian friendship it was in the good old days when the Soviet party leader could simply decree the nationality of millions in a grandiose gesture. Like much else in Soviet times, the consequences must now be dealt with. The danger in the rising tension in the Crimean peninsula is that it is a struggle not just over the control of territory but also over the fate of a heavily armed fleet; that Russia and Ukraine are proud, jealous and unused to treating each other as equals; that its aggravation is at least in part in the political interests of their leaders; and that it is a classic struggle between the principles of sovereignty and the will of the people. Mr Khrushchev's transfer of Crimea from Russia soon after he moved from the position of first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party to general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was - Russians say - always resented, though it appears the majority of the peninsula's 2.7m people voted for the independence of Ukraine in 1991, probably under the impression that life would be better. By 1992, however, the Russian majority appeared to have swung away from their new 'nation'. The Crimean supreme soviet, to general acclaim, passed a constitution for Crimea which declared that its government enjoyed all sovereign rights except those they voluntarily delegated to Ukraine. But under pressure from Kiev the deputies suspended the law - until, last Friday when the new parliament, with a militant majority in favour of union with Russia, unfroze it to cries from Kiev that this meant de facto independence. Crimea is the base of the Black Sea Fleet and the presidents of Russia and Ukraine have signally failed to agree, over the past two years, either to share it or allow one or the other to command it. It remains in a limbo, under Russian control, situated on Ukrainian territory, largely in the port of Sevastopol. The election early this year of the pro-unity Mr Yuri Meshkov as president of Crimea and of a parliament also committed to union with Russia has been followed by the signing of economic agreements between Crimea and the governments of both Moscow and Russia. In the past two weeks, reports of Ukrainian forces being moved into the area have been routinely relayed from both the fleet and the Crimean authorities, and routinely denied by Ukraine. Over the weekend it was the turn of Ukraine to claim that the fleet command had moved in tank and missile detachments. In both Moscow and Kiev, the politics speak to confrontation. Presidential elections are due in Ukraine next month, but Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the present incumbent, wants to delay them: a declaration of a state of emergency and a tough line on Crimea would do him no harm and might push back elections by general consent. In Russia, things are in some respects worse. Last weekend, two different political organisations held congresses. One was the Russian Freedom Party of former vice president Alexander Rutskoi, who used the event officially to launch his claim on the presidency with the promise that he would again extend Russia to the borders of the former Soviet Union. The other was a gathering of communist groups, including the dominant Russian Communist party: they, too, pledged to restore the imperial scope of the former Union. Both opposition groups chose this platform because they believe it popular: opinion polls show they have a point (though they do not show what Russians would put up with to achieve it). It is clear, however - from polling and anecdotal evidence  - that Crimea occupies a special spot in the hearts of most Russians. Its beauty and climate (which made it the most popular resort area in the former Soviet Union); its literary (Chekhov lived there) and historical (Catherine the Great took it from the Turks) associations; and its Russian majority - all combine to make it inconceivable that it could be other than Russian. In the increasingly heated climate which surrounds discussion of the former Soviet Union - in particular those parts outside Russia in which Russians are numerous - Crimea at present takes pride of place. It can become an oppositionist cause over which Mr Yeltsin and the government cannot afford to appear weak but which they do not wish to see boil over. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, told Mr Douglas Hurd, his British opposite number visiting Moscow yesterday, that - according to Mr Hurd  - 'Crimea is part of Ukraine and that its sovereignty is not in question'. At the same time, however, Mr Kozyrev has also said that the wishes of its people must be respected. Both Mr Vitaly Churkin, the Russian special envoy to the former Yugoslavia and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, used the Yugoslav analogy as something of a threat. Though all sides profess to be aware of what is at stake, they nevertheless inch closer to the chasm.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Crimea: the past  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1783: As part of a massive Russian expansion to the south, Catherine the Great smashes the Crimean khanate, controlled by the Tatars, and annexes the peninsula.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1944: Between May 18 and May 20 the entire Crimean Tatar population, some 180,000 people, is deported to Central Asia to punish the Tatars for backing Hitler.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1954: To mark the three hundredth anniversary of the Treaty of Pereiaslav, which joined Ukraine and Russia, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transfers the Crimean peninsula to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991: On December 1, more than 90 per cent of Ukrainians, including over half of the residents of Crimea, vote for Ukrainian independence. As Ukraine asserts its sovereignty, tensions with Russia rise.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994: In January, Crimea, where ethnic Russians constitute 70 per cent of the population, elect separatist leader Yuri Meshkov as President.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

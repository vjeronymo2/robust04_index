			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Rise in US wholesale fuel prices US wholesale prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in January with a fall in food costs offsetting the biggest jump in fuel prices in more than three years, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington. Wholesale fuel prices jumped by 6.5 per cent in January, but food prices fell by 0.3 per cent. The Labour Department said the rise in its Producer Price Index, which measures price rises before they reach the consumer, was the biggest gain since a similar 0.2 per cent rise in September. However, economists had been expecting a much higher jump, of perhaps 0.4 per cent. They said the more moderate gain showed that inflationary pressures were remaining well contained. Economists believe that rises in both wholesale prices and consumer prices will remain subdued this year even though the economy seems set to enter a period of recovery. However, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales fell by an unexpectedly sharp 0.5 per cent in January, in the first decline in 10 months.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Beijing bars Jardine from role in Hong Kong port project China has ruled out the participation of the Jardine group, the trading empire which has long been central to Hong Kong's fortunes, in a consortium to extend the colony's container port. The move puts on hold the development of the world's busiest container facility, and casts a doubt over Jardine's ability to expand its business in China or Hong Kong after the 1997 handover of the colony. In a thinly veiled attack on the company and governor Chris Patten, Beijing's semi-official Hong Kong China news agency questioned the qualifications of Jardine to operate a container terminal, and alleged it had won the right to develop the port because of political favouritism. Maintaining that the group 'lacks the necessary experience and expertise in developing and managing modern container terminals', the commentary said Jardine 'has no confidence in, and does not wish to make any commitment to, the future of Hong Kong'. China's move, which came on the eve of a visit to Hong Kong by Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, marks a worsening in Sino-British ties, which appeared to be on the mend. Jardine has had a tempestuous relationship with the Chinese leadership over the past decade. This year it angered China when it decided to de-list from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange partly because it had little faith in China's ability to administer the colony fairly after it resumes sovereignty in 1997. The last straw, however, appears to have been the 11th hour change in voting intention of Mr Martin Barrow, a Jardine executive, at a crucial point in this June's Legislative Council debate on Mr Patten's democracy legislation. His decision to abstain delivered a one-vote victory to the government. Beijing's attack yesterday was vigorously contested by Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary, who said that the colony operated a 'level playing field' for all contracts. 'Our objectivity in such matters has been a key factor in attracting bids,' he added. In the first six months of this year throughput at Hong Kong's container port rose 26 per cent compared with the same period last year. Construction of the port extension, already 18 months delayed, appears to hinge on the ejection of Jardine from the Tsing Yi consortium, in which it has a 30-40 per cent equity stake. Jardine is thought to be under pressure from partners to withdraw. High anxiety for Hurd, Page 4 Jardine motors arm boosts profits, Page 28</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by An Hui-chang] </F>   [Excerpts] The Ministry of Public Security of North Korea  is compared to our Headquarters of National Police. However,  while our Headquarters of National Police is under the Ministry  of Home Affairs, North Korea's Ministry of Public Security is  under the State Administration Council, and, accordingly, its  position can be said to be at a higher level than our police  headquarters. Its power is stronger than that of our police, as  well.    Yo Man-chol, former North Korean public security officer,  captain, who defected to the ROK recently, stated: Public  security officers' prestige is so big that their power is  "sacred and inviolable." When I was a public security officer, I  lived with the sense of a self-confidence that no one dared to  attack me.    The role of the Ministry of Public Security may be evidence  that can ascertain the remarks stated above by Mr. Yo Man-chol  to be true.    The major duties of the Ministry of Public Security include  preventing and handling crimes and accidents, conducting  security guard activities for Kim Il-song and other high-ranking  figures, conducting surveillance on foreigners, ferreting out  antistate elements, and so forth. [passage omitted]    How are public security officers appointed? The difference  from our way of appointment is that public security officers are  not appointed through an examination system, but through a  recommendation system. According to Mr. Yo Man-chol, cadre  officers in charge of recruiting public security officers at  city or county public security offices go around their  respective responsible district. There, they receive from people  in the district a list of candidates recommended by them or they  directly select candidates. Then, they select final candidates  after screening their family background and personal ability.  Priority is given to those candidates with good family  background and quick-judgment ability. However, in many cases,  public security officers are recruited through the  recommendation of high-ranking party and government officials.    Mr. Yon stated that he was the driver of a political officer  in a brigade of the Korean People's Army and that he became a  public security officer thanks to this political officer's  recommendation. [passage omitted]    One of the important tasks of public security officers is  security guard activities for high-ranking officials and for Kim  Il-song, in particular. Mr. Yo reveals that when Kim Il-song  comes to Hamhung city for an on-the-spot guidance or on leave,  all public security officers in South Hamgyong Province are  placed under a state of alert.    According to Mr. Yo, when Kim Il-song visits Hamhung city,  the South Hamgyong provincial public security department  receives Kim's itinerary from the General Security Bureau [howi  chongguk] in Pyongyang and issues an emergency codenamed "Storm  One" 40 minutes before Kim arrives at the Hamhung railway  station. Such a short notice is also to keep Kim's visit secret.    Once an emergency is issued, security officers from various  districts in the city are to gather at the provincial public  security department building where they receive orders on  deployment. They are to be deployed at various guard posts in  the city, including the Hamhung railway station. In the case of  security activities on the streets, public security officers are  to be deployed 50 meters from each other.    When Kim Il-song arrives at the Hamhung railway station,  public security officers are to be deployed on the street  leading the place where Kim is to stay 25 meters from each other.    As to the level of North Korea's security guard, Mr. Yo  said:  Public security members are to take charge of outside security,  and security guard members from the General Security Bureau are  in charge of internal security. Security guard members from the  General Security Bureau establish three and four security rings  around Kim Il-song. I once heard a security guard member from  the General Security Bureau in Pyongyang saying that security  rings are so tight that not even an ant can penetrate into the  security rings.</p>

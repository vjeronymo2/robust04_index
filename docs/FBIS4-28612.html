			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["KYODO and YONHAP report from Tokyo"] </F>   [Text] Japan's KYODO News Agency reported: North Korean  President Kim Il-song said that North Korea can abandon its  nuclear development program if it can receive economic support  from the United States to convert its graphite-moderated reactor  to a light-water reactor, along with the normalization of  diplomatic relations with the United States through dialogue.    Selig Harrison, senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment  for Northeast Asian Security Affairs, said in his news  conference with KYODO News Agency: President Kim expressed that  he has the intention to stop the radiochemical laboratory and  the ongoing construction of a 200,000 kilowatt nuclear reactor  if the United States and other foreign countries promise to  provide technology to North Korea for building the light-water  reactor. Harrison, who paid a week-day visit to Pyongyang at  the invitation of North Korea, met with President Kim on 9 June  and held talks with other North Korean high-level leaders,  including First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu. After this,  he arrived in Beijing on 10 June.</p>

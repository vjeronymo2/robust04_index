			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Last of the banks - The week ahead Investors will be watching for shocks at HSBC Holdings as it concludes the interim results season for UK banks. Shares have already fallen sharply this year on worries over Asia-Pacific growth, and its exposure to financial markets trading. On Monday, the bank, now the parent of Midland bank, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1.3bn, compared with Pounds 1.17bn. Earnings per share are expected to rise by 5 per cent to about 34p and the dividend to be increased 14 per cent to 8p. Argos, the catalogue retailer, is forecast on Monday to announce an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 13.2m to about Pounds 15m. The company said at its annual meeting that like-for-like sales - which exclude new stores - had increased 9 per cent in the first four months of the year, although they had slowed since then. Margins are thought to have held steady. Kalon, the paints group, is expected to report increased first-half profits of Pounds 10m (Pounds 8.73m) on Tuesday following improved contributions from Novodec - the French paint maker acquired for Pounds 22m last year - and Vallance, the specialist products business which cost Pounds 6.2m. It has also enjoyed some organic growth in the trade paints business, and is likely to recommend a 1.5p (1.3p) interim dividend. Continued rate competition in the US insurance market could hold back profit growth at Sedgwick, the insurance broker, which reports its interim results on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits for the six months to be between Pounds 55m and Pounds 64m, against Pounds 54.1m. Britannic Assurance, the life insurance company, will on Wednesday announce its results for the first half of the year. Like other life companies, it is not required to release interim profits figures, so attention will focus on the interim dividend. Last summer, the interim rose to 3.85p, against 3.433p. Analysts' forecasts for the interim dividend this year are round 4.2p or 4.3p - an increase of 9 or 10 per cent. BICC, the cables and construction company, reports its interim results on Wednesday. The results should show a further improvement in the group's main UK and US cable markets with pre-tax profits expected to nudge above Pounds 60m for the six months to the end of June, against a re-stated Pounds 50m. Earnings should be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend but increased payments to shareholders are some way off.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Business and the Environment: Farmers turning over a new Leaf - Deborah Hargreaves considers an initiative which combines 'green' agricultural methods and profitability Trees planted in the late 1970s are beginning to provide shelter on the windswept acres of Stanaway Farm near Ipswich in Suffolk, and wildlife is creeping back to the borders of wheatfields where new hedges have now rooted. Chris Hayward, who manages the farm, tries to use environmentally-friendly methods of production while still making a profit. 'I hope we are addressing many environmental issues in the public eye,' he says. He still sprays pesticides and fertilisers, but cuts down their use by rotating crops regularly and analysing the soil to plan more carefully the amounts of chemicals to use. Hayward follows the low input/low output approach adopted by advocates of 'sustainable' farming - a current buzzword in the agricultural community - and still manages to make a profit of more than Pounds 100 per acre. Stanaway recently became the latest holding to join the Leaf initiative  - Linking Environment and Farming - which was set up two years ago in the UK as a way of encouraging farmers to produce in a more environmentally-sensitive way. Leaf is also partly a public relations exercise in an attempt to change the popular image of farmers as antediluvian carnivores splashing pesticides across the land. 'Farmers have an image problem,' says David Richardson, a Norfolk farmer who is chairman of Leaf. 'Farmers will often preserve hedgerows and protect habitats because they need them for shooting pheasants. They don't call this conservation, they call it shooting.' The greater environmental awareness among the European public is encouraging many farmers to produce in less intensive ways. In addition, recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy have laid increased emphasis on more environmentally-friendly methods of production. Some farmers are replanting hedges that were torn up in the drive to maximise profits in the 1960s. They are leaving wide margins at the edge of their fields so that weeds from the hedges do not seed into crops which means they can then use fewer herbicides. Leaf is one of several organisations trying to show the public that farmers are doing much towards conservation while also running commercial farms. It treads a middle road between the often unprofitable organic farms and highly-intensive producers. Richardson stresses that Leaf farmers are responding to financial incentives to cut down on their use of chemicals. It is often cheaper for producers to match their inputs of chemicals more closely to optimum crop yields. This minimises the leaking of chemicals into the land and eventually, the watercourses. At the same time, there is no longer any need to splash out on fertilisers and pesticides in the hope of squeezing every last bushel of grain from the land. The public is weary of EU food mountains and Brussels is reducing guaranteed prices to farmers. These price cuts and the need to move towards world market levels for EU farmers can give a marketing advantage to those who are using 'greener' production methods. 'One of the ways the farmer will be able to make his products more attractive to the consumer will be to ensure the customer knows they were produced in an ethical way,' says Richardson. Large retailers such as J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Safeway have joined the organisation to provide the link to the consumer. All Leaf farms have to abide by a set of guidelines on conservation. Other specific advice for growing certain crops is also stipulated. Although guidelines such as minimising inputs are often unspecific about target levels, Leaf farmers must undergo a rigorous inspection process before they can join. One Leaf farmer, Robert Lawton who has a 1,500-acre dairy, arable and beef farm in Wiltshire, recently won the Farmers Weekly and Dalgety award for farmer of the year. 'One of the most important things from an environmental viewpoint is that Leaf farmers are maintaining countryside features and habitats in good health,' says Paul Wynne, land use officer at the Council for the Protection of Rural England, who sits on the Leaf advisory board. 'These farmers are preserving the hedgerows and ponds - commonplace features which farms can lose without many of us even seeing it.' In December, Stanaway became the 14th Leaf demonstration farm, which means it will be open to touring parties of opinion-formers such as members of parliament, local councillors, teachers and agriculturalists. The idea is to influence other farmers as well as the public. Leaf aims to have a network of demonstration farms with one in each county on show in the next couple of years. In addition, it has around 30 other members which adhere to its principles, but do not want to show the public round. As a way of reaching out to more farmers, Leaf recently sent out an environmental audit to more than 200 farms to gauge their awareness of green issues. The audit aims to help farmers to take stock of their existing farming methods. It asks them questions about landscape features and habitats on their farms, management of the soil, crop protection and conservation of energy. Caroline Drummond, Leaf project co-ordinator says she thought the audit 'had made people think'. She hopes farmers will fill in the questionnaire every year and record their progress on environmental issues. Leaf, which is part of a wider European movement with offshoots in Germany, Spain and Sweden, is partly funded by the large agrochemical and related companies - Schering (Germany), Dalgety (UK), Willmot Crop Protection (UK), Ciba (Switzerland), and Hydro Agri (the UK offshoot of Norsk Hydro of Norway) - anxious to promote a 'greener' image. They also hope to preserve a market which could be restricted by a public backlash against using chemicals on the land.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Monday Interview: Old man and the sea change - Harry Oppenheimer, former chairman of the Anglo American/De Beers group, talks to Andrew Gowers Enthusing about his family firm and its role in the new South Africa, the small man with the bald head and quizzical eyes suddenly interrupts himself. 'I'm afraid I talk as though no one paid any attention to what I had to say nowadays,' he says with a knowing twinkle. 'I'm out of this thing.' Claims of this sort pepper a 90-minute conversation with Harry Oppenheimer, 84-year-old patriarch of the Anglo American/De Beers group and most prominent voice of South African business for at least four decades. 'I'm very old,' he says in his sing-song English gentleman's accent, after making another apparently authoritative pronouncement about Anglo strategy. 'The people who run this company may think differently.' He knows, of course, that they do not. Oppenheimer may have formally retired as chairman in 1982, but the men he left in control of South Africa's largest conglomerate were all hand-picked by him and all regularly consult him on company policy as the group's largest individual investor. Scarcely a day goes by when he does not show up for work in Anglo's imposing headquarters at 44 Main Street, Johannesburg; his office, though it carries the name of the real family firm, E Oppenheimer &amp; Son, is just down the corridor from that of the current chairman of Anglo and De Beers, Julian Ogilvie Thompson. These days, the company's managers may have greater reason than ever to solicit the political and commercial wisdom of the man they call 'HFO'. For South Africa is in the midst of a traumatic passage to majority rule, its economic prospects are at best highly uncertain, and its future black rulers have been making less than friendly noises about the white-owned mining, manufacturing and financial conglomerates that exercise such an overwhelming grip on its business life. Amid much talk of the need for such groups to 'unbundle' and of regulatory trust-busting under a new government, Anglo is first in the firing line. Oppenheimer, however - a long-standing critic of apartheid despite the wealth he accumulated within the system - does not seem greatly perturbed. Of course, he says, there is the risk that the transition could go badly wrong, but against that must be weighed the greater risks of standing in the way of change. Like most of the country's elite, Oppenheimer assumes a constitutional settlement will be reached and that South Africa will be ruled by a government dominated by the ANC a year from now. What, then, of the potential risks to his business? The ANC, after all, has no reason to favour the conglomerates that prospered under apartheid, and it was not long ago that its leaders talked of nationalising them. Here the former Anglo chairman is philosophical, as befits someone who has heard threats of nationalisation before - notably in 1948, when the National party first came to power. Certainly the company 'shouldn't expect gratitude' from the ANC for its role in criticising the old system, he admits. Indeed, while he refuses to admit to any moral qualms about the past  -'my temperament isn't like that' - he acknowledges the group could have done more to advance black welfare. Too often, he says, 'we kept on saying how wonderful we were to have made the effort . . . and then we didn't go on pressing.' But nor does he expect that white business will in the end be singled out for punishment. 'Certainly I think this will be a government with which business people can work comfortably. You know, we've had a great deal of experience working with very, very difficult governments in Africa - a great deal more difficult than this one is likely to be . . . 'I don't think there's any risk of a government dominated by the ANC nationalising the mines or Anglo American. They had this as part of their policy. But when they . . . went into the thing, and they talked to business people around the world, I think they changed their mind.' Perhaps so, but the threat has not entirely evaporated. In the ANC lexicon, nationalisation has been replaced by talk of pursuing active anti-trust policies to curb monopolies and reduce the domination of the economy by a few large groups. Given that Anglo owns a Byzantine network of holdings in precious metal and diamond mining, manufacturing and services companies that account for more than a quarter of the value of shares quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, can it avoid early interference by the new government? Oppenheimer evidently thinks so. He is unmoved by recent talk of unbundling conglomerates - encouraging them to dispose of some of their interests - and by the restructuring announced recently by Anglo's rival, Gencor, widely portrayed as the first step in a transformation of corporate South Africa. 'I neither believe nor disbelieve in unbundling,' he says. 'I think it's absurd to say that a holding company just in principle should only invest in one industry. On the other hand, from time to time you do get circumstances where it's desirable for a group like ours to part with their interests in a company . . . But personally I wouldn't dream of accepting a policy of unbundling.' Oppenheimer suspects that the real political argument concerns the power wielded by blacks in the economy - or rather, the lack of it. And here he acknowledges that the big business groups must play a pro-active role. 'I think it's extremely dangerous to be ruled by people who have no material stake in the country,' he says. 'And as you can't - even if you wanted to - stop being ruled by the majority, we've got to see that people in that majority have as large a share in the material assets of the country as we can.' Oppenheimer sees the need to facilitate the growth of black economic power. 'If I saw an opportunity for that and it involved unbundling something, I would look at it very seriously . . . Of course, it's more difficult to do than it was in the old days because largely they (the blacks) haven't the capital to do it and very often they haven't the skills to do it. But still, these things will grow, both the capital and the skills.' He is confident any new government will hesitate to tamper radically with South Africa's big business groups in case it chokes off the investment and new jobs the economy badly needs. For Anglo, with 80 per cent of its assets and income in South Africa, this is a potential trump card. 'If a great many obstacles were put in the way of our having a successful and expanding business here - and I don't think you could have a very successful business if it's not expanding - there would be pressure to do it elsewhere,' says Oppenheimer. 'But at the moment, certainly all the pressure is to invest in South Africa, not outside.' Perhaps this amounts to making a virtue out of necessity. Anglo cannot easily embark on a significant further internationalisation of its business while it is trapped behind South Africa's rigorous regime of exchange controls. Its most ambitious attempt to expand abroad - by trying to take over London-based Consolidated Goldfields in the late 1980s - ended in humiliating failure. But even in this cloud he sees a silver lining: 'I always think we've been a lucky company, and the luckiest thing that's happened to us for many years was that that bid failed. I'm very sorry for the loss of prestige involved in the failure, but it would never have worked. I don't think we could have got on with the people involved. We would have had continual miseries, and I think it's much better as we are.' For better or worse, Anglo is thus condemned to seek survival in the new South Africa. With his son Nicholas now running the Central Selling Organisation diamond cartel in London, and serving as one of Anglo's deputy chairmen, and grandson Jonathan preparing to join the group from Oxford University, Oppenheimer hopes it will remain something of a family firm. But there is no doubt where its fortunes will be determined. 'If the ship sinks, I shall drown,' says the former chairman, 'but I'm not going to jump overboard.' PERSONAL FILE 1908 Born Kimberley.

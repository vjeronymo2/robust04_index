Ukraine's entrepreneurs, regardless of the forms of  ownership they employ, must do the following within 10 days:     -  Declare at Ukraine's National Bank the availability (or  absence) of their hard currency capital that is kept outside of  Ukraine, specifying all sums, including those obtained as a  result of engaging in entrepreneurship outside of  Ukraine;    -  Submit to Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate  declarations on the sums in their accounts in banks or other  foreign financial institutions, as well as sums of hard-currency  receipts in profits (dividends) obtained as a result of engaging  in entrepreneurship outside of Ukraine.     In the future, such declarations must be submitted on a  quarterly basis.    Ukraine's National Bank and Ukraine's Main State Tax  Inspectorate must keep the pertinent information strictly  confidential.    2. Determine that further external economic activity by  Ukraine's entrepreneurs may only be authorized after they  produce declarations envisaged by Article 1 of the present edict.    3. Bind all of those Ukrainian entrepreneurs who possess  hard  currency, deposited, in violation of the current procedure, at  accounts or as investments outside of Ukraine, to transfer this  hard-currency capital to authorized Ukrainian banks within one  month; in cases where this cannot be done for objective reasons  -- the deadline must be coordinated with Ukraine's National Bank  and with Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate.    Ukraine's National Bank must make public in the press,  within  three days, the list of Ukraine's authorized banks to which hard  currency must be transferred.    4. Ukraine's Ministry of Finance, Ukraine's Ministry of  External Economic Ties, and Ukraine's State Customs Committee,  jointly with Ukraine's National Bank, must elaborate and  implement, within 10 days, a mechanism to inspect the  completeness and reliability of the data that is presented by  entrepreneurs in fulfillment of Article 1 of this edict.    5. Ukraine's Ministry of Statistics, with the participation  of Ukraine's Ministry of Finance and Ukraine's National Bank  must approve and implement, starting from the third quarter of  1994, accountability, on a quarterly basis, of all entrepreneurs  for obtaining profits or dividends in foreign currency outside  of Ukraine.    6. Ukraine's National Bank, ministries, and departments must  report to Ukraine's law-enforcement bodies any information they  have on violations in the established procedure of holding  hard-currency accounts or using securities by Ukraine's  entrepreneurs outside of Ukraine.    7. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers must submit, within one  week, for the consideration of Ukraine's Supreme Council a draft  law of Ukraine on the increased responsibility of Ukraine's  entrepreneurs for concealment or illegal use of hard-currency  profits.    8. In the case of fulfillment of the requirements stipulated  by part 1 of Article 1 and Article 2 of the present edict,  entrepreneurs will not be subjected to the sanctions specified  by the current legislation and their management (officials) will  not be brought to trial or be subjected to any other types of  sanctions.    9. Leaders of ministries and departments and all  entrepreneurs, irrespective of their type of ownership, must be  personally responsible for the fulfillment of the present edict.

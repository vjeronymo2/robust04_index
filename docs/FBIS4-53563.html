			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The government's freeze on  public service charge hikes was "politically necessary,"  economic planning chief Yoshio Terasawa said Friday [20 May],  but he expressed concern about the move's across-the-board  nature.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata had to order the freeze to  bolster consumer psychology and help the economy, the director  general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) told a regular  press conference after a morning cabinet endorsed the freeze.    "I think the very fact that it is across-the-board is  meaningful" for beleaguered consumers, Terasawa said. But he  said he wants to "respect" the EPA's position that hikes in  public service charges should be decided case by case.    He said the move will have little effect on overall prices,  which are quite stable in Japan's still-sluggish economy, noting  that the EPA wants some prices to fall, to reduce disparities  with overseas prices. But he said the freeze "avoids the  negative effect" of more increases.    In his abrupt decision Wednesday, Hata said the government  must show the people it is taking the same bitter cost-cutting  medicine as private enterprises in their restructuring efforts.  But the move to freeze for the rest of the year a vast array of  rate hikes needing government approval, and a request to local  governments to do the same, angered Japan's bureaucracy. Public  opposition by Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito was labeled a  bureaucratic "coup d'etat" by one newspaper Friday.    Some cabinet members called at the morning's meeting for a  drastic overhaul of the system for setting public service  charges, such as highway tolls, utility rates and transportation  fares, Terasawa said.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Economy: Lift in rates increases Clarke's City stock Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's personal stock among City analysts was one of the clearest beneficiaries of yesterday's surprise base-rate rise. The decision wrong-footed most of the market and provoked squeals from business and industry but has lent credibility in the City to the government's low-inflation creed. Part of the reason for the favourable reception lies in the underlying economics. With output growing fast and yesterday's producer price data providing one of the first hints that inflationary pressures may be in the pipeline, the government's argument that base rates must rise soon to avert inflation has already been widely accepted in the City. But the real reason for the positive verdict was more political than statistical. In deciding to raise rates ahead of the Conservative party conference, while most economic indicators suggest that consumer confidence is fragile, Mr Clarke yesterday went part of the way towards convincing the City that it is now economic factors, rather than short-term politics, that are determining the timing of interest-rate rises. Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist with Natwest Markets said: 'It is a bold move for the chancellor to go to the party conference with rates having risen - indeed, to raise rates with inflation this low is probably unprecedented.' Mr David Mackie, UK economist at JP Morgan, said: 'To my mind this can only improve the chancellor's reputation. This move suggests that although Norman Lamont (the previous chancellor) outlined the inflation target as being 1 per cent to 4 per cent, the Bank of England and chancellor are now really aiming for 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent.' However, the verdict on the new system of monthly monetary meetings between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, remains more mixed. On the one hand, many analysts believe the greater openness leaves the Bank with much of the credit for the rate rise. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist in London at the Bank of America, said that the clear message of yesterday's move is that the Bank 'has much more independence in setting monetary policy than it has had in its history'. On the other hand, the logistics of the move has prompted complaints that the Bank's method for announcing a rise is unnecessarily opaque. The complaints may partly reflect red faces in the City. After Bank money-market operations last week - widely interpreted as confirming that interest rates were unchanged - most economists were confident a rise had been postponed. For some economists this pointed to an underlying weakness in the system. One such was Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs who, like many, predicted no rate change. He said: 'The fact that the decision was delayed until Friday means that it is not being taken in the monetary meeting and that is less credibility enhancing.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, agreed. 'I don't see the point of trying to catch the markets out,' he said. Others say it highlights a broader change. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist with Salomon Brothers, said: 'The market has learnt that the process of deciding a rate rise is not black and white . . . but from Mr Clarke's point of view it helps to dampen the notion that interest-rate policy is still politically driven.'</p>

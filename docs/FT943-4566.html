			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Trade embargoes The ending of Malaysia's seven-month ban on public contracts for British companies is probably as much a cause of relief in Kuala Lumpur as in London. The dispute had become an embarrassing headache in both capitals. But while the two sides now seek to restore normal relations, they and other countries should reflect on the wider lessons of this dispute, which underlines the dangers that arise when trade is held hostage to political objectives. Neither side can take much pride in its conduct. The ban, in response to UK newspaper reports that a British company had tried to bribe Malaysian politicians, was misjudged and out of proportion. If Malaysia's real target was the British press, as it claimed, it should have sought redress through Britain's courts. It should also have been encouraged to do so by the UK government and affected companies. To their discredit, some British politicians and businessmen seemed keener to appease Kuala Lumpur, by calling into question the principle of press freedom. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, will doubtless argue that he has lifted the ban because he has made his point. As likely, however, is that it had become counter-productive. Dr Mahathir has ambitious plans for Malaysia to become an industrialised country by 2020. If it is to do so, it will need to continue attracting the inflows of foreign private capital and technology that have fuelled much of its rapid development to date. The trade ban hardly sent a reassuring message to prospective international investors, who have plenty of alternative destinations. Malaysia is far from alone in trying to use trade - or unilateral threats to disrupt it - as a political lever. The US has also sought to do so, when pressing China and Indonesia to improve their human rights records. The Clinton administration also faces domestic pressure to discriminate against imports from countries that do not respect US environmental rules. Such tactics, even when well-intentioned, amount to an attempt by one country to impose its values and standards on others, by force. There is also little evidence that they achieve their objectives. Indeed, in an ever more interdependent world economy, they risk rebounding swiftly on their proponents. Witness Washington's retreat from threats to deprive Beijing of most favoured nation trade status, under pressure from warnings by US companies that such action would jeopardise their efforts to expand business in China. The advance of global economic integration is bound to make the disparities between countries' cultural, political and social values more salient. To cope with the friction, what will be needed is increased efforts to accept those differences and, where necessary, negotiate constructively upon them. Aggressive unilateral trade actions are the wrong response.</p>

First, he was held up by business in his native Donetsk,  where he is again running for the office of deputy to parliament  and was reporting to his voters; then, contrary to etiquette,  his meeting with the American ambassador ran much longer than  expected because of a deep interest on both sides, then Russian  television questioned him meticulously regarding the future of  Ukraine...    He is 61 years old. Heavy-set and deliberate of movement.  His  gaze is intent and penetrating, instantly appraising his  colocutor and the situation. In contrast, his answers are  unhurried and well thought-out. His somewhat colorless voice  comes alive when he "gets going" as his interest is engaged. A  typical "workaholic," for whom work and pleasure are one. He  comes in at eight in the moring and leaves at ten or eleven at  night. He spends all of Saturday and part of Sunday at work as  well. He likes to win and respects results. He is conservative  in his views: he has no use for revolutions and prefers a  peaceful, evolutionary development, retaining all the positive  things that were already achieved before he came to power.    You could call him "lucky" in summarizing his life, or you  could describe him as a otrudyagap [not further identified], who  achieved success through hard work and an unquestionable talent  for leadership. At his age, he is no longer tempted by a career;  he simply wants to help Ukraine in this difficult time with his  experience and knowledge.    He is mining engineer by profession. He has passed through  all the stages of the miner's hard life: from mining foreman to  mine director. His "last love" was the Zasyadko Mine in Donetsk.  Under him, this mine, which had always lagged behind, was  transformed. The plan was one thing, but the fact is that not  only was he able help the mine attain all the achievement  banners, but, more important, he made people's lives a little  happier. Under him, housing construction, which had been at a  standstill, started up: they began with self-financing, building  two-story houses, and now they are erecting 15-story buildings,  with improved plans and with apartments measuring 60 square  meters of floor space. The health resort he built in Sudak on  the Black Sea consists exclusively of first-class accomodations  with bathrooms and kitchens. "As far as I am concerned,  everybody is equal: be they ministers or cleaning women. I do  not divide people into black and white..." Thanks to him, the  mine bought itself a state farm in the old days. Zvyahilskyy  managed to arrange a meeting with Shcherbytskyy, and the latter  put his magical "I approve" on the director's request for  permission to buy the farm. And so the miners had meat, milk,  and butter in large quantities and at production cost.    In the 13 years that he served as director, he won the trust  not only of the mine employees, but also of the residents of  Donetsk itself. For a full year, he headed the Donetsk city  council and executive committee, and then on 11 June 1993, he  was appointed first deputy prime minister by a presidential  decree. Since 22 September, following the departure of Kuchma,  he has served as acting prime minister and simultaneously first  deputy prime minister of Ukraine. Although the president is  currently the official head of government, having taken on the  additional burden of the duties of two deputy prime ministers --  responsible for the economy and for the fuel and energy complex  -- Zvyahilskyy in fact heads the reorganized Cabinet of  Ministers. It is no mere chance that the first question we asked  him was:    [Timofeyeva] In your opinion, what is the economic situation  in the country, and what has the government succeeded in doing  and what has it failed to do so far?    [Zvyahilskyy] The situation in the country remains  complicated, but there are some signs of stabilization of the  economy. We have been able to curb hyperinflation a little:  compared to December, when it was running very high, it fell by  a factor of 4.5 in January-February. We have stabilized the  exchange rate of the Ukrainian coupon -- it has virtually  remained unchanged since January. The prices of food products  are holding and not rising. And in some oblasts, for example, in  Donetsk, the price of butter has fallen by 7,000 coupons. The  prices of sugar and alcoholic beverages are also dropping...    We now have new forms of clearing operations with the  different sectors of the economy. We are not opening new credit  lines for the farms; instead, we are giving them credits in the  form of goods in exchange for future finished production in  1994: fertilizers, spare parts for machinery... And when they  bring in the harvest, they will give the state their production  at equivalent prices. This will also help stabilize the economy  and prevent funds from being squandered.    [Timofeyeva] What priority tasks have you set yourself for  the coming year?    [Zvyahilskyy] The principal task is to solve the problem of  clearing operations among enterprises and farms on a nonemission  basis.    [Timofeyeva] You are accused of pursuing an extremely rigid  line, which makes one to wonder if you are not perhaps returning  to the earlier command-economy methods of managing the economy.  What is your response to this charge?    [Zvyahilskyy] Market relations are regulated everywhere. Go  back to history, look at the United States, Germany, and other  countries. Strict regulation was the only thing that enabled  them to overcome their crises. And, generally speaking, why  should the state renounce functions that are part of its  responsibilities? Why should exports and imports flow  uncontrolled? We had total liberalization of prices in Ukraine  for two years. And now we are seeing the lamentable results of  this policy. Why should a person be able to come to the exchange  and buy a million dollars without anyone knowing whether he has  returned this million to Ukraine or moved it abroad? We have now  proposed something else -- a tender committee instead of an  exchange (the operations of the exchange have been suspended for  the time being). But now I know that if five million dollars are  bought to pay Russia for gas, tomorrow this money will be on its  way, and the day after tomorrow we will have the gas we paid  for. We also have to control the price of energy supplies. Three  or four months ago, dealers held back oil products and kept them  standing while they waited for a large issue of money to be  injected into the market (they are no longer satisfied with a  price of 12-13 million; they are waiting for it to reach 15  million...) Why should they be allowed to control the economy by  speculation? That is not what a market is all about. To begin  with, it is our state enterprises, the State Oil and Gas  Committee and Ukrahroservis, that should be buying the oil. We  follow the weekly reports from the Mediterranean area plats [not  further identified]. We calculate, watch, compare this with our  own currency exchange rate, and determine that the price of oil  products in Ukraine should be 150 dollars and not 240 or 250, as  some would like. We have set a fixed rate of exchange for  petrodollars for the priority branches of industry and we  maintain it. You see, ultimately petrodollars enter into the  price of flour, bread, milk, meat... This being the case, why is  that what we are doing is viewed as wrong? Who can explain this  to me? Yes, reforms are under way, including in agriculture. Is  privatization not reform? And holding down prices on food  products -- is this not reform?    [Timofeyeva] How do you understand the term "Ukrainization  of  the economy," which is used from time to time to scare the  Russian government?    [Zvyahilskyy] That is Gaydar's idea. He is the one who  believes that it is not necessary to regulate the economy and  that reforms will happen of their own accord. Fortunately for  Russia, the proportion of its exports is still higher than its  imports and that every year it receives a certain sum of hard  currency, which it can infuse into the economy and thus curb  inflation. But what will happen when there are no more exports?..    The inordinately high nonpayment amounts are strangling both  Russia and Ukraine. But your prices have begun to climb, while  ours have stabilized. Why? Because we regulate the exchange rate  of our currency. I do not interfere in the production process  and tell a plant director that he must not make engines but must  make meat grinders instead... No. Technology, production, raw  materials -- these are all up to the one organizing production.  My only requirement is that there be a demand for your product.  It must be exportable and competitive. If you produce for the  warehouse and then demand that the government give you money  because you cannot sell your products, what purpose does this  kind of production serve? Let these producers either switch to  making something else or declare bankruptcy. Towards this end,  we need to work out a program to protect the unemployed.    Take our banks as an example. They were completely  unregulated. When the tax inspectorate came, it was shocked at  the number of abuses it found. What makes a banker more valuable  than an academician, allowing him to pay himself a salary of 150  million? Why does a miner, who works underground in extremely  difficult and dangerous conditions, earn a maximum salary of  four million coupons? We decided that the maximum salary should  be six million. Anything above six million and you pay a  progressive tax up to 90 percent. And what does raising bank  interest rates from 250 to 400-500 percent mean? It means higher  prices, which fall as a heavy burden on the shoulders of the  people. And so now if a banker hikes up rates, we will collect a  higher percentage from him. That is the point of state  regulation -- to prevent businessmen from artificially elevating  the prices of essential goods and products.    [Timofeyeva] We have heard talk behind the scenes here that  Ukraine is planning to join the CIS not as an associate member  but as a full-fledged partner in this union. Is this true?    [Zvyahilskyy] Yes, and we are planning to consider this  matter very carefully at a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers  in the very near future.    [Timofeyeva] How do you think your proposal will be met?  Will  you not be accused of betraying the interests of Ukraine? What  effect will this have on the fate of your government?    [Zvyahilskyy] Sensible people who wish Ukraine well, who are  distressed by the state of their country's economy, will  understand. As to the attitude of others -- on their conscience  be it...    [Timofeyeva] What has made you decide to run again for  parliament? Is this a reflection of your precarious position in  the government, or is this a determination on your part to  combine the duties of a deputy with those of a prime minister?    [Zvyahilskyy] Let me answer you as follows. I was elected  deputy four years ago as a candidate of the labor collective of  the Zasyadko Mine in the Kiev district of the city of Donetsk,  where there are 103,000 voters. I recently held eleven meetings  with members of this constituency. At just one meeting --  attended exclusively by pensioners and veterans of the Great  Patriotic War -- nearly 1,000 people showed up. I talked with  people at the mines, who had just come off their shifts. In  short, with people who are accustomed to speak the truth to your  face. And at no time did I hear an insulting tone or a  provocative remark. People talked of the hardships that surround  them, made suggestions, expressed criticism, but with concern  rather than agitation. This is normal. In the four years that I  served, I fulfilled virtually all the mandates of those who  elected me, even though these were rather large. It gave me  moral satisfaction to have been able to help people. But all  these mandates still need to be carried through to completion  and followed to ensure that they are fulfilled. Thus, if I did  not run again from the same district and from the same labor  collective that put forward my candidacy, my conscience would  bother me that I had failed to perform my duty. This is the main  reason.    Then, too, if I am to represent the interests of the people,  I need to be a people's deputy, so that I can deal on an equal  footing with other deputies, who otherwise could say to me at  any moment: we have been elected by the people, and who are you?    [Timofeyeva] What tasks do the coming elections have to  solve? Who needs them to begin with -- the government, the  deputies, or the people?    [Zvyahilskyy] This was the will of the people in all the  regions, both east and west. And the will of the people must be  obeyed. As a matter of fact, I supported this at the session of  the Supreme Council and voted for it. This idea was supported by  the miners and metallurgists. Ending the crisis in the economy  requires that something be sacrificed. So let us sacrifice  ourselves.    [Timofeyeva] Does this mean that these elections will bring  a  new government, new people onto the scene: will the parliament  not have to confirm it?    [Zvyahilskyy] This can happen. Although I think that  frequent  changes of government will hardly help to stabilize the  situation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 12 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen told visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa on Sunday [12 June] Beijing doubts the effectiveness of  economic sanctions planned for North Korea over its suspected  nuclear arms development, Japanese officials said.    Qian made the comment during a meeting with Kakizawa, who  arrived from Seoul earlier in the day after talks with South  Korean leaders.    Kakizawa told Qian China's positive commitment is important  in the debate over what response the international community  takes through the United Nations Security Council to North  Korea's rejection of unimpeded access to its nuclear facilities,  the officials said.</p>

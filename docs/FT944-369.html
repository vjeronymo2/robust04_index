			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fisons downgraded by IBCA IBCA, the European rating agency, has downgraded the long term rating of Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment company, from BBB+ to BBB. The short term rating remains unchanged at A2. IBCA said that Fisons' profits warnings with the interim results announced in September, came after four years of deteriorating income coverage ratios. 'With only limited cash generated by operations, it is difficult to see where long term support for the large capital and R&amp;D expenditure will come from, although in the short term further disposals could be made,' IBCA said.</p>

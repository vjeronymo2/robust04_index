			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tax laws blamed for rethink at Lippo LIPPO, one of Indonesia's largest property and financial services companies, has withdrawn a corporate restructuring plan announced last year. Under the plan, holdings in six subsidiaries were to be transferred to Lippo Pacific Finance (LPF), a quoted company, in a move expected to cost Rp250bn (Dollars 121m). Lippo says changes in Indonesian tax laws last September have made the cost of the restructuring prohibitive. 'The process was too bureaucratic and the potential tax liabilities much higher than planned,' one executive noted. Under the restructuring, LPF was to acquire up to 51 per cent of Lippobank, Lippolife, Lippoland, Lippo Industries and Multipolar - all quoted companies in which Mr Mochtar Riady, the group's founder, is a leading shareholder. LPF was also to acquire 100 per cent of Lippo Merchants, a privately-owned finance company. Brokers say consolidating the group under LPF could have solved the illiquidity which has plagued trading in some subsidiaries' shares. The price of Lippo Industries' shares last moved in November, while Lippo Life's share price has remained stagnant since September. But Lippo executives are bullish about the group. Its assets in Indonesia are split between the banking sector (Dollars 2.25bn) and non-banking, mainly property, sectors (Dollars 900m). It also has assets of about Dollars 1.5bn outside Indonesia, mainly in Hong Kong. The group's Indonesian businesses should grow at 20 to 30 per cent a year in the medium term, executives forecast. Such growth is 'not necessarily spectacular' given Indonesia's risks as a developing country, an official explained.</p>

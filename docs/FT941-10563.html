			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel tunnel rail service delayed again The long-delayed launch of train services through the Channel tunnel is to be postponed again, it was announced yesterday. Some problems are taking longer than expected to resolve, explained Euro-tunnel, the company which runs the tunnel. They included hitches in the hydraulic system and alarm warning lights. 'The systems work, but in some areas we have not achieved the reliability we want,' the company said. 'In the hydraulics, for example, we need to make a few adjustments.' Passenger shuttle services are not therefore expected to start on May 8 as previously planned. Freight services, previously due to start next month, may be delayed until April or early May. They are nevertheless scheduled to start before May 6, when the tunnel will be officially opened by the Queen and President Francois Mitterrand. Eurotunnel said the tunnel was structurally sound and no significant problems had been encountered, but the complexity of the commissioning programmes had meant some tests had had to be repeated and others had been rescheduled. 'We want to offer a completely reliable service and we thought it was better to guarantee this even if it meant a slight delay before opening,' said Mr Christian Zbylut, director of Eurotunnel's freight operations at Calais. He said the problems that had been revealed during tests were usual in such a high-technology project. 'On one locomotive there are about 500 tests which have to be performed,' he said. The Pounds 10bn project was originally planned to open in May last year but has been hit by recurring delays. Control was handed over to Eurotunnel by Transmanche Link, the contracting consortium, last December. The Road Haulage Association said it was disappointed by the delay, but did not believe that large numbers of road hauliers had intended to use the tunnel from the outset. Those affected would re-route shipments to ferry services. CTL, a freight company that had planned to run two trains a day through the tunnel to Italy starting on March 14, said it was better for Eurotunnel to delay the launch so that when it did start it could provide a reliable service. Eurotunnel yesterday offered refunds to passengers who had planned to travel through the tunnel in May. Passengers who are able to delay their journeys can use their tickets when the tunnel opens.</p>

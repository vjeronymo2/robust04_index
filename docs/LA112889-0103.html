			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE CONSIDERS LIMIT ON PRESIDIO CLOSURE  </P> <P> A compromise added to a $286-million defense appropriations bill now before the  U.S. Senate is increasing the possibility that some military functions could  continue at San Francisco's historic Presidio even after most of it is closed  and converted into a national park.  </P> <P> The compromise, approved by the House, would allow the Army to lease back and  operate the historic Letterman Army Medical Center, some Army Reserve training  facilities, some of the 1,186 houses, its commissary and day-care center.  </P> <P> Skeptics say the bill only authorizes a study of these options and does not  require the Army to lease any facilities from the National Park Service, which  by law takes possession of the park-like base when the Army departs.  </P></p>

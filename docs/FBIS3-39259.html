			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "old" report: "Trust Agency Organizes `Last </F> Reserves'"]    [Text] Berlin -- The 1993 promise by the German banking  sector to buy Trust Agency companies for a total of 1 billion  German marks [DM] has yielded only a "minimum result" so far.  This was stated by Heinrich Hornef, financial director of the  Trust Agency, in a talk to correspondents in Berlin. So far,  only two companies have been taken over by banks. In addition,  the Trust Agency has received four specific declarations of  intent for taking over Trust Agency companies. Serious  examinations are still under way for 10 to 15 companies, Hornef  said. If one takes DM20 to DM40 million each as being needed to  improve the companies, 30 to 50 companies should be sold.    Within the framework of a "last reserve," the Trust Agency  will once again offer 50 to 60 appropriate firms for examination  by the banks. In deviation from the original concept, minority  participation has also been offered. "Our imagination will not  be insufficient regarding the use of the DM1 billion. The Trust  Agency is ready for unconventional solutions," Hornef said.    As one of the reasons for the low success of the bank DM1  billion, Hornef cited differences in opinion about the  portfolios of the companies. At first, the Trust Agency wanted  to offer the companies in portfolios consisting of 10 to 25  companies each. The banks, however, insisted on individual  negotiations. Hornef accused the institutes of having reacted  too slowly and inflexibly as a whole.    In 1993, two company portfolios with 32 companies were sold  to the banking sector outside the Solidarity Pact. Without  Trust Agency involvement, land banks took over 13 east German  companies for a total of DM150 million. Of the 214 companies,  which the Trust Agency offered to the banking sector and of  which most were sent back to it, the Berlin Agency has meanwhile  sold almost 100 to other interested persons.</p>

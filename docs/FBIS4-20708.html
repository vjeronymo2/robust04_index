Armed Islamic Movement [MIA], Armed Islamic Group. The death  on Saturday of Sid Ahmed Mourad (alias Djaafar El-Afghani, alias  Seif Allah), in a spectacular operation mounted by government  security forces has revived enmities between the two militant  Islamist organizations. It also poses once again the problem of  the congeries of armed Islamist groups and their relations with  each other and the FIS. Given the paucity of information  available on the subject, it is extremely difficult to  characterize these relations. Thus far the only light shed on  the murky subject of the armed Islamist groups was furnished by  the trial of those responsible for the terrorist attack on  Algiers airport; everything else is conjecture. It was through  the trial, for example, that we learned that [armed] groups had  already formed and were prepared to go into action long before  the interruption of the January 1992 legislative elections.    The attacks on the border station at Guemmar in November  1991, and against Blida in spring 1990, are proof of that.    One of the groups ready for armed action was Tekfir Oua  El-Hidjra ("Redemption and Exile" [i.e., declare infidel and  withdraw]), led at the time by Ahmed Bouamra ("Ahmed the  Pakistani") and Nourredine Seddiki. Composed mainly of  "Afghans," the group had declared the Islamist parties "impious"  on grounds that voting was against the Shari'ah [Islamic law].    The group was rapidly dismantled by security forces after  Seddiki's death in April 1992. Bouamra has vanished into thin  air, and people have quit talking about him. The second group  was led by Allel Mohamed, alias Moh Leveilley, a young  Hussein-Dey merchant and cabaret habitue who joined the FIS when  it was riding high. He formed his group during the FIS  insurrection of June 1991, joining forces with Ben Mekhebi Fethi  (alias Abou Doujana), Nourredine Bouferra, Ben Tebbiche, and  Abdelhak Layada, his successor.    The third group ready for armed action was led by Mansouri  Meliani, who was tried for the airport attack, sentenced to  death, and executed last August.    By his own admission to the Special Court of Algiers, he had  established his "Djamaat Islamiya Moussalaha" (Armed Islamic  Groups) about the same time as Moh Leveilley. The decision was  taken, he explained, when security forces tried to restore the  motto "By the people and for the people" to the facades of the  APCs [People's Communal Assemblies] in place of the Islamist  motto the FIS had substituted. The restoration, it will be  recalled, resulted in some nasty confrontations between security  forces and Islamist militants.    Meliani said it was these confrontations that had prompted  him to action, not the arrest of the FIS directorate, whom he  accuses of "compromising with the regime."    Meliani then made contact with Sid Ahmed Lahrani, imam of El  Feth de Bab El-Oued mosque, who was killed in March 1993 at  El-Biar; Abdel Nasser Leulmi, a teacher at the CEM [College of  Intermediate Studies] of Bordj El-Bahri, killed in September  1992; Si Ahmed Mourad (Djaafar El-Afghani); a certain Abdelhalim  of Benzerga; and the imam Cheikh Nacer from Ouled Yaich. Meliani  explained that in order to avoid the mistakes committed by  Mustapha Bouyali, precursor of the armed struggle, he opted to  recruit his people first and weapons later. He organized his  movement by naming three coordinators: Lahrani (Center),  Si-Ahmed Mourad (East), and Leulmi (West). The group won  notoriety in February 1992 with the attack on the naval repair  station near the Admiralty in Algiers, an attack that left seven  soldiers, a policeman, and two attackers dead.    The groups headed by Bouamra, Allel, and Meliani are unique  in that in addition to being independent of each other they have  also managed to avoid being controlled by the FIS.    That was not the case with the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA)  led by Chebouti, or the Haraket addawla al islamiya (HDI) led by  Said Mekhloufi, who were close to the Islamist party. When the  leaders of that movement--notably Mohamed Said and Abdelrezak  Redjam--escaped the clutches of the law and opted for armed  struggle, they realized they count not count on Said Mekhloufi  or Omar Eulmi (founder of the SIT [Islamic Labor Syndicate] and  brother of Abdel Nasser, who was killed in April 1993) to unify  all the groups. So they picked Abdelkader Chebouti, whose past  actions had made him rather a legend in his own time. Chebouti  let himself be convinced. Mekhloufi and the Eulmi brothers did  not oppose him. Hocine Abderrahim, principal instigator of the  airport attack, later sentenced to death and executed, and  Bennouis and Guitli, two long-time Bouyali confederates who  later joined the FIS, also supported the decision. But Meliani  and Allel balked.    An initial effort at unification was made in April 1992, at  a  meeting held in Zbarbar. The meeting was hosted by a group  active in the Bouira region headed by a certain Hocine  Moutadjer. In addition to the latter, the meeting was attended  by Chebouti, Meliani, Mekhloufi, Omar Eulmi, Abderrahim,  Abdelkader Bennouis, and Guitli; Allel Mohamed did not attend.  The meeting created a formal structure for the armed movement:  Chebouti was made national emir, Meliani national coordinator,  Mekhloufi director of military affairs, Eulmi the mufti, and  Moutadjer and a certain "Bouratili" treasurers. Guitli and  Bennouis were put in charge of the political and information  commission, and Abderrahim was made coordinator of the Algiers  region, with Said Soussene (later sentenced to death and  executed) and Djamel Ressaf (now a fugitive, recently expelled  from France) as his deputies; Kamr Eddine Kherbane (now a member  of the FIS executive body in exile) was chosen in absentia to  handle external affairs. But two days after the meeting, Mehani  went back on his promises and withdrew (as he put it) his  allegiance to Chebouti.    On the ground, in terms of operations, Allel's group has  been  responsible for the most bloodshed. He was assisted by Soussene,  who participated in an ambush in which five policemen were  killed in July 1992 at Boudouaou. His arrest led to the  dismantling of Allel's group, 10 of whom were killed at their  hide-out in Baba Hassen in August 1992. Before that operation,  the security forces had struck another spectacular blow on 27  July 1992 with the arrest of Mansouri Meliani. These two events  shifted the balance of power, and Chebouti was once again in the  strongest position. Moreover, he had just received word of fresh  support from Ali Benhadj, who said in a "fetwa" smuggled out of  prison that if he were released he would place himself at  Chebouti's orders. The meeting at Tamezguida on 31 August 1992  was supposed to consecrate his ascendancy. Allel Mohamed,  weakened by the loss of 10 members of his group, agreed to come  to Tamezguida accompanied by two of his deputies, Abdelhak  Layada (now in prison) and Nourredine Bouferra. But the meeting  was aborted due to a security sweep of the area that resulted in  the death of Allel and his deputy Bouferra. The meeting could  not be held, and Layada took Allel's place. The apprehension of  the latter, who was suspected of giving certain names to the  authorities--notably Si-Ahmed Lakraoui and Yekhlef Cherrati  (arrested at his El-Harrach hide-out in February 1993)--opened  the way for Djaafar El-Afghani, who apparently inherited all the  survivors from El-Hidjra Oua El-Tekfir (whose philosophy he also  appropriated), the Allel group, and the Meliani group, which had  picked him, as noted previously, to be eastern coordinator of  the Djamaate Islamiya Moussalaha. The preeminent role of Djaafar  El-Afghani was also confirmed by Layada himself in an interview  with the daily EL MOUDJAHID last October, during the hearing  before the magistrate of the Special Court of Algiers. Layada  also said in the interview that he had headed a group of 600 men  in various locations around the country.    The relations between Layada and the FIS are rather  tumultuous--especially with the children of Abassi Madani and  with Rabah Kebir, whom Layada accuses of having diverted  millions of dollars he claims were earmarked for the armed  groups. His "mufti," Omar Leulmi, in a cassette circulated  clandestinely, rejected all the pretensions of exiled FIS  leaders to speak for Islamists, going so far as to threaten them  with death.    The death of Omar Leulmi, followed several weeks later by  Layada's arrest, seems not to have altered relations between the  latter's successor and the FIS. Proof came with the  assassination of former prime minister Kasdi Merbah, an act for  which GIA claimed responsibility while the FIS blamed it on the  security forces. It was thanks to this assassination that the  GIA came to dominate the political and media scene.  Subsequently, the GIA was to claim the 24 October 1993 abduction  of three French consular agents and the assassination of Mohamed  Bouslimani, who apparently had refused to issue a "fetwa"  endorsing the murders committed by the organization. The deadly  attacks against foreigners that have taken 21 lives since 1  December are attributed to GIA, which had presented one of the  three French consular agents an ultimatum giving foreigners a  month to leave Algeria on pain of death. The ultimatum indicated  that there would be no more "warnings or abductions" and that it  would be "more violent than in Egypt."    The deadline was scrupulously observed, and two days after  its expiry a Spaniard was slain on the road between Khemis  Miliana and Berrouaghia. The most recent victim of this series  of killings that has taken 21 lives is Joaquim Grau,  assassinated in his bookstore on Rue Didouche Mourad on 22  February.    Before the deadline expired, two French surveyors, three  Latin American technicians, and two Soviet training officers had  been assassinated at Sidi Bel-Abbes, Tiaret, and Laghouat,  respectively. The murder of the two French surveyors was  officially attributed to a group called "Unified Companies of  the Jihad" headed by a former "Afghan," Kada Benchiha,  apparently affiliated with the GIA. A different group that seems  to be wreaking havoc in the Titteri and Ouarsenis regions is  headed by another "Afghan," Sayeh Attia, famous as the author of  the murder of 12 Croats last December as well as the ambush that  cost the life of the wali of Tissemsilt and his companion. Since  Si Ahmed Mourad, Kada Benchiha, and Sayeh Attia all three saw  action in Afghanistan, it is quite likely they are all members  of the same organization. There is also a striking similarity in  their methods of execution: slitting their victims' throats and  atrociously mutilating the bodies. Politically, GIA has  distinguished itself by its mistrust of all Islamist leaders who  want a dialogue with the authorities, threatening them with "the  worst of deaths" and affirming, in two successive communiques,  that "the mujahidin are in command." When Anwar Haddam and Rabah  Kebir for the first time condemned assassinations of  intellectuals, the GIA replied by warning its supporters against  "djamaate who have been seduced by media celebrity and the lure  of power" and "forgotten the oath of unity in the ranks of the  mujahidin." Rejecting contacts between the regime and the FIS as  "maneuvers designed to stop the jihad," the GIA communique  accused Said Mekhloufi of being an undercover agent of Algerian  security and claimed his goal was to foment an implosion in the  ranks of the mujahidin. The GIA claims to have thwarted the plot  and executed 70 infiltrators. It promises the same fate to their  "chief," Said Mekhloufi. The FIS has reciprocated the accusation  of working with the security services. "GIA does not belong to  the FIS. I find that this movement has sometimes claimed credit  for curious things, such as the murder of Kasdi Merbah, which  everyone knows was the work of the regime," says Kamr Eddine  Kherbane, who as noted above is a member of the FIS executive  body overseas, and was given responsibility for the movement's  "external affairs" at the April 1992 meeting in Zbarbar.    In an interview last December with the French weekly NOUVEL  OBSERVATEUR, Kherbane, a former air force officer who served as  chief of security for the FIS, announced the birth of the  Islamic Army of Salvation (AIS), which he considers "the only  armed branch of the FIS." According to Kherbane, the AIS now  includes Chebouti's MIA and Said Mekhloufi's HDI.    In a situation in which responsibility for attacks is seldom  claimed, it is difficult to establish how much of the activity  is this organization's doing. But observers agree in saying it  is strongest in the mountains of Bouzegza, Zbarbar, and the  Jijelian region.    However that may be, the frictions between AIS and GIA are  so  acute that analysts concluded--overhastily and ineptly--that the  death of Djaafar El-Afghani resulted from an informer's tip  triggered by these divergences.    This sparked a quite virulent reaction from Anwar Haddam,  who  several weeks ago called for an end to the terrorist attacks.  According to Mr. Haddam, the death of Djaafar El-Afghani--whom  he described as the "mujahid commander"--was an "assassination"  that imperils dialogue between the regime and the FIS. "Dialogue  would be pointless if the regime perseveres in the liquidation  of innocents," he says in a communique reported by AFP.    Haddam's statement may only reflect panic at the prospect of  possible GIA reprisals to avenge its leaders. But whatever it  represents, it has done nothing to attenuate dissensions between  the GIA and the FIS. And there is no doubt that if the latter  agreed publicly to give evidence against Djaafar El-Afghani's  organization, its power to do ill would diminish, since it would  then be constrained to act openly. Unless Haddam's reaction was  just the prelude to a rapprochement meant to strengthen his hand  in talks with the regime. Although there is no basis as yet for  predicting what position the dissolved Islamist movement will  take toward the GIA, it is safe to say it is not going to break  with Chebouti's organization. If negotiations between the regime  and the FIS continue, the fate of Chebouti and his confederates  will have to be discussed. Thus the head of the MIA, already the  recipient of Chadli Bendjedid's favor, would have an excellent  chance of escaping further criminal prosecution. But here we  cross the line into political fiction.</p>

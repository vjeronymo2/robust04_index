			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Markets report: Peso slumps to record lows against US dollar IN the aftermath of the Christmas holiday, the American foreign exchange markets continued to provide the main focus of market interest, write Lisa Bransten and Gillian Tett. The dollar was steady within year-end ranges against major currencies yesterday while the Mexican peso hit record lows against the US currency. Late in the session the US currency was mixed against the Japanese yen and the D-Mark. The dollar rose modestly to Y100.44 up from Y100.18 late Friday, while falling slightly to DM1.5758 against the German currency from DM1.5790 Friday. Meanwhile trading in Europe was extremely quiet, with London and several other major exchanges still closed after the Christmas holiday. The peso added to last week's dramatic losses yesterday falling about 10 per cent against the dollar. By late afternoon the same-day, 24-hour and 48-hour contracts closed 50 centavos down to 5.40/5.60 new pesos to the dollar while same day contracts fell 1.05 new pesos from Friday's close to 5.55/5.75. Last week the peso lost 30 per cent against the dollar. Activity in the peso market was extremely volatile. Many traders were watching the Mexican stock market for clues about what the peso might do. The bolsa's key IPC index plunged further in late afternoon trading. Some traders attributed the peso's continued plunge to growing tension in the state of Chiapas as the anniversary of the peasant uprising in that state approaches. On January 1 of this year a group in Chiapas launched a rebellion against state authorities that remains unsettled. Late in the day, the US Treasury department a statement saying that 'recent movements in the peso have gone far beyond what can be justified by economics.' In Washington a World Bank official was quoted by Reuter as saying that Mexico was unlikely to draw on the Dollars 6bn swap facility arranged between its central bank and US agencies to calm financial markets. He said that it could only tap it in the event of a 'real catastrophe', such as the collapse of oil prices. Against major currencies, the dollar was trading within recent ranges. Margaret Kudarauskas, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Thomson Financial Services, said there was no fundamental reason for the dollar's gain against the yen. She added that rumours of orders to sell large amounts of dollars of the currency runs up between Y100.50 and Y101 would probably keep the US currency below the Y100.50 mark. The dollar's loss against the D-Mark came as that currency gained against other European currencies. Volume on US currency markets was extremely light with most market activity due to companies purchasing foreign exchange for business reasons, not traders betting on rising or falling currency values, according to Ms Kudarauskas. The peso continued to be the main focus of the day, as it plunged to a new low point against the dollar in nervous trading. Most market activity yesterday - and most of last week - was due to companies purchasing foreign exchange for business reasons, not traders betting on rising or falling currency values, according to Ms Kudarauskas. Trading in Europe was extremely quiet yesterday, with the London exchanges remaining closed. Sterling weakened slightly against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.438, down from Friday's close of DM2.441. Against the American currency it also weakened fractionally, closing at Dollars 1.546, down from Dollars 1.547 at the close on Friday. Trading in the European crosses was also extremely quiet, although the lira slipped slightly against the D-Mark, as the Italian currency continued to be undermined by the political uncertainty gripping the country. The Turkish central bank raised its overnight lending rate to 110 per cent in the afternoon from 95 opening to control dollar rates, bankers said.</p>

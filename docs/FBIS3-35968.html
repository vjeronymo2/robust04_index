			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Democratic  Reform Movement (RDRM), denied a report published in the  February 1 edition of the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW  DAILY) to the effect that he told his group's convention he  wanted the alliance-style relations with the United States  discontinued.    "I did not mention any issue related to alliance relations  with the U.S.A. in my report," Popov told INTERFAX Tuesday. In  his words, the RDRM wants "Russia to seek long-term allies and  the U.S.A. can be one of them."    He also denied having said that the RDRM platform called for  "large scale government control and financing."    Popov thinks that "reliance on the West and the Western  development option did not work in the sense that the West was  unable to offer resources for reforms in Russia and the recipes  the West offered Russia made the situation here worse."    He emphasized that "the International Monetary Fund's  recipes  were not what the developed countries had used themselves but  what they had offered to underdeveloped countries."    "What they had to offer to Russia was a Latin American  option," Popov said.</p>

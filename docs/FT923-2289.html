			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: RMC Group Anyone tempted to get carried away by the link between financial markets and the real economy should listen carefully to RMC. Sterling's devaluation will obviously boost the impact on translation of German profits in the second half; but judging by yesterday's interim trading statement there is no quick fix to continuing overcapacity and price pressure in the UK. If anything, there is a danger that the illusion of instant recovery will encourage weaker competitors to delay difficult closure decisions, thereby prolonging the agony. One can sympathise with RMC's determination to hang on to its concrete market share on the grounds that it should be a long term winner: refusal to close plants will nevertheless keep the squeeze on margins in the short term. There is a similar obduracy about aggregates, of a kind which can only make the likes of Tarmac, ECC and Evered Bardon wince. Besides the problem of surplus capacity, any help to volumes from interest rate cuts over the next 18 months will more than likely be offset by lower infrastructure and commercial property activity. The encouraging bit is that RMC has experienced no slowdown yet in Germany, which accounted for more than 50 per cent of operating profits in the first half. The outlook for next year, though, remains uncertain and elsewhere in Europe Spain and (to a lesser extent) France are flagging. At their current level - up 34p at 443p - the shares are only for genuine long termists.</p>

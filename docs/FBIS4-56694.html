			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Carlos Arturo Angel Arango, president of the </F> National Association of Industrialists, ANDI: "Economic  Prospects Are Not Clear"]    [Text] The main forces driving  growth are beginning to flag. It will not be easy to achieve  results similar to those obtained in '93.    Last year was a good year for the economy, but the positive  trend did not extend to all sectors. The foreign trade trend,  inadequate saving, and declining production profits were the  sore spots.    Nor are prospects for 1994 clear. Not only will the  aforementioned factors persist, but the main forces driving  growth are already beginning to flag. That being the case, it  will not be easy to equal last year's results this year, whether  in terms of growth, the industrial effort, price trends, or the  exchange rate.    1. Economic growth: According to the DNP [National  Department  of Planning], the Colombian economy grew at a rate of 5.16  percent in 1993. If one excludes coffee, the figure rises to  6.46 percent. This is unquestionably a good effort, given the  fact that it is the highest of the past five years. Furthermore,  it was achieved in a context of low growth rates for the world  economy and three years into the process of opening up the  nation's economy.    The pattern is uniform if one proceeds by sector. Financial  and personal services rose over 6 percent, electricity, gas, and  water by 12.6 percent, and construction by 9.3 percent.  Agriculture, industry, and mining were below the general average  (2.7, 1.9, and .1 percent respectively).    Measures were recently adopted to restrict credit for the  purpose of reducing liquidity and forcing a decline in overall  demand. While this alternative does contribute to the  anti-inflationary policy, it is disturbing in short-range terms  that one would opt to limit demand instead of stimulating  productive activity, given the existing productive capacity.    2. Manufacturing industry: According to figures supplied by  DANE [National Administrative Department of Statistics], growth  including coffee was 4.1 percent at the close of 1993 and 6.03  percent without it. The trend was not uniform throughout all  sectors, however. In fact, roughly 44 percent of our industrial  production, which generates 36 percent of all manufacturing  jobs, is currently at a standstill or deteriorating. It is  important to stress the extraordinary effort of the equipment  and transport sector (45.9 percent), which was largely  responsible for driving industrial growth. If we exclude this  sector from the total including coffee, growth falls from 4.11  to a fairly unsatisfactory 1.8 percent. Nor did sectors linked  to construction activity have a strong showing.    In 1993, problems of profitability arose related to the  process of opening up the market. On the one hand, sectors that  ship a large share of their production to the foreign market  were affected by the slow rate of devaluation.    On the other hand, other sectors that focus more on the  domestic market face competition from imports, both legal and  illegal, competition that has prevented them from adjusting  their prices based on cost trends. This is the case of tobacco,  paper, rubber and rubber products, chemical substances, and  professional and scientific equipment. Industry's prospects for  1994 are uncertain, although there is good reason to be  optimistic about certain sectors. In its Macroeconomic Plan, the  DNP predicts growth of 4 to 4.5 percent in the industrial GDP,  explained by the increase in the amount of capital accumulated  and expansion in overall demand.    Factors that may stimulate industrial activity include the  following: the foreseeable recovery of the world economy;  moderation of inflationary trends; investments in development of  the hydrocarbon sector; the vigor of public spending; growth in  the construction industry, although at a slower rate than in the  past; the anticipated expansion of regional markets as a result  of integration; improved competitiveness resulting from  decisions to convert and modernize production; and the  availability of credit.    The uncertainty in question results from: rising production  costs associated with social security; the drop in real wages  and increasing difficulties faced by regional economies,  particularly Venezuela; the expectation of a larger revaluation;  the persistent replacement of national production by imports;  and the declining vigor of the automotive sector.    3. Inflation: One has to recognize that the current  administration managed to check the upward trend of prices since  the latter half of the 1980's. Industrial prices have  demonstrated behavior consistent with the goal of reducing  inflation. This situation is in contrast with the evolution in  goods and services provided by the government, which have stayed  at a level far above the general average. The reduction in the  general level of prices was achieved at the expense of  agriculture.    For 1994, the government has proposed consumer inflation of  around 19 percent. While this is a desirable goal, one does  perceive any number of factors that could compromise its  achievement. Topping the list is the fact that the agricultural  sector will not continue to make a significant contribution to  any reduction in the general level of prices. It is a fact to be  taken into account when one considers that without the  agricultural sector, the consumer price index has fluctuated  about 25 percent over the past two years. At the same time,  fiscal management and the control of those prices which the  government does regulate will be fundamental if the goal is to  be achieved. In this connection, one must recognize the  government's commitment to adjusting rates to the anticipated  rate of inflation.    In other words, the major responsibility for meeting the  goal  of inflation set clearly falls on the government's shoulders.  This is particularly so when one considers the fact that in  industry and agriculture as well, the margin left for raising  prices has been cut, among other reasons, by exposure to foreign  competition.</p>

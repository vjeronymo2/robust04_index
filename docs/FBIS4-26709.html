			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Song Jian, state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and  Technology Commission, inspected some nature reserves in  northwest China's Shaanxi Province from June 22 to 24.    He visited the Foping Nature Reserve of wild plants in  Hanzhong Prefecture, the panda living area at Changqing Forest  Bureau and the Shaanxi Provincial Observation Station for  crested ibis.    After listening to reports about work in the nature  reserves,  State Councillor Song said that while concentrating their  efforts on protecting the wild animals and plants, nature  reserves should try to make full use of their ecological  environment to develop the local economy so as to raise funds to  enable the protection work to continue.    He said that in some areas with the right conditions, a  certain scale of animal husbandry and tourism is allowed and to  breed endangered wildlife is encouraged.    State Councillor Song noted that satisfactory achievements  have been made in protecting the crested ibis and the panda,  which were both on the edge of extinction, adding that this  showed that as long as everybody paid attention to protection of  wild animals and plants, big progress would be made in the  building of a good ecological environment.</p>

			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TO ALLOW BRAIN TEST TO AID SALCIDO DEFENSE  </P> <P> A Sonoma County judge has cleared the way for accused mass murderer Ramon  Salcido to travel to UC Irvine this month for a state-of-the-art brain scan  that could aid his defense -- if the university will accept him.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge R. Bryan Jamar on Tuesday denied a motion by Deputy Dist.  Atty. Peter Bummerts that Salcido not be removed from the Sonoma County jail  without a special court hearing. Bummerts had warned that flying Salcido to  Southern California could be a security risk.  </P> <P> However, Salcido's defense attorney, Public Defender Marteen Miller, said  Wednesday he believes a positron emission tomography (PET) scan, a brain  imaging technique that can detect subtle brain malfunctions, could reveal that  Salcido has suffered organic brain damage.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old winery worker could face the death penalty if convicted of  killing seven people -- two of his three daughters, his wife, mother-in-law,  two sisters-in-law and his boss -- in an April 14 shooting rampage. The  killings shocked Sonoma County and prompted a manhunt that ended with Salcido's  capture in Mexico.  </P> <P> A finding of brain damage might help persuade a jury that Salcido lacked the  willfulness and premeditation required for a first-degree murder conviction or  sway a judge toward leniency if Salcido is convicted, Miller said.  </P> <P> The UC Irvine Brain Imaging Center, however, has not decided yet whether to  accept Salcido as a patient, according to Miller.  </P> <P> The center's director, Dr. Monte R. Buchsbaum, "indicated he didn't want to use  this as a fishing expedition to try to find something (abnormal)," Miller said.  </P> <P> "He wanted some definitive data that there is some brain dysfunction, then he  would go in and explore it further," Miller said.  </P> <P> Buchsbaum was out of the country and could not be reached for comment  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Miller said he has evidence that Salcido may have suffered brain damage. He  said the evidence consisted of an electroencephalogram, or EEG, showing some  disturbance in the right temporal lobe and the fact that Salcido had suffered  injuries, including electrical shock, as a child.  </P> <P> UCI's PET scanner has already been used by defense attorneys in two other  trials. In 1985, Buchsbaum performed a PET scan on mass murderer Barry Wayne  McNamara, who later told psychiatrists that he had been told to kill his family  by voices on TV. The psychiatrist testified that McNamara's PET scan was  consistent with other testimony that the defendant was schizophrenic.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Bummerts, however, said defense attorneys will have "a long row to  hoe" in making such claims for Salcido.  </P> <P> "We have a statement from him that to me is clear that he knew exactly what he  was doing, that he had a purpose and that he tried to succeed in accomplishing  his purpose" by the shootings, Bummerts said. "Proving this claim now that it  wasn't premeditated is going to be a difficult proposition."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department is preparing to keep Salcido  under tight wraps if he makes the trip to Irvine. Sgt. Norm Hardin said even  the date of the PET scan will be kept secret.  </P> <P> Although Salcido has not received death threats, he is being held under maximum  security and in complete isolation, Hardin said.  </P> <P> "It's primarily because of the larger-than-normal amount of notoriety that this  case has received," he said. "This isn't the normal run-of-the-mill murder.  </P> <P> "We do want to protect Ramon to make sure he has the day in court that the  Constitution allows him."  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Estates &amp; Agency With income static and no exceptionals to boost this year's figure, Estates &amp; Agency Holdings, which owns property investments in the UK, saw pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 slide from Pounds 1.11m to Pounds 708,000. Operating profit was down from Pounds 787,000 to Pounds 708,000 and there were no exceptionals this year (Pounds 324,000). Income was Pounds 5.06m (Pounds 5.05m). Earnings per share came out at 9.64p - a 7.33p decline of which 5.4p relates to the exceptional income taken in 1992. The delayed sale of the site at Marsh Mills in Plymouth has now been completed and the directors can therefore recommend a final dividend for both 1992 and 1993, of 2p and 7p respectively. With the addition of the interim of 0.5p (1992 2.5p and 0.5p) this makes an increased total for the year of 7.5p (5p).</p>

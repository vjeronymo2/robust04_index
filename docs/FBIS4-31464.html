			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 9 (CTK) -- Mutual respect of the  differences between Russia and the Czech Republic is a condition  of good relations between the two countries, President Vaclav  Havel said in an interview for the latest edition of the Russian  weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. This was his first interview with a  Russian paper in his capacity as Czech president.    "We feel we belong through historical tradition to Europe  which is called Western. Russia is standing with one foot in  Europe, but is in Asia with the other, which is a different  world. I think we must live in friendship, based on a rich  structure of relationships. I cannot imagine the world without  this. At the same time, there is no reason to deny the  difference which exists between us," Havel said, pointing to the  "evident difference between Russia's spiritual, historical,  cultural and political world, and that, let us say, our, Central  European."    "I believe that we must respect the specific Russian space,  but Russia, too, must bear in mind that is up to us to decide on  where we want to stand," Havel told the paper.    "Russia must be a fundamental partner for that Europe which  is called Western, while Central Europe is striving to be  considered its part," Havel said. "Of course, local peoples do  not think that Russia is trying to interfere with our affairs  more than with those of other states, or that we belong in some  sphere of interests or influence. This is an unequal position.  No one can dominate. The relations can be improved only on the  basis of the principle of total equality. To tell the truth,  this part of Europe is somewhat disturbed at some voices from  Russia which seem to suggest that Russia considers us its zone  of interest, and that it would like to endorse our right to  enter these or those organisations," Havel stated.    On the recent achievements of the left in some Central and  East European countries, Havel noted that "it does not seem that  the political pendulum would swing to this side in the Czech  Republic in the foreseeable future." There are many, also  historic, causes of this, because "unlike Poland and Hungary,  there was most conservative communist regime in the Czech  Republic," Havel said.    Havel said he did not consider the shift of power to the  left  a signal of the return to communism. "This is simply a symptom  of a period of democratic development. In some democratic  countries more left-orientated parties are at power, while  elsewhere there are more right-orientated parties. I would not  draw any far-reaching conclusions from this," he added.    Regarding the communists' position in the Czech Republic,  Havel said that at present three parties have succeeded the  former communists, while "two of them are reform-minded (SDL,  the Democratic Left Party, and LB, the Left Bloc) and I can  imagine their normal participation in a democratic system."  "The third is more conservative, uniting the older, more  orthodox communists who are not able to relinquish the ideology.  However, I do not think they could jeopardise democracy," Havel  said.</p>

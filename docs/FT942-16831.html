			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Trade News: Free trade plans in pipeline A list of countries which the Clinton administration considers eligible for free trade agreements with the US will be presented to Congress in the summer. Mr Jeffrey Garten, Commerce Department undersecretary, said yesterday that a country's eligibility would depend on factors such as economic reform, openness to imports, and protection for intellectual property rights. He drew distinctions between such countries and those suitable to join the North American Free Trade Agreement - requiring approval by both Canada and Mexico. Chile's prospects were brightest, he said, and Argentina 'will merit consideration in the very near future'. On a recent trip to Latin America, Mr Garten stressed that free trade throughout the Americas was still the Administration's ultimate goal. In the meantime, the US was committed to a process of integration which was as inclusive as possible, transparent - 'to encourage reformers' - and designed to open trade, not to create exclusive blocs.</p>

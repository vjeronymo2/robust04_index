			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Lloyd's sets up market board LLOYD'S has set up its new 18-member market board. The board will start operating on January 1. It has been formed following a recommendation by a Lloyd's task force which reported last January and called for the separation of the regulatory and business responsibilities of the Lloyd's council. The insurance market hopes the market board will be the driving force for worldwide development of its business. The board consists of members drawn from inside the market with three external underwriting members. The external members are Mr Paul Myners, chairman and chief executive of Gartmore Investment Management, Mr David Newbigging, chairman of Rentokil, and Mr Nicholas Pawson, chairman of FMI. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman-elect, who led the task force and will be the market board chairman, said the composition of the regulatory board would be announced in the new year.</p>

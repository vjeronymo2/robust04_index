			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Algeria's 'too much blood, too many tears': A look at the escalating violence that has claimed nearly 4,000 lives The Algerian government began a new round of talks with opposition leaders this week to seek an end to Islamic fundamentalist violence that has killed nearly 4,000 people in two years. A day after two more Frenchmen were killed, bringing the number of foreigners murdered to 31, Spain joined France in urging its nationals to flee the country. Violence against foreigners is aimed at scaring away international capital and know-how vital to Algeria's economy, but Algerians themselves are dying daily in this two-year-old fight by Islamic militants to topple the army-backed government that cancelled elections in January 1992. President Liamine Zeroual, who called last week for talks 'without exclusion', met members of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria led by former president Ahmed Ben Bella on Wednesday night, officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The discussion was described as 'positive', but there was no elaboration. President Zeroual's call, however, is yet to be heeded by any leading fundamentalist groups. The Islamic Salvation Front, which seemed set to win the elections because of voter anger with high unemployment, corruption and government mismanagement, has been banned and its leaders imprisoned. Meanwhile President Zeroual, who also holds the defence portfolio, has bolstered the authority of the chief of staff, General Mohamed Lamari, who is a believer in 'eradicating' the supporters of radical political Islam and has been at the forefront of the repression against such groups since last summer. After a campaign of assassinations of servants of the state - policemen, soldiers, judges and mayors - militants have turned to killing doctors, writers, sociologists and journalists in their struggle to turn Algeria into a country ruled by strict Islamic Sharia law. They have also taken to killing women who refuse to wear the veil. Anger at the government's inability to stem the terrorism and opposition to 'any form of dialogue with the fundamentalists' brought 50,000 demonstrators out on to the streets of Algiers, and thousands more in five other centres around the country on Tuesday this week. The march was led by the widow of the director of the Fine Arts School of Algiers, Mr Abdellah Asselah, who was shot in the head by members of the most radical Islamic group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA), two weeks ago in Algiers. His son, Rabah, 22, a student at the school was wounded and died shortly afterwards. 'Too much blood, too many tears, together we save Algeria,' protesters chanted. 'Women have dignity and won't accept shame.' In an 'open letter' to President Zeroual, the women's groups said that they 'reject exile, submission and compromise'. The marchers threatened to organise themselves into self-defence groups and demanded that the army give them weapons to defend themselves. Marches also took place in Oran, Annaba, Constantine, Bejaia and Tizi Ouzou. Intellectuals have been caught up in the confrontation between a nomenklatura which has held power and privilege for 30 years and the radical Islamists who say in their tracts that 'those who criticise us with their pen will die by the sword'. Mr Said Allah Djaafar (the sword of God), one of the leaders of the GIA, recently told a magazine, that intellectuals were 'apostates' who deserve the same fate as 'Jews, Christians and foreigners who are part of a colonial plot to commit profanities on our country. If they are liquidated, that will destabilise the impious Algerian regime and help return the country to the reign of Islam as defined by the prophet Mohamed'. The GIA's most prominent victim in recent weeks was Mr Mohamed Alloula, the 53-year-old playwright and theatre director. He enjoyed popular success with one recent play, Ladjouad (the Veil). In 1969, at the height of Colonel Boumediene's dictatorship, El Aleq (The Bloodsuckers), was a powerful satire of the country's all-pervasive bureaucracy. Last year a psychiatrist, Professor Mahfoud Boucebci, was warned against interpreting people's dreams by militants who claimed the Koran was the only source of truth. He spoke out against those whose aim was 'to destroy science in the name of Islam'. He was murdered last June. The knives used in these murders are redolent of sacrificial acts: 'honour' can only be washed with blood, 'witnesses' must be present at the 'sacrifice'. Friends of the writer Mr Tahar Djaout, who was murdered last June, and of Mr Alloula believe that in both instances a contract was put out to kill them. Contract jobs of this kind are increasingly frequent, usually carried out by young people. In some instances, they have been drugged before. Recently, women have been targeted in acts of apparently random violence - usually raped, often murdered. Last month, a school girl of 17 was murdered as she was leaving school at Mefta, near Blida, south of Algiers. She had refused to wear a veil. Two foreign wives of Algerian citizens have been murdered recently - that they had converted to Islam was deemed of little consequence.</p>

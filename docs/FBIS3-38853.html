			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Greece will not veto any  decisions by NATO and the European Community to intervene  militarily in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Greek European Affairs  Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here Wednesday [9 February].    Speaking in the European Parliament, he said: "We cannot  block decisions by our partners (in the EC and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation)."    Pangalos was speaking at a plenary session of the  Euro-Parliament on behalf of the current Greek presidency of the  E.C., which ends on June 31.    Greece has made clear it is opposed to military intervention  in Bosnia, including the use of air strikes against Serb  positions around Sarajevo.    Pangalos reiterated the Greek position, but said Athens  would  not stand in the way of its partners which are poised to give  the green light for air bombing of the Serb positions.    The Greek minister said all the countries in the  neighbourhood of the Bosnian conflict were against military  intervention, except Turkey.    He was speaking as NATO ambassadors in Brussels met to  decide  on an ultimatum to the Serbs, that they cease their siege of  Sarajevo and withdraw their artillery from around the Bosnian  capital or face NATO air attacks.    NATO decisions need unanimous support, which means also the  backing of Athens.    Greece accepted a decision of E.C. foreign ministers in  Brussels on Monday that the EC should use all possible measures,  including air attacks, to break the siege of Sarajevo.    The Euro-MP's were generally supportive of NATO military  action. French Socialist Euro-MP Leon Schwartzenberg said: "If  we don't want to act, let us at least give the (Moslem) Bosnians  the means to defend themselves."    Liberal Dutch Euro-MP Jan Willem Bertens said the arms  embargo of former Yugoslavia should be lifted, and the Bosnian  Moslems armed to defend themselves, if the Serbs did not accept  a cease-fire in two weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Takis Dhiamandis] </F>   [Text] In a new effort to smooth the tension between Greece  and Albania, yesterday Albanian President Sali Berisha proposed  another Greek-Albanian meeting.    According to a report yesterday by Albanian Television,  Berisha, who is visiting Bucharest, told reporters that the  meeting in Zurich between foreign ministers Karolos Papoulias  and Alfred Serreqi was successful because both sides showed they  wanted to solve the crisis. He suggested another meeting be  held in Tirana to continue the talks and resolve the problems.  He said the meeting's aim will be to smooth bilateral relations.    The Albanian president did not say when this meeting would  be  held. It is significant that many people in Tirana wonder what  happened to cause Berisha's sudden turn.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Gathering storm in ERM THE BANK OF FRANCE intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday, buying the French franc, as continuing strains in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism raised doubts about whether the system of fixed parities could survive for long, writes James Blitz. The franc fell to FFr3.40 per D-Mark in European trading yesterday, its lowest level since mid-October, putting the currency at the centre of a gathering storm in the ERM. The market in European currencies was extremely jittery yesterday, and a number of ill-defined rumours circulated that ERM members would quit the system if Germany refused to cut rates. However, dealers were increasingly convinced that the Bundesbank is not about to unwind this latest round of tension by easing credit policy. Yesterday's figure for M3 German money supply growth in October - at 10.2 per cent - quashed vague speculation that a cut might come at tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting. Dealers reported heavy selling of the French franc for D-Marks. Some stressed that the selling was nothing compared with the pressures that forced the lira and sterling out of the ERM earlier this year. However, pressures are building. The French authorities intervened twice in the European day, defending the currency at FFr3.40, and short-dated French money market rates rose sharply. Strains also intensified in the Irish punt and Danish krona markets, with central banks in both countries intervening to support their currencies. Irish overnight rates shot up to 75 per cent, from around 30 per cent the previous day, although this did not stop the Irish currency falling to its ERM floor against the Belgian franc, which is the strongest narrow band currency in the system. Analysts said that a devaluation looked increasingly inevitable after the Irish general election, because of the loss of trading competitiveness caused by the recent devaluation of sterling. The Danish krona also weakened, only just managing to stay above its ERM floor against the Belgian currency, despite extremely high overnight rates. Mr Christopher Potts, an economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, said that it was hard to believe that the markets were about to re-run the battle of the franc that was waged in the summer. 'The key now is the attitude of the Bundesbank,' said Mr Potts. He believes that strains can be avoided if the Bundesbank eases policy in the wake of the wage and budget negotiations in progress. Mr Potts says that the second battle of the franc would not be won by raising French interest rates. 'That would not be credible now that the market is placing a new premium on economic growth.'</p>

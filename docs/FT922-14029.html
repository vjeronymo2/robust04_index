			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Orion losses widen to Dollars 29m ORION Pictures, the US film company whose Silence of the Lambs last week walked off with five Academy Awards, yesterday unveiled a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 29.2m, or Dollars 1.30 a share, against a deficit of Dollars 15.6m, or 75 cents, a year earlier. In spite of its string of successes - Orion has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since December. The results coincided with an announcement by New Line Cinema, an independent US film production and distribution company, that it might scupper its rescue plan for Orion if it could not reach an agreement with Orion creditors by next Tuesday . Mr Michael Lynne, New Line's president, said he was disappointed the key parties were unable to resolve their differences. New Line has been working with Metromedia, which has a 70 per cent stake in Orion, to propose a joint reorganisation plan. Under the proposal, New Line would inject about Dollars 12.5m in cash into Orion and Mr Kluge's Metromedia would match that amount. Orion's bondholders would receive about 45 per cent of the outstanding captal stock of the reorganised Orion,and New Line would hold about 46 per cent Orion. Metromedia would be left with about 7.5 per cent of Orion. A Dollars 29m note from Orion to Metromedia would also be exchanged for equity in New Line, leaving Metromedia with about 11 per cent of New Line stock. Orion's malaise was reflected in its third-quarter figures. Revenues fell to Dollars 94.8m from Dollars 119.4m the previous year, while the company's gross profit tumbled to Dollars 4m from Dollars 19.3m. For the first nine months, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 102.1m or Dollars 4.54, against a loss of Dollars 14.9m, or 78 cents, a year ago. Restructuring costs were Dollars 6.23m in the nine months and Dollars 4.89m in the quarter. Mr Peter Jovanovich, former president and chief executive of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, has left the publishing and insurance company for Macmillan/McGraw-Hill's school publishing division.</p>

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: De Beers steps through dividend minefield - Philip Gawith previews the South African diamond group's 1992 results out today WHEN the board of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the world diamond market, gathers in Kimberley today to consider the 1992 financial results and dividend, it will be the focus of unprecedented attention. A terse announcement seven months ago - 'The directors advise that the current outlook indicates a significant reduction in the final dividends' - sent the De Beers share price and Johannesburg Stock Exchange into a tailspin. It also unleashed an avalanche of unfavourable publicity on the company. At the time, the air was thick with accusations that De Beers was either misreading or misleading the market. Many analysts were left with egg on their faces and investors with heavy losses. Since then, sentiment towards the company has improved, but it remains very skittish. De Beers' shares, for example, plunged nearly 7 per cent on Wednesday last week to R62.75, before recovering slightly. The key question today is by how much De Beers will cut the dividend - something it has done only once before. Most analysts are forecasting a cut of between 30 and 40 per cent, from 112 US cents a share in 1991. But some forecasters estimate the cut could be as high as 50 per cent. Apart from De Beers' August dividend announcement, which effectively compels it to cut the dividend, a reduction is a financial necessity. Dividend cover has fallen over the past four years to a level where there is very little leeway to hold the dividend if earnings fall - as they are sure to do. Investors and brokers will also anxiously scrutinise De Beers's balance sheet to ascertain how much it has spent mopping up the excess diamond supply that had bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De Beers controlled company that sells 80 per cent of the world's rough diamonds. At the same time as the dividend announcement, De Beers imposed quotas which reduced the amount of diamonds the CSO would buy from producers by 25 per cent. This wrong-footed most brokers, and there is now considerable nervousness about what De Beers will decide to do next. This partly reflects the high risk of forecasting errors. The secrecy and complexity of the industry mean analysts are dealing with imperfect information. But it is also a function of confusing market signals. Despite the US recovery, the weak state of other world economies, especially Japan's, ought to be bad news for the sale of luxury items like diamonds. News, however, from 1993's first two rough diamond auctions - known as 'sights' - tells a different tale. Trade estimates suggest the two sights were worth a total of about Dollars 850m, nearly 50 per cent more than the estimated Dollars 580m for the comparable auctions in 1992. Analysts resolve this anomaly by arguing that the pick-up in sales is artificial. De Beers, they say, last year limited supply so much that it caused a shortage which led to a firming of prices and larger sights. Higher sales, however, do not reflect the underlying reality that production far outstrips demand. One possibility is that the good sights, together with the CSO's recent 1.5 per cent rise in the prices it pays for rough diamonds, show that De Beers is trying to soften the blow of lower earnings. Whatever the outlook for CSO sales in 1993 - most analysts seem to think they will rise marginally to Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars 3.4bn in 1992 - the improved state of rough diamond sights will have no bearing on De Beers results to be announced today. These will certainly show a considerable fall in earnings, in large part due to its decision, effective from September, to impose quotas on producers. This obviously affects all De Beers's own mines - in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Analysts are predicting that earnings per share, including retained profits from associates, will fall by 20 to 30 per cent from 283 US cents in 1991. There is little prospect of the CSO quotas being scrapped, since the gap between production contracted to the company, probably about Dollars 5bn, and actual CSO sales, remains considerable. There is broad agreement among analysts that by imposing quotas, by mopping up rough stones outside the CSO and by keeping sights tight, De Beers has done a good job in performing its traditional role of maintaining order in the market. Mr Kevin Kartun, analyst at stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, notes: 'Once more the De Beers/CSO arrangement has restored stability . . . I don't think anyone else could have done it.' Mr Des Kilalea, analyst at broker Martin &amp; Co, endorses this view. 'I think they've done their job. The doomsday scenarios one was hearing about are a lot more distant now.' He adds, however, that De Beers is not yet out of the woods. Two problems held back De Beers last year: weaker-than-anticipated demand, as world economies failed to pick up; and increased supply as a flood of diamonds emerged from Angola. On the first count, the pick-up in the US economy is not sufficient to offset the anaemic performance of Europe and the increasingly fragile Japanese economy. And, while floods and renewed hostilities in Angola have dampened supplies that from country, Mr Kilalea comments: 'It is not a problem that has been cured. It is one that has been shelved.'</p>

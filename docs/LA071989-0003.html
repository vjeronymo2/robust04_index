			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JACKSON HITS HOMER IN RETURN AS ROYALS WIN  </P> <P> Bo Jackson, returning after missing five games because of a thigh injury, hit a  435-foot home run and drove in five runs to lead the Kansas City Royals to a  9-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers Tuesday night at Kansas City.  </P> <P> It was Jackson's 22nd home run of the season, and if the Royals have a chance  to overtake the Angels and the Oakland Athletics in the American League West,  they will need Jackson's power.  </P> <P> Kansas City also will need a healthy George Brett, who has recovered from torn  knee ligaments suffered while playing on artificial turf.  </P> <P> Brett's hitting is making it easier for Jackson to get good pitches.  </P> <P> Brett had three hits, scored four runs and drove in two in the victory that  kept the Royals only 2 games behind the two leaders in the West. Every time  Jackson batted Tuesday night, Brett was on base.  </P> <P> When Jackson was out, it was Brett who kept the Royals from losing.  </P> <P> Brett failed to get an invitation to the All-Star game for the first time since  1975, his second major league season, but immediately after the break went on a  hitting streak.  </P> <P> In his last seven games, Brett is 13 for 26, has scored 11 runs, hit three home  runs and driven in 10 runs. He has raised his average 30 points to .268.  </P> <P> "When I came off the field after hurting the knee, I said, 'You can take this  turf and stuff it,' " and vowed never to play on artificial turf again.  </P> <P> "I had time to sit around and think. What can I do to get away from this stuff?  I still have four years left on my contract. (two years guaranteed).  </P> <P> "I've tried using plastic spikes, instead of metal, but that didn't do any  good. The last injury came when my spikes caught as I tried to throw the ball."  </P> <P> Baltimore 4, Seattle 3 -- There is a tight race in the West, but in the East,  the surprising Orioles go merrily on their way.  </P> <P> Craig Worthington, who has given the Orioles a regular third baseman for the  first time in years, delivered the big punch for their fifth consecutive  victory in this game at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Worthington hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning to give Jeff Ballard  (11-4) a 4-1 lead and four relievers held off the Mariners.  </P> <P> The Orioles lead the Yankees by 7 1/2 games and Toronto by 8 1/2.  </P> <P> Oakland 7, Detroit 2 -- Dave Beard, trying to make a comeback, fooled Dave  Parker the first time he faced him.  </P> <P> But when Beard (0-1), making his first major league appearance since 1985,  tried to do it again, he got the ball up and Parker hammered a three-run home  run at Detroit.  </P> <P> The home run gave Storm Davis (8-4), who combined with three relievers for a  four-hitter, the victory. Davis, who needed help in the seventh, is 5-1 since  coming off the disabled list June 10. Dennis Eckersley pitched a hitless ninth.  </P> <P> The A's Jose Canseco did not play.  </P> <P> Minnesota 5, Cleveland 4 -- In a league that uses the designated hitter, a  pitcher can trail, 4-2, in the seventh and stay around.  </P> <P> Frank Viola (8-10) did that at Minneapolis and wound up with a career-tying  best of 11 strikeouts.  </P> <P> Jim Dwyer's short sacrifice fly scored Gene Larkin with the winning run in the  ninth. Larkin was on with his fifth hit.  </P> <P> Texas 8, Boston 1 -- In a matchup of probably the two hardest throwers in the  American League at Arlington, Tex., Bobby Witt outpitched Roger Clemens.  </P> <P> Witt pitched a two-hitter and, though he walked six, had eight strikeouts for  his third complete game and an 8-8 record.  </P> <P> Clemens, 4-1 with an ERA of 2.10 in eight previous starts at Arlington Stadium,  allowed eight hits and eight runs and walked seven in 6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> New York at Chicago -- -- The White Sox, going for their sixth in a row, were  stopped by rain at Chicago. They were leading, 2-1, and still batting in the  first inning when a rainstorm ended the game. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

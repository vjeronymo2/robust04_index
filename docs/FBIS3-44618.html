Situated in suburban Shanghai, the 90 industrial  establishments operating in the zone registered five billion  yuan in gross industrial output, 328 million U.S. dollars in  export earnings and 1.372 billion yuan in profits tax, according  to the local authorities.    In other words, for every one yuan invested in  infrastructure, this 2.13-sq-km zone attracted 4.26 U.S. dollars  of investment, earned 5.08 U.S. dollars in foreign exchange,  turned out 75.28 yuan in gross industrial output and created  20.2 yuan in profits tax.    A local official attributed the success to the zone's policy  of placing priority on the quality of projects introduced. The  zone was designed to be built into a high-tech base when it was  founded in 1986. Most of the products manufactured there are  hot-sellers on the international market, such as computer discs,  laser devices and medical products.    The official said 37 percent of the operations and investors  have decided to plow their profits back to enlarge the scale of  production.    Construction is now going smoothly for a 1.37-sq-km  expansion  of the zone.</p>

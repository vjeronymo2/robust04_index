			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Harrovian Arthur Daley with a famous mum - The son of the former prime minister tells William Lewis he is not the seriously wealthy fixer the media claim him to be The image of Mark Thatcher in newspapers and on television is of an extraordinarily wealthy arms industry fixer who shamelessly exploited his position as the only son of the world's most powerful woman in the 1980s to amass a reputed fortune of Pounds 40m. It is an image created by rumour and speculation, however, rather than by hard fact. It has never been dispelled in part because Mr Thatcher has refused to comment in detail on the allegations. To ascertain the true picture, the Financial Times has scoured pages of company filings and court documents in the US and UK. His close business associates have been interviewed, including some who have fallen out with him. For the first time in many years Mr Thatcher made himself available for a lengthy interview on his affairs. What emerges is a subtly different picture. There can be little doubt that he exploited his mother's connections, although he insists that everything he did would have been achievable even if his mother had never become prime minister. With continuing speculation about why he was mixing in defence industry circles at the time of the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia, the question of the propriety of his behaviour as the then premier's son remains open. But the tales of his fabulous wealth seem a long way from the truth. Far from being a super-rich Mr Big of the arms world, Mr Thatcher appears to be a relatively small-time wheeler-dealer, a sort of Harrovian Arthur Daley with a famous mum, who has attempted investments in a wide range of industries with limited financial success. In Texas, where he lives with his American wife and two children, Mr Thatcher remains an enthusiastic follower of his mother's free-market entrepreneurial philosophy and still hopes to join the ranks of the fabulously wealthy one day. As for his current net worth, he confirms that it lies between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m. That is a highly plausible figure, on the basis of the value of his homes in Houston and London and details compiled by the Financial Times of his business interests and lifestyle. Mr Thatcher himself points to his seven-year-old BMW and denies reports that he employs a butler to travel with him. Mr Thatcher said: 'This whole idea that I have had tremendous success is just a myth. If I had tremendous success I would not be running around trying to do the things that I am doing. I would be sitting on my own private island in the South Pacific, but I am not.' Certain questions remain regarding the exact source of the more modest wealth to which he admits. It may also be in his interest to understate his net worth at the moment, due to widespread reports that his wife Diane is seeking a potentially costly divorce settlement. Mr Thatcher denied this: 'No divorce, and any speculation of it is just fanciful.' Nevertheless there is little evidence to support claims that he has made significant profits from the US business investments he has developed since 1987. Conservative party officials suggested that they were the source of a multi-million pound fortune. Instead his US business experience has been coloured by a series of bitter boardroom fights and at least one big legal case. What was probably his first significant deal in the US was partly funded by his mother's closest business supporters. It has emerged from court documents in a case involving Mr Thatcher that Hanson, the UK quoted conglomerate, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, were co-investors with him in a Dallas-based home security company, Emergency Networks. Hanson has given more than Pounds 500,000 to the Conservative party since 1987 and Mr Li has also donated substantial sums. The deal was carried out in 1987, the same year as his mother achieved her third consecutive general election victory, making her one of the most powerful politicians in the western world. Mr Thatcher helped put together a consortium of wealthy individuals and companies to invest in Emergency Networks in a complex business arrangement. He did it with Mr Bruce Leadbetter, who was also his partner in the newly formed Grantham Company - an investment vehicle named after the birthplace of Mr Thatcher's mother. Mr Leadbetter is a long-time business associate of Mr Jay Pritzker, one of the owners of the Hyatt Hotel chain. Mr Thatcher described his role in putting the consortium together: 'Bruce and I sat down and worked out what we wanted to raise and wrote out a list of people and got on airplanes.' They needed to find Dollars 1.5m, which Mr Thatcher said 'is a very difficult number to raise because it's a lot of money'. He said: 'You can run around the golf club and raise a hundred grand - you can raise money from your dentist, accountant, a few friends and come up with a hundred grand. 'Between one and a half and five million is the most difficult because no institution will look at anything where the minimum investment is less than five, they just can't afford to do it.' Among those who did agree to invest as limited partners in Xpart, an investment vehicle set up to buy more than 50 per cent of the share capital of Emergency Networks, were some of the biggest names in US finance and political circles. A US subsidiary of the UK conglomerate Hanson and Mr Li each paid Dollars 100,000 for an Xpart stake giving them each 3 per cent of Emergency Networks. Others who invested were Mr Bruce Babbit, now US interior secretary, Mr Pritzker, and Mr Joe Refsnes from Rauscher Pierce and Refsnes, the Dallas-based investment bank. Mr Thatcher also invested in Emergency Networks through Xpart and became a non-executive director of Emergency Networks. Mr Leadbetter, who became an Emergency Networks director, was the sole director of a separate investment vehicle which controlled the Xpart consortium's investment. Mr Thatcher denies having exploited his mother's position to put the deal together. He said the investment group was formed with a view to securing future reinvestment for Emergency Networks from the same companies and individuals. More money was indeed raised later on, according to Hanson, when another Dollars 10m was raised from shareholders. Hanson itself invested another Dollars 300,000 in an interest-bearing debenture, of which all but Dollars 30,000 was subsequently repaid. For a time Emergency Networks was successful. By the end of 1991 the company had 36 sales facilities nationwide and was installing more than 10,000 home security systems every month, grossing more than Dollars 90m a year. Mr Thatcher's financial share in this success was limited. He says that his shareholding in Emergency Networks never rose above 5 per cent and in 1990 he sold out for an undisclosed sum to Mr David Wallace, currently his closest business associate and a former treasurer of Lady Thatcher's fund-raising organisation, the Thatcher Foundation. Grantham, the company jointly owned by Mr Thatcher and Mr Leadbetter, had a management service agreement with Emergency Networks. It was Grantham's main business from 1987 to 1989. According to Mr Wallace, who was a paid member of staff at Grantham during this period, the company was also active in looking for investment deals in a range of industries including a record distribution company, two printing companies including one in Mexico, and a real estate development in Colorado. None of these yielded any substantial returns. Having sold his Emergency Networks shareholding, Mr Thatcher remained on the board of Emergency Networks and in January 1992 Mr Thatcher and Mr Wallace agreed to provide a Dollars 1.1m loan to the company, which had hit financial difficulties a year earlier. They did this by participating in a total Dollars 27.5m loan made to Emergency Networks by EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors. It turned out to be a wasted effort as later that year, on September 15 1992, Emergency Network filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. It is now undergoing Chapter 7 proceedings in Dallas, the equivalent of liquidation in the UK. By the time of its collapse Mr Thatcher was no longer officially connected with the company, having been dismissed from the board in July 1992, according to Mr Thatcher himself. His removal, with Mr Wallace and other directors, followed a dispute with Mr Leadbetter. Mr Thatcher blames the falling out on the close relationship Mr Leadbetter had with EDS, Emergency Networks' main lender, while also acting as a director of Emergency Networks. An Emergency Networks board meeting was called to discuss the issue, but five days before it was due to meet Mr Thatcher and the other directors were dismissed by Mr Leadbetter. He was able to do this through his control of the Xpart investment consortium. But Mr Thatcher refused to walk away. He and Mr Wallace were still owed Dollars 1.1m and they began legal proceedings against EDS last June in Houston to get the money back. According to Mr Wallace the legal fight lasted just one week as EDS agreed to a secret out-of-court settlement. Mr Thatcher said: 'I did make money out of Emergency Networks. I made in percentage terms a reasonable return on my investment.' But he refused to discuss the terms of the settlement with EDS. Hanson was not so lucky. It lost Dollars 130,000 when Emergency Networks collapsed, although Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, believes most of that may still be recovered. In 1990 the Grantham company which Mr Thatcher had formed with Mr Leadbetter was superseded by a second investment company, also called Grantham, half owned by Mr Thatcher and Mr Wallace through their respective companies - Bomark Inc and Birmingham Investments. From its formation the new Grantham company looked at a number of investments in a range of industries as the first Grantham company had done. It was not until the end of 1992 that it took on its first significant management role - in the Ameristar Fuels group, a Dallas-based aircraft fuel organisation which had been set up in June 1990 to sell jet fuel to airlines. Mr Thatcher took a low profile but played a significant role in the company, helping Mr Wallace become a leading shareholder and director. Mr Thatcher's most direct involvement was through the management agreement the new Grantham company signed with Ameristar in October 1992. Through this Grantham was paid Dollars 23,000 a month by Ameristar. At the beginning of 1993 Mr Wallace became a 20 per cent shareholder in the Ameristar group, later raising his stake to a controlling 50 per cent. Mr Wallace's estimated Dollars 2.5m investment was funded partly by Mr Thatcher, partly by his own personal funds, and partly by a loan from a mysterious Jersey-registered company called Diversified Capital which Mr Thatcher introduced him to. Although not a director of Ameristar, Mr Thatcher attended a number of board meetings and had an office at the company's headquarters. Mr Thatcher plays down the extent of his involvement in Ameristar, but details of it are likely to be at the centre of a law suit to be filed next month by Mr Jay Laughlin, a former Ameristar shareholder. He is intending to add Mr Thatcher as a defendant to a legal petition which already includes Mr Wallace. Mr Laughlin will allege that Mr Thatcher and Mr Wallace conspired to take control of Ameristar and that Mr Wallace was just a 'front man' for Mr Thatcher. Mr Laughlin claims Mr Wallace persuaded him to cede control of the company last year on the ground that additional investment was required. Mr Laughlin says he was then squeezed out completely last January. Ameristar Fuels Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in August and has a deficit of liabilities over assets of more than Dollars 6m. Mr Laughlin's lawyer is considering bringing the lawsuit against Mr Thatcher under the civil clauses of America's anti-racketeering legislation which could result in Mr Thatcher having to pay Dollars 3m personal damages. Mr Wallace and Mr Thatcher deny Mr Laughlin's allegations and say they will be contesting any action. Meanwhile, the search for riches goes on. Mr Thatcher has two big business ventures at the moment, one a substantial property development in Dallas and the other in Azerbaijan, the former Soviet republic, which is thought to partly involve the provision of high-quality paper. Baroness Thatcher visited Azerbaijan two years ago but Mr Thatcher explained that his interest started when an American woman familiar with Azerbaijan walked into his office. Mr Thatcher said: 'She walks in one day and says: 'Mark there are some incredible opportunities down there, why don't we have a look at it?' I thought I need this like a hole in the head, but I gave her a very modest budget, about Pounds 20,000, and said: 'Fine, go and have a look around.' 'Now we have got a very modest but quite profitable business down there. From a standing start we have covered all our expenses and I'm comfortable,' he said. Mr Thatcher said he was unlikely to 'make millions' out of it 'because the money's not down there'. But, he added, 'it is bloody interesting'.</p>

Vavilov; UDC 621.373.826.038]    [Abstract] Power lasers with widely variable  characteristics have been built to serve as high-energy  hyperdirectional radiation sources, as sources of luminous  energy to be transmitted over long distances with minimum loss  and to be received with subdiffractional precision. One of the  largest research stands built at the Institute of Optics during  the past 15 years is the 6-channel ``Progress,'' intended for  the study of intense radiation and spherical target interaction  relating to laser-induced thermonuclear fusion. It includes a  Nd-glass master laser emitting pulses of up to 1.5 kJ energy and  about 1 ns duration or a power of 3.5 TW in pulses of 0.1 ns  duration. It also includes a chirp-pulse generator with a  regenerative amplifier and a shaping-pulse generator, both  feeding a common preamplifier with two inputs and three outputs.  Pulses from one output pass through a compressor to the target  inside a spherical chamber. Pulses from the other two outputs  pass through a separator to a module which contains: a series of  bar and disk amplifiers with successively larger (30 mm to 110  mm) apertures with vacuum-type spatial filters separating the  amplifiers and preventing self-action, electrooptical  deflectors, electrooptical (Pockels) shutters and magnetooptical  (Faraday) shutters decoupling the laser from targets, and  harmonic filters. From here pulses proceed along six channels to  six targets. Some pulses are deflected through an amplifier with  a 140 mm aperture to two detectors with 150 mm and 250 mm  apertures respectively. Some pulses are diverted to another  compressor. This stand was used in experiments with pulse  compression during stimulated Mandelshtam-Brillouin scattering.  For generating and amplifying ultrashort chirp pulses of only 1  mJ energy and 0.2-1.0 ns within a 2-4 nm spectral, a very  inefficient Nd-glass laser is replaced with a mode-locked  YAG:Nd[.sup]+3[/] laser emitting continuous sequences of  pulses of 50 ps duration at a repetition rate of 100 MHz within  a 0.2 nm wide spectral band. Chirp pulses of 0.15-0.6 ns  duration are formed in single-mode fiber optics, where phase  modulation and group velocity dispersion broaden the spectrum  and elongate a pulse. Additional elongation of a pulse takes  place in a lattice-type stretcher. Extraction of a pulse is  effected by the electrooptical shutters, which are controlled by  photoelectric switches. The regenerative amplifier then puts out  a pulse of about 1 mJ energy, sufficient for transmission to the  main amplifier channel with a 110 mm exit aperture. A second  large research stand is the ``LAS'', which includes an Nd-glass  laser with phase conjugation and a 110 mm output aperture. It  emits pulses of up to 500 J and 25 ns duration in a beam with a  divergence angle of 5 rad so that the axial radiation  intensity reaches 80 aW/cm[.sup]2[/]. A third large research  stand is the ``Chibis'', which includes a CO[.sub]2[/]-laser  operation in the pulse-repetition mode. Experiments with this  apparatus have demonstrated the feasibility of a  focusing-deflecting system which uses large compound mirrors and  of compensating its aberrations by means of phase conjugation.

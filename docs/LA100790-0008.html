			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALZER ON SPIRITS: WYBOROVA VODKA  </P> <P> VODKA IS A BEVERAGE that generally isn't associated with Poland. Therefore, it  may be of some surprise that that country produces Europe's best-selling vodka:  Wyborowa. In previous centuries, when Polish royalty called for the best vodka  they asked for wyborowa, meaning "the choicest."  </P> <P> Today, Europeans also are asking for the choicest. Wyborowa (pronounced  Vee-ba-rova) is a 100% rye grain spirit, produced with soft water from deep  artesian wells, which accounts for its crystalline purity and exceptionally  clean smoothness.  </P> <P> Wyborowa ($12.95 for 750 milliliters 80-proof) begins with the most select rye  grain that comes from thousands of small farms; during malting (soaking,  sprouting and kiln-drying the grains) in wellspring water, starch is converted  to glucose. Then fermentation begins with triple distillation of the mash to  follow at high proof to extract all congeners, or impurities, until the  resulting liquid is colorless, odorless, and by official definition, without  distinctive character, aroma or taste.  </P> <P> The state-owned and -operated Polmos distillery is in Poznan in central Poland  and has been producing Wyborowa for centuries. Although vodka is usually made  with grains such as rye and wheat, I was told that 75% of all vodka production  in Poland uses potatoes. I wondered how potato vodka would taste. I found my  answer through a blind tasting of the Wyborowa (rye) and the Luksusowa  (potato), both at 80-proof. To the eye and the nose, there is no difference at  all. To the palate, yes, a minimal, but detectable difference. Neither I nor  two of my colleagues were able to identify which was which, only that one was  softer. That turned out to be the potato vodka, ($15.99 for 750 milliliters  80-proof).  </P> <P> Centuries ago, devotees stashed their vodka in snowbanks. Now you can store it  in your freezer, ready at any time to be served icy cold, neat -- in the Polish  tradition. Na zdrowie! (Nah-stro-vyeh) "To your health!" Robert Lawrence Balzer  </P></p>

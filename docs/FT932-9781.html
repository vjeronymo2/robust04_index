			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Avon Rubber calls for Pounds 22.5m AVON RUBBER, the tyre and motor components company, yesterday reported a 22 per cent increase in interim profits and announced a cash call to raise Pounds 22.5m for capital investment. The 1-for-4 rights issue at 440p will form part of a Pounds 40m investment programme over the next two years in its auto components, tyre and technical products divisions. The share price fell 31p to 509p. Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive, said he hoped the rights issue would not dilute earnings in 1994, the first full year. Gearing after the rights issue would fall to 22 per cent at the end of this year. Without the rights it would have risen to 55 per cent, compared with 50 per cent at the last year end. In the six months to April 3, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 5.01m on sales up 16 per cent at Pounds 133.4m (Pounds 115.3m). Earnings per share rose 40 per cent to 15.5p (11.1p); the interim dividend is maintained at 5p. Automotive components was hit by weak sales in Germany and by manufacturers selling from stock. Operating profit fell from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.62m in spite of sales up 21 per cent at Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 40.1m). The technical products division, which makes golf grips, milking machine components, photocopier rolls and aerosol gaskets, saw profits increase from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 3m on sales up 22 per cent at Pounds 37m (Pounds 30.6m). Tyre profits rose sharply to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.64m) on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 41m (Pounds 37.6m) as the division benefited from overhead cost savings. COMMENT It will not have escaped investors' attention that they last paid 500p four years ago to fund part of the Cadillac Rubber and Plastics acquisition and are only just seeing a return. This time the call is to fund the recovery, gearing being too high and the investment needs apparently too pressing to allow investment from Avon's own resources. Almost certainly the rights will dilute earnings in the first full year unless the company can lay down the investments extremely quickly. Earnings are therefore likely to rise to only 38.1p in 1994, against a previously forecast 42p. The shares are therefore in for a dull time until the company proves it can produce the organic growth its ambitious expansion is anticipating. Not least, investors will want to see how far German auto makers will shift allegiance from traditional, and expensive, local component suppliers to the likes of Avon, the price advantage of which has so far cut little ice.</p>

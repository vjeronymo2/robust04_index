			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BUILDER-ACTIVIST NATHAN SHAPELL IS DRIVEN TO DEVELOP SOME BIG IDEAS  </P> <P> As a developer and as chairman of the Little Hoover Commission, a public  watchdog agency, Nathan Shapell has forged a reputation as a take-charge guy.  Several years ago, during a commission meeting, Shapell told a federal  education official that California's schools were a mismanaged mess.  </P> <P> "They could turn it over to me and I could run it," said Shapell, a millionaire  Beverly Hills developer. "You go back to Washington and tell Ed Meese that Nate  Shapell says we've got to clean up this mess."  </P> <P> Even by Shapell's standards, he has plenty to keep him busy these days.  Shapell, 69, is the man behind an ambitious $2-billion proposal to develop  1,300 acres in the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. The rolling hills just  north of the Simi Valley Freeway were purchased in the late 1970s from  California Federal Savings &amp; Loan by Shapell's Beverly Hills company,  Shapell Industries, and by Liberty Building Co. of Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3,000 Homes Planned  </P> <P> Shapell's company owns 75% of Porter Ranch Development Corp., which last month  announced plans to develop 3,000 homes and 7.7 million square feet of office  and retail space on the site over the next 30 years.  </P> <P> But his plan is still only in the idea stage. The first public hearing on the  proposal is scheduled for later this month. Northwest San Fernando Valley  residents and merchants have already voiced concern about the proposal. "Our  major concern at this point is the traffic because that's a phenomenal project  in size and scope," said David R. Miller, president of the Granada Hills  Chamber of Commerce. "There's also a concern that a complex that size would  ruin the small-business community in Granada Hills and Chatsworth."  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development representatives have maintained that the fast-growing  West Valley needs the additional housing and can accommodate the proposed  1.5-million-square-foot regional shopping center.  </P> <P> If Shapell pulls it off, it would be one of the biggest land developments in  the history of Los Angeles County. But Shapell has overcome long odds before.  </P> <P> "He is a hard-driving person," said Richard C. Mahan, a vice president of  Shapell Industries. "He wouldn't be alive today if he wasn't a hard-driving  person."  </P> <P> Shapell is a survivor of the notorious World War II death camp at Auschwitz.  After the war, Shapell worked in Germany finding housing for displaced people  in the community of Munchberg. In the 1950s he and his brother David and  brother-in-law Max Webb moved to the United States and settled in California,  convinced that its real estate market offered plenty of growth. After a few  years they began their own real estate development company.  </P> <P> Privately owned Shapell Industries did about $400 million in sales last year  and employs 425 people, Mahan said. Shapell continues to run things as chairman  and president.  </P> <P> Shapell is no stranger to large projects. Among his 30 or so developments in  California is the former MGM Ranch in Thousand Oaks, where Shapell is building  more than 1,400 homes and a 102-acre industrial park.  </P> <P> Shapell also is building the 860-acre planned community of Eastlake Village in  Yorba Linda and the 600 luxury home community of Kite Hill in Laguna Niguel.  Shapell and builder Jona Goldrich are partners in the $60-million Promenade  Towers, a 510-unit apartment project in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shaped Character  </P> <P> Shapell's experience in Europe during and after the war helped shape his  management style of tempered ruthlessness, associates said. One former Shapell  employee, who asked that his name not be used, left Shapell Industries after  several years because of the pressure. "There were some very bright people who  couldn't take it," he said.  </P> <P> But the other side of Shapell is the community activist, the giver to  charities, the crusading chairman of the Little Hoover Commission. "That's the  humane side of him, or the feeling that he owes it to society," the former  employee said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Panel Investigations  </P> <P> Under Shapell's chairmanship since 1975, the Little Hoover Commission has  conducted about 75 inquiries attacking mismanagement or waste in agencies  ranging from local school districts to the state Department of Social Services.  And last year Shapell Industries made charitable contributions of more than $1  million, Mahan said.  </P> <P> Shapell, a Pole who changed his name from Natan Schapelski, has written  "Witness to the Truth," a 1974 book about his experience as a prisoner at  Auschwitz and as a postwar leader of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Munchberg.  </P> <P> In the book, Shapell wrote that Webb and several others at Auschwitz saved his  life. One day guards were calling out names and serial numbers of those in  Shapell's unit to be transported from the camp, and he hid in the lavatory.  Later, Webb and others bamboozled the guards so that they stopped looking for  him.  </P> <P> "To my knowledge, I was the only one lucky enough to escape like this, and to  all of those men I owe a debt," Shapell wrote.  </P> <P> Shapell, who was traveling and declined to be interviewed for this story, in  many ways is a private man. Shapell Industries went public in 1969, but Shapell  regretted it almost immediately, Mahan said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SEC, Stockholders  </P> <P> Shapell disliked the restrictions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and  the scrutiny of Wall Street brokerage firms and stockholders who wanted  ever-rising quarterly earnings from a business that is inherently cyclical,  Mahan said.  </P> <P> Indeed, in the early 1980s when interest rates soared, Shapell Industries, like  many developers, had a rough time. According to public documents, from 1981-83  Shapell Industries lost $25 million while averaging annual sales of about $50  million.  </P> <P> In 1984 the family bought the company back in a leveraged buyout for $35  million.  </P> <P> Shapell apparently believes in keeping control of his projects. In 1970 Shapell  Industries expanded into Colorado and Illinois, but Shapell later abandoned  those plans. "His feeling was, if you can't be on the site of the project  within an hour by car or plane, it's too far away," Mahan said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pushed Housing Bill  </P> <P> Shapell's prominent role in state politics has not been without controversy. In  1981, Shapell, as head of a governor's appointed affordable housing task force,  pushed a state bill that would have allowed a new commission to override local  zoning laws and create up to five new cities anywhere it wished. The measure  was eventually vetoed by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> But some who worked to defeat the bill, including Thousand Oaks city officials  and state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), contended that Shapell, a major  contributor to state politicians, wanted the bill enacted because his plans to  develop the MGM Ranch property near Thousand Oaks had been frustrated by local  zoning laws and the new bill could have helped him build more homes there.  </P> <P> Among those who opposed Shapell in the lobbying fight was Ventura County  Supervisor Madge Schaefer, who was a Thousand Oaks councilwoman at the time.  "When you're at war with Nathan, you know you're at war," Schaefer said. But  she came out of the battle respecting him. Shapell "never lied to me," she  said, while "there are some developers that are double-dealing and underhanded  and sometimes down and dirty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Fee Dispute  </P> <P> That doesn't mean everybody sees things his way. Shapell is involved in a  dispute with several school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley over  developer fees that cover the cost of building new schools.  </P> <P> State law requires developers to pay $1.53 in school fees for every square foot  of residential development. But Santa Clarita Valley voters in five school  districts approved substantially higher fees in a 1987 referendum.  </P> <P> The California Building Industry Assn. sued the districts, challenging the  constitutionality of the higher fees, and the issue is still tied up in courts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, some developers, such as Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., have  voluntarily agreed to pay the higher, disputed school fees. But Shapell, who is  developing a 3,000-home project in Canyon Country, is holding firm and paying  only what is required by state law. And that has created some hard feelings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need for Schools  </P> <P> "Shapell and all those others will build a house, make a profit and walk away  and leave people in those homes with no schools," said Clyde Smyth,  superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District in the Santa  Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> In a related battle, last year two Santa Clarita Valley school districts sued  Los Angeles County and Shapell, seeking to force county officials to reject  building projects unless schools can accommodate growth in the area.  </P> <P> Many of the same issues, such as schools and traffic, are likely to arise as  Shapell's Porter Ranch proposal receives consideration by the city of Los  Angeles, Davis said.  </P> <P> Like many builders, Shapell keeps his attorneys busy. He or his company have  been involved in about 75 lawsuits in the past decade.  </P> <P> In an effort to help sell his Porter Ranch idea to public officials, Shapell  has hired some political talent. Paul Clarke, the political consultant and  husband of former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, is the proposal's public relations man.  The project coordinator is Robert M. Wilkinson, who represented the area on the  Los Angeles City Council from 1953 to 1956 and from 1967 to 1979.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mall, Offices  </P> <P> The proposal includes 2,195 single-family homes and 800 condominiums. The  commercial area would include the regional shopping center and an office plaza  with buildings up to 15 stories high. Project officials said they have received  inquiries from Nordstrom and May Co.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch Development officials are quick to point out that their proposal  calls for spending $40 million to $50 million in traffic improvements such as  new streets and computerized signal lights.  </P> <P> "Shapell is an honest man and he builds a hell of a house," said Davis. "But he  is in a general professional group that is organized. They can kill anything  that's going to be harmful to them. . . . They are heavy players, and they are  very, very strong and they usually win."  </P></p>

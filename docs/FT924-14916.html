			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bright future seen for aluminium contract DEMAND FOR secondary (or recycled) aluminium is forecast to nearly double by the year 2,000, which is why the London Metal Exchange expects a bright future for its new secondary aluminium alloy contract, said Mr John Wolff, the LME chairman, yesterday. The new contract, for material used mainly by diecasters supplying the motor industry, started quietly yesterday but this was widely expected. Mr Wolff said: 'It will take time to bed down. But it is a very large market and growing.' He pointed out that about 4.5m tonnes of aluminium alloy was produced each year and output was growing at an annual 6 per cent, driven by the increasing use of the metal by car makers attracted by its light weight and recyclability. Cash trading of the contract - the LME's first new one since nickel was launched in 1979 - will begin on January 4. Stocks have already started to build up in LME warehouses and the exchange will give details of total tonnages at the end of October. The LME had to invent a symbol for the material (see insert above). Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME's aluminium alloy committee, said that on the unofficial market in the past two months alloy had been traded at a Dollars 10 a tonne premium to the LME's primary aluminium contract and also at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was not a satisfactory proxy for alloy and the new contract was needed. The alloy price, which was Dollars 1,160 a tonne on the unofficial market on Monday, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,175.  --------------------------------------          LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS         (As at Monday's close)  -------------------------------------- tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium  +1,300  to 1,372,525 Copper     +3,025  to   299,775 Lead       +4,025  to   174,500 Nickel       +180  to    46,524 Zinc       +1,825  to   368,375 Tin           +90  to    14,995  --------------------------------------</p>

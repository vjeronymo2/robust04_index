			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yovo Nikolov] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov has denounced  Albania's decision to place its airports at the disposal of NATO  aircraft for an air raid against Bosnia. This is something that  we do not like, Mr. Stanislav Daskalov declared after his return  from a meeting of foreign ministers from neighboring countries  of the former Yugoslavia. We are against the interference of  any Balkan country whatsoever in the conflict because it might  lead to an escalation of tension in the Balkans, he stated.    The minister of foreign affairs returned visibly depressed  from the Geneva meeting. No decisions whatsoever were adopted  at the meeting; however, that was not the purpose. An official  report on how the Yugoembargo is affecting the neighboring  countries was released. The participating countries should  provide their own remarks on the document.    Stanislav Daskalov was not aware of President Zhelev's stand  on being inclined to agree with air attacks over Bosnia. I  cannot comment on something that I have not heard, the minister  declared.    Bulgaria has always declared to be in favor of a peaceful  settlement of the conflict. If air raids should be applied as  an extreme measure, then several conditions should be fulfilled  in this connection. The first condition, in our view, is that  there should be no victims among the civilian population and  that the air strikes should not lead to an expansion of the  conflict likely to affect neighboring countries. The question  was discussed in Geneva, but none of the sides dared to commit  itself with providing guarantees.    In Suleyman Demirel's letter to President Zhelev, there was  no mention of an air corridor through Bulgaria, Mr. Daskalov  said in confirming the statement of the Turkish ambassador in  Bulgaria. As far as the foreign minister remembers, the letter  called for support in case of military intervention or in  connection with lifting the arms embargo.    Stanislav Daskalov reported that he had agreed with the UN  High Commissioner for Refugees Office on the participation of  Bulgarian business companies in humanitarian deliveries for  former Yugoslavia and the Caucasus.</p>

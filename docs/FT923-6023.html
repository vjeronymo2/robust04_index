			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Building orders fall by a fifth CONSTRUCTION orders won by British contractors slumped by almost a fifth during the three months to the end of June, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment. The fall in orders, along with fears that British interest rates may have to rise to defend sterling, sent construction and building material shares tumbling further on the London stock exchange yesterday. According to the department the value of construction orders at constant 1985 prices fell by 18 per cent on the corresponding period last year and by 19 per cent compared with the previous three months. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'These are desperate, dire figures which show that the recession is still deepening in housing and construction. They underline the slump in industrial investment.' He added: 'The slump in this industry is acting as a massive drag on the rest of the economy.' Housing and construction activity affected a range of industrial products from bricks, cement and steel to carpets, textiles, light bulbs and white goods, said Mr Straw. According to the environment department, private housing orders in the second quarter of this year were 13 per cent lower than in the corresponding period last year and 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months. Private commercial orders, mainly offices and shops, were 28 per cent lower than in the corresponding period last year and 29 per cent lower than in the preceding three months. Private industrial orders were 28 per cent and 25 per cent respectively lower over the same periods. Public-sector orders, other than housing, were 8 per cent and 7 per cent lower. Construction companies have recently expressed concern that the government may seek to restrain public spending on construction to offset rises in social security payments caused by rises in unemployment. Contractors, in particular, fear that road spending could be curtailed. The only bright spot in the figures was a sharp rise in public housing and housing association orders which rose by 36 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter last year.</p>

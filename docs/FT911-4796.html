			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Survey of Telford &amp; Shropshire (6): New premium on training  -Trends point to changing patterns of employment INVESTMENT drawn to Telford has been by far the most important factor in the employment growth of Shropshire. For the medium term, at least, this trend is likely to continue. But the shape of the labour force is changing in a way which puts a premium on training. At the time of the last census in 1987, when the population of the county was about 400,000, the number of jobs in the county was nearly 130,000, roughly 10,000 more than in 1980. But a breakdown of jobs, by district council area, showed that at best there had been a marginal increase and in some cases a small decline in job numbers in the Bridgnorth, North Shropshire, Oswestry, Shrewsbury and Atcham, and South Shropshire areas. Only in the Wrekin district, which contains Telford, was there a marked increase. Work carried out by Prism Research for a county labour market assessment commissioned by the new Shropshire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC) points out that between 1984 and 1990, 'Telford alone accounted for 95 per cent of all new jobs. These trends are expected to continue to 1993 with 8,000 new jobs forecast throughout the county; 1,000 through natural growth and 7,000 through the Telford effect.' Projections of the County Council suggest that that between 1989 and the year 2006, the labour force could increase in size by between 22,500 and 40,000. The minimum figure is derived from forecast natural change and migration. The maximum figure could be reached if there is a high level of economic activity. Two points emerge from these separate forecasts. First, if employment growth is to be more evenly spread over the county in the next decades, land supply for new commercial activity will have to be greater outside the Wrekin and Oswestry areas. The decline in the rural economy will have to be halted by welding new sources of employment on to farming and its associated industries. Second, although absolute numbers of jobs and people to fill them may increase, the constituent parts of the labour force will gradually change, thus demanding a change in the recruitment policy of companies in the county. Prism Research has highlighted three features: a 16 per cent decline in the number of school leavers, to 5,000, between 1989-93; a decline in the number of those aged between 16 and 44 years; and increase in those older than 45. Against this background, the expected labour needs include not only operatives for manufacturing industry but those with managerial, professional and technical skills to underpin the growth of manufacturing industry and those with clerical and secretarial skills to support it. The services sector has already started to expand in the Telford area and Shrewsbury traditionally has been a strong commercial centre with an influence stretching into Wales. Prism Research concludes that 'employers will need to consider alternative labour sources such as women returners to meet recruitment needs' and, because Shropshire traditionally has not had a strong demand for managers, professionals and clerical staff, there is a growing necessity for 'more employers to train and develop existing staff.' Obviously, however, entrants to the labour force will be a minority. The Shropshire TEC notes that, 'As 80 per cent of the employees of the year 2000 are currently in employment, employers already hold the key to most of their future labour needs. The competitiveness of individual businesses can be greatly enhanced through an appropriately trained and skilled workforce.' The responsibility for providing the framework in which this process of skill enhancement, of matching skills to needs, of fostering commercial acumen, now falls on the Shropshire TEC, which formally started operations on April 2 1991. The timing was less than encouraging. The onus of effort will fall on companies currently coping with recession, historically the part of the economic cycle when there is a tendency to cut spending on investment and training. At the same time, the UK government is reducing spending on youth and employment training; indeed, there is an abundance of local complaints that, proportionately, Shropshire's spending is being reduced by a greater amount than the average national fall. Certainly, in budgetary terms, the Shropshire TEC is one of the smallest of 82 around the UK, with an overall budget for the financial year 1991-92 of about Pounds 12m. Most of that will be spent on youth and employment training, picking up the mantle of the Training Agency. Mr Roy Knott, the chief executive, says that in the face of reduced government spending, the TEC is 'spreading the pain evenly' among the companies and institutions which provide training. The biggest of these is Shropshire County Council, which forecasts expenditure on training in 1991-2 of Pounds 5.56m and income from it of Pounds 5.53m. Its training contract with the TEC this year will be smaller than its contract with the Training Agency last year. The scale of the operation is indicated by the fact that in early January, there were 2,402 people engaged in youth training throughout Shropshire, while a further 4,700 were taking part in various adult training schemes, including employment training. Out of its overall budget, Shropshire TEC has some Pounds 2m to spend on local initiatives and on enterprise support, largely the administration of the enterprise allowance. Support for small business is crucial to the growth of the county economy: 90 per cent of businesses employ less than 25 people and the self-employed sector has grown by 20 per cent since 1981. The growth has been most marked in the Telford area and least marked in the south of the county. It is a significant comment on the county economy that while the TEC is seeking to devolve its encouragement of training and enterprise down to six area boards, mirroring the district councils, it has also set up a special committee of private and public sector leaders to do the same thing exclusively for agriculture.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of "exclusive" interview with Aloizio </F> Mercadante, Workers Party, PT, deputy for Sao Paulo, by  unidentified FOLHA reporter on 8 May; place not given]    [Text] [Folha] Brazil has just concluded an agreement over  a $49 billion portion of its $135.2 billion foreign debt. PT  candidate Lula has said that he wants to revise the agreement.  How would a prospective PT government address the Brazilian  foreign debt issue?    [Mercadante] We are not planning to begin the government  with  any unilateral measure, but the PT believes that the debt  remains a major foreign policy issue.    First, the guarantees that the agreement demanded from  Brazil  are totally inappropriate. The cost of obtaining the reserves  ($2.5 billion) for guaranteeing the accord was tremendous for  public finances. The guarantees are absolutely unacceptable.    It was an agreement made by a weak, dismantled government  that had no political support. We cannot allow that instead of  Brazil managing its debt, the debt should manage Brazil. This  will not happen with our government.    [FOLHA] The debt agreement that was negotiated is better  than  the agreement signed by Mexico and Argentina.    [Mercadante] In those cases the countries received money  from  the International Monetary Fund to finance their guarantees,  something that did not happen with Brazil. The fact that the  economic plan was not ready, and that the IMF refused to provide  the funds, proves that the agreement was hastily concluded. Why  wasn't it possible to wait two more months after 11 years of  negotiations?    [FOLHA] What will be the party position toward foreign  investment in Brazil in areas like the stock exchange? Will  that money be considered speculation capital?    [Mercadante] We want development to promote our massive  consumer market, and to this end we need investment, foreign  investment. We want to attract that money, and stock markets  are mechanisms for attracting it. Yet we have to see that the  money is used for economic growth, creating long-range financing  funds. We must be competent to attract that money. Otherwise,  it will end up going somewhere else.    [FOLHA] Isn't there any bias over the money that enters or  leaves the stock market?    [Mercadante] Not at all. What we have been unable to do is  to transform the capital inflow in productive investment. We  will not solve the problems by either closing the markets or  rejecting the money. Our economy must remain open, but we  should also reform the financial system in order to attract  productive investment.</p>

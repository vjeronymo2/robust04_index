			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Invesco to pay compensation Invesco MIM, the fund management group, said this week it would be paying compensation to Drayton Consolidated Investment Trust, which it manages, for violating investment trust guidelines. The breach concerned a stake and loan to Alma, the confectionery company which collapsed last year. Plans for a reorganisation of Drayton are due to be submitted to shareholders in October. Meanwhile, Invesco MIM is merging three of its unit trusts - Commodity Shares, Gold and International Leisure - into its International Growth trust. None of the disappearing trusts has performed well; the Gold Trust, in a process of reverse alchemy, has turned Pounds 100 into a leaden Pounds 29.30 over the past five years. Unitholders should not necessarily expect an improvement; the International Growth trust is 36th out of 38 trusts in its sector over 10 years.</p>

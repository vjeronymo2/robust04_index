			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Letter: BR better than the pre-war 'golden age' of trains Sir, What an excellent article in the Weekend FT ('The golden age of rail that never was', February 29) by Richard Tomkins. One fears, however, that it will have no effect on those Tories whose minds are already made up, and convinced that privatisation will provide all the cures that are needed. However, Mr Tomkins might have made his story even more telling had he said something about the strides that have been made since 1948, not because of nationalisation, but because of the immensely higher level of technical and engineering skill that is now available to all transport undertakings. Three hours fifty-nine minutes to Edinburgh from London (often in practice barely three hours fifty-five for the two best trains each way, and four and a half for most of the rest), a train every hour for most of the day compared with three day trains and two or three night trains except for the high season before the war, all in air-conditioned comfort and considerable silence, make current rail travel a world better than the noisy and draughty trains l travelled in as a child. Unless specially prepared for a speed stunt, those trains would have rattled themselves to bits if asked to travel at 125mph on daily rosters exceeding 1,000 miles. It is fairly easy to keep a train clean if it does one return trip from London to Dover in a day - for example, The Golden Arrow (160 miles). Would anyone in the 'golden age' have considered commuting from Bath, Peterborough or Derby to London and being at their desk by 8.30? They can and do now, which is why so many have ample opportunity to chronicle BR's shortcomings. Few other businesses have to manage their affairs in the public eye to the extent that transport does.

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which won control of RJR Nabisco Inc. in  November, plans to divest the tobacco conglomerate's holdings in South Africa  amid pressure from investors who oppose that nation's race policies. The two  holdings are Royal Beechnut, a confectioner, and South African Preserving Co.,  which produces canned fruit. The move came after the treasurer of Michigan  threatened to withhold its $110-million pension fund investment in KKR's buyout  of RJR because of the company's South African interests. Michigan has a law  that took effect Jan. 1 barring investment in companies with ties to South  Africa.  </P></p>

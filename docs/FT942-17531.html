			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The excitement lives on in Soho - Nicholas Lander finds adventure in a central London area with a past Behind me, in the immaculately tended square, the plane trees swayed and the beds were full of newly-planted flowers. To the left stood a former private house and a garden with a mulberry tree under which Dickens wrote A Tale of Two Cities. Ahead lay three small streets teeming with restaurants. The scene was reminiscent of an old quarter of Brussels, Paris or Strasbourg perhaps. But I was in Soho Square, central London - an area more usually well-known for its porn shops - and the restaurants of Greek, Frith and Dean Streets beckoned. When I bought the lease on my Soho restaurant L'Escargot in 1980 - I could not afford the freehold (Pounds 150,000 for 5,500 sq ft) - there were two reactions. First, I was told that no one would come because it was difficult to park and, second, if I survived I would make no money as I would have to pay too much protection money to racketeers. I never met a racketeer and within a few years it became difficult to park all over central London. Since, Soho has been down, up, down and is now on the up again. Such fluctuations are dangerous because they can produce the large rent rises - as one chef pointed out rents never go down - that closed many businesses in the late 1980s. For the restaurateur, Soho is a good trading location. There is considerable lunch business, albeit much more price sensitive than it was in the 1980s, and in the evening the potential for three types of dinner bookings - pre and post-theatre and those who just want to dine out in a lively area. Agencies for chefs and kitchen supply shops are there, too. And it is also a popular area if you just want a drink. But Soho has changed. I have never seen the streets and pavements so clean. According to Alastair Little, who has run his own restaurant in Frith Street for nine years, Westminster Council provides three rubbish collections a day. (This is not altogether good news for a restaurant critic because the number of rubbish sacks waiting for collection used to provide a reliable sign of just how busy a restaurant was.) There are still beggars and drunks on the streets but no more than in any other major European city. Soho is no longer the gastronomic island within London it used to be - the sole source of Mediterranean ingredients, raw and prepared, to which Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson and their readers hurried in the 1950s and 1960s. Hamburger Products and Bifulco's, the Italian butchers, have long gone and, according to fishmonger Dave Richards on Brewer Street, the wet fish business is not as good as it was. Yet Camisa and the Algerian Coffee Stores prosper on Old Compton Street and on Brewer Street, Randall and Aubin has been renovated and has broadened its stock. But now that fresh pasta, anchovies and peppers are available in delicatessens and supermarkets around the country there is less reason for many people to make the trip into Soho. In other London boroughs and other parts of the country the standards of cooking have improved and chefs who learnt their craft in Soho now make their names elsewhere in the capital: Adam Robinson at the Brackenbury, Shepherd's Bush (081-748-0107), and Martin Lam, at Ransome's Dock, Battersea (081-223-1611). But where Soho still impresses is in the diversity of it restaurants and the breadth of its appeal. For those who remember it from their youth there is the Gay Hussar (071-437-0973) with Elena Salvoni serving on the first floor as she did at Bianchi's in the 1950s, the redesigned Au Jardin des Gourmets (071-437-1816) and L'Epicure (071-437-2829) virtually unchanged from the 1960s when it was prime minister Harold Wilson's favourite restaurant. For those still in their youth Old Compton Street beckons. The number of coffee houses and bars that this street seems capable of supporting is astonishing - Cafe Boheme, Caffe Nero, Cafe Beta, the Soho Brasserie, Bar Sol Una, Balhans and Village Soho as well as the long running Bar Italia in Frith Street. For those who can think, drink and listen to loud music The French House (071-437-2477), Dean Street, is a valuable addition. Today, however, there is a new dimension to the gastronomic excitement long associated with Soho. Within 300 yards, along Frith Street, Alastair Little (071-734-5183), Anthony Worall-Thompson (Dell' Ugo 071-734-800) and Bruno Loubet (Bistro Bruno 071-734-4545) sharpen their knives. Further down are two good Thai restaurants, Bahn Thai (071-437-8504) and Chiang Mai (071-437-7444). For these chefs Soho's culinary attraction lies in its proximity to Chinatown. Little had just popped down there for some large red chillis which he would grill for a chilli salad. Loubet goes there regularly to buy pigs' ears and tails, black beans, ducks' tongues, Chinese chives and spices. Soho in the 1990s still provides food for the adventurous in a location with a frisson of excitement.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAVORED SITE FOR AIRPORT IS FULL OF TOXIC WASTE  </P> <P> The San Bernardino County land where Orange County leaders want to place an  international airport is so polluted by discarded jet fuel and chemical  solvents that it ranks among the nation's worst hazardous-waste sites.  </P> <P> Cleaning up the area around George Air Force Base will cost the federal  government millions of dollars and could take as long as three decades.  </P> <P> "It has been identified as one of the most potentially hazardous toxic waste  sites in the country," Terry Wilson, a spokesman for the Environmental  Protection Agency's regional office in San Francisco, said Tuesday. "The fact  that it's on the (EPA's Superfund) list indicates that this particular site has  very significant environmental problems."  </P> <P> Officials say that the pollution would not likely block development of an  airport. However, the issue, coupled with a boiling political squabble that  divides the surrounding high-desert communities, stands as an obstacle that  Orange County airport backers must overcome as they proceed with plans to  convert what is now George Air Force Base into a Southland "super port" served  by a high-speed train.  </P> <P> According to EPA and Air Force officials, a storm drain running parallel to the  main runway at George long served as a dumping area for solvents, paints and  industrial chemicals, and some of them leached into soil along the 18,000-foot  drain.  </P> <P> In addition, an underground lake on the edge of the base has been contaminated  by solvents once used to de-grease aircraft. Trichloroethylene, a suspected  carcinogen, has seeped into the water, poisoning the lake. That and other  hazardous chemicals have turned up in on-base monitoring wells within three  miles of where base residents draw their drinking water, according to the EPA.  </P> <P> Despite those problems, local and federal officials say they do not believe  plans for building a commercial airport at the base -- scheduled to close in  December, 1992 -- will be affected by the presence of toxic chemicals.  </P> <P> The Defense Department has already launched a $5-million cleanup program, and  though it is expected to take 15 to 30 years in the case of the underground  lake, local officials say the proposed airport could be built around the  contaminated area.  </P> <P> "As I understand it, our environmental situation as it is would not prevent the  base's reuse as a commercial airport," said Capt. James Tynan, a spokesman for  the base.  </P> <P> Adelanto Mayor Ed Dondelinger, whose city abuts the base, agreed, saying that  the environmental problems are significant but that the Defense Department is  handling the cleanup.  </P> <P> While the environmental issues, though serious, appear to be under control, a  pesky political standoff has arisen: Some local officials in the high desert  welcome the international airport with open arms, but others fear potential  environmental and traffic problems that could come with such a large facility  and favor a much smaller one.  </P> <P> Infighting between two groups has grown to the point that the Air Force, which  has urged area governments to reach a consensus, has offered to supply a  federal mediator.  </P> <P> "It's kind of like a family squabble," said Bruce Kitchen, a Hesperia City  Council member. "We're all going to sit down at the table. It's just a matter  of who gets the most potatoes."  </P> <P> Dondelinger and other Adelanto officials have argued that their city has been  the most affected by the Air Force base and that they have the most at stake in  its conversion. As a result, Adelanto has sought to pursue development of an  international airport essentially on its own, seeking input from its neighbors  but hoping to retain the final say in whatever plan is adopted.  </P> <P> That has irritated the other high-desert communities, however, where officials  say traffic and other fallout from any commercial airport in the region would  affect them as well. Joined together as the Victor Valley Economic Development  Authority, representatives of three cities and the county are arguing for a  more modest proposal than the one backed by Adelanto.  </P> <P> "Our initial analysis is that the base would be more appropriately used as a  regional airport about the size of Ontario," said Wayne Lamoreaux, town manager  of Apple Valley. "We're not ready to embrace the idea of a 'superport.' "  </P> <P> The Victor Valley group has agreed to have a mediator intercede, but so far  Adelanto has not. "I'm a little reluctant to agree to a mediator because I have  everything to give and they have nothing," Dondelinger said.  </P> <P> All the while, Orange County officials are waiting in the wings in hopes that  construction of the airport and rail will relieve congestion at crowded John  Wayne Airport. County supervisors voted last month to endorse George Air Force  Base as their preferred airport site.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Don R. Roth, one of the airport and super-speed train's most  fervent supporters, said Tuesday that he will meet with the Victor Valley group  on July 25 but plans to steer clear of the high-desert battle.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marla Cone contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Arts: Ayckbourn's Wildest Dreams - Theatre One of the themes of Alan Ayckbourn's comedies is power: the power that some people have over others, within a tight little nexus of neighbourhood relationships. The power may be wielded generously and without malice - even unconsciously; but upon those who fall under its influence its effect is terrible. In Wildest Dreams (1991), now reaching London for the first time, it is the newcomer Marcie who at once exerts her sympathetic and inquisitive influence upon a group of four people. Manically ingratiating, tremendously keen, and wholly fixated on whoever she is talking to, she has, within days, changed all four lives - irrevocably. These four are Stanley and Hazel Inchbridge (childless, in their early middle age, sharing a house with Hazel's mini-Hitler brother Austen), Warren (a lonely teenage boffin, convinced that he is a humanoid alien) and Rick (an introvert in her early 20s, abused in the past by her mother's lover and then left by both him and her mother). What links them is their weekly meetings to play The Game. This board game involves them in role-playing in a sub-Tolkien fantasy which unites the four of them against the world (but into which Marcie enters wholeheartedly for a while). This shared fantasy is one of Ayckbourn's most wonderful comic constructions: ludicrous but dreadfully credible. And Marcie herself is another of his master-strokes. She really is an alien; and we never understand her. But her four friends we quickly understand only too well; and some of Ayckbourn's finest writing goes into entering their unhappy private worlds. His most novel and least comic conception is Rick: butch and vulnerable, probably lesbian but powerfully susceptible to male dominance. Her first encounter with Marcie's husband is an extraordinary scene, in which he all too easily slips into the role of the abusive patriarch who bullies and molests her. Rick, like Stanley and Warren, falls in love with Marcie. Yet, even though she comes far closer to Marcie than the men, she too is taken over by her. Everything else Ayckbourn visits with his characteristic blend of psychological penetration and sociological satire. Hazel (who during the play suffers the breakdown that so many of this playwright's married women do) has a marvellous attack of depression early in the play: 'I sometimes catch myself staring at myself in that bathroom mirror and I think - what have you done with that body, Hazel? . . . Look at it. Shrivelling and drooping and wasting away - covered in brown spots and warts and wrinkles and what use have you ever made of it? Nothing . . .' There are passages, especially in the later stages of the tale of Hazel and Stanley, that feel too close to Ayckbourn formula; and the ending, though it has poetic justice, lacks the dramatic tension that rules the first three-quarters of the play. But, though there are umpteen ingredients identifiable from other Ayckbourn, most of them do not feel familiar as you watch. Two features of this London staging have particular importance. One is that this is the first time the RSC has performed an Ayckbourn play. The other is that the play is being performed in The Pit, the auditorium that (among London's theatres) most closely resembles the Stephen Joseph Theatre-in-the-Round in Scarborough, for which Ayckbourn creates his plays. All the cast do excellent work. Brenda Blethyn (Hazel), Barry McCarthy (Stanley) and Peter Laird (Austen) create in detail the awful truths of the Inchbridges' home. Gary Whitaker slightly forces Warren's boyish unworldliness. As Rick, Jenna Russell is outstanding, playing this untheatrical and subdued character with utter objectivity. Playing the vivid humanoid Marcie, Sophie Thompson excels herself. She has here an appalling nervous energy, and a whole musical inventory of nervous laughs: scales and arpeggios upward or downward, mini-trills, and staccati on one note. It is this nervousness which makes Marcie so alarmingly real. How can someone so unrelaxed invade other people's lives and overwhelm them? Yet she can, and does. 'And,' as Clement Crisp would say, 'we believe.' At the Pit, 071-638-8891, until March 12; then transferring to the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

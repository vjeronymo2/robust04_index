			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jenny Shields: "Cocaine Smuggler Jailed for 30 </F> Years"]    [Text] A Spanish skipper who smuggled a "murderous  cargo" of high purity cocaine into Scotland was jailed for 30  years at the High Court in Edinburgh yesterday.    The sentence passed on Francisco Torres is believed to be  the  heaviest handed down by a Scottish court for a drugs offence and  was intended, the judge said, to "act as signal to others".    Prison sentences totalling more than 100 years have now been  given to smugglers and couriers involved in the drug-running  operation which ended in Britain's largest-ever drugs seizure.    Five Scots are in jail for their involvement, but a sixth,  referred to as Mr X, is still being hunted.    Torres, 28, ferried the cocaine across the Atlantic in  January 1991. It was brought ashore by dinghy at a remote cove  in Sutherland.    The cocaine, which had an estimated street value of  &pound;100  million, was intercepted near Newtonmore in the Highlands. It  was being driven south on the A9 disguised as waste from  Dounreay power station.    Torres, who was convicted of drug smuggling at the High  Court  in Glasgow last month after being extradited from Canada last  July, attempted to commit suicide in prison while awaiting  sentence.    Yesterday Lord Weir told Torres: "You piloted this murderous  cargo to our shores. It brings misery and death to its users.  The sentence I have to pass is intended as a signal to others  that it is folly to risk landing controlled drugs in Scotland."    Mr Donald Findlay, QC, defending, said that Torres still  vehemently protested his innocence, and wanted to challenge  media reports--based on information from Customs officials in  Britain and Canada--that he was a major drug runner.    Mr Findlay said there was "not a single scrap of evidence"  to  justify the allegations, and argued that Christopher Howarth, of  Ullapool in the West Highlands, who was jailed for 25 years for  his part in the operation, was a major player but his client was  simply a courier.    He urged Lord Weir to draw a distinction between the  sentence  imposed on Howarth and that which should be passed on Torres.  However Lord Weir said he had to consider the jail terms already  imposed, and particularly that on Howarth.</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCHES BECOME MORE AWARE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY CLERGY;  </P> <P> ETHICS: A MAIL SURVEY OF PASTORS INDICATES THAT ABOUT 10% HAVE HAD AN  INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP WITH A MEMBER OF THE FLOCK.  </P> <P> Sexual ethics are coming out of the closet and into the hearing rooms and  seminaries of mainline Protestant churches.  </P> <P> An increasing number of complaints by laymen and research indicating that up to  a quarter of the clergy may have committed some form of sexual misconduct have  led churches to address the issue, according to some church leaders and  ethicists.  </P> <P> "I think it's coming to the forefront because there are increasing complaints  against the clergy," said the Rev. Ronald Barton of the Community Church of the  Monterey Peninsula in Carmel. "The cultural environment at this time is one in  which victims of all kinds of abuse are ready to name the abuse and the  abuser."  </P> <P> And the church is more willing to listen, according to Episcopal Bishop Harold  H. Hopkins Jr.  </P> <P> "The church has often looked the other way when inappropriate behavior occurs  on the part of clergy," Hopkins said at a recent conference in Minneapolis on  sexual misconduct. "Our commitment now is to not only recognize that the  problem exists, but to begin immediately to take preventive and educational  steps."  </P> <P> In a mail survey of 80 pastors conducted by Barton and the Rev. Karen Lebacqz  for the Center for Ethics and Social Policy of the Graduate Theological Union  in Berkeley, approximately 10% of the respondents said they had a sexual  relationship with a church member, Lebacqz said.  </P> <P> She and Barton said the survey results were consistent with other research,  which showed up to a quarter of clergy engaged in misconduct that included such  acts as kissing and hugs that were more than friendly embraces.  </P> <P> The results did not surprise some others studying the issue.  </P> <P> "Those figures are not out of line," said the Rev. Emilie M. Townes of the St.  Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Mo., which this week held a conference  on ministerial ethics co-sponsored by the South Central College of Bishops and  the Division of Ordained Ministry of the United Methodist Church.  </P> <P> The victims are particularly vulnerable because the abuse takes place in a  church setting, Townes said.  </P> <P> "By authority of their position, ministers have a lot of power and a lot of  sway over people coming to them seeking help," she said. "If the minister's  always right, anything he or she asks of them must not be out of line."  </P> <P> But while psychiatrists have been trained to recognize problems of patients  being vulnerable to and even initiating sexual advances because of their  psychological needs, many clergy have not had such training, Barton said.  </P> <P> When pastors were asked in the survey how they recognized danger signs of  sexual misconduct, the top answer was by feeling, intuition and instinct,  Lebacqz said.  </P> <P> She said the survey results raise the question: "Are pastors being trained  adequately to learn how to deal with sexual-ethical issues?"  </P> <P> In the Northern California Conference of the United Church of Christ, where  Barton once served as associate conference minister, church officials worked  for five years to develop guidelines for handling complaints, Barton said. In  the last four years, he said there have been three or four complaints, compared  to one in the four-year period before the guidelines were developed.  </P> <P> Following the Minnesota conference, the Episcopal Church is considering  organizing a national task force on the issue.  </P> <P> "Sexual involvement by clergy is tantamount to family incest," said the Rev.  Susan Moss, a member of the Interfaith Task Force on Sexual Exploitation by  Clergy in Minnesota. "The dynamics are the same: Parishioners come to church  expecting that clergy will help provide a nurturing, caring environment, a safe  place to grow in the faith. When that trust is betrayed, the whole congregation  becomes the victim."  </P></p>

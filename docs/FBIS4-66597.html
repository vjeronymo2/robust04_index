			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 25. India and Singapore  commenced a four-day joint naval training exercise in  anti-submarine warfare (ASW) manoeuvres in the Andaman Sea from  Wednesday.    The training exercise, which is scheduled to end tomorrow,  is  being held on the specific request by Singapore which had  formally approached the Indian government last December. The  visiting Singapore ships had arrived India last Monday on a  seven-day official visit.    The participating ships of the Singapore Navy are RSN  Victory  and RSN Valour, both missile Corvettes.    These two corvettes, designed by a German firm, were built  in  Singapore as recently as in 1991. The participating Indian naval  vessels are INS Taragiri, an indigenously built Leander class  frigate of British design and INS Kursura, a Soviet made Foxtrot  class submarine.    The joint naval exercise has been described by defence  ministry sources as a "naval exercise of significant training  value for the Singapore navy". The ASW manoeuvres being taught  to the crew of the Singapore navy ships include that of sonar  operator training, and sharpening skills at detection and  designation of oceanic and underwater targets, especially  submarines.    This is the first time that a submarine of the Indian navy  is  participating in bilateral joint naval exercises involving the  sensitive ASW operations.    Significantly, Singapore has shown interest in seeking  India's help for specialised training of its naval officers. The  Singapore navy chief who is arriving in New Delhi early next  month on his first visit in recent years has specially sought to  visit naval facilities at the Eastern Naval Command in Cochin.    Although a few vacancies for foreign trainees at the Indian  training establishments are being availed by the Singapore navy,  the Indian navy expanding the scope of training officers of the  Singapore navy in the near future is thus emerging as a strong  probability.    This is the second time that India and Singapore are holding  bilateral naval exercises. The two sides had held a four-day  tactical joint naval exercise off the coast of the Andaman  Islands in February last year.    The exercises, which were elementary in nature, had included  surface shooting and screening apart from other manoeuvres.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO WILL ANSWER?;  </P> <P> PAC BELL OPENS A TECHNOLOGICAL WAR BY TEST-MARKETING A NEW TELEPHONE MESSAGE  SERVICE. BUT HOME MACHINES HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES AND MAY PROVE TOUGH TO  DISPLACE.  </P> <P> Just 21 years ago, the telephone answering machine was born in a Torrance  garage. Since PhoneMate bought the license to that invention, which now has  many competing versions, the answering machine has found ready acceptance,  first among businesses that welcomed having telephones answered after hours  and, since 1980, in a growing number of homes.  </P> <P> But now California's largest local phone company, Pacific Bell, is testing the  market for what it calls its "answer to the answering machine" -- voice mail, a  phone-answering and message-sending service built into the telephone network  and requiring no special equipment other than a push-button phone.  </P> <P> What seems to lie ahead is a major marketing war between competing telephone  technologies. Pacific Bell, which is conducting market tests with its new  service in the port community of San Pedro and the Silicon Valley town of  Milpitas, is confronting the answering machine head on. On buttons distributed  at a San Pedro gathering called March 31 to introduce the service to the  community, the company declared that its new system "puts the answering machine  where it belongs -- inside your phone."  </P> <P> A Pacific Bell video played hilariously garbled answering machine messages and  emphasized that its service requires the purchase of no equipment -- as long as  the customer has a push-button telephone that "speaks" to computers. "It's a  service built into the telephone system," the narrator explained. "There's  nothing at all! Just a blank spot where the answering machine used to be."  </P> <P> But PhoneMate, which parlayed the Torrance invention into nearly a 19% slice of  today's answering-machine market and annual sales approaching $120 million, is  far from throwing in the towel. Indeed, the company (since last year a wholly  owned subsidiary of Japan's Asahi Corp.) regards Pacific Bell as "just another  competitor in a very competitive field," said Larry Kloman, PhoneMate vice  president of marketing.  </P> <P> "They will certainly capture some share of market," he acknowledged, "and we  will direct our marketing strategies accordingly. But there's plenty of room."  </P> <P> U.S. consumers last year bought nearly 9 million answering machines. That's  nearly double the total of three years earlier. Industry sales have grown about  20% annually in most of the 1980s, but market penetration remains only 20%.  Analysts estimate, however, that at the present pace of sales, penetration will  reach 35% in 1990.  </P> <P> But by then Pacific Bell and many other local phone companies across the nation  will be moving beyond market tests. And the phone companies enjoy real  marketing advantages, Kloman said, notably, a directory full of readily  identifiable customers. "That's a huge advantage."  </P> <P> There are other advantages, too.  </P> <P> "A lot of people are scared of technology and won't buy an answering machine,"  said Steve Kropper, a senior consultant with International Data Corp. in  Framingham, Mass. Such people, he suggested, might find an answering service  offered by their local phone company attractive.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Casey Dworkin of Personal Technology Research in nearby  Waltham, Mass., maintained that residential customers will be a very hard sell  for the phone companies -- particularly if they already have answering  machines.  </P> <P> "Voice messaging is just not going to take off in the home," Dworkin predicted.  "There may be some niche marketing for a home-office situation," but most  households, he said, value such phone machine features as the screening of  incoming calls. Voice mail can't do that.  </P> <P> Plus, he said, buying a machine is not a continuing expense, such as voice  mail, but a one-time cost -- and as little as $50 to $75, including such  features as remote access to messages.  </P> <P> So far, the experience of Contel of California, which first brought residential  voice mail to the state last year, tends to bear out the difficulty of reaching  that market. Alice Camuti, marketing coordinator for the Victorville-based  phone company, has signed up only about 2% of 50,000 potential customers who  could subscribe to voice mail, though the company claims to be making progress  -- by stressing the answering-machine elements of the service and leaving other  capabilities, such as message sending, for customers to grow into.  </P> <P> But, Camuti acknowledged, "if they have an answering machine and it's not  offering any problems, it's a hard sell. They say, 'It works fine, why do I  need yours?' "  </P> <P> Lisa French, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, is bullish about the future  of voice mail. Nonetheless, she predicted that answering machines "will be  around a long time . . . for folks who just want to have their telephone  answered."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Pacific Bell's entry into the ring is not PhoneMate's first  David-and-Goliath match. In 1973, PhoneMate took on American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph after AT&amp;T tried to force its customers with answering machines  to lease a special device to connect them to the network. When the dust settled  three years later, the court ruled that answering machines could be plugged  directly into any phone jack.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell chose its two test communities with great care, said Lee Camp,  vice president and general manager of information services.  </P> <P> "San Pedro is in many ways a unique community," he said. "but it also offers a  balance that we expect to find throughout California."  </P> <P> The "balance" includes a Latino population that makes up 29% of the 101,000  residents, plus San Pedro's original core of Yugoslavs and Greeks drawn to the  harbor and its commercial fishery. There are 35,000 households and 2,500 small  businesses -- Pacific Bell's prime targets in the marketing tests. Such tightly  defined communities, whose members keep in very close contact with one another,  hold the greatest potential for voice messaging, Camp said.  </P> <P> The other test market, Milpitas, has a populace that is technologically  sophisticated and therefore unlikely to be awed by the new service.  </P> <P> Camp said he expects the two tests to last at least six months.  </P></p>

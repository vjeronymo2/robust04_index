			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / An inflation target is not enough Can the level and amount of spending in an economy or group of economies be so low as to lead to unnecessary unemployment and recession? Keynes gave a resounding 'yes' to this question. The mistake made by post-war governments that tried to follow his teachings was to suppose that monetary and fiscal policy could be determined solely with an eye to output and jobs, without taking prices into account - other than by controls or by jawboning. The result was that inflation took off and one government after another found its policies derailed. (It is sad that Michael Stewart cannot see this in his new Penguin polemic, Keynes in the 1990s.) The result was that by the end of the 1970s most countries were trying to return to some sort of sound money policy. This was very necessary. What was unfortunate was that they did not stop at throwing away the inflationary bathwater; they threw away the commonsense baby as well. For it remains true that total spending in an economy can be too low as well as too high. British sound money policies took the form first of monetary targets and then of exchange rate objectives, culminating in ERM membership. After both these gods failed, the government announced an inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent, with the hope of eventually reaching the lower half of the range, as its only macroeconomic goal. Most commentators were so relieved that something had been saved from the wreckage that they did not realise that an inflation target on its own was a retrograde step, which did indeed risk throwing out the baby of sensible demand management with the bathwater of inflationary finance. Yet there were a few voices who had all along urged a form of demand management that was in keeping with sound money, but also provided a safety net against unnecessary recession. The headline of this policy had the jargon-sounding name of Nominal GDP - a national cash-flow objective might be a good translation. All it means is that governments and central banks should try to maintain a level of spending low enough to prevent an inflationary take-off, but high enough to secure adequate growth when pay and prices are sufficiently restrained. Interestingly enough, the original monetary targets, if they had worked, would have been more helpful here than the new direct targets for inflation. Monetary targets were supposed to stabilise a quantity known as PT, the price level times the volume of current transactions. So once a tight money policy had done its job of squeezing out inflation, P would fall, T would rise, and output would automatically recover. A price target on its own, however, contains no such safety net. If real output were to fall by 10 per cent and inflation remained at 1 per cent, everything would seem to be fine except for the blood on the streets. The chart shows that these are far from hypothetical reflections. There is no mistaking the trend. In the first couple of years of the Thatcher government Nominal GDP was still rising at double-digit rates. So although I was not a particular fan of the 1981 Budget, which raised taxes in a recession, there was no way in which I could support the 364 protesting economists or the self-proclaimed 'Tory wets'. We are now in a changed universe. On the latest estimates UK Nominal GDP is rising by 4 per cent per annum, compared with the rate of 6 or 7 per cent consistent with moderate recovery and low inflation. These few percentage points of shortfall can eventually amount to hundreds of thousands of jobs. So the UK needs a tightening of policy like it does a hole in the head. The same applies to most other Group of Seven countries for which similar charts can be drawn. A Nominal GDP objective is easier to achieve for the world's leading economies in concert - which is one reason to avoiding a unilateral slashing of interest rates by the UK. There will be ample opportunities for a concerted approach at the proposed G7 'employment' summit as well as the EC summit on October 29. One low-key proposal would be to ask the - already existing - staff of the European Monetary Institute to map out, without committing their bosses, what a sensible path of Nominal GDP for the Community might look like and alternative methods of achieving it. But action in the spirit of the idea is required earlier - and was indeed called for in the IMF Economic Outlook, although wrapped up in the verbiage of that institution.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / New Outhwaite compensation move SOME OF the Lloyd's Names on the loss-making Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 who did not benefit from the Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement agreed two weeks ago have grouped together to press for compensation. The Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting on the insurance market - are among a group of more than 600 who were not party to the legal action which resulted in the deal. About 80, mostly working Names - those who have jobs with Lloyd's agencies or brokers - met last night and agreed to contribute Pounds 150 each to finance a campaign to recover their insurance losses. A total of 987 Names were party to the legal action that alleged that negligence by RHM Outhwaite Underwriting and 80 other agencies was responsible for syndicate losses of more than Pounds 200m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Donald Tusk, Union of Freedom deputy </F> chairman, by correspondent Katarzyna Janowska; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Janowska] Do you believe there is a real chance  for a true unification within the Union of Freedom's Krakow  organization? After all, it is public knowledge that there is  no love lost between the Liberals [Liberal Democratic Congress,  KLD] and Unionists [Democratic Union, UD] in Krakow....    [Tusk] If it were just a question of feelings and emotions,  my presence here would not change anything at all. You cannot  influence the way people feel about one another.    [Janowska] But we are not talking about feelings: We are  talking about political facts. As recently as a few weeks ago,  UD and KLD activists in Krakow fought each other over the  influence each group wanted to wield in local self-government  structures over questions of economic policy. Now, with the  drafting of the joint list of candidates for positions in local  self-government, the UD candidates were forced to give way to  the Liberals, which was not conducive to promoting good  relations between the two groups.    [Tusk] This phenomenon is not restricted exclusively to  Krakow. Problems with integration within the Union of Freedom  occur throughout Poland because, as we know, the two groups  involved have often followed very different paths. We assumed  from the very beginning that, owing to the frequency and  intensity of contacts and a different level of conflicts, we  would achieve the optimum consensus at the top--that is, in  Warsaw--sooner than anywhere else. This assumption has proved  correct. On the other hand, sparks tend to fly more often in  local circles because of their past experience with local  self-government affairs or because of personal considerations.  However, I would prefer not to overestimate their significance.    [Janowska] Nevertheless, some local KLD activists claim  that, fearing that they might disappear from the political  stage, Messrs. Tusk and Bielecki have secured for themselves  positions in the larger party.    [Tusk] Of course, you have the right to form any opinion or  arrive at any interpretation, especially when it comes to  individual motives. However, we are bound by the party  discipline, which obliges us to reason and act in unison.  During the congress at which we decided on joining forces with  UD, there were only a handful of votes--out of the total of 300  delegates--from abstainers or adversaries of the unification  proposal. Liberals from all over the country decided to join  forces with the Democratic Union and form a single party by a  proportion of about 99 to 1. The subsequent presence and active  participation of the Liberals during the unification congress  confirmed this decision unequivocally.    In addition, Krzysztof Bielecki, who holds the post of a  high-ranking bank official in London, did not particularly  depend on the outcome of the unification congress. In fact,  neither did I--and it could even be said that I lost out by it  because I had to give up the attractive position of party  chairman in the process.    [Janowska] But, instead, you gained the post of deputy  chairman of a larger party, which actually commands seats in  parliament.    [Tusk] Even so, I do not automatically gain access to  parliament by becoming a member of the Union of Freedom party. I  believe that, contrary to the charges that have been brought  against me, the conjunction with UD opens up the field for the  activity of several thousand activists of the former KLD, who  would otherwise have remained on the margins of political life.  After all, the Liberals did not have any realistic chances of  an independent victory in the local election anywhere apart from  the Tri-City [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot].    [Janowska] Are you not afraid that the unification may  increase the already considerable distance between the former  KLD's central authorities and its local representatives?    [Tusk] At the moment, my priority is to ensure the  effectiveness of Union of Freedom policies rather than the  comfortable situation of its members. Anyone who fails to tune  in to the theme of our new music--that is, the construction of a  new, strong party that will win the coming elections--will lose  out in the party contest. Nevertheless, I am still moderately  optimistic as regards the future, which also goes for the Krakow  troubles. Everybody should be given time to readjust.    [Janowska] Does this end to the rivalry between the  activists of the two former parties mean that the KLD will  ultimately merge into UD?    [Tusk] I would be happiest if it meant that the former  Congress and the former Union merge equally into the Union of  Freedom. However, we cannot pretend that things are different  from what they really are, and so we must accept that the former  UD leaders will continue to play a leading role in places where  the former UD was particularly strong. All the same, I do not  regard this as a great problem, especially in Krakow, where the  former UD circles were more akin to the KLD circles than they  were in, say, Warsaw. I am inclined to treat the conjunction of  UD and the KLD not as a union between two political parties but  as a rapprochement between two separate tendencies that proved  capable of pursuing the same philosophy on a number of issues.  I trust that there will be no instances, either in Poland at  large or, specifically, in Krakow, whereby either of these  formerly separate tendencies refuses to participate actively in  the life of the new party. On the other hand, it could happen  that individual political figures will experience difficulty in  carving a place for themselves within that new reality. But  that is something that cannot be helped.    [Janowska] How long will we have to wait for the actual,  practical unification?    [Tusk] During the unification congress we held in April, we  allowed a year for that. The next national congress of the  Union of Freedom will be preceded by a truly democratic internal  party election. By April of next year, we will be able to say  that the intraparty hierarchy has been determined according to  the wishes of all Union of Freedom members.    [Janowska] When will the Union of Freedom nominate its  presidential candidate? We have already heard certain names  being mentioned--such as Jacek Kuron, Leszek Balcerowicz, and  Professor Andrzej Zoll.    [Tusk] There is no need to nominate our candidate to the  office of president today or even tomorrow. However, the Union  of Freedom must begin to get used to the thought that it might  be best to name a candidate representing several tendencies. I  hope that the all-Poland congress of the Union of Freedom,  scheduled for the spring of next year, will mark the moment of  the official nomination of our candidate. For the time being,  all speculation as to his name must remain just speculation.</p>

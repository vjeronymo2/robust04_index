			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Rush on Tesco computer offer THERE's a rush on Tesco's latest special offer. With just three weeks to go schools around the country are pulling out all the stops to claim the computers and software on offer from the supermarket chain in return for vouchers. Tesco expects the promotion to cost it more than Pounds 3m. It has printed 42m vouchers and so far distributed 10m. For every Pounds 25 spent on its groceries, Tesco is giving a voucher worth about 38p redeemable by schools in software and computing equipment. Some 3,500 vouchers will buy Acorn's BBC A3000; with another 1,400 comes a JP150 printer; and just 300 gets a 'Nelson's Navy at Trafalgar' software package. Mr John Patten, the new education secretary, who has forthright views on good and evil, would doubtless praise the enterprising efforts by schools to help themselves by tracking down the vouchers. Staff and parents have been approaching businesses to collect on their behalf. In Swindon, collecting boxes are in the foyers of churches, hospitals and police stations. Door-to-door collections are reported in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. Wren Park primary and Ravensdale infants schools, in Mickleover, Derby, have put giant 'barometers' in front of their schools measuring progress in voucher collection. Tesco says that Essex people and the Welsh appear to be the most avid voucher collectors. Should not the state be providing all this equipment anyway? 'Yes', says one Roman Catholic head, 'But remember the good book: unto him that has, more will be given.'</p>

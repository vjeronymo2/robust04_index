			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEMAND SOARS AT VACATION TIME;  </P> <P> AS SUMMER NEARS, FIRMS SET TO CASH IN ON TRAVELERS CHECK BOOM  </P> <P> Summer vacation often means travel, and traditionally summer is the biggest  travel season in the United States. To that end, companies that serve travelers  are beginning to gird themselves for the annual onslaught. A case in point:  travelers checks.  </P> <P> Three of the world's biggest travelers check companies have come out with  announcements. Spokesmen for the three -- American Express Travel Related  Services, MasterCard International and Visa International -- said the approach  of summer was the reason the announcements were timed for late March.  </P> <P> "Approximately 40% of our annual sales take place in June, July and August,"  said John B. Wright, president of MasterCard's travelers check unit.  </P> <P> What's new in the hotly competitive $56-billion market for travelers checks?  The battle rages on two fronts.  </P> <P> The first line is the consumer, who should be concerned with fees,  acceptability and ease of refunds. Experts said about two-thirds of the  travelers checks sold in this country are sold without fees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seek Highest Profit  </P> <P> Acceptance worldwide and ease of refunds are the subject of debate among the  companies and the theme of various ad campaigns.  </P> <P> The other battlefield is the distributor, who wants to know which is the most  profitable check to sell.  </P> <P> With the last few days, the big players announced these changes:  </P> <P> * American Express launched an advertising campaign for its Worldwide Refund  Delivery program, which promises to hand-deliver replacements for lost or  stolen American Express travelers checks anywhere in the world.  </P> <P> The company, the industry leader and the biggest spender on consumer  advertising for the checks, says the refund can be obtained by calling one of  12 toll-free numbers from any of the 570 million telephones in the world.  </P> <P> * MasterCard, taking a stand on the distribution front, introduced a voluntary  program in which it will invest the "float" -- the money paid by customers for  travelers checks that have not yet been spent -- on behalf of any financial  institution that sells its checks, and will pay that institution a sales  commission.  </P> <P> Previously, the institutions had to pay MasterCard an administrative fee and  invest the float themselves. Wright, the unit's president, said many small  banks and other sellers had asked for this system, which is the way American  Express operates. MasterCard, an association of member banks, does not issue  travelers checks itself, but licenses issuers.  </P> <P> * Visa announced an expanded refund network and predicted that it would outsell  American Express outside the United States this year -- which produced the  closest thing to a snort of derision one is likely to get from the  buttoned-down financial-services types at American Express. As Tom Cash, senior  vice president at American Express Travel-Related Services, put it: "People can  make all kinds of projections, and what they have to do is deliver on that."  </P> <P> Overall, the international travelers check market is growing at 7% to 8% a  year, notwithstanding the increasing acceptability of credit cards in many  tourist destinations. That's twice the rate of growth of the American travel  business, according to Cash, who added that he sees travelers checks as an  alternative to cash, not to credit cards.  </P> <P> "People still buy travelers checks," said Spencer Nilson, publisher of the  Nilson Report, a publication that tracks travelers checks and other non-cash  payment systems.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of people don't want to carry their credit cards. The difference  is, you can convert travelers checks to cash, and (with) bank cards you can't  always do that. There's no substitute (for cash) for a taxicab."  </P></p>

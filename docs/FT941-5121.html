			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West expands to Pounds 41.3m Bristol &amp; West building society, the UK's tenth largest, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 41.3m for the year to end-December 1993, a rise of 5.6 per cent on the Pounds 39.1m for 1992. It also restated its 1992 profits as Pounds 14m in the light of new accounting standards which affect how the sale of some freehold property is presented. The society's provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 14.6 per cent, to Pounds 63.3m against Pounds 74.1m. Mr John Burke, chief executive, said that the provisions charge underlined the fact that until a relatively recent change in approach, the society had sought to reach arrangements with borrowers in arrears rather than moving more quickly to repossession. The society said that the volume of residential mortgage arrears fell by 45 per cent to Pounds 71m. Mortgage advances rose by 11.6 per cent to Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 997m), while net receipts of retail savings more than doubled to Pounds 230m (Pounds 101m). B&amp;W's wholesale funding fell to 25.1 per cent of shares and deposits, against 27.8 per cent in 1992. Total assets rose to Pounds 8.14bn (Pounds 7.73bn). Mr Burke said that the society was pressing ahead with the sale of 46 branches in estate agent chains Hamptons and Bristol &amp; West Property Services. The remaining branches - about 70 in Hamptons and about 30 in BWPS  -will be retained. The group's cost/income ratio was 56 per cent, down slightly from 57 per cent in 1992. The society's cost income ratio was 44 per cent (45 per cent).</p>

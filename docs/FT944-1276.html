			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: Bennett's 'Wind in the Willows' returns - Theatre The Alan Bennett dramatisation of The Wind in the Willows has been a huge popular draw for the National Theatre at Christmas time since its widely-acclaimed premiere four years ago. Now, returning to it for the first time since that premiere, I love again much of what I had loved then, and find new things to love too. But, as so often happens in life on returning to scenes of bygone delight, I am startled to realise how much both it and I have changed. My strongest memory of the Nicholas Hytner production was of Mark Thompson's vividly evocative decor, with its miraculous changes of scene. This is still marvellous. By the time - about halfway through Act One - the Wild Wood turns on its axis to reveal Badger's front door (slanted in a shelf that suddenly appears in the wood's floor) and then turns again to take us down into his home (an old-style resort of quiet distinction), I am as entranced to re-see this changeable spectacle as any novice in the audience. Of the features that have joined the production since it was new, the most splendid is the Toad of Patrick Barlow. He is in every way larger than was Griff Rhys-Jones; at times he reminds me of Dame Edna, at times of Billy Bunter. He is so robust and so naughty that he seems at times to be adding lines to the text; and it is a great compliment to him that in almost every case I found afterwards the lines were actually Bennett's. 'Me dress up as a washerwoman? . . . Couldn't I be a lady novelist?' Later, as a washerwoman: 'Shirts are to me, Sir, what daffodils is to Wordsworth'. I had not known just how funny Toad's pretend death-scene ('Give me the sun]') is. And oh] the way Barlow says, when Toad on trial is asked to renounce motor-cars, 'Never' - or rather 'Nev-ah' like Winston Churchill defying Hitler. A Churchillian Toad? It heightens the central joke of Bennett's adaptation, which is to point up the little-Englander there'll-always-be-a-riverbank kernel of the original Kenneth Grahame story. But the production - which has been recreated by Edward Kemp - has changed in other ways too. It feels more child-oriented, and closer to pantomime. In 1990, there was some attempt to capture the moving chapter in Grahame which most closely addresses the numinous: the Piper at the Gates of Dawn. I had hoped that this scene would have been more successfully realised; but now it has now been simply dropped. And, like every childhood locale revisited, the world of The Wind in the Willows seems, onstage, smaller and less innocent to me now. Not unlike the Guy Burgess he once so memorably dramatised - Burgess who wanted to retain the charm of English life though having betrayed England - Bennett wants duplicitously to cash in on the nursery charm of Grahame's tale and at the same time to mock the English class pretensions on which it is based. This method of lampooning Englishness and cuddling it at the same time is typical of Bennett, of course; he was at it as far back as Forty Years On. In about 80 per cent of The Wind in the Willows it is bliss to see how well he can have his cake and eat it. But I find the other 20 per cent of the play both irritating and depressing. It is good to renew acquaintance with Michael Bryant's grave Badger. And it is just as good to make the new acquaintance of Jasper Britton's spivvy chief Weasel, of Crispin Letts's tender Mole, and to find the unsinkable Betty Marsden as Washerwoman and Bargewoman. Michael Jayston, though slightly too subdued and solemn, is a properly Home Counties old-school-tie Rat. As for Barry Stanton, he very nearly persuades me that Albert the horse is the best role in the whole piece. In repertory at the Olivier Theatre</p>

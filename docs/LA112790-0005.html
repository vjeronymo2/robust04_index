			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW GENDER BIAS CREEPS INTO COURTS;  </P> <P> JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROPOSALS ARE BRILLIANTLY TO THE POINT  </P> <P> The workings of the state Judicial Council appear to be grist for cocktail  conversations among lawyers but of little interest to anyone else. But the  recent recommendations of the council -- the constitutionally mandated body  that sets rules for courts and standards of judicial administration -- should  interest anyone who may ever set foot in a courtroom.  </P> <P> The recommendations attack gender bias in the legal system in ways so specific  that they will likely affect any woman who walks into court. And because this  comes from the powerful council, there's no doubt that all of the 67  recommendations will become court rules once the details are worked out. Those  rules make California a leader among states.  </P> <P> A council report concluded last March that women, be they attorneys, witnesses  or otherwise, generally were perceived as having less credibility than men.  That's not a problem unique to the legal system. But courts exist in the  context of assumed fairness and impartiality. To the degree rhetoric and  reality fail to meet, faith in the rule of law and the legal system itself  erodes. That's why the council's effort to combat anti-female bias in its own  ranks is vital.  </P> <P> The council recommendations address ways to curb both egregious and subtle  discrimination against women in the legal system. There are the obvious  offenses: a judge who calls one attorney Mr. Johnson and the other "honey" or  "Mary" -- an attorney who refers to the other attorney as "this babe." But  there are the subtle, more common biases that illustrate the way in which  "business as usual" in the legal system sets up barriers to equal justice for  women. A key example is the courts' way of allocating court personnel and  resources, which the council found was biased against family and juvenile cases  -- which disproportionately affect women and children. One prominent jurist  told of presiding for 10 days over a civil trial involving a $100,000 dispute  between two companies; later, when she was in dependency court presiding over  custody and child abuse cases, she was expected to deal with 30 to 40 cases a  day, with each case involving an average of 2.5 children. So, 10 days for  $100,000 for a company, or 10 days for crucial cases involving 1,000 children.  Nothing could tell the story better than that. The council has decided that the  system must re-order its priorities.  </P> <P> The specifics for changing procedures will take time. But the process of  sensitizing the system has already begun. Many judges are learning more about  how gender bias creeps into language. Soon gender-neutral language will be  required in all local court rules, documents and jury instructions.  </P> <P> The council's gender-bias work was one of the last official acts of former  state Chief Justice Rose Bird. Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas played an admirable  role in keeping the issue alive; a racial and ethnic bias committee is in the  works. The council can't rid society of its prejudices, but justice demands  that the legal system be held to a higher standard.  </P></p>

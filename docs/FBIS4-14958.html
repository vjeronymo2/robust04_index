			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, April 5 (SNARK)--A three-month assembly  (the second one in this year) started in Armenia. It is  supposed to involve the medium-rank staff of the Ministries and  State Departments. This is the assertion of the Armenian State  Minister for Defence Vazgen Sargisyan. Speaking on television  he declared that such assemblies will be carried out constantly  from now on, and all the Armenian citizens liable for call-up  will take part in them.    The State Minister confirmed that after a short military  training the participants of the assembly are usually sent to  the Armenian- Azerbaijani frontier. However, they serve not at  the front line, but in rearguard.</p>

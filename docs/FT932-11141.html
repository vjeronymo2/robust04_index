			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US links Gatt deal to better EC access THE US requires better market access for its agricultural exports to the EC in order to conclude a Uruguay Round deal, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, said yesterday. Following meetings in Brussels with Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, Mr Espy said the issue of market access was left 'largely unresolved' by last November's EC-US breakthrough in Washington on farm trade. The US agriculture secretary said the administration had no wish to reopen the Washington agreement, which staved off a transatlantic trade war. But in order to conclude an agreement under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) 'we need better market access,' he said. He would not be drawn on whether the US was seeking a managed trade solution, guaranteeing it market share, and merely said officials from both sides would be looking at the issue of access. He also said it was 'time-urgent' for the EC to implement the Washington agreement on oilseeds, hinting that otherwise the powerful US soya industry would press for the Dollars 1bn sanctions withdrawn last November to be reinstated. Mr Steichen emphasised that 'their interpretation is different from ours' on market access. 'The US wants fixed markets now,' he added, pointing out that the Uruguay Round final act mentioned only market 'opportunities'. Senior Commission officials said it would be almost impossible to get EC member states to agree on any guarantees for market access, beyond the commitments already entered into under the Washington agreement and last May's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy - already facing opposition from France, the EC's main food producer and exporter. Mr Steichen said the EC should adopt the oilseeds part of the Washington agreement - separate from the Uruguay Round proper - by next month. He emphasised that if France continued with its opposition, it could be outvoted. 'This is not a question of unanimity. It will be settled by a qualified majority' of member states, he said. Mr Espy nevertheless said he would be reporting to President Bill Clinton that a conclusion to the round was possible.</p>

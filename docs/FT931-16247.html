			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Dublin lifts overnight rate to 100% IRELAND'S central bank was forced yesterday to raise its overnight lending rate from 50 per cent to 100 per cent as the punt continued to come under intense pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism, write Tim Coone in Dublin and James Blitz in London. The Bundesbank's decision to trim its short-dated money market rates raised hopes that the ERM might survive recent tensions, and allowed a number of European countries - including Belgium and the Netherlands - to cut their interest rates. However, the punt continued to face selling pressure and traded at its floors against two of the strongest ERM currencies, the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder. The Belgian and Dutch central banks cut their rates in moves which underlined the easier policy stance shown by the Bundesbank. The Dutch central bank reduced three important rates - the discount, secured loans and promissory note rates - by 25 basis points to 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5 per cent respectively. The Belgian central bank cut its discount and emergency lending rates by 25 basis points to 7.50 and 10 per cent respectively. The Swiss national bank cut its discount rate by half a point to 5.5 per cent.</p>

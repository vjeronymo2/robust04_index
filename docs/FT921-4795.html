			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House court victory Midland &amp; Scottish Resources yesterday lost its appeal against Trafalgar House in their protracted wrangle over the Ocean Emerald oil rig. The Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court's ruling in January that Trafalgar House can keep control of the rig, which its Davy division is building, until it is able to draw on a Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's bankers or until it is paid in full by MSR. Until the legal fight is resolved, former shareholders of Davy, which Trafalgar House acquired last year, will get none of the Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, second instalment for their shares from Trafalgar House. Trafalgar House is planning to write to the former shareholders next week. The rig was physically completed in December but a huge amount of documentation and certification work has still to be completed before the financial transaction on the rig can take place.</p>

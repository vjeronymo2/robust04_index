Chamber Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has two deputies and one  post remains vacant. Shumeyko nominated two candidates for the  post -- head of Voronezh region administration Aleksandr Kovalev  and Chairman of the regional council of the Leningrad region  Vadim Gustov. The region retained the old name in contrast to  the administrative centre which was renamed into St. Petersburg.    However, Kovalev refused to run for the post, while Gustov  lacked 15 votes to become deputy speaker. 71 lawmakers  supported him instead of the necessary minimum of 86.</p>

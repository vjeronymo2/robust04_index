			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Working Life: The ice men cometh - At the bar If you haven't heard of ice beer you will. It's no good muttering 'fad' and ordering something else. Putting ice cubes in your pint won't do either. Ice beer is brewed like that - it's served sans glace. And if the North American consumer is anything to go by, it tastes just great. A year after its launch, ice beer has 12 per cent of the Canadian market: 2 per cent in the US. But it isn't cheap - I paid Pounds 4.90 (Dollars 7.60) for two bottles at a central London pub. Labatt's quotes Pounds 1.50-Pounds 1.80 as a pub price range. Molson Pounds 1.90-Pounds 2.00 and Foster's Pounds 4.79 for a four-pack from the off-licence. All are aiming for the trendy premium packaged lager market. Bottling is fashionable and the buzz word is ICE. Of course ice beer is a sophisticated product and the result of various brewing processes too complicated to worry about - suffice to say they all involve super-chilling or freezing to produce ice crystals. All should be served cold: Labatt's recommends 42F. When you and I get the stuff, the crystals have gone. Taking the ice out can flush out proteins and compounds and 'improve' the taste and freshness and/or strengthen the beer. Very little is new in brewing - the Canadians used to leave cider out in buckets to freeze, and after removing the ice, would fall around for weeks on the resulting concentrate. What's left after you take the ice out of Labatt Ice Beer, Molson Ice, and Foster's Ice is a premium lager which is one of two things. If you're the brewer its smooth, clean, clear, crisp, and strong at between 5 and 5.6 per cent alcohol by volume. If you're the consumer the word bland may creep into your over-heated brain: the memory of drinking defrosted beer from the fridge lingers around the taste buds. My own judgment is that the lack of after-taste does make ice beer very smooth. It's an odd sensation, the tingling clean taste on the tongue just fades away. Then nothing happens. The alcohol content provides taste. It is refreshing, and different, and on a blazing summer day the word ICE on the label is going to empty a few shelves. If the market takes off expect further competition in the UK.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gabi Zohar] </F>   [Text] The way the Palestinian police has managed to take  control over security in the Gaza Strip and Jericho is "not  bad," but the civilian institutions are still at the beginning  of being formed. This was stated yesterday by Major General  Dani Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the  territories, at a seminary on the political economy of peace in  the Middle East, held at Haifa University yesterday.    Rothschild explained that Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement]  and the Islamic Jihad are not interested in holding a dialogue  with Israel. "At best, they consider taking part in the  Palestinian establishment, but they are opposed to the peace  process.    "Should they become part of the Palestinian autonomy, this  will not happen as part of a democratic process in which a  society votes and makes democratic decisions. This could lead  to problems, if Hamas wins a majority in the Palestinian  autonomy. Israel is trying to help with a money-equivalent and  today employs 25,000 Palestinians from the autonomy. Work in  Israel is not granted automatically -- it is a consequence of  the security situation and economic needs.    "The number of Palestinian laborers permitted to work in  Israel is occasionally considered with regard to these two  criteria. If in the future we will see that the Palestinian  police and security forces are managing to take control over the  self-government regions and keep them quiet, we will further  increase the number of Palestinian laborers in Israel." Gen.  Rothschild noted that the standard of living in Gaza and Jericho  has deteriorated since Israel pulled out from there.  Nevertheless, it will take a few months before these things can  be statistically examined.    "At the same time, I am optimistic and I do not believe that  a financial or economic problem can foil the agreement. It  seems to me that the Palestinian Autonomy is stable enough to  improve its situation even if the process takes a month or two.  There will be cause for concern if the Palestinian  establishment does not show the residents that their standard of  living is improving. There will be no vacuum in this place. If  the situation does not improve, Islamic forces that oppose the  peace process will step in.    Gen. Rothschild estimated that the economic situation will  improve in Gaza and Jericho within the coming two weeks, after  the donor countries last week agreed to transfer $42 million to  the autonomy. Contacts between the Palestinian body, set up to  coordinate the transfer of money from the EU, and the European  donor countries will continue next month. The money that will  arrive in two weeks will provide for immediate needs, and the  funds that will arrive later are earmarked for various projects.    "The Palestinian self-government authorities should make a  list of priorities for the donors. You cannot pay for the  construction of houses before an infrastructure and a sewage  system is built, and the donor countries do not know that,"  Rothschild said. He added: "One of the donor countries' foreign  ministers told me recently: We will provide for 5,000 houses.  When I asked him: what about schools and infrastructure? he  said: `It is their problem.'"    Referring to the Palestinian aspiration to cut themselves  off  from Israeli aid at once, Rothschild said that they will have to  choose which is more important to them: national pride or  economic needs. The idea to construct a power station on a ship  at sea only because they do not want to receive electric power  from Israel is economically wrong.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 21 June  reports that "Major General Dani Rothschild, the coordinator of  government activities in the territories, said that Israeli  companies tried to take over Palestinian businesses by flooding  the territories with goods. That is why the Palestinians seek  to cut themselves off from the Israeli economy. At the same  time, Rothschild made the assessment that despite all the talk  about separation from Israel by politicians in the territories,  Palestinian businessmen and economists would prefer ties with  the Israeli economy rather than with Jordan. The coordinator  warned that if the Palestinian authorities did not rapidly  improve the standard of living in the autonomous areas, the PLO  may lose control of the streets to radical elements. Israel,  therefore, must do all in its power to help the PLO."]</p>

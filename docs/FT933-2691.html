			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Technology: Unlocking a new operating system - Worth Watching Leading US personal computer maker Compaq Computer took a technological plunge on Tuesday with a range of minicomputer-replacement 'multi-processor' systems, writes Geof Wheelwright. Known as the Compaq ProLiant family of 'file servers', they have up to four computer processors in a single machine (the highest number ever offered by Compaq). ProLiant systems will come with specially-designed implementations of Novell's NetWare, SCO's Unix and Microsoft's Windows NT Advanced Server on four compact discs. These CDs can be used with the built-in CD-Rom player to install any one of the operating systems - although users must first contact their Compaq supplier to pay for a software 'key' to 'unlock' the operating system they choose to install. This system means users can have immediate access to the network operating system of their choice without having to order it for inclusion with the system. Compaq: US, 713 370 0670; UK, 081 332 3000.</p>

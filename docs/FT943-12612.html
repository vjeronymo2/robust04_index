			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: Shopping marches on - Two new victims of shopaholics One in six of us is a shopaholic, Mintel reports, and although this seems a depressing statistic, I prefer to look at it the other way and think that five out of six of us are not. That species - so highly developed in America  -which needs to shop in order to feel it exists, is still a rarity in the UK. But there is disturbing evidence that it is increasingly difficult to find a shopping-free zone, no matter where you go. Wimbledon, the Royal Opera House, Hampton Court Palace, Buckingham Palace . . . you name it, they will be trying to sell you more than spectator sports or a cultural experience. They will be there with their souvenirs, special offers, postcards and scarves. This summer two more bastions have fallen prey to the notion that no experience is complete unless there is the opportunity to shop: Goodwood, that most demure of race-courses; and Glyndebourne, that most magical of opera houses. In Sussex, Glorious Goodwood is about to begin. It runs from Tuesday to Saturday and, aficionados will know, it has always had a completely different atmosphere from Ascot. There are fewer of the international or Euro-chic set around, dress-codes are informal, even for the Richmond enclosure, and picnics are part of the treat. This is not the place for blindingly smart jackets and short skirts. Go instead for soft jackets and flowing skirts - think country prettiness instead of metropolitan chic. As for the chaps - where Ascot is morning dress and top hats, Goodwood is full of racegoers in blazers and chinos or linen suits and panama hats. Friday sees a grand ball in conjunction with Tiffany, the jeweller, and, to coincide with Goodwood Week, the company has launched a first collection of Goodwood-related products. The collection is small and based on the colour yellow - a particularly brilliant shade found in a Stubbs painting. You can choose from socks, head-scarves, silk ties, braces, umbrellas and panama hats. You could spend 50p on a pencil, Pounds 30 on a Panama hat or Pounds 65 on a silk scarf. During Goodwood Week there will be a shop near the paddock. Afterwards, everything will be available by mail order (brochures and details from Goodwood House, Chichester, West Sussex, P018 0PX. Tel: 0243-774107). Those who have already been to Glyndebourne may have noticed that the new shop sells a host of items that could come to the rescue of forgetful punters - you could buy chocolates or champagne (Pounds 25), waterproof-backed picnic rugs (Pounds 55) and ultra-lightweight folding seats (Pounds 36.75), insulated bottle bags and champagne stoppers, canvas bags and umbrellas, all in Glyndebourne green. Also on sale are photograph albums, address books, noteblocks and pencils. For opera buffs there are recordings, videos, opera journals and the like. Prices range from 95p for the notebooks to Pounds 11.95 for a visitors' book. The shop is open from 3pm until the end of each performance. A catalogue is being produced for the autumn.

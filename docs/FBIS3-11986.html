			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Federal Supreme Court [STF] has approved a  preliminary ruling in favor of the legislative branch employees  union by 10 votes against one. This represents the suspension  of the government decision to withhold 10.9 percent of their  March salaries.    This is really a partial preliminary ruling, because the STF  has not decided whether the wage increase should be immediately  paid. The STF has determined that the government should adopt  the necessary measures to have the difference deposited in the  Bank of Brazil in the accounts of the Chamber of Deputies, the  Senate, and the National Accounting Office. The money will  remain at the disposal of the STF in special interest-earning  accounts until the STF issues a definitive ruling, something  that will probably take place in May.    In order to continue with the trial, Justice Ilmar Galvao  will ask for more information from Congress and from President  Itamar Franco, who will have 30 days to answer the STF. Soon  after, the attorney general must give his opinion on the case.    The preliminary ruling issued today only favors legislative  branch employees. In making a final ruling the STF will take  into account the administrative decision made on 10 March, when  it decided that judicial branch salaries should be converted  into the URV [real value unit] rate established on the 20th of  each month.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Firefighters to see Clarke today LEADERS OF the Fire Brigades Union are due to meet Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, today to discuss the future of the pay formula that has decided the wages of their 49,000 members for 14 years. Under the formula drawn up by the last Labour government to end the first national firefighters' strike, their pay is linked to the upper quartile of all male manual workers' earnings. Last November the firefighters secured a 4.9 per cent pay rise as a result of wage comparability, but their union fears the government intends to scrap the pay formula.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: The mysterious Lenz WHEN Jakob Lenz died in mysterious circumstances in Moscow in 1792, an obituarist noted that he would be 'mourned by few and missed by none'. Most of his old acquaintances had assumed he was long since dead. It was a sad end for a man who had once been a youthful protege of Goethe. He was born in 1751 and produced his best-known works, including a homage to Shakespearean drama, in his early twenties. 'Best-known' is a relative term, not until this year's Edinburgh Festival has a collection of his plays been published in English, though some readers will know Lenz indirectly because The Soldiers led to Buchner's Woyzeck. If - and the Festival still has to prove it - Lenz has a lasting claim to fame as a dramatist, it is on the grounds that he was Brechtian before Brecht and politically Marxist before Marx. He writes about the exploitation of ordinary people and their readiness to be exploited. Social class and male domination play a heavy role in The Soldiers which opened at the Royal Lyceum Theatre on Tuesday. This was the era of mercenaries and endless small wars. The officers picked up women wherever they could and, as often as not the women would fall for them. There is no reason to think that Lenz gives an inaccurate account of his times. The striking fact is the extent of his social criticism. Lenz appears to condemn the tradesman father of the girl who is seduced as much as the officer who does the deed. Gerard Murphy who plays the tradesman bears more than a passing resemblance to the Reverend Ian Paisley. On the credit side, Lenz shows his debt to Shakespeare by ignoring the dramatic unities. The Soldiers lasts for only 90 minutes, yet it has 34 scenes, a few of them only a line or two long. Nothing is wasted, indeed a great deal is gained, by passing quickly and naturally from one scene to another. Parts remind one of the rapid scene changes in The Tempest and Macbeth. More dubious is a passion for melodrama. Had he survived to 105 Lenz could have had a career on the Victorian boards. We shall pass over the little girl lost and poisoning scenes. Like David Mamet's Oleanna, The Soldiers has alternative endings. The original version has the commanding officer saying that so many troubles could be avoided if the king would provide the army with concubines who would follow the wars wherever they went. The rather grand Countess de la Roche agrees: 'Oh, if only someone could be found to promote the idea at court] It would benefit the whole nation.' Subsequently Lenz changed the ending on the grounds that it was unlikely that of the countess's rank would go along with such heresy. This production is by the Glasgow Citizens Company directed by Philip Prowse. I made a bet with myself which ending they would choose and was glad to be wrong. Prowse goes for the later, gentler version and Jane Bertish as the Countess does it well. Prowse also designed the sets, which look splendid at the beginning and end, but the play as a whole is made for a smaller stage and a smaller theatre.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Joulwan named to head Nato forces PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday named General George A Joulwan as Supreme Allied Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's forces in Europe (Saceur), George Graham writes from Washington. The Pentagon said the Nato allies had already approved Gen Joulwan's appointment, which opens the way for General John Shalikashvili, his predecessor as Saceur, to take up his new post as chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said he would not complete Gen Shalikashvili's confirmation until a successor had been named. Gen Joulwan, 53, is in Panama as head of the US Southern Command, in charge of all US forces in Latin America. Known for a ferocious temper, he has overseen US efforts to curb drug running and terrorism in Latin America, as well as presiding over preparations for the US's withdrawal from the Panama Canal by the end of 1999. An infantryman with two combat tours in Vietnam and extensive service in Europe, he had been considered less experienced than some other candidates in the political skills required for the job. Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence, yesterday decided not to fire Admiral Frank Kelso, the senior serving US navy officer, for his handling of the 1991 'Tailhook' sexual harassment scandal, Jurek Martin writes. Mr Aspin overruled the recommendations of Mr John Dalton, appointed by Mr Clinton as the civilian secretary of the navy this summer. His action probably avoided further souring of relations between Mr Clinton and the military. Mr Dalton urged that Admiral Kelso be dismissed for failing to show leadership in the 'Tailhook' conference in Las Vegas, during which navy airmen allegedly assaulted female colleagues.</p>

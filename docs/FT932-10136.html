			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Trade News: The 'plain folks' Kantor risks alienating  -A Midwest mayor complains about protectionist trade policies At 6ft 7in, the mayor of Milwaukee, Mr John Norquist, can pack a memorable punch, which he did rhetorically last week with some telling jabs at the US steel industry and protectionist politicians. 'Mickey Kantor (the US trade representative) says he doesn't believe in trade theology. Well, I've got 50 unemployed longshoreman who don't believe in trade theology either. They just want to work.' The mayor took up the case of the dockworkers as well as Milwaukee's Paper Machinery Corporation on a trip to Washington last week. The company, which had been successfully competing against French and German companies, has had to absorb a 10-20 per cent increase in steel prices since the US commerce department put temporary tariffs on steel imports. The tariffs, a result of the dozens of dumping and countervailing duty cases brought by the steel industry against companies in 21 countries, could cost hundreds more jobs in Milwaukee and other port cities and at the factories which mould steel into products for export around the world. Authorities at the Port of Toledo, which last year handled 50,000 tonnes of leaded steel from Europe, say the tariffs have thrown 45 dock workers off the job. The ports of New Orleans, Philadelphia, Long Beach, California, and Houston also report job losses. According to the Milwaukee city government, the steel suits have cost the local economy about Dollars 2m in the first five months of the year; steel imports have plummeted by an estimated 78 per cent. The warehouses are almost totally empty. Mayor Norquist is particularly irked at the 'sheer 100 per cent unalloyed greed' of the steel companies, which he sees as too wimpish to compete. Years of protection have allowed them to pour billions of dollars into modernisation, but the money was gained on the backs of their customers, he says. The mayor has no patience with charges of dumping. 'If someone wants to set prices under their cost of production, say thank you,' he says. 'The high value products are those which use steel. If they do subsidise steel, that makes our other products more competitive.' President Bill Clinton aimed his presidential campaign at plain folks such as Mayor Norquist, a Democrat and former lathe operator; the two met briefly on the campaign trail. So Mayor Norquist decided to bring up the steel tariffs with the 'populists' in the White House. His message was dutifully received - by the aide of Mr Clinton's 33-year-old political assistant, Mr Rahm Emanuel. The administration has stood visibly back from the 'quasi-judicial process' under which the commerce department determines how much dumping and subsidies there have been and the International Trade Commission decides if the US industry has been injured by the alleged dumping and subsidies. 'It's a judicial process that was set up by a political process to turn normal competition into findings of illegal dumping,' the mayor says, reaping scorn upon his fellow politicians. 'It is convenient for them to sit back and say we didn't do it. . . It was this mechanistic formula when actually they're making a policy decision to prop up an industry that already has 85 per cent of the market.' Mayor Norquist has fixed upon Mr Kantor, who implements rather than originates Mr Clinton's trade policies, as the administration's bogeyman. 'Mickey Kantor doesn't know which products to penalise and which to subsidise. When he's trying to penalise Germany and Japan, he's hurting Milwaukee. He's decided to punish Milwaukee and punish Wisconsin to prop up this industry that doesn't want to compete in the marketplace. All they want to do is sit on their congressmen's laps.' Mr Kantor has no role in the dumping/countervailing duty regime, but he has defended it as necessary: 'I would say the US process, both in terms of fair hearing and transparency, is probably as good or better than any process in the world.' While not directly involved in the countervailing duty suits, Mr Kantor is suppressing a planned study by the ITC that might reveal the harmful impact of 'unfair trade laws', a project proposed by his Republican predecessor. He is also backing congressional opposition to proposals in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks which could open US trade law to challenges by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. None of this means much to the people of Milwaukee who benefit little from federal government projects. They want the 'change' Mr Clinton promised, the mayor says - an end to meaningless free market rhetoric. They want to get on with their business without government interference.</p>

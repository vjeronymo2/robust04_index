The slump in production in the  Far East has reached a critical point, it stresses, and a  further reduction in the production and supply of energy cannot  be permitted. The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity in  some parts of the Far East has reached 200 rubles, whereas in  central parts of Russia it is 16 rubles. The decisions of  government bodies for the development of the Far East's fuel and  energy base are not being fulfilled.    In order to avoid the complete shutdown of industrial and  other enterprises, the heads of administration of krays and  oblasts in the Far East are asking the Russian president to  urgently examine the question of state support for the region's  economy. In particular, the Far East workers are hoping to  obtain loans and credits amounting to 140 billion rubles to  settle their debt for petroleum products sent to the region.  The territories are also asking for the federal budget debt to  enterprises in the state sector amounting to 450 billion rubles  to be written off. A number of other questions regarding the  supply of vital needs to the region are also raised in the  appeal.</p>

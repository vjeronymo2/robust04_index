			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels May 25 TASS -- Russian Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev met with British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind  at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss  Russia's concept of partnership with NATO.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Grachev said that European  security is not only NATO's prerogative. Security should be  ensured by joint effort of all political and military  structures, he added.    Speaking about bilateral cooperation, Grachev noted that an  agreement has been reached to send to Britain about 60 junior  Russian officers for military training.    Additionally, working groups will be set up this year to  study prospects for holding joint Russian-British military  manoeuvres next year.    Rifkind expressed satisfaction with the fact that Russia has  confirmed its intention to join the Partnership for Peace  programme.    In his address to the NATO leaders earlier today Grachev  said  that Russia is ready to develop broad and constructive  cooperation with NATO and called for devising an "active  mechanism" of bilateral consultations on all problems concerning  European and global security.    Grachev said that "Russia is ready to develop genuine and  all  embracing strategic cooperation with NATO. NATO's partnership  for peace programme should play a role in this process."    However, he stressed that the programme "is not a  comprehensive answer to the realities of the new epoch" and is  only the first step towards building a new strategic alliance in  the name of peace and security.    Russia is interested in broader relations with NATO to  correspond its (Russia's) weight and position in the system of  international relations, Grachev said. He emphasised that  Russia does not claim any privileges, but is seeking to develop  and expand the very concept of partnership between the East and  West.    He said Russia is also ready to develop cooperation with  NATO  in coordination of military policies, peace-keeping operations,  military planning and training, as well as disarmament, arms  control, conversion, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and  nature protection.</p>

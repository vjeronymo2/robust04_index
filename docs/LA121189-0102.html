			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FDA AWARDS GENERIC DRUGS A 99% CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH  </P> <P> The dust is slowly starting to settle on the generic drug scandal. The Food and  Drug Administration has completed a preliminary survey of top-selling generic  medications and found that 99% were fine.  </P> <P> The news came as a tremendous relief for Henry. His father and grandfather both  died of heart attacks at an early age. His own blood pressure is high and his  cholesterol is elevated. To control these health threats, Henry takes Calan and  Lasix for hypertension and Nicobid for cholesterol control.  </P> <P> Before questions were raised about the safety and effectiveness of generic  drugs, Henry's monthly bill was $37. But Henry got scared after reading the  headlines, and had his pharmacist fill his prescriptions with only brand names.  His bill soared to over $175.  </P> <P> This was a hardship for Henry and his wife, but like millions of other  Americans, he didn't want to risk his health on dubious generic drugs. Now,  Henry should be reassured that the vast majority of generic drugs meet federal  standards.  </P> <P> Answering the question, "Are the generic drugs on the market safe and  effective?" FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank Young recently responded, "The answer  appears to be a qualified yes."  </P> <P> The FDA's conclusion was reached after examining 30 of the most widely used  generics, medicines like hydrochlorothiazide, prednisone, antibiotics such as  amoxicillin, cephalexin and erythromycin, pain-relievers containing  acetaminophen and codeine or propoxyphene, and many others.  </P> <P> The tests considered whether these generic medications were indeed chemically  identical to their brand-name counterparts; if the active ingredients were as  strong as those in the brand-name medicines, and if the pills dissolved  properly -- a short-cut to determining if these medicines get into the  bloodstream as they should.  </P> <P> The results show that in most cases generic drugs are as good as brand-name  medications. Drugs that flunk the tests are being withdrawn.  </P> <P> The generic drug mess was brought to light as a result of whistle-blowing from  within the industry itself. One of the major manufacturers of generic products  felt that FDA officials had shown favoritism to its rivals.  </P> <P> Now that the feds have cracked down, physicians, pharmacists and patients  should return to using generic drugs with confidence. The savings are too  important to ignore.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nabisco to cut 6,000 jobs and take Dollars 445m charge RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and food group, yesterday announced that it was to cut 6,000 jobs from its worldwide workforce of 63,000 as part of a cost-cutting drive aimed at improving productivity. The restructuring would result in a charge of Dollars 445m to net income in the fourth quarter, equivalent to 32 cents a share. However, the company added that it would enhance future net earnings by an average of Dollars 250m a year. Nabisco emphasised that the job losses would be spread across the group's tobacco and food operations in the US and overseas, at all levels of the workforce. Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our restructuring programme is intended to improve margins in both the tobacco and food businesses, so we can resume our earnings growth track next year.' The company said other components of the charge included reductions in corporate expenses, promotion and merchandising programmes, and manufacturing cost improvements. In October, Nabisco had warned that fourth-quarter net income would be hit by a restructuring charge. Yesterday the shares rose by Dollars 3/8 to close at Dollars 6 5/8 in anticipation of future earnings growth. Nabisco's announcement comes less than two weeks after Philip Morris, its closest rival in the food and tobacco industry, unveiled similar plans for a restructuring aimed at defending its brands from low-cost competitors. Philip Morris said it would cut its world-wide workforce of 168,000 people by 14,000, in a move that would produce a Dollars 457m charge to fourth-quarter earnings but would later result in a Dollars 600m-a-year enhancement of earnings. Both companies have been hard hit by a price war which broke out in the US cigarette market earlier this year when Philip Morris reduced the price of its best-selling Marlboro and other premium brands by 20 per cent. RJR Reynolds, which makes Winston and Camel cigarettes, reported a 58 per cent fall in third-quarter net income because of the price war, and warned that cost-cutting measures would follow.</p>

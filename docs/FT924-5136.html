			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / SIB attacks sales methods of life insurance industry THE SELLING practices of the life insurance industry were sharply criticised yesterday by Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the UK's main financial regulator. Mr Large referred to what he described as 'mis-selling' of life products in his speech to the annual conference of the Society of Financial Advisers in York. He said that 'human nature has been found wanting in too many cases and this has shown up as bad practices and disadvantaged clients'. As a result, he said, there was widespread public unease about the industry. The vast majority of salesmen working in the industry earn commission for each policy they sell, with the heaviest income accruing in the early years of the product. This practice of 'front-end loading' has encouraged, critics say, high-pressure selling. Customers who surrender their policies early find costs have taken a large chunk of their investment. It can take about 11 years for the surrender value of a 25-year endowment policy to equal the value of premiums paid. The life assurance regulator, Lautro, has disciplined a number of companies for the inappropriate selling of policies in recent months. The previous chairman of SIB, Sir David Walker, criticised front-end loading, but the authority has done little to reform the commission system. The industry has responded sharply to past criticism. When Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, criticised selling practices in September, the Association of British Insurers said his comments 'betrayed a lack of understanding about how the insurance industry operates'. Yesterday, Mr Large said that 'the selling of life products does pose particular regulatory challenges. The combination of commission-driven selling and lack of transparency in the products themselves places an enormous weight on the conduct, the training and the professional competence of advisers, be they tied or independent'. Mr Large said regulators had been criticised for interfering too much in a business which was already suffering from the recession. 'My view is that if we could all be satisfied that high and continually updated standards of competence were universal through the industry, then it might be possible to contemplate a less prescriptive approach to regulating the client-adviser relationship. But to be frank, we do not now have that confidence.' Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers Association, said: 'It is a shame that after five years of the Financial Services Act, it is only now that the chief regulatory body has said this. Mr Large is right to pick out remuneration as well as lack of competence as a key factor.' Bonuses feel the squeeze again, Weekend, Page III</p>

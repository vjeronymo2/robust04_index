			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. Anastase Gasana, the minister for foreign  affairs in the government of the late Mrs. Agathe  Uwilingiyimana, has said that the cease-fire talked about by the  government in Rwanda is not sincere but an attempt to gain time  and carry out the Machiavellian plan to reinstall the Republican  National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND]  government. In a memorandum to the Rwandan peace talks  facilitator President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Dr.  Anastase Gasana said that the government and the army in Rwanda  have been surprised by the resolve and the strike forces of the  Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA], and they are now trying to buy  time to reorganize.    Dr. Anastase Gasana said that since the outbreak of the war,  MRND has always been for a military solution. [passage omitted]  Meanwhile, the MRND and their allies elaborated a plan to  physically eliminate opposition personalities and for that  purpose, the army trained 2,000 MRND Interahamwe [pro-MRND  militiamen], armed to massacre the population, instructed to do  so when the time comes. By assassinating the president of the  Republic, the hardliners of the past one-party regime MRND and  the army wanted to create for themselves a golden opportunity to  implement their plan of getting rid of the opposition political  leadership and militants.

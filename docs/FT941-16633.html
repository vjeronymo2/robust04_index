			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: How money was made - Scheherazade Daneshkhu traces a five-year record of investment highs and lows Investment is a gamble, and people deciding where to place their bets in 1994 may be tempted to look back five years to see if the roulette ball has fallen on their chosen numbers during that period. The chart shows the performance of various investments in the five years to the beginning of this month, and is a yardstick against which the performance of an investor's portfolio can be measured; indeed, it could tell you where you should have invested five years ago. The good news is that unless investors were heavily into the Japanese stock market, which recorded a sharp downturn in 1990, or relied on property, they will comfortably have beaten inflation to enjoy a real return. It has not been the best five-year period for the more cautious, though. Investors in building societies and National Savings did not fare as well as those in equity-linked funds, although returns for those averse to risks still have been reasonable. Take an investor in the fourth issue of National Savings index-linked certificates, providing a tax-free annual return of 4.04 per cent on top of the rate of inflation. They will have seen a rise of 56.56 per cent on their money with virtually no risk. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester compounded returns shown in the chart are net of basic-rate tax. They are lower than for the previous five-year period (January 1988-January 1993) because interest rates in the past year have been historically low at 5.5 to 6 per cent. The stock market crash of 1987 was still at the back of investors' minds at the beginning of 1989, but foreign buying late in 1988 helped to push up the market. The FT-SE 100 rose buoyantly from 1,793.1 at the end of December 1988 to 2,051.8 at the end of January 1989, and continued to rise on the back of busy corporate activity throughout the spring and summer. The stock market indices are included as a guide - they reflect capital gains only and do not take re-invested income into account. This means that although the average investment and unit trust (offer to bid, net income re-invested) has fared well, the returns are not strictly comparable with the market indices. Investment trusts have shown strong returns over the period, helped by a substantial narrowing of the discount from an average of 21 per cent at the beginning of 1989 to 5 per cent at the start of this year. Discounts have narrowed because of rising markets and strong demand from private individuals who have been attracted into the sector by personal equity plans and savings schemes. The narrowing of discounts cannot be repeated on the same scale over the next five years and could indeed widen, since some investment trusts today stand at a premium to net asset value. Returns in the future will instead depend on strong investment performance. The average figure quoted is a very rough guide to the sector; individual trusts show wide discrepancies in performance over the past five years. An investor in the highest-performing investment trust over five years (EFM Dragon, which invests in the Far East, excluding Japan) would have enjoyed a return of 427 per cent while an investor in the worst trust (Gresham House) would have shown a loss of 95 per cent, according to Micropal. Although investors in unit trusts appear to have done less well than those opting for an investment trust, the returns for investment trusts are shown on a mid-market to mid-market basis (with net income re-invested) and do not reflect the full bid-offer spread or brokers' commission. The unit trust figures (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested) take all charges into account. Despite the recent rally in gilts, investors in UK bond funds and international fixed-interest instruments fared less well than the average unit trust. The average gain for someone holding a UK bond fund was 57.5 per cent (compared with 84.76 per cent for the average unit trust), while investors in the average international fixed-interest unit trust achieved returns of 63.6 per cent. The devaluation of sterling has contributed to the performance of this sector. The UK indices show that there were good gains to be had over the period. But investors would have fared even better in the US, where they would have more than doubled their money. Once again, the performance of the US market is helped by the decline of sterling; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by just over 73 per cent in dollar terms, but this mushrooms into a rise of 111.67 per cent in sterling. The benign tax regime of investments such as friendly society bonds and managed pension funds contributed to their performance, as reflected in the average figures in the chart. Both investments are relatively inflexible, though; benefits from contributions into a pension fund can be drawn only on retirement age. If you surrendered your friendly society policy early, you are likely to have got back only your premiums. Tax-efficient contributions into both a friendly society policy and a pension fund are limited - in the case of a friendly society the maximum monthly contribution in 1989 was Pounds 9. That was the year in which the property market began to falter. The Halifax house price index, which began in 1983, reached a peak of 228.5 in July 1989  -an 18 per cent rise on the previous 12 months. To cool the overheated economy and curb inflation, base rates went up to 15 per cent in October 1989. Anyone who bought property at the beginning of 1989, for fear that they might not be able to afford a purchase later, will have made a loss, on average, of almost 7 per cent. Unfortunately, past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future and investors, particularly those who do not intend to take a long-term view, will remain at the mercy of the investment roulette wheel.</p>

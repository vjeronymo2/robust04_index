			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV  </P> <P> The start of the National Football League regular season, several attractive  college football games and the men's and women's finals at tennis's U.S. Open  are among the weekend's sports television viewing choices. However, the  Dodgers' last gasp effort to stay in the National League West race will not be  seen on any Southland viewing screens.  </P> <P> The injury-weakened Rams open play Sunday against the Green Bay Packers with  KCBS Channel 2 and KFMB Channel 8 airing the game at 10 a.m. Because the  Raiders have decided to stay in Los Angeles for now, only one other NFL game  can come into Los Angeles on network television Sunday, with KNBC Channel 4  opting to air the Pittsburgh Steelers-Cleveland Browns matchup at 1 p.m.  Cable's Turner Network Television begins its NFL regular season coverage with  the New York Giants playing host to the Philadelphia Eagles at 5 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> College football's game of the day matches defending national champion and No.  1 ranked Miami (Fla.) and No. 16 Brigham Young at 4:30 p.m. today on ESPN. No.  19 UCLA opens its season against No. 23 Oklahoma at 12:30 p.m. today on  Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42.  </P> <P> Russell White, a prep standout at Encino Crespi High School, is expected to  make his collegiate debut today when California visits Wisconsin, 9:30 a.m.  ESPN. White, forced to sit out his freshman year after failing to meet the  NCAA's Proposition 48 academic standards, is second on the Bears' depth chart  at tailback and will return kickoffs.  </P> <P> Boris Becker meets Andre Agassi in a men's semifinal match as coverage of  tennis's U.S. Open begins at 8 a.m. today on KCBS Channel 2 and KFMB Channel 8.  The women's singles finals follows with the John McEnroe-Pete Sampras semifinal  concluding the day's action. The same stations will air the men's singles final  at 1 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> SportsChannel televised Friday night's series opener between the Dodgers and  division-leading Cincinnati Reds, but will not air games today or Sunday.  </P> <P> "The baseball schedule we lay out is done in November," explained Rockey  Flintermann, SportsChannel's director of programming and network operations.  "When we sat down in November, we thought San Diego and San Francisco would be  contending for the pennant. We have three telecasts against San Diego left and  one with San Francisco. Cincinnati comes as a surprise."  </P> <P> Flintermann also said he was reluctant to change his schedule out of fairness  to fans who had purchased tickets after consulting the television schedule.

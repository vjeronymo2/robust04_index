			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO LIE: ISUZU GIVING ITS DEALERS $2 MILLION TO SPEND AT THE MALL  </P> <P> It's a $2-million spending spree that might render Joe Isuzu speechless.  </P> <P> About 200 of the nation's hottest Isuzu dealers will converge at South Coast  Plaza Saturday and Sunday for a modern-day version of Supermarket Sweepstakes.  </P> <P> The dealers will be spending an average of $10,000 -- some as much as $50,000  -- as part of an incentive program offered by American Isuzu Motors, the  Japanese auto maker's U.S. marketing arm based in the City of Industry.  </P> <P> And for the dealers, there will be no taking home the leftover cash. They've  been instructed to spend it -- or lose it.  </P> <P> American Isuzu has offered the program for several years as a way of rewarding  its top dealers.  </P> <P> Jim Henwood, South Coast Plaza's general manager, said the mall tried to lure  the Isuzu dealers three years ago but lost out to Trump Plaza in New York.  Another past destination for the Isuzu dealers was Nieman Marcus' flagship  store in Dallas.  </P> <P> This year, Henwood said, South Coast Plaza lured the group with the help of the  Nordstrom department store chain, which has a store at the mall.  </P> <P> "They wanted to give the impression that their dealers are being taken to the  finest retail establishments in the U.S.," Henwood said.  </P> <P> An American Isuzu official said no one was immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> Henwood said South Coast retailers have been told a $2-million windfall is  headed their way. Clerks have been told to watch for people wearing Isuzu lapel  pins and carrying special credit cards. The cards will be issued to each dealer  and will allow them to charge an amount equal to their incentive payment, plus  10%, in case they run over their allotment and want to pay out-of-pocket.  </P> <P> South Coast Plaza officials plan to roll out the red carpet for the group. The  mall will host a reception for the 200 dealers and, after their hard day of  shopping, provide them with free foot massages.  </P></p>

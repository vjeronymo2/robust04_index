			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Impudent Remarks" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister  Hata reportedly claimed again that Japan should take a permanent  seat on the UN Security Council [UNSC]. Speaking at the plenary  session of the House of Representatives on May 16, he said  "calls for Japan to play its role in the new era have come from  the United Nations."    His remarks are a mockery of the unbiased opinion of the  international community which has consistently opposed Japan's  shameless attempt to obtain a permanent seat in the UN Security  Council.    Now, Japan is scheming to call back the militarist spectre  of  the past, crudely violating the UN Charter.    All the more grave is the fact that Japan is stepping up its  nuclear armament and its conversion into a military power in an  effort to carry this criminal scheme into effect.    It is only too clear that a war criminal, a nuclear  criminal,  cannot become a permanent member of the UN Security Council.    As the international community opines fairly, Japan has  neither justification nor elementary qualification to hold a  responsible position in the UN.    Japan, a criminal state which unleashed the Second World  War,  has yet to cleanse her dishonour as an "enemy state" stipulated  in the UN charter, and yet to apologize for the crimes it  committed against the Korean and other Asian nations in the past  and make compensations for the damages.    Japan must clearly liquidate her crime-woven past and stop  her nuclear armament and moves to become a military power for  domination over Asia, instead of impudently coveting for a  responsible position in the UN.</p>

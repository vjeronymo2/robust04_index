We promised to give you the details about  this event, so let us listen to a report by our correspondent  Yevgeniy Nikonov.    [Nikonov] Taking up office and placing his hand on the  Constitution of the Chuvash Republic, President Nikolay Fedorov  took the oath:    [Fedorov] "I pledge, in carrying out my duties as president  of the Chuvash Republic, to observe the Constitution and laws of  the Chuvash Republic, the Constitution and laws of the Russian  Federation, and to defend its sovereignty, to respect and  preserve the rights and freedoms of the individual and the  citizen, the rights of the peoples of the Chuvash Republic, and  to conscientiously carry out the obligations entrusted to me by  the people, which will be the guarantor of friendship and  cooperation with all peoples, and to be responsible for my  actions before the people."    [Nikonov] In his inaugural speech, in which he set out his  political credo, Fedorov said that as president he would  sanction freedom, knowledge, culture, and morality, and in the  sphere of the economy he would support the people who are  working and producing goods.    [Fedorov] "A politician can only become a professional and  can only truly help Russia when we link him with the interests  of the country's commodity producers and the will of the  entities of the Russian Federation. The question is not so much  one of dramatis personae as of the principle of shaping a  mechanism to work out a policy that is answerable to the Russian  people."    [Nikonov] On behalf of Russian President Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin, Fedorov was congratulated by Sergey Aleksandrovich  Filatov, the head of the president's administration.    [Filatov] "Permit me, on the instructions of Russian  President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, to heartily congratulate  Nikolay Vasiliyevich Fedorov, the first president of the Chuvash  Republic on his election, his taking of office, and the  beginning of his work, and to wish him all the best on this path  although it will be a very, very difficult one. I have to say  that we have lived through a very tough and dramatic year, a  year that has seen everything -- a crisis in the economy, a  crisis of power, and a political crisis, and which,  unfortunately, has ended in a dramatic way because of the fact,  in the main, the structures of power have not been able to cope  with the tasks and aspirations facing our country. It has to be  said that the reformation of the power structures is under way,  is continuing, and today the Chuvash Republic has also embarked  upon the reformation of its own power structures, strengthening  the authority of its executive structure."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Salina] </F>   [Excerpt] Tavapy 1, Alto Parana -- The police reacted  violently against the some 400 peasants from Tavapy 1 and 2 who  partially occupied Route No. 6, nearby km 22, for a short while  in protest over the serious economic hardships they are  experiencing and to demand at least 1,000 Guaranies per kilogram  of cotton.    Almost 100 people were injured as a result of the police  repression. One person was seriously injured by a tear gas  canister.    The long history of struggle by Tavapy peasants was revived  yesterday when about 400 of them temporarily occupied the road  despite a strong police contingent. They refused to withdraw  and sustained beatings and were the target of tear gas. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / India's new airlines seek wider horizons: A campaign for swifter liberalisation of the skies FREQUENT flyers on Indian Airlines, India's state-owned domestic carrier, were pleasantly surprised last week when they took the evening flight from Delhi to Bombay. Suddenly, checking in was no longer a nightmare. Ground staff were efficient. Most important, the flight took off on time. Passengers - all with their own Indian Airlines horror story to narrate - were astonished when a smiling flight attendant laid out a crisp tablecloth before serving a stylish Indian meal with bread and fruit. 'See what competition has achieved,' said one passenger, Mr Kantikumar Podar, a Bombay businessman and president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 'There is a tremendous change in attitude and service. For the first time, it's a pleasure to fly Indian Airlines.' The introduction of the government's open skies policy two years ago has given domestic travellers a choice. Four private airlines - Jet Airways, East West Airlines, Damania Airways and Modiluft - operate on lucrative routes such as Bombay-Delhi and Bombay-Bangalore. Passengers may now walk into the main airports and buy a ticket an hour before a flight. Delays and overbooked flights may be things of the past. For the first time, the 40-year-old state airline is facing competition in a market the new operators believe it has long taken for granted. Passengers are attracted to the new airlines by punctuality as well as free alcohol and attentive service. Passengers flying Damania received individual thank-you letters from the managing director. A couple who complained about service on Modiluft were sent roses and a handwritten apology note. However, despite the new airlines' efforts to make liberalisation work, the cards are stacked against them. The new airlines, which the government prefers to call private air taxi operators, face operational constraints as well as battles with a bureaucracy which, they say, tries to impede liberalisation. 'The government has granted us the permission to operate, but it is constantly safeguarding the interests of Indian Airlines at our expense,' says the head of one airline. 'The taxpayer is actually subsidising the inefficiencies of Indian Airlines, at a great cost to our economy and foreign exchange reserves.' Indian Airlines made a loss of Rs2.11bn (Pounds 44.8m) last year. Last week, the four airlines formed the Air Taxi Operators' Committee to urge the government to speed passage of a parliamentary bill to repeal the Air Corporation Act 1953, which prevents the formal legalisation of private carriers and grants protection to Indian Airlines as a departmental undertaking of central government. The bill is now before parliament. The committee's demands include a clear-cut aviation policy with guidelines for air taxi operators. 'We are still termed non-scheduled operators, though we operate to schedules. Not being able to advertise and publish schedules poses a major marketing problem, especially abroad,' says Mr Naresh Goyal, owner of Jet Airways, which has inter-line agreements co-ordinating flights with international carriers including British Airways. The committee has urged the director general of Civil Aviation to withdraw a directive that private operators should operate an equal number of flights on routes of less than 700km and on those of more than that distance. 'We are not charity organisations and this stipulation would mean that we would lose the flexibility of optimally deploying our limited resources,' says one operator. A further constraint is that private airlines are not allowed the best facilities at Bombay and Delhi airports. They share limited counter space in old, shabby terminals. New terminals are reserved for Indian Airlines' Airbus flights to leading cities. 'The airports could benefit from rents if the unused counters and space at the new terminals were allotted to private operators,' the committee said. The committee has asked for a revision of airport and air traffic control timings, which are tailored to suit Indian Airlines' operations. It has also requested adequate hangar space at airports. In the absence of any co-operation from Indian Airlines, private operators' aircraft have to go abroad to be serviced and even to have mandatory monthly checks. Spares and equipment have to be imported, which makes them more costly. The private airlines' battle for equal treatment is likely to be a hard one. If the parliamentary bill is passed, Indian Airlines may be unable to continue flights on loss-making routes which would otherwise not be connected by air. 'Indian Airlines has a social commitment to the country that the private operators don't need to worry about,' says an Indian Airlines spokesman. 'None of the private airlines can match our infrastructure, and if it hadn't been for subsidies, how could we offer the lowest fares in the world?' However, the private operators say that India's domestic air traffic has been stifled by Indian Airlines, and could grow substantially. 'During its best year, IA catered to a volume of 10m passengers, but aviation experts say that the total market size could increase to 25m passengers,' according to Mr Goyal. Mr Thakiyudeen Wahid, managing director of East West Airlines, says: 'East West has shown that with maximum utilisation, we can fly 8,000 passengers per day with 11 Boeing aircraft, compared with IA's 22,000 with a fleet of 53, including 24 Airbus A-320s and 11 Airbus A-300s.' Mr Parvez Damania, the 33-year old poultry farmer who started Damania Airways, says: 'Indian Airlines and the airport authorities could provide us the engineering support, make their under-utilised infrastructure reap profits, and save considerable foreign exchange.' He says: 'The attitude towards us is not right. We could work together with Indian Airlines to greatly expand the market. And Indian Airlines would be the first to benefit.'</p>

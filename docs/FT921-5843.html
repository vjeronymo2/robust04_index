			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: GFB to offer Dollars 500m of stock overseas GRUPO Financiero Bancomer (GFB), the holding company comprising Mexico's second largest bank, announced that it is to offer Dollars 500m of its stock in the US and European markets in the coming weeks, in part to enable it to meet a final payment of Dollars 1.73bn due to the Mexican government by April 6. A group of investors headed by Mr 'Don' Eugenio Garza Laguera, whose family owns around 85 per cent of the large conglomerate Grupo Visa, bought 56 per cent of Bancomer from the Mexican government last year for a sum that has risen to Dollars 2.88bn, after including accumulated interest on outstanding payments. Grupo Visa in turn owns 60 per cent of Femsa, best known for its breweries that provide Mexico with half its beer. Mr Laguera's bidding group borrowed Dollars 600m last October from JP Morgan, the US investment bank which is managing the equity deal, to meet an earlier payment. The bridge loan was secured against assets in Femsa. Mr Othon Ruiz, chief executive of Visa, said Femsa had received binding proposals in the soft drink and packaging businesses (of Femsa) which would enable them to pay back the bridge loan soon. Femsa owns the Coca-Cola franchise in Mexico City, the largest such franchise in the world.</p>

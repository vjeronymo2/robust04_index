			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / International Company News: Plan that avoids expensive mistakes - A look at the remaining clouds on Fisons' horizon THE LAST 18 months have not been kind to Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group. A series of apparently endless regulatory problems, culminating in the withdrawal in the US of some of its best-selling products, the subsequent resignation of its chairman, and a drubbing from the stock market which ended with the company dropping out of the FT-SE 100 Index, have all cast doubt over the future independence of the group. However, Mr Cedric Scroggs, Fisons' increasingly confident new chief executive, believes his team, which last week announced an improvement in operating profits at the drugs division for the first time in nine months, has answered most of the questions asked about the group's future as an independent pharmaceuticals company. The regulatory problems appear, at least for the moment, to be over. Mr Scroggs points out that Fisons has shown for the last six months that it can meet the regulators' rigorous standards. The question whether the company has sufficient scale to discover, develop and market new drugs, has also been mostly answered, says Mr Scroggs. He adds that on the marketing side, strategic alliances in the US with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer for Tilade, the asthma treatment, and Allergan, a US group, to co-market Acular, the main competitor to Fisons' withdrawn product Opticrom, have shown the way forward. The company is now looking to license in a number of compounds. One will take the place of Tipredane, Fisons' asthma treatment where development was halted in April because of lack of efficacy. Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, says the US sales force will have spare capacity after next year and most of the other salesforces are under-utilised at present. Fisons refuses to say which companies it has approached or the type of anti-asthmatic it wants to licence in. Mr Redmond says Fisons is not interested in a beta2-agonist, the most common form of asthma treatment. In the meantime, Fisons' development capability has improved considerably, says Mr Redmond. Historically, Fisons has been one of the best places to do research in the UK pharmaceuticals industry, but its track record on development has been lamentable. The decision to cancel development of Tipredane even has its brighter side, insists Mr Redmond. In the past, the decision whether to cancel would have been put off. Now, the development process has been improved so that decisions are made earlier to avoid expensive mistakes. In addition, the development of Tipredane has provided Fisons with invaluable experience in developing a product simultaneously around the world, explains Mr Redmond. Tilade was first launched in the UK in 1985, and is yet to filed with the regulatory authorities in Japan. Tipredane would have rolled out within only a few years. The increasing willingness to collaborate with other companies means Fisons will also sign a co-development agreement with another group for remacemide, its product for epilepsy, an area in which the company has little expertise. The agreement will reduce the risks for Fisons. For the longer term, Mr Redmond intends to license-in further asthma products at early stages of development. Innovative medicines such as paf-antagonists and leukotriene antagonists are possible areas for development. Zeneca of the UK and Upjohn of the US are working on leukotriene antagonists. Schering-Plough, the American group, is working on a paf-antagonist. Roche of Switzerland is working in both areas. Mr Redmond says Fisons can offer expertise in clinical research and delivery system. A number of companies are interested in using its patented multi-dose dry powder inhaler clinical trials. In addition, any partner could eventually use Fisons' sales forces. Clouds remain on the Fisons' horizon. The US patents for the nebulised version of Intal, an asthma product and one of its best-selling drugs, expired in August. This version represents about half of the drug's US sales. In addition, an FDA advisory committee will decide next week whether generic companies will be able to launch versions of the inhaled version without doing clinical trials. In the meantime, Mr Scroggs must turn his attention to the underperforming scientific instruments operations which fell into a loss during the first six months. He admits the loss, likely to be repeated in the second half, is all the more galling because he was in charge of the business before he was appointed chief executive. 'It's a very nasty episode,' he admits.</p>

			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Lara wins record-breaking Pounds 500,000 sponsorship deal Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company, has signed up West Indies cricketer Brian Lara, the world record-holding batsman, in the largest ever individual cricket sponsorship deal valued at Pounds 500,000. Mr Lara was uncustomarily kitted out yesterday in pin-stripe suit and bowler hat to open MAM's first innings in sports sponsorship, long an avenue of corporate image-promotion for financial services companies. MAM, which had done almost no advertising until two years ago, launched a print campaign earlier this year, featuring dramatic sports imagery. The company, which has grown to manage Pounds 60bn in assets, has recently shifted its marketing efforts to its retail businesses including unit and investment trusts tailored for wealthy private clients as well as personal pensions business. 'The corporate theme is one of sporting excellence,' explained Mr Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury Fund Managers. Although it was Mr Lara's agent who made the initial approach to MAM, Mr Royds said his company's market research suggested it would gain the greatest impact on its target audience by sponsoring either cricket or rugby. Sponsoring Mr Lara appealed to MAM, Mr Royds said, because 'he is the most prolific run scorer in the world. We are the leading investment management company in the UK. The tie-up is obvious'. In April, Mr Lara broke the world record for the highest score in a Test innings when he made 375 against England. Then, last month, he hit a world record for a first-class innings, 501 for Warwickshire against Durham. He is the first to hold both world records since Sir Donald Bradman, widely regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, in the 1930s. Mr Lara will invest his sign-on fee in Mercury's flagship unit trust, The Mercury Portfolio. The contract with MAM will run until the end of 1996. A performance-related element could raise the total above the basic Pounds 500,000. In return for the sponsorship, Mr Lara will appear in MAM advertising and appear at some MAM-sponsored charity events, while his cricket clothing will carry some MAM advertising. MAM, which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, is hardly Mr Lara's sole corporate sponsor. His others include a mobile telephone company based in south-west England, Joe Bloggs clothing, and BWIA, the West Indies airline which has given Mr Lara 375,000 free air miles. In recent weeks, Mr Lara has been plagued by press reports of excessive lateness for games and, in one well-publicised incident, for producing a mobile telephone while fielding. His contract contains a 'let-out' clause if he engages in certain specified types of conduct. 'I'm not going to tell you what those are,' Mr Royds said.</p>

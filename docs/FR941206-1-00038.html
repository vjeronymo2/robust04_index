			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act requires the State to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT. As discussed in the General Preamble, the purpose is to prevent growth in motor vehicle emissions from canceling out the emission reduction benefits of the federally mandated programs in the Act. The USEPA interprets this provision to require that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions will never be higher during the ozone season in one year than during the ozone season in the year before. When growth in VMT and vehicle trips would otherwise cause a motor vehicle emissions upturn, this upturn must be prevented. The emissions level at the point of upturn becomes a ceiling on motor vehicle emissions. This requirement applies to projected emissions in the years between the submission of the SIP revision and the attainment deadline and is above and beyond the separate requirements for the RFP and the attainment demonstrations. The ceiling level is defined therefore, up to the point of upturn, as motor vehicle emissions that would occur in the ozone season of that year, with VMT growth, if all measures for that area in that year were implemented as required by the Act. When this curve begins to turn up due to growth in VMT or vehicle trips, the ceiling becomes a fixed value. The ceiling line would include the effects of Federal measures such as new motor vehicle standards, phase II RVP controls, and reformulated gasoline, as well as the Act mandated SIP requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Illinois has demonstrated in its submittal of July 14, 1994, that the predicted growth in VMT in the Chicago, Illinois nonattainment area is not expected to result in a growth in motor vehicle emissions that will negate the effects of the reductions mandated by the Act. Further, Illinois has projected motor vehicle emissions to the year 2007 and has not predicted an upturn in motor vehicle emissions. The nonattainment area includes the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will and the townships of Aux Sable and Goose Lake in Grundy County and Oswego in Kendall County. The MOBILE5a model was used to calculate fleetwide on-highway motor vehicle emission factors for future years. The average summer weekday VMT for 1990 has been estimated to be 140.35 million miles for the baseline inventory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the years 1990 to 1996, Illinois used a VMT growth rate of 2.7 percent per year for the Chicago nonattainment area. There are indications that VMT growth may be slowing. Since the future VMT growth can be difficult to predict, Illinois used three different possible VMT growth rates to project mobile source emissions and demonstrate compliance. Illinois estimated mobile source emissions at a VMT growth rate of 1 percent, 2 percent and 2.7 percent per year for 1996 to 2007. The July 14, 1994, submittal lists the predicted average summer weekday VMT for the years 1990, 1996, 1999, 2004 and 2007 at each of the three VMT growth rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MOBILE5a model was used to estimate motor vehicle emission rates for the specified years as mandatory control measures become effective. The control measures whose effects were modeled were: The Federal motor vehicle control program; volatility controls for gasoline and reformulated gasoline; and the inspection and maintenance program (both the current program to 1996 and the enhanced program from 1996 to 2007). There were no benefits taken for the employee commute options program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even at the 2.7 percent per year VMT growth rate, no upturn in mobile source emissions is predicted. The July 14, 1994, submittal demonstrates that emissions will continue to decline through the year 2010. This demonstration meets the first requirement of the 3 part submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 15, 1993, Illinois submitted the 15 percent reasonable further progress plan. This submittal relies on a 2 ton per day credit from transportation control measures (TCMs) to meet the 15 percent reduction. A listing of TCMs was submitted with the SIP submittal. On December 9, 1993, the Chicago Area Transportation Study's policy committee officially adopted this package of TCMs as a component of the Illinois 15 percent plan. Many of the TCMs have already been implemented and all of the TCMs have been included in the Chicago area's transportation improvement program. The USEPA requires further documentation on these TCMs before the second element can be fully approved. The further requirements for Illinois' TCM package are discussed in a May 20, 1994, letter from the USEPA Regional Administrator to the Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this time, Illinois has met the VMT Offset requirement by using TCMs as necessary in the 15 percent plan. The USEPA is proposing to approve the second element when a favorable finding of completeness on the 15 percent plan is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The attainment demonstration and the post-1996 RFP SIPs are due on November 15, 1994. Illinois will address any necessary TCMs to reach attainment and meet the post-1996 RFP in those SIP submittals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

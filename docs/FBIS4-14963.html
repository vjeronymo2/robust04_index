			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondnet Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 5 April, TASS -- The personnel of  the Mangyshlak nuclear plant (fast-neutron reactor) asked the  presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan for urgent aid as the plant  is about to be stopped.    The open letter of the collective published by local press  says that because of the blockage of payments between the two  countries. The plant just as an energy complex of which it is  part, cannot provide itself with nuclear fuel and reserves of  technological equipment. The situation is aggravated by the  fact that many workers and employees get a discharge and leave  for Russia as civic, language and other problems of skilled  personnel are not being solved.    Nuclear specialists believe that the stoppage of the plant  threatens to paralyse enterprises of the eastern Caspian Basin.  The supply to cities and villages of technical and drinking  water received by desalination will be stopped. The very  stoppage of the fast-neutron reactor can lead to unpredictable  consequences. There are no effective projects for its stopage  and conservation.</p>

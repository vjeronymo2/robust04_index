			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ja'far Ra'ed: "Consolidation of the State's </F> Authority in Iran"]    [Text] With the beginning of the 16th year of the Iranian  revolution, the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali  Khamene'i, has made a number of important decisions. The  decisions have demonstrated, in a clear and unambiguous fashion,  the existence of a strong central authority in Iran today, which  can take hold of Iran's inhabitants with a strong and  unflinching hand and guide them in the direction this central  authority desires. These decisions have also proved that what  used to be called a duality of authority has now become a thing  of the past. At the same time, they have indicated that the  revolution's centers of power, which possessed clout and  influence, have in fact been cut down to size.    The first step taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i in the direction  of strengthening the authority of the state was to give free  rein to the minister of interior--a person in whom he has  confidence--to take charge of matters and strike down those who  would do damage to the nation's security and stability. This was  done by entrusting him with the power and authority of  commander-in-chief of the armed forces--authority which was  previously entrusted to learned clergymen--and command of the  police and security forces, the gendarmerie, and the  mobilization forces--for a period of three years. There was a  reason for making this period of time three years. The second  and last term of rule by Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a period of time totaling four years, and  more than six months of this term have already gone by. In three  years' time the end of this term will be near, and the duties  undertaken by his minister of interior will then be almost  concluded.    The name of this minister of interior, who currently has  such  broad authority, is 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi. "Jahrom" is  a city in southeastern Iran and is famous for the quality of its  date crop. It is in the region called "Fars," and its capital  city is Shiraz, the city of the two poets Sa'di and Hafez. Also,  the moon as seen from Shiraz was celebrated by the Iraqi poet  al-Bayati in his famous poem "The Moon of Shiraz," and other  Arab poets as well have celebrated the beauty of this city.    Before 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi took over the  Ministry  of Interior, and before the nation's spiritual leader entrusted  him with the powers of commander-in-chief of the forces  responsible for internal security, he undertook two initiatives  that left no doubt as to his decisiveness and determination to  curtail the intervention of the centers of power in matters that  were to be within his area of responsibility. The first of these  initiatives was to prevent the so-called "Moslem students  marching along the path of the Imam" from demonstrating in front  of the [former] U.S. Embassy on the anniversary of its  occupation. This is the same group that had occupied the U.S.  Embassy in Tehran in 1980. [date as published] Every year, on  this anniversary, the group had been accustomed to demonstrating  across from the [former] U.S. Embassy and burning the U.S. flag,  and hearing speeches from their leaders such as Mohtashemi and  Kho'iniha. The demonstration took place [this time] on the  anniversary, across from the [former] U.S. Embassy in Tehran,  but under the supervision of the government organizations, who  did not permit the burning of the U.S. flag, since this was  considered to be an insult to the people of the United States  and their nation and regime.    The second initiative was to prevent Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali  Akbar Mohtashemi--the former minister of interior, who had also  been, before that, the Islamic Republic's ambassador to Damascus  and was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon--from giving  a speech to the public in the city of Sari, in northern Iran.  These two initiatives, which were the first signs of what  Besharati would do, were like a clear and unmistakable  announcement of the fact that this man was serious and did not  joke around.    It is interesting to note, in the case of Besharati, that he  is the first minister of interior in the days of the Iranian  Islamic Republic who does not wear a turban and is not one of  the clergy. All of those who had preceded him in this high-level  position since the rise of the new regime in Iran had borne the  title of "Ayatollah" or "Hojjat ol-Eslam," such as Ayatollah  Mahdawi Kani, Hojjat ol-Eslam Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Hojjat  ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar  Mohtashemi, and the last one, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Abdollah Nuri. If  it is true what people say concerning the possibility that this  strong and decisive man will be nominated and elected president  of the republic and thus succeed Hojjat ol-Eslam  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, then this will be another weak spot in the  make-up of the Iranian Islamic Republic, which will be broken.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate, in the Velayat-e Faqih  regime, not to have a clerical leader be chief of the executive  power of government in order that he not issue individual  interpretations of religious law.    'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi was the first deputy to  Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati before the  Ministry of Interior was entrusted to him. He was also one of  the candidates to succeed his minister in the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, but Dr. Velayati was retained in his ministry  and the portfolio of the Ministry of Interior was entrusted to  him. Besharati was successful in his former position as first  deputy minister of foreign affairs. Before leaving this  ministry, he made a trip to North Africa, during which he  visited Tunisia and Morocco. One of the positive results of this  trip was the fact that normal relations were once again  established between Iran and both Tunisia and Morocco. Besharati  maintained his interest in foreign affairs issues even after he  was transferred to the Ministry of Interior. As evidence of this  interest on his part we have the statements he made, while  visiting Qatar a few weeks ago, concerning the necessity of  developing Iranian-Arab relations and his expectation that  good-neighborly relations and cooperation would develop between  Iran and Saudi Arabia.    Besharati's appointment to the Ministry of Interior during  the second week of August 1993 was welcomed by various circles  of people in Iran. They include extremist press, which made  reference to his past services and praised his prominent role in  the Revolution Guard and its intelligence bureau which foiled  many plots hatched against the regime of the Islamic Republic  during a critical period of its history.    One fact that Arab readers should know is that Besharati,  when he was first deputy minister of foreign affairs, forwarded  a report three days before Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and in  this report he gave a very accurate assessment of the  consequences expected as a result of the occupation of Kuwait by  Iraq, and his report also listed all the benefits Iran would  reap by adhering to a policy of neutrality in this dispute. This  accurate report was the reason for Ayatollah Khamene'i's sending  him a message of praise and appreciation in March of 1991, in  which he provided his assessment of Besharati's capability and  his political astuteness. It was an official message that was  signed by Khamene'i himself, and it constituted an exceptional  gesture on his part. Besharati is considered to be one of a  group of pioneers in the Iranian Islamic Republic. During the  previous regime he was in jail and spent about four years under  arrest, and during that time he was the object of respect on the  part of his jailers because of his reasonable and responsible  behavior. He is known for his strong enmity toward leftist and  extremist organizations and those who belong to them. At the  present time he enjoys the favor of Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles and head of the parliamentary  majority known as the "Resalat bloc." ("Resalat" means  "mission.") The members of the Resalat bloc consist of about 170  deputies or members of the Majles. This bloc is a conservative  one which fosters Islamic traditions, adopts the policy of free  trade, and represents the Iranian bourgeoisie.    We have dealt, at great length, with the Iranian minister of  interior, 'Ali Mohammed Besharati-Jahromi, because it is  expected that he will rise quickly and take on major  responsibilities. Besharati was born in the town of Jahrom in  1944 and graduated from both elementary and secondary school  there. He received his higher education in Tehran where he  specialized in education, and then he entered government service  in Qom. He utilized this opportunity to attend courses in  Islamic sciences, and later on he studied in the College of Law  in Tehran. Then he joined the revolutionary movement, and  because of that, he went to jail. When the revolution took  place, he became responsible for guarding Khomeini during the  Imam's return to Iran. Then he was appointed head of the  intelligence bureau of the [Revolution] Guard in the Command  Council of the Revolution Guard. He became a member of the  Majles as a result of the first elections held after the  revolution, representing the people of Jahrom. He was given  great responsibilities in the parliament, including membership  in the fact-finding commission that investigated abuse and  torture of prisoners in jails. He acquired a good reputation as  a result of this work since he stood up for prisoners who  suffered abuse and argued in their defense with the overseers of  the prison system.    In general, Besharati, during the various stages of his  political activity, became known as an opponent of reckless and  extremist behavior in the name of the revolution, and he has  written some works, including one called "Humaneness in Islam."    In connection with the beginning of the 16th year since the  establishment of the regime of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah  Khamene'i, the nation's spiritual leader, in addition to  supporting Besharati as minister of interior, embarked upon the  taking of other measures that indicated that he was beginning to  curtail the role of some of the centers of power. These measures  included the dismissal of the brother of President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Mohammad Hashemi, who had been the overseer  of Iran's radio and television for 13 years and who was  transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and the  appointment of the minister of Islamic guidance, 'Ali Larijani,  as the new overseer of Iran's radio and television. Ayatollah  Khamene'i sent a long letter to Larijani in which he explained  the policy guidelines to be adhered to by Iran's radio and  television. These recommendations included the necessity of  being concerned about the Persian language used over radio and  television and raising its usage to a higher level. Groups  opposed to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani welcomed this new  appointment and had high praise for Larijani's personality,  capabilities, revolutionary past, and great knowledge of  literature, art, and politics. He is expected to bring about  basic changes in these important media, of which he will be in  charge.    Ayatollah Khamene'i then appointed Mostafa Mirsalim as  minister of Islamic guidance. This man is known for his maturity  and impartiality, and occupied a number of sensitive posts  during the days when Khamene'i was president of the Islamic  Republic, including the post of director of public security.    These basic changes have been accompanied by other important  steps taken by Ayatollah Khamene'i. They have included the  removal of Engineer Mar'ashi (brother-in-law of President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani) from his post as governor of the province of  Kerman in southeastern Iran, the province which contains the  town of Rafsanjan. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani then hastened to  appoint Mar'ashi to the post of chief of the Office of the  Presidency of the Republic.    Other fairly important changes in other institutions have  also taken place, including the dissolution of the agency that  was responsible for setting policy for Iran's radio and  television programs. This agency had existed ever since the  beginning of the new regime.    After undertaking all these measures, the leader of the  revolution, Ayatollah Khamene'i, was the prayer leader for the  faithful during the first Friday prayer this year after the  sighting of the crescent in Iran during the blessed month of  Ramadan. This initiative, that is, Ayatollah Khamene'i's serving  as prayer leader for all the faithful during the Friday prayer,  is something that rarely happens. One of the most important  things that the spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic  announced to the faithful during last Friday's prayer, the date  of which corresponded to 18 February this year, was the fact  that he will turn a blind eye to opponents of the government in  Iran who express their opposition in newspapers published inside  Iran and who make statements to foreign radio stations abroad.  It appears that, with this statement, he wanted to demonstrate  the magnanimity of the government agencies toward those who are  in the opposition.    Before we conclude this article, we should make it clear  that  the measures taken in recent weeks by the spiritual leader of  the nation cannot really be considered to be a challenge to the  authority of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani or an effort to  degrade his position. One thing that attracts our attention is  the fact that Ayatollah Khamene'i never misses an opportunity to  praise the personality and laudable qualities of the republic's  president. In fact, he praises him so highly that some people  feel that there is a large measure of exaggeration in what he  says. Whoever closely follows events in Iran, especially the  debates that take place in the Majles, knows that these measures  have been taken in accordance with the opinions of the majority  of the members of the parliament. One of these measures that was  widely acclaimed was the dismissal of Mohammed Hashemi, the  overseer of Iran's radio and television, concerning whom  parliament selected a committee to investigate what was going on  in the organization that he was the head of, and the results of  the investigation were not at all in his favor. Merciless  attacks occurred between Mohammed Hashemi and the members of the  parliament, and perhaps President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was  embarrassed about his brother and unable to take any measures  against him, so Ayatollah Khamene'i chose to save him from this  anguish.    It could be said that the current session of parliament  represents the traditional merchant class, and it is known that  this class of people has ties to devoutly religious Shiite  circles and clergymen other than the extremist revolutionary  types, as previously mentioned. Most of the members of  parliament who are members of this economic class are united  under the banner of the "Resalat" bloc and the current speaker  of parliament, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, who is its  spokesman. Perhaps we can conclude from all of this that Iran's  general policy is moving in the direction of being a religious  national bourgeois policy.</p>

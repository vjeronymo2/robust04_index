			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe hit again Further fears that the proposed Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture between British Aerospace (BAe) and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) was close to collapse sent shares in one of the UK's biggest manufacturing companies tumbling for the second day in row. The shares were down 15 to 396p in early trading after TAC's acting president said his directors would vote on the issue on October 19. However, the news only served to increase uncertainty pver the deal with traders paying little heed to a statement from BAe saying the Taiwanese government still backed the venture. Bargain hunters in the afternoon helped the stock recover some of the lost ground and the shares finished 12 off at 399p, the second time the shares have closed below 400p since July. Explaining the market's jitters, Mr Chris Avery at Paribas said: 'The market had not fully discounted the possibility of closure of the regional jets division and the cash outflow that would go with it if the deal does not go ahead.' Sentiment in BAe was further weakened by a sell recommendation from Robert Fleming, due to land on investor's desks today. The oil sector rebounded yesterday as cheap buyers followed closely on the heels of the previous day's slide in share prices. In a generally firm sector the main players staged the best performance. Oil prices softened after trying to stage a modest rally and analysts saw the recovery in share prices as little more than a knee jerk reaction to the previous day's session in which they took a largely unwarranted bruising. Some optimism over the announcement by Shell and BP of their joint venture to develop oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico helped buoy those stocks. Another boost to the larger oil stocks was the recommendation by brokers Strauss Turnbull. Shell went ahead 3 to 682p in moderate volume while BP moved up 5 1/2 to 326 1/2 p, again in reasonable volume. A further driving force in oils was the relentless interest of US buyers, according to a couple of analysts. Burmah gained 6 to 788p, Lasmo added 2 to close at 140 1/2 p, Enterprise also improved by 2 to reach 470p. Cairn Energy added 3 to 67p with its quoted price touching 69p at one point, according to an oil analyst. Interim figures from Bank of Scotland at the top end of expectations cheered the market, helping the shares firm 3 1/2 to 184p in strong trade of 7.7m, as analysts upgraded expectations of full-year profits. Half-time profits jumped 58.4 per cent to Pounds 117.6m against a range of forecasts of Pounds 93m to Pounds 120m. The range for the full year is now Pounds 260m-Pounds 280m against a previous Pounds 210m-Pounds 230m. Hopes of a reduction in interest rates continued to boost Abbey National where the shares put on another 6 to to 437p. Strong two-way business in Hanson brought the day's biggest turnover at 32m, the shares closing 3 ahead 267p. Among insurance stocks, Royal Insurance eased 3 to 325p after Smith New Court placed 6.5m shares. The broker was reported to have placed the stock at 325p. A clutch of positive recommendations boosted British Airways and the shares firmed 2 to 370 1/2 p. The stock is favoured by NatWest Securities, SG Warburg and Smith New Court. Smith also recommended BAA, the UK airports operator, and the shares put on 10 to 880p. Among engineering stocks, a positive note on TI Group from NatWest Securities helped the shares gain 8 to 371p, and it was a recommendation from the same house that saw FKI advance 7 to 168p. Cookson Group put on 6 to 204p following a buy recommendation from Nomura. Concerns about future prospects hurt FR Group and the shares lost 6 to 252p. A bullish note from Credit Lyonnais for Fenner saw the shares put on 8 to 110p. Construction group Hewden-Stuart gained 16 to 158p after the announcement of interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.1m ahead of expectations. Analysts had predicted profits of around Pounds 8m. Mr David Taylor of UBS said: 'The good performance was a consequence of fewer bad debts and better management.' News of a slowdown in the German construction industry helped ease RMC down 8 to 825p and Redland 10 to 555p. UK housing start statistics, showing 4 per cent fall in the three months to August, assisted the slide. The move by Coats Viyella to redeem early preference stock dated November 2004 gave the share price a boost as the market responded well to the implications for a rise in earnings per share and a fall in gearing. The shares gained 8 1/2 to 268 1/2 p. Courtaulds Textiles bounced after its recent dull run, the shares added 16 to reach 540p. Thin trading contributed to the price rise but one analyst also believed that investors were beginning to realise that the stock had started to look oversold. Other statistics, Page 31.</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Lazard bids for Grahams Rintoul LAZARD Brothers, the merchant bank, has made an agreed bid for Grahams Rintoul &amp; Company, the specialist investment management company. The move, announced yesterday, marks a return to the investment trust market for Lazard. It provides Grahams Rintoul with a high-profile name and it enables Lazard, which is fifty per cent owned by Pearson - the conglomerate that also owns the Financial Times - to expand its private investor base. Mr Jimmy West, chief executive of Lazard's investment management arm, said: 'Investment trusts are a growing market and an area in which we could do with some expertise.' The acquisition of Grahams Rintoul, for an undisclosed sum, brings two trusts with a combined net asset value of about Pounds 55m - the Grahams Rintoul, which concentrates on smaller companies, and the North American Gas trust which is geared for the specialist investor. Lazard has been absent from the investment trust arena since it was faced with a hostile bid for its Romney and Raeburn Trusts in 1988. The attack prompted the bank to turn the trusts into an open ended Guernsey-based investment company called Lazard Select. Subsequently, Lazard took on Mr Jimmy West from Globe Investment Trust to head up Lazard Investors and in January this year Investors became the fund manager for Crown Financial Services' Pounds 680m assets. The Rintoul acquisition is small by comparison and even smaller in the light of the Pounds 4.2bn of assets managed by Lazard Investors but it is the merchant bank's first fully-fledged return to the investment trust area. However, funds managed by Lazard are smaller compared with the tens of billions managed by its merchant banking rivals, Schroders, Robert Fleming, SG Warburg and Morgan Grenfell.</p>

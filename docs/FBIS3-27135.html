Chen Xitong pointed out that the key  to accelerating the development of mountainous areas lies in  emancipating the mind, opening wider, relaxing policies, and  entering the market.    Chen Xitong as well as Yang Chaoshi, standing committee  member of the municipal party committee, and responsible persons  of pertinent committees and offices went to Yanqing County to  the north of the Great Wall on 14 January. They heard reports  by Liu Jinsheng, secretary of the county party committee, and Li  Shuwang, head of the county, and gave speeches at the township  enterprise work conference of the county. [passage omitted]    Chen Xitong pointed out: There are five major reasons why  Yanqing County has not developed fast enough. First, it has not  opened itself wide enough. The mountainous areas, in  particular, have established few ties with the outside world and  closed themselves for long periods of time, thus hindering their  development of the economy and various undertakings. They  should open their doors wider to other domestic areas and the  foreign countries. Second, Yanqing has yet to fully develop its  advantages. With 500,000 mu of cultivated land, Yanqing may take  advantage of the difference in temperature to produce the grain,  forestry products, fruits, and vegetables that meet market  demand and march toward a modernized agriculture. It may also  tap the potential in the mineral resources in the mountainous  areas and its tourist resources. Third, its degree of  industrialization is not high, and township enterprise  development is sluggish. Two-thirds of its labor forces still  feed themselves by farming and many labor forces have yet to  free themselves from farming. It should regard  industrialization as the fundamental way of development. Only  when township enterprises are developed, can the labor forces be  diverted from farming and the productivity improved. Fourth,  Yanqing has not emancipated the mind fully enough. It should  further emancipate the mind and note both its inferiority and  superiority. It should uplift spirit, admit but not be  reconciled to its backwardness, and work in a down-to-earth  manner to change the backward outlook. Fifth, the municipality  and pertinent departments have not provided sufficient  assistance. They should render more help to accelerate  Yanqing's development. [passage omitted]    On 15 January, Chen Xitong and others went to Changping  County. They heard reports by Zhang Geng, secretary of the  county party committee, and Li Shixiang, acting head of the  county, and visited Heishanzhai and Xiazhuang Villages to learn  about the situation. [passage omitted]    Cheng Xitong fully affirmed the development of these two  villages. He pointed out: Heishanzhai Village has done it well  to follow the idea of "developing mountainous area based on the  reality of mountainous area; and leaving mountainous area (for  planned localities) to develop mountainous area." Both villages  have proceeded from their reality and their own advantages in  resources to vigorously develop the fruits and mineral products  that have bright market prospects. This reflects the  development idea of "living off the mountain skillfully when  living on the mountain and entering the market to achieve  prosperity." Chen Xitong expressed satisfaction with Xiazhuang  Village which boosted peasants' production enthusiasm through  the leasing system, stressing the need to implement the  guidelines of the municipal rural work conference and to relax  policies to accelerate the development of mountainous areas,  especially the old mountainous areas with economic difficulties.

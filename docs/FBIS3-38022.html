Tension Increases Between Branches  of Authority"]    [Text] Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin was on the  platform for exactly 50 minutes, addressing the deputies of both  chambers of the Federal Assembly. His report "On Strengthening  the Russian State" was listened to in silence and the response  to it was one of restraint.    The various political forces represented in parliament had  no  illusions about the power of the president's message to bring  about creative work and accord. They were still feeling the  impact of the previous day's decision by the State Duma on an  amnesty for those responsible for the August putsch and the  October revolt.    This was the sole topic of conversation in the Kremlin  before  the session of the two chambers opened. Here are some  pronouncements on the topic.    G. Zyuganov, leader of the communists' faction:    "If the president's team and the government fail to see that  the State Duma's amnesty decision points the way to national  accord and reconciliation, too bad for them. We are on the  brink of mass strikes. The economic crisis is assuming  catastrophic proportions. Therefore the task now is to take  steps toward reconciliation. The amnesty should be followed by  a treaty with Belarus. We must make an approach to Ukraine and  restore all links with Kazakhstan."    Describing the president's message, G. Zyuganov said: "The  president has now promulgated 15 programs, but none of them has  been implemented. I do not expect any constructive actions from  the president and government. Our approach is an immediate  change of economic course and the formation of a government of  national confidence on condition that Chubays and Kozyrev leave  it. If confrontation on the part of the executive authority  continues, those who signed the agreement in the Belovezhskaya  Forest will be quitting the political arena this very year."    Presidential Press Secretary V. Kostikov also returned to  the  Duma's amnesty decision.    "No doubt there is now going to be a war of legal  interpretations of the State Duma decision," he said, "since,  under the Constitution, it can declare an amnesty but it cannot  adopt a decision on it. No one will be leaving Lefortovo or  Matrosskaya Tishina in the next few weeks or months. Moreover,  this decision is immoral, since those in detention were directly  involved in the bloodshed. It is clear that there is a bloc of  communists and neofascists in the Duma with practically no  difference between them."    Journalists were particularly interested in the view of  Russian Federation General Prosecutor A. Kazannik. He said that  the organs of the prosecutor's office are not concerned with  politics, and that "We are in the business of ensuring  compliance with the law, and we are obliged to apply the  decision of the competent state organs. When it is published we  will study it and will familiarize each of the accused with the  report. If they accept the State Duma's amnesty decision, I  will rule that the criminal case against this or that individual  be dropped."    But despite this dramatic news, which the Duma served up  precisely on the eve of the president's policy statement, there  were nonetheless optimistic tones regarding the president's  message:    Interviewed by your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the well-known  economist P. Bunich said:    "The president faced a difficult task: He had to talk about  everything in a 50-minute speech, missing out none of the  problems that society regards as explosive. His tact is to be  welcomed -- he did not react to the State Duma's decision. It  is not the place to talk about it. As for the very important,  economic section of the message, the president's confirmation of  the continuation of the course of reforms begun in 1992 can be  regarded as the key feature. The second thing of importance  mentioned by the president is that he does not take his lead  from those who advocate strong state authority, from the report  of the `Soviet academics.' Proposals by the president on, for  example, freezing prices, pay, the rouble rate, and so on might  have signaled his support for the course propagandized by them."    Former finance minister B. Fedorov told your IZVESTIYA  correspondent:    "Certainly, one must welcome the president's statement of  the  danger that the current Cabinet of Ministers might boost  inflation. Nonetheless, everything will depend on the practical  implementation of the measures indicated by the president."</p>

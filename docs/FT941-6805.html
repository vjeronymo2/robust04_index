			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Piper European trust to be launched A new European smaller companies investment trust aims to raise up to Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for subscription. Piper European Smaller Companies is being launched by Piper International Asset Management, the Edinburgh-based fund management subsidiary of the US Piper Jaffray group. The trust will invest in European companies, not including the UK, with market capitalisations of up to Pounds 250m, with the aim of achieving long-term capital growth. The trust will be managed to qualify for investment via a personal equity plan. Managers of the fund say they believe the time is right to launch a European smaller companies fund because of rising economic growth in Europe, and the tendency of smaller companies to outperform larger companies at times of economic growth. As yet, there are relatively few investment trusts specialising in this area. The team of managers were all formerly with N Dunn &amp; Co, a small fund management company which was recently acquired by Piper. Ordinary shares in the trust will be offered at 100p, with one warrant attached to every five shares.</p>

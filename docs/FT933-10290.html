			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Resin supplier may rethink US offer SUMITOMO Chemical, the world's largest supplier of high-grade epoxy resins, is under pressure to turn to Dow Chemical of the US for emergency supplies following an explosion at its plant in northern Japan last month. The resulting halt in production has affected the semiconductor industry, as the plant supplied 60 per cent of the world's epoxy resins used for plastic semiconductor packages. Sumitomo initially declined co-operation with Dow after the US company offered to start up a plant, closed in 1991, on condition Sumitomo purchased all the epoxy produced over the next five years. Sumitomo said it had a two-month inventory and would be able to provide 50-60 per cent of its usual monthly sales from September. It added the Japanese chemical companies Nippon Kayaku and Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, and Chang Chun Plastics of Taiwan, would provide emergency supplies. However, Sumitomo may eventually have to meet Dow's conditions to keep up supplies. Mr Tommy Tang, analyst at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said that unless Sumitomo could guarantee supplies it might have to reach agreement with Dow. The cause of the explosion at the Sumitomo plant is still being investigated. The company said it did not know how long restoration would take; the plant's main equipment and most racks and structures were reusable, although peripheral equipment, including a solvent recovery tank and an electrical room, were badly damaged by the blast. High costs forced Dow to close down its epoxy resins plant, which had a production capacity of 5,000 tonnes, It could cost more than Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) to start up.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] Recently there has been no let-up in newspaper,  television, or radio coverage of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Bosnian  conflict. We could not fail to respond to this topic,  especially since there are Russian servicemen in the former  Yugoslavia, and if, after all, the decision is made that the  Bosnian conflict will be tackled by military means, by means of  bombardments, then it will be very difficult to predict both  what Russia's position will be in the end and what in the end  the position of our soldiers in former Yugoslavia. Today we  present for your attention a commentary by our journalist  Aleksandr Znamenskiy, who will tell you about the stance on this  matter of the Foreign Ministry, specifically of Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and of Russia's Defense Ministry, of Russian Military  Department Head Army General Pavel Grachev. Aleksandr  Znamenskiy is at the microphone:    [Znamenskiy] Bombing the positions of the warring sides in  Bosnia is the least effective decision which could be made to  wind up the crisis in the region, Andrey Kozyrev noted. He  stressed that the UN resolutions theoretically provide for the  possibility of military support of UN forces if they are  subjected to direct attack. In this case the UN secretary  general is to hold consultations with the permanent members of  the Security Council, including Russia. Then we willl make a  decision, the minister said. In particular, he said that in  Russia such a decision will be taken by the president.    Kozyrev said that in the specific situation in Bosnia, it  should not be a matter of launching strikes against the Serbs  alone. One should be speaking of providing protection against  attack from any side. As far as any other strikes are concerned  which go outside the context of protecting UN forces, say, as  punishment, we are categorically against strikes, even  theoretically, Andrey Kozyrev stated. In this connection the  minister expressed regret that the Russian initiative to convene  the Security Council has not received proper support among the  Western partners. In particular, this initiative provided for  strengthening security zones, including round Sarajevo. It is  possible that if it had been implemented earlier it would have  been possible to avoid the tragedy.    The time has come for our Western partners in the Security  Council to take a closer look at our proposals, Kozyrev  stressed. The Russian minister said that it is necessary to take  urgent measures, but not to fall into a trap. A provocation is  possible from any side, the Russian minister stated. Once  before, in 1914, a provocation was perpetrated in Sarajevo, when  just such a territorial act caused a global tragedy. It is  Andrey Kozyrev's view that now, too, an escalation of violence  could lead to a repetition of this tragic scenario. The  minister expressed the hope that the international community  will be guided in this matter by cool political thinking and not  by emotions. This was the point of view of the head of Russia's  political department.    Regarding the Russian military, they virtually fully support  it. However, taking into account the importance of the topic, we  nevertheless asked Russia's Defense Minister Army General Pavel  Grachev to say a few words in connection with this problem:    [Begin Grachev recording] The basic aim of the Russian  leadership is that a unilateral approach toward determining the  responsibility of the Bosnian communities for the continuation  of the armed conflict is impermissible. In the interests of  putting an end to it as soon as possible, Russia is trying to  get and will try to ensure that sufficient influence is brought  to bear not only on the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs but also  on the leaders of the Croat and Muslim communities.    Now, as to the possibility of using military force: We  believe that the use of the NATO countries' combat aviation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is capable of provoking a new escalation of  combat actions and is permissible only in the event of a direct  attack by Bosnian armed formations on the peacekeeping forces.  Taking into account the complexity of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the dispatch of additional contingents from  NATO countries into the conflict zone prior to the cessation of  the combat operations could be used by the command of the Muslim  community for building up their combat effort, which will  inevitably provoke a further escalation of the Bosnian armed  conflict.

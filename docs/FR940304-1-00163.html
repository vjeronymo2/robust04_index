			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are $87.13, $213.97, $1,025.41, and $1,839.60 for standard levels 1&hyph;4,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 1 is $32.77; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $42.51;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 3 by $59.53; and standard level 4 by $68.16. See Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support Document, Table 4.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool heaters show that revised standards would result in increases in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 17.9 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce short-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run return on equity's of 18.0 percent, 18.4 percent, 19.7 percent and 19.9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, respectively. Revised standards have even greater increases in long-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-run return on equity's of 18.7 percent, 20.1 percent, 26.0 percent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Life-cycle cost and net present value.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A life-cycle cost is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 3 and level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the four candidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels, a unit meeting level 1 has the lowest consumer life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average affected consumer of $231.13 and standard level 2 would reduce average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life-cycle costs by $198.94. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard levels 1 and 2 would not cause any economic burden on the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer. Standard level 3 would increase average life-cycle costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $447.19, and standard level 4 would increase average life-cycle costs by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,177.57. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financing the purchase of pool heaters. Similarly, DOE did not consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national average energy prices were appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;4 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $0.13 billion, negative $1.09 billion, and negative $2.44 billion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively.

See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volume A. <FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>  Decreases in air pollution will occur for nitrogen dioxide (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> reduction would be 4,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12,000 tons; 31,000 tons and 41,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, footnote 37.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dioxide (CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total estimated CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> reduction would be 4 million tons. During this time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period, the peak annual reduction of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> emissions that are expected to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12 million tons; 32 million tons and 43 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.04  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pool heaters, standard levels 1&hyph;4, are not expected to affect oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conclusion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 4 for amended pool heater standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the standard levels analyzed, level 4 will save the most energy (0.78  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumes that all pool heaters will be condensing pulse combustion pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters. However, the payback at this standard level of 27.0 years exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 15-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,178.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 0.58 quads of energy. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payback at this standard level of 17.2 years also exceeds the product's life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and produces an increase in life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters with standard level 2 for pool heaters. The Department concludes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level 2 for pool heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996_2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.23 quads  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by as much as 12,000 tons, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.01 percent by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by 12 million tons, or 0.02 percent, over the forecast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 5.0 years or one-third of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product life. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle cost of approximately $199. Additionally, the standard is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity from 17.9 percent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the base case to 18.4 percent in the short run and to 20.1 percent in the long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> run. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> g.

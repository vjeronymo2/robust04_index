			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Speech By Comrade Hu Jintao at Meeting To </F> Commemorate 30th Anniversary of the Death of Comrade Jiao Yulu  (13 May 1994)"]    [Text] Comrades:    Today, the Henan Provincial CPC Committee has convened a  grand meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of the death of  Comrade Jiao Yulu. Entrusted by General Secretary Jiang Zemin,  I have come to the meeting and, on behalf of the CPC Central  Committee, to deeply cherish the memory of Comrade Jiao Yulu, to  extend heartfelt regards to relatives of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and  to express high consideration for fine Communist Party members,  fine cadres, and other advanced individuals who have emerged in  the great practice of reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization and who have carried forward the spirit of Jiao  Yulu.    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good member of the CPC, a good  public  servant of the people, and a good example for county secretaries  and the broad masses of cadres. This is acknowledged by all  party comrades and the people of all nationalities throughout  the country. He dedicated all his life to the cause of the party  and the interests of the people. In the early 1960's, Comrade  Jiao Yulu was secretary of the Lankao County CPC Committee. In  order to change the poverty-stricken situation in areas  afflicted by natural disasters in Lankao, despite illness, he  led the people of the whole county in fighting stubbornly  against serious natural disasters. He went deep into the  reality and the grass-roots level to seriously conduct  investigation, to listen to the demands of the people, to  concern himself with their plight, to earnestly help them  overcome difficulties, and to bring the warmth of the party to  tens of thousands of households. He devoted himself to his  work, worked diligently, performed official duties honestly,  carried out arduous struggle, always linked his heart with those  of the people, and maintained the fine quality of a Communist.  At the last moment of his life, he was still thinking of how to  help the people live a happy and prosperous life and how to make  the country grow and flourish. Comrade Jiao Yulu consciously  linked the lofty ideal of the realization of communism with the  arduous struggle carried out in a down-to-earth manner in the  present stage, made selfless contributions, did his utmost to  explore, served the people wholeheartedly, and depended entirely  on the people. Through his own actions, he portrayed the  shining image of an outstanding member and cadre of the  Communist Party and erected a towering monument in the hearts of  the people. For the past 30 years, his moving deeds have  educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of party members,  cadres, and ordinary people to constantly move forward. His  great spirit will always shine with dazzling splendor in the  progress of historical development.    Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  party's basic line, China has made spectacular achievements in  reform, opening up, and modernization which have attracted  worldwide attention and the face of the whole country has  undergone profound change. The tasks we are shouldering today  are different from those when Comrade Jiao Yulu was alive. The  social environment, working conditions, and people's ideology  and concepts have also changed greatly. While taking economic  construction as the center, building socialist material and  spiritual civilization, and promoting another leap in society  and history, all party comrades and all the people of the  country are constantly making progress themselves. The spirit  of the time, which includes emancipating the mind, seeking truth  from facts, energetically making exploration, boldly blazing new  trails, carrying out arduous struggle, advancing despite  difficulties, learning from foreign countries, making  unremitting efforts to improve oneself, being modest and  prudent, guarding against arrogance and rashness, being of one  heart and one mind, taking the overall situation into  consideration, practicing economy, being honest, rousing oneself  to make the country prosperous, and making selfless  contribution, have all been further developed. At the same  time, we must also be aware that ideas and styles of money  worship which "puts money above everything else," hedonism which  advocates seeking ease and comfort, and blatant egotism which  places individual interests in first place, have also grown and  spread among some of the people. Under these circumstances, no  matter whether or not we are trying to carry forward the spirit  of the times or to resist the influence of various negative and  decadent ideas, it is all the more necessary for us to adhere to  the party's purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, to  inherit and carry forward the fine style of establishing close  ties with the masses of people and of doing arduous pioneering  work, and to advocate through great efforts the spirit of Jiao  Yulu. It can be said that today, seriously learning from and  carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu remains as the demand  of our great era, the call by the people of all nationalities  throughout the whole country, and the need in strengthening  party building and developing socialist modernization.    The goal of our present stage is to build socialism with  Chinese characteristics. The general task for the whole party  and the whole country at present is to seize the opportunity to  deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote  development, and maintain stability. In learning from and  carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period, we  should have our feet firmly planted in the present, have our  eyes on the future, and integrate the lofty ideal of realizing  communism with carrying out socialist modernization in a  down-to-earth manner. The fundamental objective of carrying out  reform and opening up, and of establishing the socialist market  economy structure, is to liberate and develop the social  productive forces, to strengthen the comprehensive national  strength of our socialist country, to improve the living  standards of the people, and eventually to realize common  prosperity. As a genuine Communist Party member, one should  firmly establish the correct ideal, faith, and outlook on life,  unswervingly carry out the party's basic line of "one center,  two basic points," increase one's sense of responsibility and  mission in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  give expression to one's value of life in the course of  endeavoring to make greater contributions to reform, opening up,  and modernization.    In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao  Yulu  in the new period, we should, as did Jiao Yulu, serve the people  wholeheartedly, establish close ties with the people, do  everything for the people, and trust and rely on the people in  all matters. Comrade Jiao Yulu "had everyone on his mind except  himself." What he thought or did was precisely what the broad  masses of people needed most and what he criticized and opposed,  was precisely what the broad masses of people detested and  hated. He always "appeared in front of the people when they  were in difficulty and showed concern for and helped the people  when they needed help most." This is the fundamental reason why  Jiao Yulu enjoys such a high prestige in the minds of the people.    The reform, opening up, and socialist modernization we are  engaged in at present are a brand-new cause in human history and  are also the people 's own cause. In the course of advance, we  will inevitably encounter many new situations and new problems  and only by relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses of  people can the problems be solved. In particular, in the  current process of deepening reform, some deep contradictions  will gradually become conspicuous and some people will meet with  some new difficulties in production and daily life. Therefore,  we should study these problems and find solutions to them  together with the masses of people in a serious and responsible  manner. Leading cadres at all levels must further strengthen  their mass viewpoint, adhere to the mass line, safeguard the  fundamental interests of the people, go among the people to find  out their weal and woe, listen to their demands, strive to solve  problems and overcome difficulties about which the people are  concerned, and properly handle various contradictions among the  people. The masses of people are the source of our party's  strength and the basis of the victory of our cause. All party  comrades should firmly strike roots among the people and serve  the people well. With the trust and support of the people, the  victory of our cause is guaranteed.    In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao  Yulu  in the new period we should, as did Jiao Yulu, adhere to the  party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed  from reality in everything we do, speak the truth, do solid  work, explore boldly, and work creatively. Comrade Jiao Yulu  went deep into reality, carried out investigations and studies,  respected the practice of the people, proceeded from the reality  of Lankao, made and implemented the correct policy decision on  putting the "three disasters" under control, and made important  contributions to changing the face of Lankao. He seriously  implemented the decisions made at higher levels and paid  attention to implementing them in light of local reality. He  was fond of reading and studying but he did not blindly follow  what the books said. He paid attention to studying other  people's experiences but he never used such experience  mechanically. This is also an important reason why Jiao Yulu  was able to work with so well and why he enjoyed popular  support. Today, if we want to seize the opportunity to develop  ourselves and to push forward the cause of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, we must pay greater attention to  grasping the essence of Marxism in emancipating the mind and  seeking truth from facts, study hard, master a scientific world  outlook and methodology, uphold the principle of putting  practice first, respect the objective laws of the development of  things, comprehensively understand and implement the party's  line, policies, principles, and various reform measures,  correctly understand and handle contradictions and problems with  which we are faced, guard against one-sidedness and avoid  thinking in terms of absolutes, and reduce subjectivism and  blindness. Regarding new problems we face, it is all the more  necessary for us to study them with utmost care, energetically  solve them, boldly explore them, creatively work on them, and to  constantly raise our leadership level and develop our work  ability.    In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao  Yulu in the new period we should, like Jiao Yulu, fear no  hardships and dangers, fight with fortitude, and do arduous  pioneering work. Waging arduous struggle and making unremitting  efforts to improve oneself are fine traditions of our party and  the Chinese nation. These fine traditions were fully manifested  by Jiao Yulu. When Lankao was hard hit by serious natural  disasters, Jiao Yulu, in the dauntless and heroic spirit of a  Communist, pressed forward in the face of difficulties, dared to  "pose as hero before difficulties," and aroused the  determination and fighting will of the people to triumph over  difficulties through his own deeds. Ours is a great cause which  is full of hope and also strewn with hardship. A great cause  needs a great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is a kind of  noble moral integrity and also provides a tremendous strength  for cutting through brambles and thorns, blazing new trails, and  for forging ahead. In the course of reform and construction,  especially when we encounter difficulties, it is even more  necessary for us to carry forward the spirit of waging arduous  struggle. As Communist Party members, we should not fear  hardships or dangers and should never recoil with fear and  accomplish nothing. We should make unremitting efforts to  improve ourselves, do pioneering work, and forge ahead, and  should never stick to old ways and cease to make progress. We  should practice economy and treasure the wealth created by the  people and we should never indulge in ostentation or competition  in spending, extravagance, and waste.    In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao  Yulu, we should perform official duties honestly and work  diligently for the people. Jiao Yulu did not go to Lankao to  become an official. He went there to work for the people's  interests. To date, the people still talk extensively about how  he performed his official duties honestly and exercised  self-discipline. "The history of the country and of all the  great men in the past shows that diligence and thrift lead to  success but extravagance leads to failure." We should remember  this old saying. Party and government cadres, leading cadres in  particular, at all levels must follow the example of Jiao Yulu,  consciously temper themselves to strengthen their party  characteristics, always put the party's cause in an important  position, and set high demands on themselves. They should  correctly use the power given them by the people, work hard,  strive to do solid work to benefit the people, resolutely fight  against phenomena of corruption, and live up to the hopes of the  broad masses of people.    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a brilliant example for our broad  masses  of party members, leading cadres at all levels in particular.  Party committees at all levels should regard learning from and  carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu as an important measure  to strengthen the building of the ideology and work styles of  party and state power organs, to strengthen the building of the  socialist spiritual civilization, and to promote reform, opening  up, and socialist modernization in China. They should:  Continue to do a good job and make achievements in this  respect; further enhance the formation of a public opinion  environment for developing healthy trends, suppressing unhealthy  trends, and encouraging people to make progress; and should  promote the more extensive and thorough development of  activities to learn from Jiao Yulu. They should link learning  from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu with the  implementation of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee, with the study of the Volume 3 of The Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping and with safeguarding and promoting  the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. In  the course of doing so, they should strive to train and nurture  thousands upon thousands of good party members and good cadres  like Jiao Yulu. In activities to learn from Jiao Yulu, leading  cadres at all levels should take the lead in setting examples  through their own actions, comprehensively improve their own  quality, lead the broad masses of cadres and people in plunging  themselves into the practice of seizing the opportunity to  deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote  development, maintain stability, and make new achievements in  and greater contributions to the great cause of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics!</p>

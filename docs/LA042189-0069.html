			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS CANCEL PLANS FOR 2 NEW REACTORS AT CHERNOBYL  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has canceled plans to construct two more reactors at the  stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and has halted expansion of all  similar plants for safety reasons, the Tass news agency said Thursday.  </P> <P> The decision was announced six days before the third anniversary of the  accident at Chernobyl, 60 miles north of Kiev in the Ukraine, that killed 31  people in the world's worst civilian nuclear disaster.  </P> <P> Plans to construct two additional reactors at the facility had been suspended  since the explosion of the No. 4 reactor spread a cloud of radiation over  Eastern Europe on April 26, 1986. The No. 4 reactor is now sealed in concrete.  </P> <P> Addition of No. 5 and No. 6 reactors to the three-reactor plant would have made  it the biggest atomic energy station in the world.  </P> <P> "The Council of Ministers has adopted an unequivocal decision to abandon the  construction of the fifth and sixth power blocks of the Chernobyl nuclear power  station on which work had been suspended after the Chernobyl accident," Tass  said. "In addition, no plans will be made to expand other power stations now in  operation that use the RBMK (graphite) reactors. Unlike Western reactors, the  graphite RBMKs can be refueled without being shut down for months at a time."  </P> <P> The agency said the other stations are at Kursk, in central Russia, and near  the western city of Smolensk.  </P> <P> The graphite system is inexpensive and simple because the reactor is made of  piles of graphite blocks with interconnecting water-cooling pipes. It is hard  to maintain, however, because the hundreds of thousands of pipe connections  could develop leaks.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has 45 nuclear reactors in operation at 16 locations, and  another 34 plants are under construction at 15 locations, according to official  figures.  </P> <P> The government has decided to rebuild power blocks that were constructed in the  1970s and are now operating, Tass said. The reconstruction will take place  between 1989 and 1994, Tass said.  </P> <P> "These and all the newly constructed power blocks will be equipped with  additional safety systems, which ensure safe cooling in case of an emergency,"  Tass said.  </P> <P> The new systems will allow inspectors to contain any radioactive leaks from the  reactor complex, Tass said. Soviet engineers will have designs by the mid-1990s  for a new generation of power stations.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, Feb 22 (AFP) -- Southern officials mounted a  diplomatic drive on Tuesday in the Gulf, after troop clashes at  home which claimed at least eight lives despite a reconciliation  accord between Yemen's rival leaders.    Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, met King  Fahd  in the Saudi capital, while his deputy Salim Salih Muhammad met  the Kuwaiti amir, Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, and called for ties  to be restored.    They were the first such high-level visits since the 1991  Gulf war, when the conservative monarchies accused Yemen of  siding with Iraq and Kuwait broke off relations.    Al-Bid later travelled to Oman while Salih Muhammad went to  the United Arab Emirates, where he said the tour was aimed at  drumming up support for Yemen after the reconciliation signed on  Sunday in Amman by al-Bid and President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a  northerner.    Referring to the clashes which have erupted since the deal,  the envoy called on "all parties concerned to help remedy the  situation and allow the return of stability."    But an Arab diplomat here, declining to be named, warned  that  the al-Bid initiative could back-fire and "aggravate the crisis  of confidence between the president and his deputy."    Al-Bid is still refusing to return to Sanaa from his  southern  base of Aden, where he has taken refuge since last August, an  official in the president's General People's Congress (GPC) said.    He said the vice president was demanding the arrest and  trial  of those responsible for the series of political assassinations  since the country united in May 1990, most of which have  targeted al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP).    Since Friday, fighting between rival Yemeni troops has  killed  at least eight soldiers and created an "explosive" situation  which could run out of control, diplomatic and defence ministry  sources said.    Seven died in two separate clashes in the south on Monday,  the day after the Amman accord calling for major economic,  political and military reforms. Another soldier was killed in  fighting near Aden airport on Friday.    The accord on decentralization, as demanded by the south,  was  aimed at ending a political crisis between Salih and al-Bid that  threatened the unity of the country.    Despite unity, the two armies have not merged -- although  northern units have been sent south and vice versa -- and  tension has grown with troop build-ups along the former frontier.    The situation has become "explosive," with a risk of the  fighting spreading across the country, a source close to Defence  Minister Haytham Tahir Qasim, a southerner, said after the  latest clashes.    Four soldiers were killed and 20 wounded in the town of  Lawdar, 100 kilometres (60 miles) northeast of Aden on Monday,  diplomatic sources said.    Southern troops dispatched as reinforcements from the port  of  al-Mukallah fought for several hours with a northern brigade in  a battle involving tanks and artillery.    Three other soldiers died Monday when northern forces  attacked an administrative building held by southern troops in  Zinjibar, 30 kilometres (20 miles) east of Aden, and the capital  of Abyan province, the sources said.    Tension flared in Abyan after the president overturned the  nomination of a local governor by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al- 'Attas, a southerner.    A military commission was dispatched to Abyan to sort out  the  dispute between the rival forces but so far the mission has been  a failure, the YSP said.    But the GPC official played down reports of tension, saying  the situation in Abyan was calm after the commission's  intervention with the backing of the US and French embassies.    "The alarming reports from the YSP are designed to  camouflage  the actions they are taking that are contrary to the  reconciliation accord," he charged.</p>

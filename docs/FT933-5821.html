			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Astec (BSR) doubles to Pounds 4.33m - Strong performance prompts resumption of dividend payments ASTEC (BSR), the Hong Kong-based and London-listed electronics company that is 48.9 per cent owned by Emerson Electric of the US, is resuming dividend payments for the first time in three years following a doubling of pre-tax profits and earnings per share in the first half. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 jumped from Pounds 2.17m to Pounds 4.33m, boosted, said Mr Brian Christopher, chairman, by higher sales, a profits turnround in the slimmed-down electronic components division and lower interest payments. Sales increased by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 136.4m (Pounds 124.4m). On a comparable basis, adjusting for exchange rate differences and operations sold or closed in 1992, sales grew by 6.3 per cent. The group, which has achieved a steady improvement in performance over the past 18 months, reported increased earnings per share of 1.2p (0.6p). It is paying an interim dividend of 0.25p, the first distribution since a 0.7p interim in 1990. Mr George Tamke, chief executive, said the results reflected the company's strong underlying financial performance, including growing market share and improving operating margins. Sales in the core power conversion business increased by almost 30 per cent to Pounds 108m (Pounds 83.1m). However, after adjusting for the impact of exchange rates the increase was a more modest 8.6 per cent. Operating profits in the division increased to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 3.6m) but margins fell to 3.6 per cent (4.2 per cent) reflecting the non-recurring start-up costs of a new modular production line and the group's second plant in China. Excluding these start-up costs, Mr Tamke said operating margins grew by a percentage point. Electronic components sales declined to Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 41.3m) reflecting the reorganisation of the operations which now solely comprise Beckman Industrial. However, the components business reported an operating profit of Pounds 712,000, or 2.5 per cent of sales, compared with a loss of Pounds 354,000, and is now expected to resume growth. The group generated a positive cash flow of Pounds 13.1m in the first half that enabled it to eliminate borrowings and end the period with Pounds 300,000 net cash. As a result of this and lower interest rates net interest payable fell from Pounds 977,000 to Pounds 240,000.</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / CD CORNER: MAKING THE CASE FOR JOHNNY CASH -- ROCKER  </P> <P> "Johnny Cash: The Sun Years" wasn't designed by Rhino Records to be Exhibit A  in the case for Johnny Cash's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  But the newly released CD indirectly serves as one.  </P> <P> One reason frequently cited to explain why the veteran singer has been bypassed  by Hall of Fame voters since balloting began five years ago is that many voters  tend to view Cash's primary interest as country music rather than rock.  </P> <P> This perception exists even though he was a label-mate at Sun Records in the  '50s of -- and often toured with -- four other artists who have been voted into  the Hall of Fame: Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Roy Orbison.  </P> <P> The view also overlooks the fact that country -- along with gospel and blues --  played a key role in the development of rock. Two country legends -- Jimmie  Rodgers and Hank Williams -- have been inducted by the Hall of Fame as  forefathers (the term given to pre-rock influences).  </P> <P> Cash's music was influenced strongly by the restless blues strains popularized  by Rodgers and by the rural, emotional purity of Williams.  </P> <P> Most of Cash's key Sun singles -- including "I Walk the Line" and "Folsom  Prison Blues" -- reflected a tension and a guitar-oriented edge that gave them  a tougher, more modern pop-rock feel than most of the country records of the  '50s. Some of the singles -- notably "Big River" and "Home of the Blues" --  even ventured effectively into rockabilly.  </P> <P> While the 18 songs featured on the new Rhino package (including all those  cited) represent Cash's most direct ties to rock, his later Columbia recordings  were also influential in rock -- both his ambitious concept albums and his  frequent social comment. Among the Hall of Fame members who have cited Cash as  an influence: Bob Dylan, Bobby Darin and Ray Charles.  </P> <P> Several of Cash's Columbia albums are already available in CD and an especially  attractive one is due shortly: a single, budget CD that includes both of Cash's  live "Folsom Prison" and "San Quentin" prison albums from the '60s.  </P> <P> HALL OF FAME, PART II: Eddie Cochran, who was part of the Hall of Fame's 1987  induction class, is saluted in an excellent four-disc CD box set that was  released in Britain by Liberty/EMI and is available as an import in some U.S.  record shops. The set, which retails for around $48 and is titled "The Eddie  Cochran Box Set," contains 113 selections -- ranging from the L.A.-based  performer's early country experiments through some live TV appearances and some  tracks where he appears simply as a session guitarist.  </P> <P> Cochran had only two Top 20 U.S. hits, "Sittin' in the Balcony" and "Summertime  Blues," but his music was characterized by an uncommonly appealing sense of  youthful intensity and desire, and he was an especially big influence in  Britain, where he died in a 1960 auto crash at age 21.  </P> <P> There are no plans for EMI to release the box set in this country, but the  label is planning to issue a single, 20-song Cochran CD as part of its  "Legendary Masters" series on Feb. 26. Other artists who will be featured in  the series include Rick Nelson, Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, Bobby Vee and  the duo of Shirley and Lee.  </P> <P> HALL OF FAME, PART III: The Kinks, inducted into the Hall of Fame last month,  are mainly celebrated for the singles and concept albums that were released in  the '60s by Reprise Records. But the English band also made several noteworthy  albums in the '70s for RCA Records, including "Muswell Hillbillies." That album  is one of three of the RCA collections just released in CD by Rhino. The  others: "Soap Opera" and "Schoolboys in Disgrace."  </P></p>

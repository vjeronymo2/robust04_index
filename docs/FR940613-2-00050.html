			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We suspect that the practices we describe developed over time as appraisers, and mutuals and their advisers, attempted to deal in good faith with the inherent contradictions of, on the one hand, a form of transaction perfectly suited to institutions on the brink of failure, or which the market feared, and, on the other, a thrift industry that has returned to health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a footnote to the conversions of the 80's, it is worth observing that many institutions which emerged with very high capital ratios were so anxious to earn a good return for their new, demanding stockholders, that they grew their balance sheets more quickly than they should have and took risks they did not fully understand. A total of 77 New England savings banks converted in the years 1984 through 1989; these transactions increased their weighted average capital ratio to 15.2% from 6.6%; 16 of them (or 21%) subsequently failed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, the rush by converted institutions to increase assets quickly tended to reduce credit standards throughout the market, imperiling other institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ''Understanding the Experience of Converted New England Savings Banks,'' Eccles and O'Keefe, FDIC (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changing the Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> What this history demonstrates is the need for fundamental change:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``appraisal'' process puts the government in the awkward position of substituting its judgement for that of the market...  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; .&blank;.&blank;. and forces most converting institutions to raise far more capital than they can prudently deploy...  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; .&blank;.&blank;. but still fails to eliminate windfalls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This has put well-intended individuals involved in more than a few conversions in the ethically uncomfortable position of pretending the appraisal requirement is met when they know it isn't.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The required form of transaction transfers the existing value of the mutual to a small group of individuals with the cash, sophistication and risk appetite to buy the stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Because value is being ``given away,'' the process invites insider abuse. And because the value has to go somewhere, the ingenuity of market participants eventually frustrates attempts to eliminate the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We share with others a desire to address problems arising under the existing rules. We do not in any way want to prevent valid conversions from taking place_nor encourage conversions that fail to meet a valid business need. We also desire that our handling of conversions be generally consistent with that of the OTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons we are publishing elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a proposed rule which: (a) reaffirms our intention to review conversion applications submitted by state-chartered nonmember insured savings banks (and applications for insurance from newly established associations to be owned by mutual holding companies), and (b) explicitly establishes certain criteria which are comparable to those of the OTS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, we feel it is only fair to put the public on notice that we believe it may be difficult for a healthy mutual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a sound business plan while raising enough new capital to receive a valid appraisal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

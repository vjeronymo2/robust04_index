			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zixin (3769 1311 0341) of the Ministry of </F> Foreign Trade and Economic Development Trade Development Office:  "Strategic Tasks in Foreign Trade Adjustment"]    [Text] China is in the process of working out a new  industrial policy to meet the needs of further opening itself to  the outside world and building a socialist market economy. It is  one of the four major goals of China's national industrial  policy in the 1990's to adjust the foreign trade structure  properly, accelerate the upgrading of the industrial structure,  and enhance its international competitiveness. Since reform went  under way and the open policy began, foreign trade has played an  increasingly important strategic role in promoting economic  growth, optimizing the industrial structure, and raising the  quality of the economy. During the 1990's, as the Chinese  economy accelerates its integration into the world economy and  as China continues to take big strides toward a socialist open  market economy, foreign trade will play an even more prominent  strategic part in modernization. In the 1990's there will be a  series of changes, including opportunities and challenges, in  both the internal and external conditions in which economic  development and foreign trade take place. Thus further adjusting  the foreign trade structure and creating even more favorable  conditions for economic development in order to meet the  requirements of the new situation has become a major topic  facing us. We believe that depending on the needs and  possibilities, the adjustment of the foreign trade structure in  the 1990's will involve three major strategic tasks. First, to  take advantage of our "latecomer" status and speed up the  transition of the mode of economic development from extensive to  intensive, we must continue to ensure that foreign trade,  particularly exports, expands at a fast pace and contributes  even more to economic growth and the adjustment of the  industrial structure. Second, we must speed up the upgrading of  the export industries and the optimization of the export mix in  light of the evolving trends in the global industrial structure  and China's own capabilities. The goal is an export mix  dominated by multiple-processed products and articles with high  added value. Third, by accelerating the reform of the import  system, we must set up an import regulating system that is in  line with China's national conditions, satisfies the  requirements of GATT, spurs the optimization of the import mix,  and raises the proportion of imports consisting of advanced  technology and equipment in order to bring about technological  advances in China. At the same time, the domestic market should  be opened systematically and selectively, an appropriate measure  of international competition should be introduced, and the  adjustment of the industrial structure and pattern of regional  distribution should be brought under greater pressure so as to  further the well-being of the people and improve the overall  efficiency of the national economy. Below we discuss the goals  and means of the three major strategic tasks of adjusting the  foreign trade structure:  <H5>  I. Increase Contribution of Foreign Trade to Economic </H5> Growth, Industrial Structure Adjustment    Since reform went under way and the open policy was  introduced, foreign trade has contributed progressively more and  more to economic development as it experienced rapid growth, a  trend that has been particularly striking since 1988. Dependency  on imports and exports has increased substantially. Foreign  demand as indicated by exports also showed signs of rising  relative to gross social demand, as did the increase in exports  relative to the increase in gross demand. The expansion of  foreign demand is becoming an increasingly important force  fueling economic growth. Rising exports contribute to economic  growth immensely. The significant change in the standing of  imports and exports in national economic processes symbolize the  historic changes in the way the Chinese economy operates.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

First, the increase in exports has accelerated the adjustment of  the product mix and the upgrading of products. Second, the  increase in exports had set the stage for the realization of  economies of scale by some enterprises, which helps widen their  margin of profit. Third, exporting and taking part in  international competition have pushed many enterprises at home  to improve the quality of their products, introduce more variety  in their product design and lineup, and lower costs, which all  help improve the quality of Chinese enterprises and enhance  their international competitiveness. Fourth, the growth in  exports has put to use China's comparative advantage in capital  goods such as manpower through participation in international  division of labor, which helps improve our macroeconomic  efficiency. Fifth, the multiplier effects of foreign trade have  powerfully fueled the development of related sectors. Sixth, the  importing of raw materials, goods, and consumer products in  short supply in China has met the requirements of industrial and  agricultural production as well as the daily needs of the people  and helped ease the constraints of the bottleneck sector on  economic development. Seventh, the importation of advanced  technology and equipment and intermediate inputs has helped  accelerate technological advances in China, improve the  input-output ratio, enhance economic efficiency, speed up  industrial upgrading, and strengthen the momentum for lasting  economic growth. Eighth, competing imports have demonstrative  effects and exert pressure on domestic enterprises to speed up  their "learning, absorption, assimilation, and improvement"  process and become more adaptable. All in all, the rapid  development of foreign trade makes it possible for China to  better utilize foreign markets, resources, funds, technology,  and qualified personnel.    As the supply-demand conditions in the national economy  evolve and following the resumption of China's status as a  signatory to GATT, foreign trade will play an even more  important role in balancing the total volume and the structure  of the economy in the 1990's. On the one hand, when the demand  structure goes upscale and the demand for newer and better  consumer goods swells, the demand for capital goods and  intermediate goods with a high technical content would intensify  by the day. On the other hand, there are signs of deterioration  in supply conditions, particularly the availability of  resources. There is also extensive plant duplication in light  industry, processing industry, and durable consumer goods  industry. In these industries the scale is not economical and  there is a good deal of production overcapacity, which makes it  hard to improve product quality and raise profitability, which,  in turn, would lead to diminished international competitiveness.  Moreover, since the resumption of China's membership in GATT is  irreversible, many domestic industries would be affected to  varying extents. These factors make it even more imperative that  China use foreign trade in the 1990's to close the gap between  supply and demand at home and speed up industrial upgrading. And  economic structural reform, particularly the deepening of  foreign trade reform, will pave the way for foreign trade to  play an important strategic role in the national economy.  Moreover, international conditions in the 1990's more and more  favor the drive to increase the contribution of foreign trade to  the national economy. First of all, with the global economy and  world trade gradually recovering in the near and medium term,  China may face a more favorable international market in the late  1990's. Second, the world-wide industrial structure is in the  midst of readjustment right now, with developed nations and the  newly industrialized countries [NIC's] hiving off traditional  industries at an accelerated pace, which provides a favorable  external environment for China's move to accelerate industrial  upgrading and gradually replace light and textile industries  with heavy industry, chemical industry, and new durable consumer  goods industry as the leading export-oriented industries.    Based on the universal laws of industrialization and  modernization worldwide and the requirements and possibilities  of the development of foreign trade in the 1990's, we should set  the following goals for the first strategic task of the  adjustment of foreign trade structure in the 1990's.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

A widespread trend among  industrializing nations as they take off economically as well as  a major characteristic of global economic development today is  for foreign trade to grow reasonably faster than the economy.  Since reform began and the open policy was introduced, the  development of China's foreign trade has basically been  consistent with this principle. As the Chinese economy takes off  in the 1990's, it is entirely necessary and possible to keep  foreign trade expanding 3 to 5 percentage points ahead of GNP.    2) Imports should roughly equal or slightly exceed exports.  Most NIC's ran some sort of a trade deficit during their  economic take-off so that they had considerable foreign  resources and technology at their disposal to accelerate  economic development. China's medium- and long-term foreign  trade policy in the 1990's is to achieve a rough balance between  imports and exports, but considering the needs of modernization  and the fact that we have a net surplus of capital projects, it  would also be normal to run a small deficit in some years.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. A Comparison of Foreign Trade and GNP Growth Rates of Some Newly In-|  |dustrialized Countries (Regions) During Economic Take-Off ()                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Exports                  |GNP                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |South Korea              |27.2                     |9.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hong Kong                |9.1                      |8.6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Brazil                   |9.3                      |9.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Indonesia                |9.6                      |7.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      3) The extent of participation in international division of  labor will increase further, gradually creating an open  resource-balancing mechanism. The fast growth of foreign trade  inevitably implies greater involvement by China in international  division of labor and exchange based on the principle of  comparative advantage and opening up China economically even  further to the outside world. As foreign trade dependency  increases in the 1990's, the integration of the Chinese economy  into the world economy will quicken and an open optimal  resource-allocation and balancing mechanism will gradually come  into existence.

A  high savings rate and a rising foreign trade contribution rate  are preconditions a developing nation must meet to achieve fast  economic growth and improve the quality of its economic  development. As a developing nation, China too must work to keep  savings rate and foreign trade contribution at a high rate if it  is to accelerate economic take-off. Accordingly, it is  imperative that macroeconomic regulation and control be  tightened and improved and the appropriate monetary and fiscal  policies be adopted in order to hold down gross domestic demand  as appropriate and check inflation. To do all that is to set the  stage for raising the accumulation level in the national economy  and ensuring the steady long-term expansion of exports,  basically reversing a longstanding phenomenon in which export  growth is hampered by the boom-and-bust cycle in the domestic  economy.    2) Deepen reform and gradually allow the market to play a  basic role in resource allocation. This is an institutional  guarantee of putting comparative advantage to the utmost use and  obtaining the optimal comparative advantage through foreign  trade.    3) Establish a foreign trade system featuring fair  competition and deregulation that conforms with the norms of  international trade. Instead of making the earning of foreign  exchange their principal objective, foreign trade enterprises  must now be profit-driven, a transition that must be effected as  soon as possible. Over time they should be operated exclusively  in accordance with the principle of profitability. Property  rights relations should be sorted out and a modern enterprise  system should be put widely in place.    4) Gradually create a new body of policies consistent with  international practices that will encourage exporting and give  the export drive all necessary support.  <H5>  II. Accelerate Upgrading of Export Industries; Optimize </H5> Export Mix    Accelerating the upgrading of the mix of export industries  and optimizing the export mix are major conditions for improving  the terms of trade, enhancing China's international  competitiveness, and heightening its staying power as an  exporter. It is also an important driving force behind better  utilizing the changing mechanism of the international market to  facilitate the adjustment of China's industrial structure. It is  the second major strategic task facing China in the 1990's as it  seeks to adjust its foreign trade structure.    1) The need to accelerate the upgrading of export industries  and optimize the export mix    Since reform began and the open policy went under way,  China's mix of export commodities has improved enormously.  According to customs statistics, industrial manufactured goods  accounted for 80 percent of all Chinese exports in 1992. At  $19.55 billion, electrical machinery products made up 23 percent  of all exports. The mix of countries (regions) to which Chinese  exports are destined has been improved. There has been stable  development in export growth using a variety of trading methods.  The optimization of the export mix has been instrumental in  promoting the adjustment of the mix of industries. However, we  should also see that China's leading export industries remain  resource-and labor-intensive industries with little multiple  processing and limited added value. We are still a long long way  from fully exploiting our economic and technical edge and our  strength in elements of production. There are little differences  between the export mix of one locality compared to the next.  Production of export commodities takes place on a small scale  and is fragmented, which militates against the effort to make  exporting more profitable, diminishes the staying power of  export growth, and encourages panic purchasing at home even at  inflated prices and cut-throat price-slashing overseas. The  optimization of the export mix and the adjustment of the  industrial structure should have a mutual stimulating effect,  but because of the above-mentioned factors, such a relationship  has not been fully operational. The optimization of the export  mix has done little to further the adjustment of the industrial  structure, which it should. Although China's current export mix,  dominated by labor-intensive products, is favored in some ways,  it also faces grim challenges given the international climate  today.    To begin with, competition among the nations world-wide will  become more ferocious in the 1990's even as global economic  interdependency increases. As the new-tech and high-tech  revolution accelerates, high tech and new tech will be the  principal theatre where nations vie for supremacy in overall  national power. As the internationalization and  industrialization of high-tech and new technology quicken their  pace, the global industrial structure will undergo dizzying  changes, with technology- and knowledge-intensive industries  increasingly gain the upper hand in international competition,  while the terms of trade for resource- and labor-intensive  industries will worsen in contrast. External conditions do exist  for the further participation by China's labor-intensive  industries, which enjoy an edge, in international division of  labor. At the same time, however, China's export mix, heavily  dependent on labor-intensive products, also faces grim  challenges.    Another important trend in world economic development in the  1990's is that regional economic blocs have been taking shape at  an accelerating pace, profoundly impacting the movement of  commodities, capital, technology, and qualified personnel among  nations. In Europe, a huge unified market became operative  starting in early 1993. The United States, Canada, and Mexico  have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the  Asian and Pacific region, economic cooperation is moving in the  direction of institutionalization and sub-regional groups have  proliferated. Elsewhere, too, economic cooperation associations  of all forms and shapes are being planned or put together  enthusiastically. To a certain extent, economic regionalization  will stimulate economic growth and trade around the world, thus  creating some opportunities for China. But such opportunities  will be accompanied by protectionism and an expanded flow of  commodities, capital, technology, and personnel among developed  nations and developing nations within a particular regional  bloc, which will adversely affect the development of China's  foreign economic relations and trade.    Third, the adjustment of the global industrial structure  will  continue and international division of labor will intensify in  the 1990's. The outward transfer of labor-intensive industries  from developed nations and the NIC's will pick up steam.  Meanwhile, however, member-nations of ASEAN and countries in  South Asia, Latin America, the Commonwealth of Independent  States, and East Europe are also in a hurry to reform and open  up themselves to the outside world. As their international  competitiveness improves over time, they will become tough  competitors for China.    Summing up the preceding paragraphs analytically,  traditionally it is the labor- and resource-intensive  industries, including light industry and the textile industry,  that have sustained the scale of China's exports. However, any  major expansion in exports will be hard to come by if we fail to  upgrade our industries technologically and continue to compete  essentially on price. We can no longer afford to delay giving  special support to and developing on a priority basis such  technology-intensive industries as heavy industry, chemical  industry, and instrument-making industry in which China already  has a foundation in place and where it enjoys a dynamic  comparative advantage.    2) Developing technology-intensive industries for export:  strengths and practical feasibility    More than 40 years after the PRC was founded, China has  basically put together a coherent industrial system and a  complete scientific research system. It boasts a full line-up of  industries, a large number of technical personnel, and a massive  army of scientific researchers. Right now about 2 million  scientific research personnel are engaged in research and  development, more than anywhere else in the world, generating  scientific research achievements in the tens of thousands each  year. In such S&amp;T fields as aviation and space technology,  biotechnology, genetic engineering, fiber optical  communications, shipbuilding, iron and steel, domestic  electrical appliance industry, and petrochemical industry, China  matches the best in the world or is closing in on it.    China is also heavily favored to develop  technology-intensive  industries for export in that it can compete on the costs of  elements of production. Vast in territory, China abounds with  strategic resources like non-ferrous metals and ferrous metals,  coal, and petroleum. It has an ample supply of inexpensive  labor. Infrastructural facilities like water supply,  communications, and transportation have also reached a  substantial scale.    Even more important, after more than 40 years of  construction, particularly after reform began and the open  policy was introduced, China has greatly enhanced its production  capability and level of technology by attracting foreign  capital, importing advanced technology and whole plants, and  developing industries using high and new technology. No doubt  this has laid a solid foundation for the drive by China to push  its exports to a higher level of technology.    In light of the characteristics of China's economic  development and the trends in the development of international  economic relations and trade, we should firmly commit ourselves  to achieving the following as objectives of the adjustment of  the mix of export commodities and the establishment of strategic  industries. In the short haul, rely on the agricultural  byproducts industry, light industry, and textile industry as the  mainstay export industries, while concentrating on increasing  the technical content of export commodities, improving product  quality, and moving to the upper end of the market, forming a  host of products with international brand-name recognition. In  the medium term, take the electrical machinery, food, and  chemical industries as the leading export industries and  concentrate on developing mature technologies and whole plants  for export in order to increase China's international  competitiveness and elevate them to the nation's leading exports  after five to seven years of hard work. In the long run, make  high-tech industries and the next generation of chemical, heavy,  and instrument-making industries our strategic export  industries, treating them preferentially on a policy level and  giving them all-out support to ensure that new export growth  targets are met one after another. Everything must be done to  make sure these industries are exporting a substantial amount of  their output by the late 1990's, joining the ranks of China's  key export industries.    3) Policies and measures to strategically adjust the mix of  China's export commodities    a) The government must conduct scientific planning and  formulate the appropriate laws. The adjustment of the export mix  embraces a range of fields, including those in  production--industry, scientific research, foreign trade, and  agriculture--and circulation. No unit acting alone can draw up a  comprehensive plan. It is proposed that comprehensive agencies  under the State Council take the lead in initiating systems  research in conjunction with the functional departments involved  and drawing up an export industry strategy for each of the three  industry clusters as presently conceived--current mainstay  industry cluster, near-term leading industry cluster, and future  strategic industry cluster--setting goals and outlining the  steps to be taken at each stage and introducing them as soon as  possible. Moreover, when the conditions exist, we should  consider drawing up the corresponding legislation such as a  technology import-export law, a high-tech and new technology  industry law, and a strategic industry vitalization law, among  others. Enlist the help of the law to spur the upgrading of  export industries.    b) Expedite economic structural reform and S&amp;T reform  vigorously and establish a mechanism that promotes the effective  integration of trade, industry, agriculture, and technology. In  the short run, there are two ways to integrate industry,  agriculture, technology, and trade. One approach is to go all  out to develop large-scale enterprise groups in the form of  comprehensive conglomerates that combine trade, industry, and  technology under one roof with foreign trade playing the  dominant role. In matters of technology, these enterprises  should go in for self-absorption, self-improvement, and  self-development with one helping the other in an endless cycle.  The other approach is to vigorously develop multinational  corporations that combine industry, S&amp;T, and foreign trade  under  one roof, with leading industries playing the dominant role. The  industrialization and internationalization of high-tech will be  completed within the industrial corporations themselves. In the  medium and long term, the problem of dissociation between  industry and trade must be solved at its root by deepening  economic structural reform and S&amp;T reform.    c) Formulate policies to single out certain industries for  preferential treatment, thereby bolstering the optimization of  the mix of export commodities. In preparing its industrial  policy for the 1990's, the state must consider the overall  industrial adjustment strategy and guide the optimization of the  mix of export commodities. Among the major policies and measures  are the following: 1) Fund credit support system; 2)  import-export policy; 3) a sound tariff policy; 4) export  drawback and other tax policies; 5) technology and qualified  personnel development policy.    d) Strengthen export industrial organizations. In the  transitional period of economic structural reform, the  government should take administrative, legal, and, if necessary,  administrative measures to step up intervention in export  industrial organizations. Not only should it guide the  rationalization of the structure of the increase in properties,  but it must work harder to adjust the structure of existing  properties. Enterprises in export production commonly operate on  a small scale, which prevents them from benefiting from  economies of scale. This and other problems must be overcome. On  the other hand, the government must promote the rationalization  of the distribution of export production, gradually putting  together an export production system that takes advantage of  each region's resource, economic, and technical strengths and  marries specialization with cooperation. At the same time, the  government should further the trend toward the formation of  foreign trade enterprise groups to enhance China's  competitiveness, forming an intelligent operational pattern  where the regions practice division of labor even as they  cooperate.    III. Decontrol Importation, Optimize Import Mix, and  Intensify Pressure To Adjust Structure    The irrationality of China's import mix manifests itself  primarily in the following ways: First, advanced technology and  equipment, particularly software technology, account for only a  limited share of total Chinese imports. According to statistics,  technology imports constitute a mere 8.5 percent of all imports  during the Seventh Five-Year Plan and only 8.2 percent in 1992.  Second, the importing of luxury consumer goods has not been  reined in successfully. Consumer goods and capital goods  imported through a variety of illegal channels have been  battering the domestic market. Third, unplanned importation and  duplicate importation are commonplace, severely hampering  industrial production and the adjustment of the industrial  structure at home. Even more serious, they complicate the drive  to increase the staying power of economic development and raise  profitability.    The irrationality of the import commodity mix has its roots  in the existing import management system, which also has given  rise to excessive import protection, hindering the full  exploitation of China's comparative advantage and its more  extensive participation in international division of labor.  Moreover, it takes away a major incentive to upgrade the  country's industries and undermines the effort to enhance  international competitiveness and profitability.    The move to gradually decontrol importation and optimize the  import mix in the 1990's has enormous strategic significance for  upgrading the industrial structure and would help solve some of  the deep-seated problems in China's industrial organizations:  low standard, small-scale operations, inefficiency, overlapping  industrial distribution and fragmentation. First of all, by  reforming the import management system, we can create the  conditions for extensively importing advanced foreign technology  that is applicable in China and increasing the efficacy of  technological application, which would spur technological  advances in export industries and leading industries, speed up  the upgrading of export products, and build future industries  with a dynamic comparative advantage that are oriented to both  the domestic and international markets. Second, introducing into  China an appropriate measure of international competitive  pressure would help put an end to a pattern common to industrial  development in China; namely, small as well as large enterprises  seeking to have a full lineup of products; eliminate inefficient  and backward enterprises; hasten the adjustment of the existing  volume of assets; and maximize comparative advantage by  furthering participation in international division of labor. The  end result would be to optimize resource allocation and steer  China onto the road of intensive operations, which is the way to  high-efficiency development. Third, introducing into China an  appropriate degree of foreign competition would also help  dismantle local barriers within the Chinese market, weaken local  protectionism, and advance the rationalization of the pattern of  regional distribution and the formation of a large nationwide,  unified market, greatly checking project overlapping, import  overlapping, and other unsound phenomena in economic  construction. Fourth, although basic changes in the mechanism  for forming and adjusting the industrial structure ultimately  depend on the creation of a new market economy, a gradual effort  to steer China's leading industries onto the road of open  development is also a necessary requirement for the creation of  a highly efficient mechanism for forming and adjusting the  industrial structure as well as an efficient way to remove  "existing structural pitfalls" in the near term. ("Existing  structural pitfalls" refers to the phenomenon in which the  structure of the existing volume of properties determines the  structure of any additional properties, making the industrial  structure even more irrational.) It can also further  comprehensive reform relating to the direction of the domestic  market.    China has now adopted a policy of speeding up the creation  of  a socialist market economy. A new round of reform centered on  public finance, banking, investment, and the management of  public properties will lead to major changes in China's resource  allocation mechanism. If import reform and the opening up of the  market can be coordinated with and integrated into the new round  of reform, we may possibly be able to eliminate the old  industrial structure formation and adjustment mechanism and  tentatively create a new one. If that should come to pass,  deep-seated structural contradictions that have long plagued the  national economy and their accompany problem of low  profitability will largely be solved. Economic cyclical  fluctuations, essentially a byproduct of those contradictions,  and the resulting enormous waste of resources, will also  correspondingly be held in check. When that happens, the  upgrading of China's industries and the enhancement of its  international competitiveness will be basically ensured. These  are the objectives to strive for as we optimize the import mix  and admit international competition into China in the 1990's.  First, increase the proportion of advanced technology and  equipment imports significantly to over 40 percent. Between 1978  and 1988 machinery and equipment imports accounted for 25.68  percent of all imports on the average. Corresponding figures for  1989 and 1990 were 30.8 percent and 33.0 percent, respectively,  far below the 40 percent recorded between 1950 and 1965. Second,  take measures consistent with GATT to check the importing of  luxury consumer goods properly. Also, take effective steps to  firmly prohibit imports through a variety of illicit channels,  particularly smuggling in all shapes and forms. Third, decontrol  importation in conjunction with import reform. Introduce into  China a proper measure of foreign competition. Create an open  resource allocation and industrial structure adjustment  mechanism in most of the maturing light industries and textile  industry and a few of the chemical and heavy industries. With  such a mechanism, these industries will more fully participate  in international division of labor and exchange in accordance  with the principle of comparative advantage, thereby becoming  the first in the nation to achieve the goal of  internationalization. Fourth, by regularizing import management  tools, we should gradually move toward the use of tariffs,  general exceptions, and security exceptions authorized under  GATT to regulate imports. A new import management system where  the national industrial policy guides importation is the basic  solution to the problems of duplicate importation and unplanned  importation and other irrationalities in the import mix and will  help reconcile competition with protection and hasten the  development of national industries. The idea is to create a  situation in which the import mix an industrial structure foster  each other with good results, bringing an early end to the low  standard of industrial organizations and the structural  inefficiency in the national economy.    To ensure the realization of the above objectives, we should  pay attention to the following as we go about regularizing the  import system and opening up the market:    First, accelerate import reform. Replace without delay the  existing import control measures which have not worked too well  with a new set of practices that are effective and consistent  with GATT rules. The technical adjustment of import control  methods should be completed before the conclusion of the  negotiations on China's accession to GATT, thus paving the way  for the resumption of China's membership in GATT and further  improving import management.    Second, regularize economic tools such as tariffs and  exchange rates. Lower the overall tariff level as appropriate to  coincide with negotiations on the resumption of China's  membership in GATT and the Uruguay round of talks. Moreover,  adjust the tariff system with despatch and gradually abolish all  sorts of illegal tariff waivers and cuts to set the stage for  the elevation of tariffs into the principal tool of import  regulation. Grasp the favorable opportunity to accelerate  exchange rate reform and foreign exchange reform so that the  current two tracks in the exchange system are merged into one as  soon as possible and a regularized managed floating rate system  is created.    Third, create a mechanism that uses the industrial policy to  guide importation. Under the new industrial policy, the  intelligent adjustment of the foreign trade structure (including  the import mix) has become a major objective. The key issue now  is organization and implementation. The industrial policy must  be coordinated with fiscal, financial, tax, investment, and  foreign exchange policies and carried all the way through so  that it truly guides the optimal allocation of resources and  ensures the rationalization of the import mix.    Fourth, immediately set up a security system to mitigate the  negative effects of opening up the market. China should waste no  time in creating an import security system in accordance with  the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy provisions of GATT and its  rules on dealing with a sharp increase in imports. To create  such a system, we need to draw up anti-dumping and anti-subsidy  regulations and safeguard provisions with despatch, set up a  special agency to implement them, and reform and improve related  social security policies at home. Only thus can we ensure a  smooth transition to the adjustment of the industrial structure  and reduce to a minimum the negative effects of opening up the  market.    Fifth, turning to the strategy of opening up the market, we  must take pains to organically combine China-initiated market  opening with negotiated market opening, incremental opening with  wholesale opening, and opening with protection. First open up  those industries that are already mature and are fairly  competitive internationally while giving fledgling industries a  transitional period. This is the only way to avoid the excessive  social costs that may be incurred when the market is opened  improperly and to ensure that some potential industries will not  be deprived of a chance to survive and develop because the  external impact has been too strong, even as we admit foreign  competition into China and effectively accelerate the upgrading  of the industries and the adjustment of the industrial structure.    It needs to be emphasized that it is an extremely complex  task to stimulate the adjustment of the industrial structure by  decontrolling importation as appropriate and introducing foreign  competition. There is a need to incorporate it into the overall  planning for reform, opening, and modernization in the interest  of design cohesiveness and push ahead with it in tandem with  others.    To sum up, the three strategic tasks central to the  intelligent adjustment of the foreign trade structure are one  major issue that must be tackled as part of the national  industrial policy and national economic development. They can be  realized over time only through the efforts of every sector  under the centralized direction of the state. In conjunction  with other comprehensive agencies concerned, agencies in charge  of foreign economic relations and trade should waste no time in  formulating a foreign trade policy for each particular industry  to serve as a basis for solving the major issue. Cooperating  actively with other departments, they should also aggressively  ensure the implementation of the national industrial policy,  particularly the foreign trade policy for each specific  industry, so that foreign trade develops faster and better and  contributes even more to modernization.</p>

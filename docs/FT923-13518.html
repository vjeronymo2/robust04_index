			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Observer: Starting up Georges Ghosn, the latest mogul to strut the French media stage, is a relatively unknown quantity even in France. He first popped up three years ago when he and his partners bought La Cote Desfosses, one of the bibles of the French stockmarket. Now he has acquired the loss-making La Tribune de l'Expansion, the country's second biggest financial daily. A 38-year-old Lebanese-born journalist, Ghosn came to Paris to study and soon afterwards began editing and publishing various newsletters specialising in Africa and the Arab world, for groups such as Kol-Al-Arab or Panarab Medias. For a while he published a newsletter in association with the Middle East Economic Digest. His latest move is his most ambitious to date. He plans to merge La Tribune with La Cote, which publishes all the stock market prices, and produce a full economic and financial daily. But making it financially viable will not be easy, as the demise of La Tribune has indicated. And it might be difficult to merge the conservative editorial style of La Cote with the more aggressive style of La Tribune.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Renewed rally lifts Brent crude above Dollars 21 a barrel NORTH SEA oil prices yesterday topped Dollars 21 a barrel for the first time in seven months, renewing the rally sparked by the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to leave output unchanged for the third quarter. Brent crude for July delivery gained 32 1/2 cents on the day to close at Dollars 21.12 1/2 , the highest price since November 18 last year. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said: 'We have covered most of the pent-up demand, and the market is tending higher. The price may have some way to go on the upside - it has moved faster and consolidated more quickly than I had expected.' He thought a price of Dollars 21.50 was possible in the short-term. Brent crude has gained about Dollars 1.50 since before the Opec meeting in Vienna two weeks ago, on belief that supply and demand in the third quarter should be well balanced. Saudi Arabia had widely signalled its intention before the meeting to press for a rise of 1m barrels a day in the output ceiling. However, the kingdom unexpectedly accepted a roll-over of the second quarter ceiling. Traders attributed yesterday's price rise to a fall in US oil stocks, and political nervousness sparked by an unconfirmed local newspaper report of a build-up of Saudi troops on the border with Yemen. The two countries have a long-running dispute over oil-rich land around the border. New York light crude prices were up 35 cents at Dollars 22.46 in morning trading. The key question affecting oil prices in the longer term is whether Saudi Arabia's behaviour at the Opec meeting marked a fundamental shift in policy towards supporting a higher price, or was motivated by short-term desires to improve relations with Iran and send a warning signal to the European Community and the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro about Opec's opposition to a carbon tax.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAILOUT BILL HAS SOUTHLAND S&amp;L REVISING ITS GAME PLAN  </P> <P> As part of its deal to buy ailing Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in late  December, the New York merchant banking firm of Castle Harlan Inc. had to chart  a business plan that satisfied federal regulators.  </P> <P> Today, Castle Harlan must rewrite Irvine-based Western Empire's recovery plan  to satisfy a new set of regulatory requirements.  </P> <P> Western Empire, with two branches in Orange County, is typical of hundreds of  savings and loan associations across the nation that must adjust to radical  changes mandated by the S&amp;L bailout legislation signed Wednesday by  President George Bush. They are healthy or recovering thrifts that worry that  some of the new provisions in the bill are onerous and, in some cases, renege  on promises that regulators made late last year as they hurried to peddle  dozens of insolvent S&amp;Ls.  </P> <P> "We were outside investors who came in with cold cash, and now they're changing  the rules on us," said Rob Wages, a Castle Harlan employee and Western Empire  director. "We're disappointed with the legislation. Certainly anyone who goes  forward with any bailout of an S&amp;L has to keep in mind that the government  can change the rules at any time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $6 Million in Goodwill  </P> <P> After posting losses for more than two years, Western Empire has started  recording profits in the past two months. A key element of Western Empire's  return to profitability is gains from trading in high-yield corporate  securities, often called junk bonds.  </P> <P> And nearly $6 million in previous losses were converted to goodwill, an  intangible asset that has no real value yet boosts capital, a thrift's final  protection from losses. Under the purchase agreement, regulators gave Western  Empire 20 years to write off that goodwill.  </P> <P> The new law, however, forbids S&amp;Ls from using federally insured deposits to  trade in junk bonds and gives institutions five years to liquidate their  portfolios of such bonds. It also sets up tough new capital standards and  requires that goodwill be eliminated from calculations of capital within five  years.  </P> <P> Junk bond trading "was a major part of our business plan," Wages said. And the  requirement to bolster capital while writing off goodwill creates "a very big  hit on earnings," he said.  </P> <P> Although frustrated by the rule changes, Castle Harlan is "committed" to the  S&amp;L and will revise its business plan to comply with the new law and to  provide the parent company with the returns it expects, Wages said.  </P> <P> Unlike many investors who bought thrifts in the waning days of 1988, Castle  Harlan did not receive financial assistance. It paid $15.8 million in cash for  Western Empire, and only $50,000 of that went to the former owners. The  remainder erased the S&amp;L's negative net worth and provided a cushion of  capital that allowed it to resume its growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact of Junk Bonds  </P> <P> But regulators did approve two important items in the deal -- the inclusion of  goodwill as part of the S&amp;L's assets and capital base and the ability to  start trading in junk bonds.  </P> <P> At the end of June, Western Empire had $121 million -- or 25% -- of its assets  in junk bonds, according to the S&amp;L's figures.  </P> <P> "A large part of our operation in terms of turning the S&amp;L around is based  on high-yield securities," Wages said. "We're going to have to take a look at  the impact of the law on our operations."  </P> <P> He termed the five-year phase-out period a "constructive" compromise and said  the S&amp;L would be able to comply.  </P> <P> One option allowed in the law, he said, is to create an affiliate that would be  sufficiently funded -- not with deposits -- to engage in junk bond trading. It  may be possible, for instance, to move the portfolio to the affiliate and  provide the S&amp;L with a promissory note to cover the deposits used to buy  the junk bonds, he said.  </P> <P> Creating an affiliate, though, could mean that the S&amp;L would cut back the  amount of assets it puts into mortgages.  </P> <P> "If the legislation forces thrifts into mortgages only, there will be a  dramatic reduction in assets in the industry because mortgages are not making  money for S&amp;Ls," he predicted. "A lot of thrifts will be put out of  business, and home owners will pay more for mortgages and get less for  deposits."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Higher Cost Seen  </P> <P> Castle Harlan has not decided how it will change its operations, he said.  </P> <P> "The total cost to everyone will be higher because the law is limiting an  S&amp;L's ability to invest in an area in which it has expertise to help  bootstrap itself out of trouble," Wages said.  </P> <P> Wages is not as concerned with the new requirement to raise the capital level.  </P> <P> Writing off $5.9 million in goodwill over five years instead of 20 means that  the S&amp;L must subtract $1.2 million a year -- or $295,000 a quarter -- from  its pretax earnings. That's a big bite from an institution that is only now  starting to post modest profits, he acknowledged.  </P> <P> Although it lost $1.1 million in the first six months of this year, the S&amp;L  recorded a modest profit in May and June totaling $55,000. At the same time  last year, Wages said, the S&amp;L was losing $500,000 a month.  </P> <P> At the end of June, Western Empire had $492 million in assets and its capital  exceeded the requirements spelled out in the new law. But if it needs more  capital in the future, Wages said, it should have little trouble raising  adequate cash from private sources.  </P> <P> As long as it can bring more cash into its capital base, goodwill won't be a  problem. The S&amp;L can still write it off over 20 years, Wages said; it just  cannot include goodwill in its calculation of capital for regulators after five  years. Its goodwill at the end of June was $5.7 million, or about 1% of its  assets, he said.  </P> <P> "At this point, if we were presented with the same deal to buy Western Empire,  we might not choose to do it," he said. "But we are committed to what we've  done and think there's enough flexibility in the new law to make it work."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WESTERN EMPIRE SAVINGS AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Western Empire, which opened in 1981 as Placentia Linda Savings &amp; Loan, was  acquired in 1988 by Castle Harlan Inc., an investment banking group from New  York. Western has headquarters in Irvine and another office in Yorba Linda.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="3" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended Dec. 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $133  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $120  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $124  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -$8.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -$3.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Regulatory capital  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> as % of assets  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.27  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.55  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.33  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Assets (1st qtr 1989): $245.8 million  </P> <P> Junk bonds (1st qtr 1989): $50 million  </P> <P> Number of employees: 55  </P> <P> Chief executive: Robert Margolis  </P> <P> Sources: Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Co. and Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco  </P></p>

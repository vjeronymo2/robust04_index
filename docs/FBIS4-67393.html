			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tapio Mainio: "Forest Research Institute: Heavy </F> Metal Emissions Into Environment Have Decreased; Volume of  Cadmium Reduced by One-Fourth"]    [Text] According to the Forest Research Institute (METLA),  less heavy metal than before is spreading into Finland's natural  environment. According to the METLA report, the amount of toxic  cadmium in moss samples has decreased by one-fourth over the  past five years.    Cadmium and nickel emissions into the air have decreased  because the fertilizer industry has changed its production  methods.    According to an earlier Environment Ministry study,  discharges into the ground increased during the late 1980's, but  emissions into the air and water decreased.    Cadmium is one of the most toxic elements. As an  environmental toxin, it accumulates in tissue, especially the  kidneys and liver, and it may cause serious intoxication. Not  all of cadmium's injurious effects are known.  <H5>  Most in Harjhavalta and Kokkola </H5>   According to the METLA study, high cadmium content was still  measured in the moss samples collected in Harjavalta and  Kokkola. There were also increased concentrations in the  environments of the biggest population centers in southern and  southwestern Finland.    METLA studied heavy metal discharges in moss. In the study  that was just completed, they compared the results obtained in  1985 with the moss samples collected in 1990. About 5,000  samples were collected from 3,009 different sites in Finland in  the selected test area.    "I'm particularly pleased with the drop in cadmium and lead  discharges since they spread easily to wide areas. For example,  cadmium reaches Finland as remote fallout from Central Europe,"  Assistant Professor Eero Kubin of METLA said.    Cadmium gets into the environment from the fertilizer  industry and from combustion gases produced by the burning of  waste, among other sources. There is also a certain amount of  cadmium in phosphate fertilizers and substances used for coating  products.    There was over 0.5 microgram of cadmium per gram of moss  sample in Kokkola and Harjavalta. Concentrations of as much as 2  micrograms per gram were found in moss in studies made in  Poland, Romania, and Hungary.    According to the foreign substance statute, there may be up  to 0.1-0.5 milligrams of cadmium per kilogram in foodstuffs.    "The order of magnitude is the same if the guideline figure  is compared with the results of the moss studies, although moss  is not eaten. It is, nevertheless, hard to say whether the  Kokkola or Harjavalta discharges are affecting people's health,"  METLA chemist Harri Lippo said.  <H5>  Study To Be Repeated Next Year </H5>   "We get a good picture of heavy metal emissions in Finland  and how they are changing with the aid of samples. Impurities in  the atmosphere like heavy metals reach the ground along with  rainwater. The metals accumulate in the tissues of the moss  since they get their nourishment from rainwater," Lippo said.    The extensive moss study will be repeated next year. The  study is part of an international follow-up study that was begun  as a joint Nordic effort in 1985.    From the results it is apparent that the volume of lead,  which is damaging to people and the environment, has decreased  by one-third over the past five years. The switch to unleaded  gasoline has done the most for reducing lead emissions.    The volume of vanadium in the environment has also decreased  since the oil refineries have abandoned the use of heavy fuel  oil and switched to natural gas.    Chromium, copper, iron, and zinc concentrations have  remained  at the same levels or increased slightly. Tornio's large  chromium emissions have, however, decreased since the Outokumpu  steel mill improved its cleaning equipment. Chromium is known to  cause allergies.</p>

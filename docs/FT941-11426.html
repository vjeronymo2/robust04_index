			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Political Notebook: Not such a special relationship after all It is not, as some have claimed, the worst breach in UK/US relations since Suez. Far from it. But nor is it the minor squall claimed by 10 Downing Street. The decision by President Bill Clinton to offer Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein a public relations coup in New York was remarkable not so much in terms of any new damage inflicted on UK/US relations. Seen through the focus of Whitehall, its real significance lay in what it revealed about the state that relationship had already reached. It is not an encouraging picture. But first the hyperbole - with headlines declaring an end to 'the special relationship' - should be cleared away. The wide-ranging identity of interests which has long provided the foundation for close ties between London and Washington has never guaranteed a trouble-free friendship. A flick through Baroness Thatcher's account of her days in Downing Street provides ample evidence that even her famous partnership with President Ronald Reagan had its ups and downs. The row over the US invasion of Grenada is an obvious example. As one senior minister put it yesterday, even happily married couples occasionally fall out. Both sides were clearly anxious this week to isolate the latest disagreement from the broader relationship. The White House put out what the New York Times described as a lengthy and conciliatory statement emphasising 'the importance that the US attaches to close co-operation with our British ally on a range of global issues'. For its part the Downing Street press office, now run by Mr Chris Meyer, the former second in command at the UK's Washington embassy, was insistent that the relationship was alive, well and vigorous. In the narrow terms of the Irish problem there was also a suggestion that if Mr Adams had done well this week, the trip might do some good in the longer term. The Sinn Fein leader offered no concessions to his hosts in terms of peace. President Clinton has dropped his campaign pledge to send a peace envoy to Northern Ireland. The White House cannot accept the Downing Street view which denies any other government outside the British Isles a legitimate interest in the conflict. But British officials are hopeful that as long as the London and Dublin governments stick together in their approach to peace Mr Clinton will think twice before granting Mr Adams another visa. Scratch beneath the surface though and it does not take long to discover real unease about the transatlantic relationship. There is the concern that Mr Clinton is still surrounded by aides who want to downgrade Britain's status. Resentments still burn against the Home Office investigation into Mr Clinton's spell in Oxford in the 1960s and Tory party help for the Republicans during the US election campaign. Mr Major, received warmly during his visit to Washington a year ago, has since been denied the ready access to the president that he could take for granted from Mr George Bush. There is a distinct absence of personal chemistry. At last month's Nato summit France and Germany were the focus of US attention - with President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl the centre of attention. Last year's transatlantic dispute over the west's approach to Bosnia did not help - nor, in the view of some Whitehall officials, does the Euro-sceptic rhetoric that Mr Major adopts to appease the right of the Conservative party. The weight Washington attaches to British views is in direct proportion to the role London plays in the European Union. That link between influence in Brussels and in Washington is likely to strengthen rather than weaken as the US reduces its commitments in Europe. In the old days of the cold war the US needed an ally whose reflex was almost always to support Washington's stance. In a world where the communist bloc no longer exists and Russia poses a much reduced threat, that imperative is no longer quite so powerful. The argument can be overstated. For all its relative decline, Britain still holds an important place as a reliable ally. The State Department and the Foreign Office have the sort of easy relationship that comes with the habit of agreeing. The odds are that when Mr Major visits the White House at the end of this month he will get a enthusiastic welcome. But the world has changed. Ironically, former presidents Reagan and Bush and the now Lady Thatcher were reunited in Washington last night for a gala birthday party. You could almost hear them tut-tutting.</p>

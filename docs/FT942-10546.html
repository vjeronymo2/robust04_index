			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: N Brown rises 18% but cautious on recovery N Brown, the Manchester-based direct mail-order group which specialises in clothing for older women, yesterday reported an 18 per cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits. For the 52 weeks to February 26 profits were Pounds 22.5m, against Pounds 19m, on turnover ahead 9.3 per cent to Pounds 186.8m (Pounds 170.8m). Earnings per share were 17 per cent higher at 20.83p (17.74p), and a final dividend of 5.75p makes a total of 8p (7p). The company also announced plans for a 1-for-1 bonus share issue to improve the shares' liquidity. The shares closed up 2p at 477p. Sir David Alliance, chairman, said the current financial year had started well but he remained cautious about the rate of general economic recovery and its impact on the business. The profit improvement reflected sales gains by the core home-shopping business and a turnround in the financial and property services operations. Overall operating profits grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 24.7m (Pounds 22.1m). The home-shopping business increased its contribution by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 24.5m (Pounds 22.6m) on sales up 9.4 per cent to Pounds 179.8m (Pounds 164.3m.) Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said the sales increase reflected a 2 per cent gain in the total number of customers and a 7 per cent increase in their average spending. The group's long-established catalogues for older women accounted for 77 per cent of group turnover, while Fashion World and Candid, both introduced four years ago and targeted at the growing number of consumers in the 35-50 age range, increased their turnover by more than 40 per cent. Financial and property services reported a Pounds 427,000 operating profit, compared with a Pounds 273,000 loss on turnover up 7 per cent to Pounds 7.05m (Pounds 6.59m). The pre-tax figure was also helped by a sharp decline in interest costs to Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 3.3m) reflecting lower interest rates and reduced borrowings. Year-end gearing fell from 37 per cent to 28 per cent. COMMENT Despite the chairman's cautious remarks Brown's results were at the top end of analysts' forecasts and the core mail-order business continues to perform well by emphasising product range, value and customer service. The group claims 23.1 per cent of the Pounds 836m a year direct home-shopping market, and ranks sixth in the combined Pounds 4.4bn agency and direct home-shopping market, leaving plenty of room for domestic organic growth. Demographics are working in the group's favour and this, coupled with the introduction of new catalogues aimed at a slightly younger customer, should keep sales moving ahead. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 25.25m look possible producing earnings of about 23.4p. The stock's 20.4 prospective multiple looks high, but it is deserved.</p>

I'm sure it is something like ``Snow,  rice, sake, and far from Tokyo.'' But it's necessary to revise  this image a bit. As for rice, koshihikari is the famous brand,  the charming but dry Niigata Seishu is the popular choice in  sake and in terms of supplying it, Niigata boasts being third in  Japan As for snow, it abounds in the ski resort areas on the  borders of the prefecture, but in recent years it hardly has  accumulated at all in Niigata City or other areas along the Sea  of Japan. The distance in time from Tokyo is now only one hour  and forty minutes on the rapid Asahi that runs on the Joetsu  Shinkansen Line. If you leave Niigata at 8 AM, you can make a  meeting in Tokyo that starts at ten o'clock.    One might think that Niigata is primarily an area for  farming  and tourism, but actually it is the largest industrial region on  the Sea of Japan. Since long ago, Niigata has been blessed with  ``snow, and then the water from its melting,'' forming a  productive region that is provided with local industries that  supply the needs for food, clothing and shelter.    The famous products and industries in Niigata include  traditional Japanese clothing, which developed as a secondary  winter industry for farmers in Tookamachi, Ojiya, and Shiozawa,  synthetic fibers and knits in Gosen, Mitsuke, and Tochio.  Tsubame and Sanjo, which originally produced Japanese-style  nails, now after several transitions, form a base for processing  metals in all fields. They are also famous for sake grown from  rice and water, and Kamo is noted for its wardrobes made of  pauwlonia wood.    In addition to these, since the beginning of the Meiji  period, Niigata has produced ``burning water,'' i.e. petroleum,  which fostered the development of a drilling machine industry,  ultimately becoming the foundation for the machine manufacturing  and metals processing industries centered around Nagaoka. These  enterprises, which have become firmly established as locally  based industries, play a major role in industrial development in  the prefecture.    Challenges for Niigata Industry    Judging from the most recent trends in Niigata industry,  there has been steady growth, but it is also true that the tempo  has become somewhat lax. Niigata's ranking among the prefectures  in delivery of products has dropped from 19th place in this  decade to 23rd. Regarding the structure of industry here, there  has been progress in establishing new businesses concomitant  with the development of high speed transportation systems. While  the processing and assembly industries, beginning with  electronic and electrical machinery have become leading  industries, they comprise only 35 percent, which is nine points  lower than the national average. 99.6 percent of the more than  20,000 manufacturing businesses in the prefecture are small  businesses, many of which are subcontractors, so that the value  added productivity is only two thirds of the national average.    Consequently, an urgent challenge is to increase the added  value of Niigata's industries, but in order to achieve this, it  is first essential to aim at facilitating local development by  improving the technological strength and planning ability of the  local industries that are diverse in nature and form a solid  base in the prefecture.    It is also desirable for the prefecture to promote  aggressively the attraction of new businesses, such as those in  leading edge technology and information fields and those which  possess R&amp;D capability, in order to bring about a change in  the  structure of industry and to strengthen cooperation between  incoming businesses and businesses already existing in the  prefecture.    It is desirable for the prefecture to take full advantage of  the high speed transportation systems now in place, to aim for  full activation of its potential by increasing the connectivity  among businesses and industries. In order to achieve such  objectives, it is currently developing and promoting the  measures described below.    Towards Improvement of Technology in Corporations in the  Prefecture First of all, the Shinano Technopolis, centered in  Nagaoka city, has been achieving substantial results. Last  April, a plan was adopted for the second quarter, whose  conceptual basis is the ``establishment of a consortium of  cities for exchange of industrial technology which will become  the leader in the Age of the Japan Sea Rim.'' The consortium has  benefited from the arrival of new businesses and the development  of corporations, and takes pride in having achieved the highest  level among all technopolises in Japan in terms of the number of  new sites established for business and the number of securities  issued.    Within the rim area, the Laser Application Engineering  Center  has been set up as one facet of a project to provide a national  research base, and the prefecture has positioned laser  processing as a major technology that will have great ripple  effect on local industries. In promoting the center, it is  working towards the dissemination of technology to local  businesses.    Nagaoka City has been designated as a regional focal point,  but it is also promoting the Office Arcadia Concept and  anticipates the establishment of research institutes, training  institutions and information-related businesses there.    Secondly, an industrial engineering center and under it six  research institutes, set up by region and type of industry are  conducting actual R&amp;D and business leadership, playing a  major  role in improving the technology of local production industries.    Concomitant with the changes in environment related to  economic and technological developments, the need is increasing  for strengthening collaboration between industry, academia, and  government in R&amp;D, development of human resources, and  technology exchange, and for promoting R&amp;D in the fields of  technology that will form the base for progress in the  prefecture in the 21st century. A ``technotank'' concept ,which  is supposed to materialize this year, has been formulated in  order to realize this effectively.    For this reason, this year they are slated to formulate a  basic plan by surveying the (current) status of the laboratory  and research infrastructure, and conducting a needs analysis for  technology development in the prefecture. Third, with the  objective of incorporating a design viewpoint into commercial  product production and business management, the Niigata  Prefecture Life and Culture Creative Industry Foundation  (commonly called the IDS Corporation) is active. Every February,  Niigata sponsors an IDS design competition in order to determine  the possibilities for the NEXT products from Niigata. It  receives many entries from local industries. The outstanding  participants receive guidance from specialists ( The Open  Laboratory) on developing their entries into products.    Fourth, implementation of measures for local small  industries  is a crucial task. The ``Law to Vitalize the Concentration of  Local Small Businesses'' that was implemented last year is  considered very effective for promoting the development of new  fields of local industry in the prefecture. Those areas  attempting the development of new fields are working on the  gradual implementation of activation plans. Progress is also  being made in establishing facilities for activation of local  small businesses via local industry promotion centers in two  locations, and the Sanjo branch of the College of Small Business.    Fifth, in order to accelerate the location of businesses  here, the prefecture is promoting prefecture-managed large scale  industrial zones in three locations, and core industrial zones  for public corporations for encouraging regional development. In  order to increase opportunities for interchange between newly  established and local businesses and strengthen cooperation  between them, the prefecture has established the ``Niigata Link  Project'' effective this fiscal year.    Extending The Basis for the Japan Sea Rim Exchange Sphere    We expect the Age of the Japan Sea Rim to arrive with the  21st century, which is just around the corner. Exchanges with  countries bordering the shore of the Japan Sea will become  increasingly active and the role played by areas along the Japan  Sea are expected to grow in importance. By establishing the  position of the prefecture as the gateway to the Japan Sea, and  at the same time strengthening collaborative and cooperative  relationships with neighboring prefectures, it is promoting the  ``Japan Sea Kan'etsu Belt Zone Development Plan'' as the central  strategic task of the prefecture. This will even further  heighten the centrality of the prefecture as a node which ties  it to the Kanto region via a high-speed transportation system.    Niigata has been the only city to be connected to the  Russian  Far East directly by air route, but as of this April, regular  air service with Vladivostok has been established. The runway at  the Niigata Airport is currently being extended to 2500 m, and  plans are under way to further expand it to 3000 m and to  improve access to the airport including direct access to the JR  Line.    Since 1989, an annual Japan Sea Rim International Forum has  been held. It will establish a Japan Sea Rim Economic Research  Institute as a think tank to play a central role in generating  information about Japan Sea Rim exchanges and in conducting  survey research. Also, in order to promote economic exchanges, a  basic plan aimed at introducing FAZ this fiscal year, and a  survey designed to activate and make efficient the exchange of  products within the prefecture, is being conducted.    We want to construct a Niigata Prefecture that plays a vital  role, by working collaboratively to create a base for exchange  throughout the Japan Sea Rim area, and by producing high added  value to the industries described above.</p>

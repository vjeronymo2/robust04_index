			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine Elf's warning that half-year group operating profits will fall 20 per cent highlights how tough it is for corporate France to claw its way out of recession. Continuing weak demand in France and Germany, combined with the depressed crude oil price in recent times, is hampering Elf's self-improvement plans. Elf's heavy exposure to upstream activities increases its vulnerability. Such slow progress may disappoint those investors who bought into Elf at the time of its much-hyped privatisation in February. Elf was then sold to the market as a BP-style recovery stock. US investors, in particular, were attracted to its vast asset base, cash flow profile and yield. Elf is still pursuing the right course in cutting costs, preserving cash and aiming to realise FFr5bn from asset sales. Yet the weakness of the oil price and strict French employment laws mean it will take longer to realise the benefits than most had previously assumed. Elf's warning also strikes an ominous note for the rest of the French bourse, which has already fared worse than most other European markets this year. Corporate and consumer confidence remains fragile as the all-important 10-year OAT bond yield has jumped by 2 percentage points this year. High bond yields may deter investment and forestall the fall in the savings ratio. The French government will find it hard to press ahead with further privatisations against such a background. At least it has already got a good slug of stock away this year.</p>

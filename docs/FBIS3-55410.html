Duties on imported goods may serve several purposes. First  of all, there is basic protectionism, that is, the protection of  domestic manufacturers against competition from foreign  companies. Second, the fiscal aim, or the strengthening of the  income part of the state budget. Third, by regulating the flow  of commodities into the country, you can strengthen its balance  of payments and the national currency rate. Some people in  Russia believe that high tariffs can be used to protect  consumers' interests within the country.    First of all, something about protectionism. The main rule  is that you cannot simultaneously protect all sectors by means  of tariffs (this can be achieved only by completely closing the  borders, with entirely predictable consequences). You can only  protect individual, relatively small industries. Let us suppose  that a decision is adopted to raise tariffs on the import of  automobiles, automobile spare parts, and machine tools. Does  the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant gain something? Can it  successfully compete even on the domestic market against  imported output? The answer is by no means obvious. The price  of imported automobiles will go up to some extent. This will be  followed by the price of domestic automobiles, but the plant's  profit as a whole may fall because of the simultaneous increase  in the cost of production connected with the acquisition of more  expensive equipment and spare parts. You can draw one  conclusion from this simple example: Which of the enterprises  are protected is unknown, but on the other hand, it is clear who  has lost -- all the country's automobile manufacturers.    The introduction of duties on machines and equipment may  have  even more serious consequences (particularly loud appeals are  being made by lobbyists to introduce such duties). A high  tariff will be an obstacle to importing state-of-the-art  equipment, and Russian manufacturers will be forced to use old  and obsolescent machines. This will make all potential exporters  uncompetitive, because they will be working with old equipment.    The second rule is that, if raised duties of a protectionist  nature are implemented, then this should only be on consumer  goods.    Now something about the fiscal role of duties on imports.  Despite popular opinion, the overwhelming majority of budget  income from this type of tax depends not only on the rate of the  tax itself but also on how easy it is to collect. Furthermore,  importers seek and often find a possibility of completely  avoiding or significantly reducing payments. The idea of  re-grading, as old as the whole command system itself, is in  operation here: One commodity is imported, but another is  declared, and it is not the state treasury that gains, but  individual interested parties.    Hopes that higher import tariffs may have a favorable effect  on the balance of payments and the rate of exchange are also  illusory. In theory, the demand for foreign currency will most  likely fall, which may help maintain a stable exchange rate.  But stabilizing the exchange rate by reducing imports is using  the worst of all the possible methods. First of all, an  increase in exports could have a far more significant favorable  effect on the exchange rate and its stabilization (the abolition  of export quotas in 1994 would make it possible to increase  exports by $18 billion). And second, successful macroeconomic  stabilization would ensure a stable rate of exchange in the long  term. But after all, the exchange rate is not an end in itself.  And although the historical experience of countries which have  suffered high inflation and hyperinflation shows graphically  that the stabilization of the currency rate was always a  constituent element of a successful policy of curbing inflation,  the experience of summer 1993 testifies that the stability of  the ruble against the dollar has not led to a reduction in  internal inflation or an improvement in any other macroeconomic  indicators.    In conclusion, the thesis about the protection of the  Russian consumers' interests. You have to start with the fact  that the actual approach is wrong in principle. The rights of  the consumer may best be protected by a system of no import  duties.    In 1990 the Polish peasants, who are a powerful and  well-organized force in the country, demanded that the  government maintain high duties on the import of milk and dairy  products. More or less in the same way as Russian manufacturers  are now complaining that Russia will suffer from lower tariffs,  they stated that the unrestricted import of milk into Poland  would lead to a significant reduction in agricultural production  and increase unemployment. The reformers' government stood firm  and refused to compromise. The beginning of open competition  against foreign milk was a really difficult time for the Polish  farmers, as Polish milk was literally going sour after a few  days, whereas European milk could keep for far longer. But in  the end they were able to significantly improve the quality and  saleability of the product, and they were victorious. West  Europe is now being forced to protect itself against Polish  dairy expansion. It is obvious who was the winner in this story  -- the Polish consumers, who received good-quality milk, and the  Polish producers, trading with Europe.    Russia differs from Poland in that here it is not only the  peasants who are well organized. Russia has the most effective  system in the world for lobbying decisions being adopted by the  government. Enterprises relate to industrial ministries, and  their interests are protected in the government by the  ministers. Only the poor consumer is left unprotected. If the  government is led by the industrial ministries and raises the  rates on imported output, the Russian consumer will continue to  drive automobiles which are eternally lagging behind Western  models, work using outdated equipment, and drink sour milk.</p>

Border trade  with Vietnam and Laos was suspended for some time last year due  to relations between the countries. "Since trade ties between  them resumed, the countries' governments -- both at central and  local levels -- are meeting more frequently on border trade  policy," said Fan Xiliang, chief of the comprehensive division  of Yunnan Provincial Economic Relations and Trade for  Neighbouring Countries Administrative Bureau. "Therefore, the  outlook for border trade is good," he added.    China's southwestern Yunnan province has a 4,000-kilometre  boundary with Burma, Laos and Vietnam. It takes care of the  mainland's border trade with those countries. "Trade with all  three countries is rising. But as our trade with Burma already  has a higher volume, Vietnam and Laos are likely to grow faster  in the future," Mr Fan said. More than 80 per cent of Yunnan's  border trade was with Burma, he said, with Vietnam accounting  for about 10 per cent and Laos the rest. "China has had good  links with Burma for ages. The traffic and communication  systems between the two countries are better developed. That's  why their border trade volume is so high," he said.    Yunnan's border trade stood at 2.27 billion yuan (about HK$2  billion) in 1992, up 38.4 per cent on the 1.64 million yuan in  1991. Imports and exports were balanced. Border trade is  conducted in yuan, as opposed to foreign trade where  transactions are made in foreign currencies.    The mainland has been conducting border trade with the three  countries since before the establishment of the People's  Republic. "Since the country adopted its open economy policy,  great attention has been paid to border trade, which is  supported and agreed on by the Government," Mr Fan said.    Lower tariffs are charged on imports through border trade  from the three countries, while some cities on the Chinese  border enjoy some of the benefits granted to coastal cities.  "We help encourage people to trade higher-end goods. We are  also working to crack down on both the import and export of  imitation products," Mr Fan said. Participants in border trade  are state, collective and private enterprises, including  hawkers. Approvals from the relevant authorities are needed for  conducting border trade.</p>

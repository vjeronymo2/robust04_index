			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with French European Affairs Minister </F> Alain Lamassoure by correspondent Albert du Roy; from the "Hour  of Truth" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Du Roy] Mr. Lamassoure, I am  afraid that you might find my question unpleasant rather than  intelligent. I would like to speak on the theme of the Iranians  [deported to Iran by France]. You said that this was a matter  of national interest. National interest is not far from reason  of state, and the experience we have of this around the world  and in history shows that reason of state is rarely legitimate.  My question is: On such an affair, how long can one carry on  without giving a substantial explanation?    [Lamassoure] We shall see how things turn out. Where the  fight against international terrorism is concerned, there are  times when it is preferable to keep silent. Believe me, Albert  du Roy, everyone will understand.    [du Roy] So this is a matter of international terrorism.  Please reassure us that it has nothing to do with economic  interests.    [Lamassoure] No, absolutely not. It is matter of national  interest.    [du Roy] A last very simple question on this subject: I  suppose that The Interior Minister Pasqua is happy with the  Government's decision?    [Lamassoure] The decision was made by the relevant  authorities. Each played his role within the framework of the  institutions of the Fifth Republic.    [du Roy] So we are no longer trying to terrorize the  terrorists?    [Lamassoure] We are fighting against terrorism  energetically.    [du Roy] Another theme I would like to speak about is  Russia.  [passage omitted] In the program of Mr. Zhirinovsky, who has  emerged as the great winner of the Russian elections, there are  elements which are clearly imperialistic, even warlike, and  there are racist elements. If democracy were to bring him to  power, would French aid continue?    [Lamassoure] Two things: First, Mr. Zhirinovsky is not the  great winner of the last Russian elections. [passage omitted]  Second, it is quite clear that we cannot tolerate the kind of  comments that Mr. Zhirinovsky has been making.    [du Roy] What if he asks to come to France?    [Lamassoure] If he continues to make these kind of comments,  I do not see how we could welcome him in France. In particular,  the kind of comments he made about Bulgaria, about President  Zhelev, which are offensive, about the Romanian people, about  the Baltic states, Finland, Turkey, and other countries, are  totally unacceptable. I would like to tell the representatives  of Romania, of Bulgaria, and of the Baltic states that we  consider their security as our security, and that we will be  very careful to ensure that these countries may enjoy the same  security guarantees as do all the other countries of Europe.    [du Roy] One last question on this: Should those countries  of  eastern Europe who so wish be allowed into NATO?    [Lamassoure] I do not think that this would be a good  solution. The Atlantic Alliance was set up during the cold war  to protect us against the Soviet threat and the Warsaw Pact.  The Soviet threat no longer exists, the Warsaw Pact no longer  exists. The Atlantic Alliance remains. We still need it. We  can understand the security concerns of some countries of  central and eastern Europe, but an alliance has to face a threat  or an enemy. If you were to extend it to half of them, to  central Europe but not to Eastern Europe, then those who are  excluded will, at best, feel that we are not interested in their  security, and at worse that we consider them enemies. If we  were to extend it to the whole of central and eastern Europe,  but not to Russia, then imagine the reaction in Moscow, whoever  is in power in Moscow. Also, if we open it up to Russia as far  as Vladivostok, then it is no longer an alliance but a security  system.    What we are saying in France is that what Europe needs is  not  an extension of the Atlantic Alliance but a security system in  which alliances have their role to play. There will be a NATO  summit on 10 January. The Americans have proposed to these  countries what they call a partnership for peace. Let us give  particular importance to this partnership for peace. What we  are suggesting -- what we call the Balladur initiative, the  proposal for a conference on stability made by Mr. Balladur and  accepted by the 12 -- is that all the countries in central and  eastern Europe who have minority problems, cross-border minority  problems, who are concerned, should gather around a table to  find specific solutions to these problems. The day they find  those solutions, then we will give a European and international  guarantee to the solutions they themselves have found. [passage  omitted]</p>

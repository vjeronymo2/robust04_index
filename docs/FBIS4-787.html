			<p>BFN     [Text] A new party has been created called the Action Front  for Renewal and Development-Alafia [Front d'Action pour le  Renouveau et le Developpement-Alafia, FARD-Alafia]. Its  constituent assembly was held in Parakou on 2 and 3 April.  During the deliberations, the party's activists from the  country's six regions studied and adopted the basic documents of  the party. They also analyzed the political, economic, and  social situation on the national and international levels.    According to its communique, the FARD-Alafia is determined  to  go beyond its ambition of just creating a microparty. It will  contribute to the creation of viable macroparties to rally and  organize Beninese citizens in the respect of the Constitution  and the laws of the Republic. The FARD-Alafia activists are  determined to engage in common thoughts and actions to fulfill  the tasks of nation building and the advent of a new Benin, full  of hope, the communique further stated. It concluded that the  FARD-Alafia is a national party that will bring the sons of  Benin together and make them join hands to face all challenges,  especially that of the devaluation of the CFA franc, and other  national problems.    The FARD-Alafia is composed of a 21-member executive bureau  including its general secretary, Dr. (Salif Aka). The new party  is at the forefront of the political scene with five deputies at  the National Assembly.</p>

"The Vietnamese government is cooperating with us on issues such as  emigration and the repatriation of the remains of U.S. servicemen."  </P> <P> The United States still does not recognize the Hanoi regime, however, and the  official said there has been no proposal to provide U.S. government aid to  Vietnam.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Pei Jianfeng: "Machinery Industry Gears </F> Up"]    [Text] China will build the machinery industry into one of  the pillars of the national economy, the minister of the  Machinery Industry said yesterday.    Making his remarks at the opening of the industry's national  conference, He Guangyuan said the industry will keep growing at  a rate of 13 to 14 percent annually through the end of the  century.    By 2010, he said, the machinery industry will account for a  third of the nation's industrial output value .    Basic machinery and their components, power generators and  automobiles will be the industry's priorities, he added.    According to the latest statistics, the machinery industry's  output value was 364.5 billion yuan ($41.9 billion) last year, a  24.6 percent increase over the previous year.    Profits and taxes jumped 30 percent to reach 32.5 billion  yuan ($3.7 billion) and exports of machinery products exceeded  $14 billion last year.    The industry produced 1.28 million automobiles last year,  including 234,000 sedans, representing an increase of 20 percent  and 44 percent respectively over 1992.    The minister said this year's investment, financial and tax  reforms will present the industry with new opportunities and  challenges.    The establishment of the national import and export bank, he  said, will increase machinery exports, particularly complete  equipment.    However, the money shortage will continue to be tight as  more  enterprises resort to commercial loans for technical renovations.    The new taxation system will make enterprises compete on an  equal footing.    The unification of the dual-track foreign exchange system  will help expand exports but make imports more expensive, he  said.    And the country's auto assembling factories that depend on  imported parts will face higher costs because of the devaluation  of renmenbi.    Economists predict that the machinery industry will grow 12  to 15 percent this year.    The planned auto output is 1.4 million this year, including  340,000 sedans.    Continued rapid growth in fixed assets investment this year  will be the driving force of the industry.    But inadequate transport and the shortage of capital, energy  and raw materials will still pose problems.    He said the ministry will adopt bolder corporate reforms  this  year to push enterprises to the market.    More companies will be restructured into shareholding ones  and be listed at domestic and overseas securities exchanges.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, 4 May (AFP) -- UN special representative  for Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has had "informal contacts"  over the past 24 hours in Arusha, Tanzania, with the warring  Rwanda parties but no actual negotiations have taken place, UN  officials said Wednesday [4 May]. "There have been many  informal contacts with the two delegations, with Tanzanian  authorities and different ambassadors who came to Arusha", said  in Tanzania Moctar Gueye, spokesman for the United Nations  Mission for Assistance to Rwanda (MINUAR).    Booh-Booh is to travel Wednesday to Kampala to meet Ugandan  President Yoweri Museveni, and return the same day to Arusha,  Gueye said. The interim Rwandan Government accuses Uganda of  aiding the Rwandan Tutsi rebels, the Rwandan Patriotic Front.    Gueye said the United Nations remained "optimistic" there  might be a formal meeting of the delegations (FPR). [sentence  as received]    The Rwandan Government delegation is led by Transport  Minister Andre Ntagerura while the rebels, who are mainly Tutsi,  are led by a member of the Hutu ethnic group, Alexis  Kanyarengwe. The rebels have refused to meet with the  government, which they do not recognize. Jacques Bihozagara,  the rebels' foreign affairs representative, reiterated this  stand Tuesday saying that a ceasefire "would protect the  killers."</p>

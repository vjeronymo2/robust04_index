			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / French president and his party drift apart: Relations between Mitterrand and the Socialists have sunk to a new low RELATIONS between Mr Francois Mitterrand and France's governing Socialist party have sunk to an all-time low in the past few weeks as the president prepares for life after the Socialist administration. Both sides have increasingly distanced themselves from each other on a whole range of issues, ever since the traumatically close referendum on European union in September, called by Mr Mitterrand against the advice of several senior Socialists. What are they up to? Mr Mitterrand is seen by the French press as trying to bolster his personal power to make life difficult for the conservatives, who are on course for a landslide victory in the legislative elections on March 21 and 28. The Socialists, meanwhile, are said to be resigned to growing apart from an ailing and unpopular president, who might not last the course until the end of his mandate in spring 1995. While nobody in France is as clever as Mr Mitterrand in dividing the right-wing opposition, politicians on both sides suspect he is equally keen on tripping up his own party. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR conservative party, dubbed Mr Mitterrand as 'the inventor of permanent civil war as a method of government,' in a recent newspaper interview. Other critics believe Mr Mitterrand wants to snub both sides of French politics at once to reflect voters' general dissatisfaction with the political class, a tactic reminiscent of General de Gaulle's attempts to strike an intimate relationship with the electorate over the head of parliament. The latest and most dramatic sign of the split between Mr Mitterrand and his troops came with his recent call for a parliamentary high court inquiry into former Socialist ministers' part in a scandal over the distribution of blood infected with the HIV virus. If the case gets through its complex administrative process, which it easily could, the chief defendant some time early next year would be none other than Mr Laurent Fabius, the party first secretary, until recently regarded as the president's chosen dauphin. The noose tightened yesterday when the standing committee of the senate, the upper house of parliament, approved manslaughter and fraud charges - the first step to a trial - against Mr Fabius and two other former Socialist ministers, Mrs Georgina Dufoix and Mr Edmond Herve. All three deny the charges and say they look forward to this chance to clear their names against what they say is a political campaign by the conservative-dominated senate. They have the clear support of all senior Socialists except for Mr Mitterrand, who has said non-committally that the constitution must do its work. Asked on television whether he felt betrayed, Mr Fabius said he would rather keep his thoughts to himself. A leading Fabius supporter, Senator Daniel Percheron, was more blunt. 'Mitterrand has led us to understand that we are alone and responsible for ourselves,' he said. The blood scandal is only the most dramatic of a series of clashes between the president and his party. Other examples include Socialist MPs' recent refusal to accept Mr Mitterrand's plans to ban business donations to political parties, and the president's encouragement of Generation Ecologie, led by a former environment minister in the Socialist government, which two weeks ago turned its back on the Socialists by forming an electoral pact with France's other main ecology party, the Verts. Mr Mitterrand, meanwhile, enraged his party on Armistice Day by sending a wreath to the grave of Marshal Philippe Petain, reviled by many French people for collaborating with Germany as leader of the Vichy regime during the second world war. The president has discreetly done this every Armistice Day for the past seven years without attracting a row, as a gesture likely to appeal to a minority of older right-wing voters who remember Petain as a hero of the first world war. But this time the Socialist party was not prepared to turn a blind eye to what Mr Henri Emmanuelli, speaker of the parliament, condemned as an 'incomprehensible' gesture. However, Mr Mitterrand rarely acts without a clear motive, even if he is the only one to understand it at the time.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE UNIT ENDS CHENEY HEARINGS, SCHEDULES APPROVAL VOTE THURSDAY  </P> <P> The Senate Armed Services Committee today wound up hearings on Defense  Secretary-designate Dick Cheney and scheduled an expected approval vote on his  nomination for Thursday morning.  </P> <P> "I think Dick Cheney is very well qualified to be secretary of defense and I  plan to support him," Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said of Cheney, named  by President Bush to replace John Tower after the Senate rejected Tower last  week. Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.) said they hope for full Senate  approval of Cheney on Friday, before the Senate begins a two-week Easter  recess.  </P> <P> Nunn, who led the Senate fight against Tower amid allegations of drinking and  womanizing by the former Texas senator, said the committee -- which voted 11 to  9 against Tower -- will vote on Cheney the first thing Thursday. "I don't know  of any opposition to him," Nunn said.  </P></p>

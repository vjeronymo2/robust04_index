			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's new taxation  system, started at the beginning of this year, has maintained  all the preferential policies for foreign investors and is  creating a more fair and favorable taxation environment for them.    This was the statement made by Dong Shukui, a senior  official  with the State Administration of Taxation, at the 11th  China-Australia Senior Executive Forum held here today.    The leading official in charge of China's overseas-related  taxation told reporters that since the carrying out of the new  taxation system, the total tax burden of foreign-funded  enterprises has decreased to some degrees, compared with the old  taxation system.    According to him, foreign-funded enterprises are no longer  paying higher taxes than domestic enterprises on 94 items, due  to the adoption of unified value-added taxes, consumption taxes  and business taxes for both foreign and domestic enterprises.    Dong told the Australian entrepreneurs that there are now 11  kinds of taxes that are applicable to foreign-funded enterprises  and foreign nationals according to the new taxation system,  among which, duplication under the old industrial and commercial  consolidated tax has been removed by introducing value-added  taxes.    He explained that the value-added taxes will only be charged  on added value derived from production processes. Higher or  lower tax rates are related only to the added value, but not to  the number of enterprises involved, which is believed to favor  foreign-funded enterprises in developing coordinated and  socialized production.    The official added that all the preferential policies on  foreign-funded enterprises' income taxes will be continued.    According to the new system, productive foreign-funded  enterprises established in special economic zones and economic  and technical development zones, shall pay business income taxes  at a reduced tax rate of 15 percent.    Meanwhile, productive foreign-funded enterprises located in  coastal economic open areas and open cities shall pay business  taxes at a reduced tax rate of 24 percent.    Productive foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from  business income taxes in the first two profit-making years and  pay half the business income taxes in the next three years.    The official told reporters that the foreign-funded  enterprises will also continue to enjoy preferential treatment  on turnover taxes.    Under the new taxation system, the foreign-funded  enterprises  shall be exempt from value-added taxes on imported machines,  equipment and spare parts at import entry which are needed in  production and do not exceed the total amount of investments.    In addition, foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from  value-added taxes and consumption taxes on manufacturing  products for export, excluding the ones under separate  regulation by the government.    Dong Shukui noted that Sino-foreign joint-venture banks and  foreign-funded banks registered in special economic zones and  Shanghai's Pudong New Area can be exempt from business taxes in  the first five years starting from opening day upon approval.    The official stressed that the Chinese Government will  consistently give foreign-funded enterprises favorable policies  and preferential treatment to boost their investment in the  country.    According to Dong, 1993 was the best year in luring and  utilizing foreign investment. The statistics by the end of last  year showed that China had developed more than 170,000 projects  with foreign investments and absorbed 220 billion U.S. dollars  in foreign investment under agreement, with 60 billion U.S.  dollars actually used at present.</p>

The visit, on February 28, "follows a suggestion made by the  President last year after learning that the prime minister's  father and grandfather had lived and worked in the Pittsburgh  area," White House Spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said in a statement.    Following a "working evening and dinner" in the Pennsylvania  city, northwest of Washington, the two leaders will return to  the White House, where Major will spend the night as Clinton's  guest.    It marks the first time Clinton has travelled outside  Washington with foreign head of state and the first time he has  invited a foreign leader to sleep at the White House.    Major will leave for a four-day visit to Washington on  February 27. He met Clinton in Washington last February shortly  after Clinton took office.    However, the traditional "special relationship" between the  United States and Britain has become cool after Major's  conservative government support Former President George Bush  during 1992 presidential campaign.    Last month, Clinton offended Britain by allowing the leader  of the IRA's [Irish Republican Army] political wing Sinn Fein,  Gerry Adams, to enter America for the first time in the past 20  years.    There was still differences between the two countries on  Bosnia as London urged Washington to play a more active role in  the peace process and contribute troops to the U.N. peacekeeping  operations.</p>

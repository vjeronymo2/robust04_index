Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), said he generally appreciates the  program, saying it shows the government's determination to take  necessary measures to open Japanese markets.    Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), urged the government to implement  the package in steady steps.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, said the program contains little substance.    Hiraiwa and Hayami called for tax cuts over a three-year  period and an increase of over 100 trillion yen in outlays for  public works projects.    Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said it will review a  procurement agreement reached between Japan and the United  States in 1981 and provide more information concerning its  procurement to foreign suppliers. The giant domestic  telecommunications firm said it opposes any move to include its  procurement plans in a governmental framework.    The insurance industry expressed hope that business leaders  of both countries will negotiate for the opening of the Japanese  insurance market.    The automobile industry insisted the question of Japanese  auto parts procurement from U.S. suppliers be settled through  industry-level talks.</p>

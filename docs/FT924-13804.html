			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Bank chief urges firm monetary policy GERMANY'S powerful savings bank movement yesterday urged the Bundesbank to stand firm in its tight monetary policy, and resist calls from both home and abroad to relax interest rates. Mr Helmut Geiger, president of the German savings bank federation, delivered a staunch defence of the central bank's policy, criticising countries like the US, Britain and Italy for being too lax in their monetary control. He also underlined the continuing doubts in the German business and banking community about the Maastricht treaty, saying the recent turbulence on the currency markets showed that economic and monetary union should not be introduced too hastily. Mr Geiger's support for the Bundesbank, while predictable, will provide welcome public backing at a moment when calls for interest rate relaxation, in order to prevent the German economy tipping into prolonged recession, are multiplying. 'We call on the Bundesbank to stand firm by its money supply policy,' Mr Geiger said. 'This is the only chance we have to create reliable preconditions for economic growth. The Bundesbank must not give in to pressure. A premature cut in interest rates might be understood by the public as a capitulation to monetary depreciation. It might cause market rates to rise rather than fall.' He flatly rejected accusations that the Bundesbank was itself responsible for the upheavals in the currency markets. 'That responsibility lies with those governments who simply failed to adjust their currency parities in good time to the changes in their value,' he said. As for the Maastricht treaty, he warned that European union would only succeed if currency union worked as a force for integration, not dynamite to blow the EC apart.</p>

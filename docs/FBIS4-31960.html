			<p>BFN     [Text] For over a month now, Serbian soldiers have been  entrenching along the border with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], raiding constantly on the  territory of the neighborly country. The Serbian soldiers, who  are also deploying mortars along the border, are in the direct  vicinity of U.S. Protection Forces soldiers, who have not  reacted so far. It is also reported that the Serbian soldiers  have entered up to 300 meters into Macedonian territory.</p>

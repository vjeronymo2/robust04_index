			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad </F> by Edyth Bulbring; place and date not given]    [Text] Aziz Pahad was running an hour late. He was tied up  with representatives from the German government's development  wing, and then another man, Mr Gopichand Hinduja, who also  appeared to have lots of money, an aide explained. The new  deputy foreign minister's willingness to make time for wealthy  and influential people like Mr Hinduja -- said to be the  10th-richest man in the world -- became clear as he explained  the new government's pragmatic and interest-driven foreign  policy.    Simply put, it entailed being very nice to the rich and  powerful, nice to the potentially rich and powerful and kind to  old friends who were neither. Although Mr Pahad would blanche  at such a crude assessment, he agreed that gone were the days of  making friends for friends' sake to further partisan objectives.    It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of  his  ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department  which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with  everyone that would have it.    Like all the other ministries under the new government,  South  Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to  ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP]  success.    "Our priority is making sure that the country has a  sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and  Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept,"  Mr Pahad said.    The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and  sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as  swiftly as possible.    Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and  art  works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The  resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms,  development aid and soft loans.    Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will  be to increase favourable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be  looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations  with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India,  the People's Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle  East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.    There were also important new friends to consolidate  politically in the context of being the new government. These  would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a  liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC  changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the  decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN  Security Council.    As there were scores of other developing countries on the  lookout for favourable relations with the most important  economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the  Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had  to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the  successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad.    South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first  was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in  an increasingly marginalised continent.    Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the  example of the "best miracle of the century". "We have captured  the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict  resolution to become the world leader in this arena."    But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest  of the world that this success story continued. For if South  Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating  democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious  consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy  and racism.    "They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy  approach  to politics. They want us to succeed." Another ace was South  Africa's position in the continent of Africa. "If we don't  sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the  region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the  development of other parts of Africa."    This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy  priority -- its relationship with the southern African region,  which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader  interests.    President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this  week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important  role that South Africa could play in the continent. However,  South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and  expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies.    Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards  relations with Africa. "Unless we can achieve mutually  beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to  tackle effectively our international or regional challenges," he  said.    This translates into developing regional co-operation by  joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and  rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs  Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement.    He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and  would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would  also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both  the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent  strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution.    Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to  areas of economic development but to basic issues like  gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants.    He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees,  the latter which South Africa would deal with according to  internationally accepted conventions. "But we cannot turn a  blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal  with this in a way that protects the interests of our country.  We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it  justly and humanely."    It was in this context that regional development became a  priority for SA. "If you don't have mutually advantageous  regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South  Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be  able to prevent it".    On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad  said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could  help the organisation become a more effective body on the  continent and in the United Nations.    Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first  African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council.    The government's policy of making new friends and extending  South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean  establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he  said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national  interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one  diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading  priority areas and establishing links with countries with  perceived potential.    One example under debate was the policy towards the People's  Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South  Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to  forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC  was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous  trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of  the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South  Africa's largest trading partners.    "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our own interests and international precedents."    Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated  only by South Africa's interests.    However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue  of  friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these  countries. "There are other forms of interaction and  co-operation."</p>

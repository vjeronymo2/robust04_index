			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel: A monopoly dismantled / A look at the proliferation of carriers servicing routes to South Africa As South Africa prepares for its first freely elected government, and memories of trade sanctions recede, growing numbers of business travellers are boarding 11-hour flights from Europe to Johannesburg. This is of great satisfaction to airlines flying the route. The Johannesburg-London air corridor is one of the most lucrative in the world. It is less pleasing to travellers; complaints about the cost of flying to Johannesburg are common. But while the current R9,000 (Pounds 1,670) fare for a business class return ticket from London to Johannesburg is not cheap, in real terms it used to be lot more expensive. Until a few years ago, air travel both to and in South Africa was a closed shop. South African Airways ran a virtual monopoly on domestic flights and, with a few selected international partners, an effective cartel on overseas routes. Three years ago, however, the government relaxed the rules on international carriers, allowing for price competition and new entrants. Most fares have dropped steeply, but not so precipitously as to threaten route profitability. Yet it remains slightly more expensive than some comparable longer routes, such as London to Sydney. But shopping around for lower fares can pay off, as some discount centres offer business fares as low as R5,428. Better deals are also available through airlines such as Sabena and Air France, which often offer slightly more reasonable fares with free transfers to London. Cheapest of all are carriers such as Egyptair and Kenya Airways, although with the inconveniences of stopovers in Cairo or Nairobi. One future option will probably be Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Airways, which has been trying for several years to get a foothold in the market. Once in Johannesburg, it is possible to take direct flights to big cities worldwide. The number of international airlines flying to and from South Africa has risen to 58 since deregulation. The rapid increase in the number of carriers is most striking in traffic with Asia, which is now serviced by four airlines in addition to SAA. Internally, the menu of flight choices is limited. A cosy SAA monopoly, during which it routinely raised fares about 12 per cent a year, was broken up with the arrival of competitor Flitestar in 1991. With some assistance from the government, Flitestar eventually carved out a 30 per cent market share, largely from business travellers. To the dismay of the flying public, however, this experiment in competition came to a sudden halt three weeks ago when Flitestar folded.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Try the rakia, but hang on to your head - Giles MacDonogh visits Bulgaria. He has a meal to remember with a retired cavalry officer and sees the problems of the country's wine industry I know now that the only way to deal with the after effects of home-made rakia is to eat a large bowl of shkembay tchorba, liberally dosed with pickled garlic and scattered with chilli pepper seeds. I learned as much in the pretty old town of Veliko Turnovo in Bulgaria after dinner with a remarkably hospitable retired cavalry colonel and his wife. As ever, the meal had begun with a plate of salad and a glass of rakia, the Bulgarian national drink. It is a little like an Austrian Obstler: a schnapps distilled from whatever fruit there is to hand. The colonel was proud of his rakia. I recognised that home-made feel as it burnt its way down my oesophagus stripping away any form of protective lining it encountered along the way. Tears appeared in the corners of my eyes. What kind of alcohol level did it have, I asked hoarsely? Not more than 45 degrees, said the colonel unconvincingly. I would have bet good money it was 10 more. The colonel cheerfully refilled my glass and raised his own in a toast. I was relieved when my salad plate was taken away and the need to swallow the firewater passed. We ate one of Bulgaria's best little dishes: red peppers filled with feta and beaten egg, dusted with flour and fried in batter. Then the colonel's wife served her special schnitzel, flavoured with marjoram and also dipped in beaten egg. Later, some little strips of ham made their appearance as we had not finished the wine (the Bulgarian shuns drink unaccompanied by food). Finally, a sweet cake appeared laced with something like a Rhenish Apfelkraut: a reduction of apple juice. I cannot have drunk more than a couple of tumblers of rakia but the damage was done. Shkembay was the only hope. Shkembay is perhaps the one area in which the Bulgarians and the Romanians make common cause. North of the Danube it is called ciorba di burta, or sour-stomach soup. The words tchorba and ciorba both derive from the Turkish word for soup and this was the broth which fuelled the janizaries, or Christian guards, of the Ottoman army. It presumably gave them the force to fight. Classic shkembay should be brimming with whole cloves of garlic and big, juicy chunks of tripe. If you are suffering as much as I was, you add some more pickled garlic and more pepper too. Bulgarian cookery is simplicity itself. A salad, such as the popular shopski salata (which refers to the people of Sofia), with its tomatoes and grated feta, is served with a glass of rakia. A soup is often served, and sometimes a sort of assiette volante in the form of a pancake filled with meat. Next comes a little plate of kebab or schnitzel; or sometimes a cheese dish such as the kashkaval or yellow cheese, dipped in batter. One of the most pleasant meals I ate in Bulgaria was also in Veliko Turnovo, in the Mehana (or tavern) Hadji Mincho, in the old town. I ate rustic potato soup and mutton sauteed with onions while a singer called Petya sang me an apparently lewd song about a woman caught pilfering blackberries. Meals are not over-generous. Little slivers of meat are frequently served, in good old Communist Block style, under a covering of cheese. The cheese is either white (feta or sirene) or yellow (kashkaval). The Party had its own gastronomic tastes, as a Bulgarian friend remembers on the one occasion he was invited to the Politburo guest house (now the Hotel Rila) in Sofia for lunch. The room was filled with plump little men in shabby brown suits with pools of sweat under their arms. They were all fetching a treat from a buffet and licking their lips as they conveyed it back to their seats. The dish turned out to be whole sheep's heads - eyes and all. Now that the Politburo is no more, the old members might well be working in Sofia's central market. I was flabbergasted by the linguistic talents of one of the stall holders who addressed me first in fluent Italian; then moved effortlessly into German until, learning that I was English, he spoke to me in my own language. The simplicity of Bulgarian food may have something to do with the comparative youth of the state combined with 40 years of communism. After the Bulgars (with a little encouragement from Gladstone) ejected the Turks a century ago, the new nation borrowed many of its culinary ideas from elsewhere. From France they imported the verb 'paner' to cook in batter (this appears on tourist menus as pane, as in 'brain pane'); from Hungary came palatschinken or pancakes; from Russia, a taste for little smoked fish. More recently culinary attention has turned to that bulwark of capitalism, America. A provincial hamburger, however, turned out to be a fairly crude attempt at the genre: a roll was filled with what tasted like spam, together with a few slices of cucumber and some feta cheese with tomato ketchup. The restaurant business is booming in Bulgaria for the first time since 1947. People are free to open what they wish. Before 1989 there were about 10 restaurants in the capital, Sofia. Now there are hundreds. But while you are no longer stuck for choice as to where to go, there is little variety when it comes to the food on the plate. So far, the only post-communist culinary inventions are the doner kebab and the hamburger. We must give them a few years yet. In the meantime I counsel anyone going to Bulgaria to apply their palates to a good bowl of shkembay.</p>

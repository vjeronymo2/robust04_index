			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: BP Canada climbs on improved gas, oil prices BP CANADA, the oil and gas producer formerly controlled by British Petroleum, has reported improved second-quarter profits and a strengthening balance sheet. Net earnings from continuing operations totalled CDollars 3.7m (USDollars 3.13m), or 7 cents a share, up from CDollars 2.3m, or 5 cents, a year earlier. The latest figure excludes BP's mining assets, which are in the process of being sold. Long-term debt has been cut in the past six months from CDollars 183m to CDollars 148m. Mr David Claydon, chief executive, ascribed the improvement to higher natural gas volumes, improved oil and gas prices, as well as a lower Canadian dollar. Natural gas output in the first half of 1992 was 34 per cent higher than a year earlier, but oil and natural gas liquids production dropped by 4 per cent. Britain's BP sold its 57 per cent stake in BP Canada last June to a group of investors. Norcen Energy, the main oil and gas arm of the Bronfman interest of Toronto, reported a sharp decline in first-half profits, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The company saw profit for the period slide to CDollars 21.4m, or 28 cents a share, down 39 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 480m, a fall of 6 per cent. Norcen, however, registered a strong improvement in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, boosted by higher oil production and prices. Natural gas output was also up sharply, but prices weakened. Alberta Energy earned CDollars 23.3m, or 30 cents a share, in the first half, up from CDollars 6.7m, or 6 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 279m, against CDollars 265m. Interest costs dropped sharply while oil and gas sales grew. The forest products side also improved.</p>

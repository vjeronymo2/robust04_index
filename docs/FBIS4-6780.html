			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, as soon as  warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry left Seoul after hatching  a war plot, the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique announced a plan  to stage the Hwarang war exercise in which some 130,000 puppet  military personnel, police officers, and reserve forces will be  mobilized. The war exercise will take place from 25 April for  five consecutive days and will be held in Inchon and areas of  Kyonggi Province adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line. In  order to instigate hostility and distrust within the nation and  heighten antagonism toward the Northern half of the Republic  among the South Korean residents, the puppet clique added a  drill of countering so-called spy infiltration.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / MEPs unlock the gates to an enlarged Europe The gates to the European Union swung open yesterday for Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway when the European parliament ratified their accession treaties by resounding majorities. Whether all four join the EU's existing 12 members in January now depends on whether they can sell European integration to their voters in referendums, starting with Austria next month. Latest opinion polls show that only in Finland is there a clear majority in favour of EU entry. But the size of yesterday's ratification was acclaimed by Nordic diplomats as a boost to their membership chances. In what European parliament president Mr Egon Klepsch described as 'a decision of historic importance', MEPs confounded critics of their chronic absenteeism with a near-record turnout of 468 of the 518 members. Amid barracking, an attempt to get the vote postponed was defeated by 305 to 150 votes with 13 abstentions. A large bloc of Euro-MPs then switched to demonstrate support for enlargement itself and all four countries were endorsed by huge majorities. Norway received 374 for, 24 against, and 58 abstentions; Austria 374 for, 24 against and 61 abstentions; Finland 377 for, 21 against, and 61 abstentions; and Sweden 380 for, 21 against with 60 abstentions. At the core of the No vote were neo-fascists complaining that the Maastricht treaty meant death to independent nations, and Greens arguing that an unreformed EU would destroy high environmental and social standards in the applicant countries. An exception was former French foreign minister and European commissioner Mr Claude Cheysson, who in a speech histrionically titled J'accuse, attacked 'the gravediggers of Europe' responsible for March's compromise with Britain in the row over EU voting rights. But the debate had already turned towards European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors' interpretation that parliament had won a victory in ensuring Britain got only cosmetic concessions in the voting row. Strasbourg had held enlargement hostage until Britain's partners faced down the UK demand that a small minority of countries should be able to block decisions in an expanded Union. Mr Delors called for a new federalist drive in Europe, and an offensive against Euro-sceptics he characterised as bigots. 'Let us go on the attack,' he urged MEPs, ahead of next month's Euro-elections. 'Don't be defensive. Don't just answer the people who have a different Europe to propose, because those are the anti-Europeans. Those are the people who do not accept people with different political convictions, different religions, or a different colour of skin.'</p>

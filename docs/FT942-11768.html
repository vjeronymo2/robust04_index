			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Thos Cook expands by 25% to Pounds 31.6m Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services group which is owned by Westdeutsche Landesbank, increased pre-tax profit by 25 per cent to Pounds 31.6m in 1993, writes Michael Skapinker. The increase came in spite of the continental European recession, companies cutting business travel costs, and low interest rates which depressed travellers' cheque earnings. Revenues rose 22 per cent to Pounds 595.6m. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive, said leisure travel proved resilient in most markets. He said holidays were 'now considered an essential, not a luxury, for people throughout the developed world'. Mr Rodrigues added that business travel, by contrast, was going through a big change as companies sought ways of reducing costs. There was evidence of increased demand for business travel as companies come out of recession, but this, he said, remained a highly competitive market.</p>

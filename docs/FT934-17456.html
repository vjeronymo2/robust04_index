			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Georgians routed Victorious Abkhazian rebels on a shooting spree in Sukhumi yesterday. Separatists routed Georgian soldiers from the last corner of their rebel territory yesterday, advancing nearly 90km in a day. Since Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze flew from the war zone on Tuesday, leaving the smoking ruins of the local capital Sukhumi in Abkhazian hands after an 11-day siege, his countrymen have suffered defeat after defeat.</p>

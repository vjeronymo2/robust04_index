			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (3): The right balance will reduce the risk - Structuring a portfolio / Philip Coggan invites three financial advisers to consider the needs of three different types of investor MOST SERIOUS investors realise that they should have a balanced portfolio. Equities are too risky, cash and bonds are vulnerable to inflation, overseas markets provide diversification but a currency risk. But how should one put the disparate elements together into a portfolio? We asked three financial advisers to suggest portfolios for three types of wealthier investor. They were allowed to assume that the individuals had already provided for basics such as pensions and life insurance. The following were the advisers' thoughts in late August; market changes between then and the publication date may have affected some of the recommendations, so the portfolios should be treated as a starting point only. A portfolio of Pounds 500,000, for a UK couple who want income. Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain de Broe, says: 'We would divide our clients' money into two distinct elements: an income or 'sinking' fund, and a 'growth' fund. The income fund, held in the building society and, perhaps, a few income shares of split-level investment trusts, is responsible for providing a quarterly, or even monthly, income for the investor. 'Drawing a mixture of interest and capital, the income fund is called upon to deliver a regular fixed sum over a term of, say, five years. At the end of that term, the income fund will have been totally eroded. 'However, over the same term, the growth fund should increase sufficiently to replace the capital lost in the income portfolio. The growth fund makes use of whatever allowances the client has available to maximise the tax-free maturity of investments at the five-years stage. 'For husband and wife, I suggest that Pounds 90,000 would be in a postal building society account, Pounds 60,000 in income shares of split-capital trusts (Pounds 12,000 of this would be placed in a personal equity plan), and Pounds 50,000 in debenture shares. 'This part of the portfolio would provide income, with the building society account being steadily eroded. 'The income shares would have a high yield, and thus might lose some capital over five years; the debenture shares would come from Dartmoor investment trust, which have a 6 per cent gross yield, and where the income and capital are index-linked. 'For the growth part of the portfolio, I suggest Pounds 114,000 in the zero-coupon shares of split-capital investment trusts, then Pounds 90,000 in a cash-backed Business Expansion Scheme (Pounds 40,000 each in the current tax year and Pounds 5,000 each carried back to the 1992-93 tax year, if invested before October 5). 'A further Pounds 40,000 can be invested in the 6th issue of index-linked National Savings certificates. Each spouse can buy Pounds 10,000 for themselves and hold a further Pounds 10,000 in trust for each other. 'For some growth, we might put Pounds 30,000 in the Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Protected Capital Plus, which is a three-month rolling account, tracking the FT-SE 100 index. If it goes up, you get nearly all the rise. If it falls, your quarterly loss is limited to 2 per cent. 'For extra growth, we would look at emerging markets. Investment trusts in this area are at a bit of a premium right now, so we would put Pounds 20,000 in Olliff's City of London Emerging Markets unit trust. Finally, each partner could put Pounds 3,000 into a single-company Pep. 'This combination will yield a net income of just over 5 per cent and provide a decent level of capital growth at the end of five years.' A portfolio of Pounds 500,000, for a UK individual who wants capital growth: Michael Thompson, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray, suggests a portfolio with the following split: Gilts, 20 per cent; zero-coupon preference shares, 20 per cent; and cash 2 per cent. The remainder would be invested in investment trusts specialising in the UK (15 per cent), international (22 per cent), North America (5 per cent), Europe (5 per cent), the Far East (5 per cent) and emerging markets (6 per cent). 'In the gilts,' says Thompson, 'I would select Funding 3 1/2 per cent 1999/04 and the Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 2006. Although I believe that we will be in a climate of low inflation and low interest rates for at least the next two to three years, I believe it makes sense to maintain some exposure to index-linked stocks as a hedge against the unexpected.' Zeros offer investors steady capital growth but no income. Thompson opted for four different zero stocks: TR Technology, Abtrust Preferred, Contra-Cyclical and Fleming Income &amp; Capital. For the investment trust selections, Thompson opts for, in the UK: TR City of London, Murray Income, Derby Trust capital shares and River &amp; Mercantile capital shares. In the international category, he likes: Murray International, Alliance, Bankers, F&amp;C and F&amp;C Smaller Companies. For Europe, he picks Ecu trust; for North America, American trust and F&amp;C US Smaller Companies; for the Far East, Fleming Japanese and EFM Dragon; and for emerging markets, Murray Smaller Markets, Templeton Emerging Markets and the Latin American Investment Trust. A portfolio of Dollars 750,000 for an expatriate, or international investor, whose base currency is dollars: Graham Barnes, of Wilfred T Fry, in Worthing, says: 'An investor with dollar liabilities will logically want to buy dollar assets, usually through equities and US government bonds. 'However, problems face both sectors at the moment. First, it is difficult to justify buying at the US stock market's current levels. Secondly, US interest rates are low with little prospect of further immediate falls, and there is little scope for capital profits from US bonds. The solution to this problem would appear to be partly in timing and partly away from the US. 'We would invest equally in bonds and equities. We favour European bonds, where interest rates are most likely to be cut, probably further than in any other economic area. That could well weaken European currency values against the dollar, which would suggest hedging the currency exposure. Although complicated, hedging can be arranged even for the individual. 'Stock markets can give growth in terms of income as well as capital. Thus, two quite separate equity portfolios are indicated. 'First, 20 per cent of the total portfolio should be invested in a mixture of Asian Pacific, emerging markets and European equities. Clearly, we are looking for our capital gain away from the US in more volatile markets, since we believe the potential reward justifies the currency risk (ie, local currencies depreciating against the US dollar). 'Secondly, 30 per cent of the total portfolio should go into the US market, but only when Wall Street declines from present levels. This part of the portfolio would be invested for dividend growth and stability. 'It is important to state that the overall asset allocation set out here would need regular review.'</p>

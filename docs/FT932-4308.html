			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Japan carworkers top of earnings league in world motor industry JAPAN, the world's biggest car producer, had the highest gross hourly wage rates in the world automobile industry last year, according to a study by the German motor industry federation (VDA). Japanese car assembly line workers also worked the highest number of hours. Germany and Sweden had the highest total motor industry wage costs, however, because of a much heavier burden of social costs such as payroll tax or national insurance. Carworkers in Germany and Sweden, along with Italy, also worked the fewest hours. Britain had the lowest total wage costs (gross wages plus social costs such as payroll tax) in the developed world's motor industry last year, a position it has held for six of the past seven years. At the same time UK carworkers worked longer hours than anywhere else in Europe, and Britain had one of the lowest levels of corporate taxation. The German motor industry, which is facing severe problems as new vehicle sales plummet, has suffered a sharp decline in its competitiveness, according to the VDA figures. Total industry wage costs at DM47 (Pounds 19) an hour were the highest in the world last year based on average exchange rates. The position deteriorated further in the wake of last autumn's turmoil in European currency markets. Based on exchange rates in December 1992 German vehicle makers had total wage costs two-thirds higher than the average of DM28.3 in the rest of Europe, and 37 per cent higher than in both the US and Japan at DM34.4 per hour. Adding to the German industry's problems its carworkers enjoyed some of the shortest working hours at 1,483 hours per year in 1991 (the latest VDA figures available), a third less than the 2,181 hours worked on average by their Japanese counterparts and 27 per cent less than the 2,022 hours worked annually in the US. According to the VDA figures, German carworkers worked 350 hours a year less than their equivalents in the UK (1,830 hours a year) and more than 100 hours a year less than in France (1,608) and Spain (1,654). Carworkers in Sweden and Italy had the shortest annual working hours at 1,388 and 1,409 respectively. The VDA claims that German motor industry competitiveness is further burdened by one of the highest levels of corporate taxation, with a tax rate of around 66 per cent compared with 52 per cent in France and only 33 per cent in the UK.</p>

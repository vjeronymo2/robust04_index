			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Fashion: Down and out in London but not in Paris - Whatever you wear in the French capital make sure it's immaculate, says Alice Rawsthorne, who has been scouring the city for bargains WHEN Dan Walker was a solicitor in London he had no choice concerning what he wore to work. 'It had to be a suit, darkish, with a quiet tie. If I'd worn anything else I'd have been sent straight home.' Now he works as a film lawyer in Paris. 'It's completely different. I wear linen suits in summer and a blazer with trousers in winter. If I don't have client meetings I go the office in jeans. I also wear lots of colour - greens and reds - that I'd never have worn in London.' Style is something that Parisians take seriously, very seriously, much more so than their London counterparts. Everyone, male and female, is expected to take an intelligent interest in the way they look. The difference in dress is probably most marked for men. There is no gallic equivalent to the sober-suited City of London uniform, as a glance at the male members of the French cabinet - Jack Lang, the Thierry Mugler-clad arts minister, or Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialist party, in his chic linen jackets - attests. France's female politicians - Elisabeth Guigou, minister for European affairs, in Chanel and Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, in Torrente  -are just as colourful. Although the dress code for women is probably more rigid in Paris than London. 'Women here are far smarter,' says Lady Sara Fergusson, who has lived in Paris for five years since her husband, Sir Ewen, became British ambassador. 'But they are often less imaginative. There is definitely a uniform.' The uniform for the haute bourgeoise ladies who lunch at the glossy restaurants along Avenue Montaigne, La Maison Blanche and L'Avenue, is a Guigouesque combination of Chanel suits with short(ish) skirts and the sheerest tights. They may gossip about the new long skirts they saw at the fashion shows, but they would not dream of wearing them. But short skirts are out in Bohemian Paris. There was barely a shin in sight at the Marais art gallery openings last Saturday that marked the start of the autumn arts season. Any legs which were not hidden behind long hemlines were swathed in black leather. Whatever you wear in Paris it must be immaculate. One day I went to cut some ivy from the riverbank beneath my apartement on the Ile Saint-Louis. I dressed for the task - an old catsuit, Levi jacket and fashionably, or so I thought, battered Gucci loafers. I stopped off at a cafe for a coffee and croissant only to I realise that I did not have enough money. The patronne brought the coffee and croissant explaining - with a sympathetic smile presumably saved for paupers - that it was free as I looked 'thin and hungry'. When my colleague, Will Dawkins, moved to Paris from the FT's Brussels bureau, he took a favourite tie to his local dry cleaner. He returned to find it torn into pieces. The cleaner said he could not possibly have cleaned it as the tie was 'dead' and he had done Will a favour by dismembering the corpse. Dan Walker remembers his Parisian girlfriend howling with horror at his shoes. 'She said they were filthy. She was right. No one had noticed in London." The consolation is that it is easy to dress well in Paris. The city is crammed with dry cleaners, cobblers, seamstresses and couturiers. 'What I miss most of all are the seamstresses and cleaners,' says Natalia Fawcett, who recently returned to London after five years in Paris where her husband, Edmund, was correspondent for The Economist. 'Paris shops always alter whatever you buy so it fits perfectly and dry cleaners tell you exactly how they plan to treat your clothes.' Paris also has more shops to choose from. The areas around avenue Montaigne, rue Faubourg Saint-Honore, place des Victoires and rue de Grenelle are packed with designer stores. And the city abounds with bargains. Jane Cattani works for Christian Dior where she has the pick of the collection, but she also scouts around Agne B. and the La Redoute mail order catalogue for 'cheap fillers'. Lady Fergusson favours Givenchy for grand occasions, but browses around the department stores for 'everyday things'. Natalia Fawcett bought most of her Parisian clothes from the degriffe shops at place d'Italie, where the designers sell leftovers from previous seasons at a fraction of the original price. The biggest bargains are the soldes prives to which designers invite faithful customers. These are held on the eve of the normal sales so you have the pick of the bargains and prices are lower. The only hitch is the queue. One friend arrived at Christian Lacroix to be told by the doorman that it would be at least three hours before she could enter the shop. I queued for an hour at the Yohji Yamamoto men's solde prive to pay for blue trousers 'ordered' by a friend in London. At home I realised they were black, not blue. A Parisian would not have chosen the wrong colour.</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / As They Say in Europe: English like it should be spoke I READ the other day that Liz Forgan, the boss of BBC radio, was worrying about accents. She has commissioned research into what the London Evening Standard called the 'tyranny of the well-spoken south over national broadcasting.' She said: 'I think sometimes we sound a little monotonous . . . like a narrow slug of the population.' I am as prejudiced as any narrow slug and, therefore, glad to take advantage of the new freedom of debate within the BBC. But all I have to contribute is to wonder why our concern to give regional accents a fair hearing is not shared elsewhere. In countries as different as France and Poland, you go to a special school to make sure you speak proper before broadcasting. In Germany, if you work for Bayerische Rundfunk, you might allow a trace of Munich or Upper Bavaria in your voice, but no more. In Switzerland, the national news is read in Hochdeutsch, or standard German, even though no Swiss-German speaks it routinely. The only European country that allows significant variations in speech is Spain - but for local broadcasts only. Even in England, surveys have shown that people prefer the sound of standard English. The problem goes much deeper, however, than agonising over the precise mix of regionalism that is necessary. There was a letter in The Guardian last April from Professor Richard M Hogg of Manchester University. In it, he contested an assertion by the education secretary, John Patten, who had said that 'Clive and me went to Wembley' was incorrect grammatically. Hogg replied: 'The sentence may not be formally correct but it is grammatically correct, just as the equally correct 'Clive and I went to Wembley' would be inappropriate in many informal situations (such as the school playground).' This was a savage blow to people like me who had been taught that 'I' was the subject and 'me' the object, only to be varied in the case of 'It's me.' (The French similarly say 'C'est moi,' but no professor of French would say that moi and je are interchangeable). In England, it is necessary to accept situational grammar. Yet Prof Hogg has left me with many worries. Is the following sentence correct? - 'Dave and me was up the Garden last night watchin' Turandot. Gwyneth Jones sung real good.' In other countries, any form of incorrectness, let alone yobspeak, is regarded with derision. Lech Walesa is sneered-at by Warsaw taxi drivers for his failure to employ the locative case correctly. The greatest enthusiasm for linguistic purity is found among the people whom I regard as the best educated in Europe, the Czechs. When I was in Prague shortly after the fall of communism, among the many graffiti was the frequent appearance of one word, Mylos - a jibe directed at the last communist boss, Milos Jakes. The point is that i and y sound the same in Czech but their use is defined strictly. Jakes himself spoke bad Czech and this contributed to the contempt in which he was widely held. The graffito implied that he could not spell his own name. Accompanying Prof Hogg's letter in The Guardian was one from Andy Gibbons of the Campaign for Raising Standards in English, a name that many will find curiously misleading, for he wrote: 'Expressions such as 'We was . . .' are a social irritant rather than a barrier to communication.' I now realise I must drop my hidebound approach to the English language and accept the doctrine that everything is as good as everything else and sometimes much better. Nevertheless, I still worry why it is that I find 'me are' less acceptable than 'us is.' There remains the problem of what to do about those who put their officially-sanctioned freedom into practice and end up unemployed rather than as doctors, investment bankers or barristers. In countries which have yet to catch up with Britain, the standard spoken tongue is respected because it provides a standard; it is the language that a foreigner learns, the tongue in which normal debate can be conducted while minimising the risk of being misunderstood. Those who speak the standard tongue are not especially respected. But they are certainly not derided: they provide a barrier against anarchy. When I was in Japan recently, I saw a bilingual sign in a shop. The English version said: 'Children's wear.' That is right. Not 'Childrens wear,' nor even 'Childrens' wear.' They are so tedious, the Japanese, fussing about getting things right. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

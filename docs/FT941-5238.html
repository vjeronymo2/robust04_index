Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, has already served two terms of office on the Bank's court of governors. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on the City, attributed the prime minister's failure to re-appoint Mr Laird to 'weakness or prejudice'. He said it would be the first time since the Bank was nationalised in 1946 that there would be nobody representing unions on the court of governors. Mr Alan Beith, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the break with the long-established practice of appointing someone from a union background to the court of governors was widely felt to be 'undesirable'. Mr Nelson praised Mr Laird's contribution to the Bank and insisted that no reflection had been cast on him by the prime minister's decision. He said: 'There is no intention to be partisan in this matter. It is far too important for party politics to play any part.'</p>

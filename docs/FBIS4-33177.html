			<p>BFN     [Text] Rum production projected for 1994 ensures a steady  supply of ration quotas and the current levels of sales in the  food stores. The Liquors and Beverages Union will produce 33  million liters of rum in 1994, a volume slightly higher than in  1993. This was announced by union director Jose Manuel de la  Osa. The Sugar Industry Ministry and people's government  productions will allow the supply to reach 41 million liters in  1994. This does not mean, however, that rum sales can be  deregulated, like what happened with cigarettes. The industry  has the capacity to increase its volume of production, but does  not have enough molasses and alcohols to satisfy the rum demand  in the retail chain. De la Osa pointed out that increases in  those essential raw materials will make it possible to increase  rum production in the future. For the present, ration quotas per  family unit, as well as the levels of distribution to the retail  food chain, will continue in Havana and the rest of Cuba.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Power price cuts of up to 15% offered to companies Companies are being offered cuts of up to 15 per cent in the price of electricity as power suppliers prepare for the introduction of more competition in the market for medium-sized to large consumers from April. The average cut, however, will be considerably less. Inenco, the energy consultancy, said most offers would lead to power costs falling by 4 per cent to 8 per cent. Some companies said they had been offered no reductions. This is partly because electricity companies are tending to demand more frequent payment of bills by companies which want to sign tailor-made contracts rather than remain on standard tariffs. Consultants are advising clients against signing contracts hastily. Mr Andrew Johns, director of the consultancy National Utility Services, said: 'Many regional electricity companies will not offer prices outside the areas where they supply until nearer April. Even then they may review and revise.' The April changes represent the second liberalisation of the electricity market. About 5,000 sites which use more than 1MW of electricity have been able to buy power from a range of suppliers since the industry's privatisation three years ago. Less intensive consumers have been required to buy power from their local regional electricity company. However, from April 1 the threshold of the competitive market will fall to 100 kilowatts, taking in another 45,000 consumers ranging from medium-sized businesses, including supermarkets, to schools and hospitals. The largest reductions on current tariffs are being offered to sites that are one of a series owned by large companies, and to those that require substantial amounts of electricity outside periods of peak demand. Mr Ken Green, power and water purchaser for Imperial Chemical Industries, said yesterday that at the 15 or so company sites which would become eligible to choose their electricity supplier from April, the largest reduction was about 15 per cent. That applied to only one or two sites, however. Some were being offered virtually no price advantage and the average was between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Mr John Hardy, managing director of Fowler &amp; Holden, a small engineering company in Grimsby, said he had rejected offers from two electricity suppliers which had required payment of bills every 10 to 12 days rather than monthly. Neither offer would have cut the company's electricity costs, he said. Mr Brian Acott, of Inenco, said most regional companies were demanding settlement periods of 10 days. Many customers had already signed deals which they might regret when further offers became available from other companies, he said. Offer, the electricity industry regulator, has criticised electricity companies over attempts to tie existing customers to long-term deals in the approach to April and has instructed them to offer contract escape clauses in some cases. Mr Acott said some power companies were making withdrawal from contracts diffi-cult by charging significant administration costs as a penalty.</p>

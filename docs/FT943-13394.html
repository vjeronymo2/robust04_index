			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Canada and US seek to avert wheat sales clash The US trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, and his Canadian counterpart, Mr Roy MacLaren, will hold last-ditch talks next week in an attempt to resolve the trade dispute over imports of Canadian wheat, Reuter reports from Washington. White House officials and congressmen and senators from wheat-growing states met yesterday to discuss options. The wheat states' representatives said later that the US was poised to act if the talks in Washington on July 27 failed. 'The US is prepared to pull the trigger,' Kansas congressman Mr Pat Roberts said. The International Trade Commission recommendations call for import quotas of 500,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes. During the meeting, these recommendations were discussed and trigger levels of 500,000 tonnes, with 150,000 tonnes for durum imports, emerged as a likely level, although senators noted that no decision has been finalised. The US-Canada wheat trade dispute has spiralled from a minor problem - over the surge in imports of Canadian durum wheat - into what threatens to be the beginning of a trade war between the world's two largest trading partners. Imports of Canadian wheat have surged to record levels, angering US farmers who fear the loss of domestic markets to imports of cheaper Canadian wheat. Agriculture department figures show the US imported 4.766m tonnes of wheat from Canada between October 1993 and April 1994. This is more than double the 2.173m tonnes imported in the same period a year earlier. The complaint against Canada was bought under Section 22 of US agricultural law which expires in January 1995, or as soon as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is implemented.</p>

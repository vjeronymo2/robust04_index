			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Sri Lankans stone ministers Thousands of mourners hurled stones and abuse at Sri Lankan government ministers at the funeral yesterday of a popular general killed in a weekend landmine explosion, Reuter reports from Colombo. At least 15 people, including two ministers and some soldiers, were injured.

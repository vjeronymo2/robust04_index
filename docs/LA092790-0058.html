			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN RENEWAL PLAN PROPOSED  </P> <P> A developer and a major Torrance property owner have proposed a $35-million  redevelopment plan for the city's old downtown area that would include 170 new  condominiums and 28,000 square feet of retail space.  </P> <P> The four-acre project proposed by Gascon Mar, a development firm based in San  Diego, and Sam Levy Investments, a Torrance-based property firm, would include  three parcels in a four-block downtown area.  </P> <P> Included in the proposal are plans to shave off the back of the Newberry store  at Sartori and El Prado avenues to provide more parking spaces. The down-sized  building would be converted into a market or a series of smaller stores.  </P> <P> Representatives of the two companies also told City Council members Tuesday  night that their proposal calls for building 100 condominiums in three-story  buildings at Torrance Boulevard and Cabrillo Avenue and 70 more at Cravens  Avenue and El Prado. The units would range in price from $125,000 to $270,000.  </P> <P> The project would eliminate landscaped center medians on several streets to  convert the current parallel parking to a diagonal pattern and would raze two  old hotels and the quarters of several local stores and offices.  </P> <P> Gascon Mar representatives said they plan to conduct a series of public  meetings on the proposal before filing formal plans with the city.  </P></p>

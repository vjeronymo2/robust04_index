			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / How US pension plans are going international Forget for the moment about exciting and dangerous hedge funds, but look instead at those dull and staid US pension funds. Worth some Dollars 2,500bn (Pounds 1,700bn), they put Mr George Soros and his ilk into perspective. And there are important structural changes taking place, with global implications. A survey of the US pensions industry from the Connecticut consultants Greenwich Associates* spells out the massive shift into international assets now proceeding. At the end of last year the average fund had 8 per cent in non-US assets (6.4 per cent in equities, 1.6 per cent in bonds) compared with only 4.4 per cent in 1991. Moreover the international exposure is expected by plan managers to hit 12 per cent by the end of 1996. Again, that would be very largely in stocks, at 9.6 per cent against 2.4 per cent for international bonds. The sleepiest plan sponsors, even in the public sector, appear to be waking up, and there is a frantic scramble to find global managers. Half of the funds surveyed by Greenwich had international portfolios at the end of last year, and half of the remainder intended to start buying international assets within 12 months. Public sector funds - half of the industry in terms of assets - have tended to lag behind, and still have only 5.6 per cent overseas against 9 per cent for corporate funds. However, on present plans the public funds will have almost caught up in three years' time. What does this mean for markets around the world? Already we have seen 100 per cent surges in several Asian markets in 1993 as US money, not all from pension funds, has sloshed around. The pension funds and similarly run endowments and foundations now own global equities worth some Dollars 170bn, and they plan to raise this to Dollars 300bn over three years. So although there may be further Hong Kong-style setbacks, as we have seen in 1994 so far, the money will keep flowing, perhaps at Dollars 30bn-plus annually. The bond picture, incidentally, is not so dramatic. US tax-exempt funds hold Dollars 42bn of global bonds according to this survey, and plan to raise the aggregate to Dollars 75bn over three years. Governments around Europe alone will happily eat that rate of inflow for breakfast. So much for the expansionary features of US pension funds. Overall, though, they are far from buoyant, with the corporate plans shrinking. This applies particularly to corporate defined benefit (in UK parlance, final salary-linked) plans which are estimated to have suffered a negative cash flow of Dollars 36bn in 1993. But the public sector plans and the corporate defined contribution (or money purchase) plans are still enjoying net inflows. Defined contribution plans accounted for 30 per cent of all corporate plan assets in 1990, but the proportion has risen to 37 per cent today and could be 60 per cent in 10 years' time. They have a much lower international equity proportion - only 0.8 per cent against 9.7 per cent for defined benefit corporate plans. Remarkably, the defined contribution plans have on average 31 per cent of their assets in the sponsoring company's own stock, representing a worrying concentration of risk for beneficiaries - although on the other hand the current bid battle for Grumman has boosted the value of the company's 401(k) plan by some Dollars 250m. It is worth asking, in view of the defined contribution growth, how permanent the US pension funds' voyage overseas may prove. The international shift appears to be motivated by a search for higher returns without undue increases in risks. Expected returns on US assets have declined, pushing funds further into equities (with exposure to domestic bonds down 2.3 percentage points to 32.7 per cent in two years). Both small capitalisation domestic stocks and foreign stocks have benefited from this search for extra return. Emerging markets, heavily marketed, have offered tempting returns. Last year the US was the worst-performing main stock market in dollar terms, but it may not look relatively nearly so bad in 1994. The pension plans' rush abroad is probably unstoppable in the medium term, but a bad period for international returns could yet cause plan sponsors to put their more ambitious plans on ice for a while. *Greenwich Associates, Tel.

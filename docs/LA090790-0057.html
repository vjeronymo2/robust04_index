			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> EVICTED WOMAN SELLS DUPLEX FOR $135,000  </P> <P> A Camarillo resident who became homeless after city officials evicted her from  her decaying house, filled with trash up to the ceilings, sold the duplex for  $135,500, city officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Kelton Roberts, 64, took to the streets after her house was declared a health  hazard about 20 months ago.  </P> <P> City officials removed about 100 tons of garbage that had begun to fester and  mold in her home.  </P> <P> Roberts, who says her obsessive compulsive disorder makes her unable to throw  anything away, was not happy about the sale. "It's sold and it's over and now  I'm unhappy. I never wanted to sell it," Roberts said.  </P> <P> Roberts attends counseling and takes medication for her disorder, but she said  it has not relieved her problem.  </P> <P> Salvador Plascencia, who bought the property, plans to rent it out after  renovating it, real estate agent Mike Takusagawa said.  </P> <P> Roberts said she is not sure what she will do with the money but may buy a  mobile home.

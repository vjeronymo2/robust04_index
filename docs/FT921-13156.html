			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Ontario U-turn reins in public spending A DEEPENING fiscal crisis has forced Ontario's New Democratic Party government to make a sharp U-turn in economic policy. Canada's richest province, which less than a year ago proposed spending its way out of recession, now proposes to limit the rise in transfers to municipalities, schools and hospitals to 1 per cent, in the fiscal year from April 1, followed by 2 per cent in each of the following two years. Mr Bob Rae, provincial premier, warned that further austerity measures would be required to rein in the galloping budget deficit. This is now projected, for the year to March 31 1993, at CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.8bn), far above the earlier estimate of CDollars 8.9bn. 'We're facing tough choices,' Mr Rae said in a television address. 'We've got to find that balance between the cost of the services people need and expect, and what we can afford.' Among the likely consequences of the clamp on transfer payments are higher university fees, longer delays in elective surgery and cuts in refuse collection and other municipal services. Ontario contributes about 40 per cent of Canada's gross domestic output and is one of North America's biggest borrowers on international capital markets. Its economy - heavily dependent on the automotive, steel and forestry industries - shrank by an estimated 2.1 per cent last year, the biggest fall among Canada's 10 provinces. The provincial Treasury has revised its forecast of 1992 growth to 2.2 per cent, down from an estimate of 3.8 per cent. Government revenues are expected to fall by 1.5 per cent in the fiscal year to March 31 1992, the first drop since 1945. Mr Rae's social democratic government, in office since September 1990, drew strong criticism last year when it raised the 1991-92 deficit to CDollars 9.7bn, three times the previous government's projection. Pressed by a dispirited business community, the NDP recently started to shrink from interventionism. It shelved plans for a publicly owned car insurance scheme, delayed a proposed environmental 'bill of rights' and softened a ban on Sunday shopping. Business groups are fighting proposed changes to the provincial labour law, which would include a ban on hiring replacement workers at strikebound companies. The Big Three North American motor companies warned last week that the changes would seriously damage Ontario's ability to attract new investment.</p>

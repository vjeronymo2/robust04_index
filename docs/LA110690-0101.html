			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL ENDS BID TO WORK AROUND TAX PROPOSITION;  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO: OFFICIALS CONSIDER ENACTING AN EMERGENCY MEASURE ON THE EVE OF A  VOTE ON AN INITIATIVE THAT COULD REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL TO RAISE LEVIES.  </P> <P> Faced with substantial public opposition, the San Fernando City Council on  Monday rejected a proposal to authorize itself to enact emergency taxes on  utilities and cable television service, a defensive move before today's  balloting on a constitutional amendment restricting tax increases.  </P> <P> About 50 angry opponents of the proposal crowded City Hall as council members  considered the utility users tax, introduced to protect the city from the  possible effects of Proposition 136. The ballot measure would eliminate the  ability of local officials to raise taxes without voters' approval.  </P> <P> The audience cheered the measure's defeat. "You're damned if you do. You're  damned if you don't. I'd rather be damned later than today," said Councilman  Jose Hernandez.  </P> <P> The ordinance, rejected on a 4-1 vote, would have established a framework  enabling the council to quickly and easily enact emergency taxes on gas, water,  electricity and telephone and cable TV service -- without asking the voters --  in case of a severe economic slowdown.  </P> <P> If the council had acted before the proposition passed, the new tax authority  would not fall under its restrictions. The measure involved two ordinances: The  first would have authorized the new taxes, the second would have immediately  suspended them but reserved the council's power to reimpose them in an  emergency.  </P> <P> City officials had said any such taxes would not be permanent and would only be  implemented as a last resort before cutting municipal services. Public hearings  and a council vote would have been required before any new taxes could be  implemented.  </P> <P> City officials had said they did not envision actually imposing any new fees in  the foreseeable future and called the utility users tax a "safety net" that  would guarantee that municipal services such as police protection would not be  cut if the city were to fall on tough economic times.  </P> <P> "I hope I don't have to come back and say 'I told you so,' " said Councilman  Doude Wysbeek, who cast the sole vote for the proposal, referring to  predictions that the tax limit could cause cuts in essential city services.  </P> <P> Like their counterparts in a number of Southern California cities -- including  West Hollywood and Compton -- San Fernando city officials were racing to  approve new municipal taxes before voters statewide decide Proposition 136,  which would take the issue out of the hands of cities and counties completely.  </P> <P> Proposition 136, which would take effect at midnight if approved, would  prohibit a city or county from enacting a new general-purpose tax or increasing  an existing one unless a majority of voters approved. A new or increased  special-purpose tax -- to pay for increased police protection, for instance --  could not be enacted without two-thirds voter approval.  </P> <P> A memo by city Finance Director Michael J. Moon said the utility tax was not  designed as a "long-range revenue source, only as a stopgap measure." City  Administrator Mary Strenn said the taxes would be implemented only if the city  were faced with a sudden, severe revenue shortage -- for example, if a large  retailer moved or went out of business, reducing the city's sales tax revenues.  </P> <P> The swiftness with which city officials placed the matter on the agenda  prompted criticism from San Fernando residents who accused the council of  trying to sneak the ordinance through at the last minute.  </P> <P> Angry residents launched a flurry of petition drives opposing it, gathering  1,185 signatures, which council members said was a key factor in their  decision.  </P> <P> "This preempts our vote on Proposition 136 and circumvents our right for the  people to vote on future taxes," said Florine Dickey, who has lived in San  Fernando for 36 years. "It think it's sneaky. This should have been on the  agenda a long time ago."  </P> <P> City officials denied that they purposely waited until the last minute to  discuss the ordinance, saying it took two months to research the issue and  draft the proposed measure.  </P></p>

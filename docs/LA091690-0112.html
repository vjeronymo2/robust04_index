			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLEMSON, THOMAS BOUNCE BACK TO WIN  </P> <P> Doug Thomas scored on a 98-yard kickoff return and also set up the winning  touchdown with a 37-yard pass reception as Clemson defeated Maryland, 18-17, in  an Atlantic Coast Conference game Saturday at Baltimore.  </P> <P> Thomas was seeking redemption. In Clemson's 20-7 loss to Virginia last week, he  dropped a critical third-down pass. The Tigers were forced to punt, and  Virginia returned the kick to set up the clinching score.  </P> <P> "The burden was on me because we lost," Thomas said. "If I didn't drop it, they  would have never had that big return. It was all my fault.  </P> <P> "I sure feel a lot better this week."  </P> <P> Clemson (2-1 overall, 1-1 in the ACC) has beaten Maryland (2-1, 0-1) four  consecutive times.  </P> <P> Maryland took a 17-12 lead with 10:25 remaining on a 39-yard field goal by Dan  DeArmas.  </P> <P> On Clemson's next series, the Tigers faced third and seven from their 35 when  Thomas caught a short pass from DeChane Cameron and sprinted to the Maryland  28. Five plays later, Cameron hit Rudy Harris with an 11-yard pass for the  winning touchdown.  </P> <P> Dexter Davis' second interception with 2:23 left assured the Tigers of victory.  </P> <P> No. 3 Florida St. 48, Georgia Southern 6 -- Shannon Baker and Amp Lee each had  two touchdowns and Terrell Buckley scored on a long punt return for the second  consecutive week as the Seminoles extended their winning streak to 12 games  with the victory at Tallahasse, Fla.  </P> <P> Florida State (2-0) has not been defeated since a 34-23 loss to Clemson on  Sept. 9, 1989.  </P> <P> Georgia Southern (1-2) was limited to just 19 yards rushing and 53 yards  overall in the first half, their lowest total since the school reinstated  football in 1982.  </P> <P> Lee sandwiched two short scoring runs around Brad Johnson's touchdown pass to  Baker in the first half. Baker also caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from  reserve quarterback Casey Weldon in the fourth quarter to close the scoring.  </P> <P> Buckley, a sophomore, scored on a 67-yard punt return in the fourth quarter,  giving Florida State a 41-6 lead. He scored on a 63-yard return last week  against East Carolina.  </P> <P> No. 11 Virginia 56, Navy 14 -- Virginia quarterback Shawn Moore passed for four  touchdowns and ran for a fifth before halftime as the Cavaliers rolled up 664  yards while cruising to a nonconference victory over the Midshipmen at  Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> Moore, a senior, completed 13 of 22 passes for 250 yards and ran for 35 yards.  He became the school's career total offense leader with 6,081 yards, breaking  Scott Gardner's 15-year-old mark of 6,059.  </P> <P> The Midshipmen (1-1) were down, 21-0, when they got their second first down.  Navy had only 49 yards and three first downs by halftime, when it trailed 35-0.  </P> <P> North Carolina 48, Connecticut 21 -- Cookie Massey scored on an 87-yard  interception return to highlight a 24-point first quarter as the Tar Heels won  a nonconference game at Chapel Hill, N.C.  </P> <P> Coach Mack Brown, 2-20 in his two previous seasons at North Carolina, is 3-2  this season.  </P> <P> Connecticut, a member of the Division I-AA Yankee Conference, fell to 0-2.  </P> <P> North Carolina State 20, Wake Forest 15 -- Terry Jordan, who lost two fumbles  and threw an interception in the first half, hit Reggie Lawrence on a 33-yard  scoring play in the third quarter to help the Wolfpack win an ACC game at  Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> Jordan, a sophomore, was starting in place of junior Charles Davenport, who was  sidelined with a bruised shoulder.  </P> <P> Jordan's touchdown pass to Lawrence, which gave the Wolfpack a 17-12 lead, came  one play after his scoring pass to William Turner was called back because of a  holding penalty.  </P> <P> Jordan completed 12 of 21 passes for 181 yards.  </P> <P> Jordan's problems with ballhandling were part of an epidemic. The Wolfpack  (2-1, 1-1) committed four turnovers in the first quarter and finished with  five.  </P> <P> The Demon Deacons (1-2, 0-1) picked up two points when Wolfpack punter Preston  Poag watched a snap sail over his head and out of the end zone.  </P> <P> Virginia Tech 24, East Carolina 23 -- Quarterback Will Furrer completed 14 of  19 passes for 237 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Hokies (2-1) in a  nonconference game at Greenville, N.C.  </P> <P> East Carolina (1-2) pulled to within 24-23 on a 31-yard touchdown run by David  Daniels, but defensive end Jimmy Whitten blocked the extra-point try to keep  the Hokies in the lead.  </P> <P> William &amp; Mary 37, Villanova 14 -- Quarterback Chris Hakel ran for two  touchdowns and passed for another as the Tribe won a nonconference game at  Williamsburg, Va.  </P> <P> Hakel completed 16 of 26 passes for 222 yards as William &amp; Mary evened its  record at 1-1. Villanova (1-1) was held scoreless in the second half.  </P></p>

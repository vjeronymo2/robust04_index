			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 25 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said Friday that uncertainty clouds the North Korean  nuclear issue because Pyongyang has yet to follow up on its  decision to permit nuclear inspections last week.    Han told the National Assembly Committee for Foreign Affairs  and Unification that North Korea's acceptance of International  Atomic energy agency (IAEA) inspections provided the world with  an opportunity to continue efforts to solve the problem through  dialogue. However, he said, if North Korea does not issue visas  to IAEA inspectors soon, the IAEA will inevitably have to take  strong steps.    "North Korea is delaying the issuance of visas, linking the  start of IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear sites to the  third round of high-level talks with the United States," Han  said.    The foreign minister told lawmakers that North Korea and the  United States met Tuesday and Wednesday after holding a contact  on Feb. 15, the day that North Korea announced its acceptance of  nuclear inspections, to arrive at some kind of understanding.    Han said: "At the recent contacts, Washington told Pyongyang  that the IAEA nuclear inspections should be completed  satisfactorily and that suspension of `Team Spirit,' the South  Korean-U.S. joint military exercise, should be realized only  after an exchange of special envoys between South and North  Korea. Only then, U.S. officials stressed, can North Korea and  the United States hold the third round of high-level talks. But  North Korea is insisting that the third round of high-level  talks be held at an early date."    Once Pyongyang and Washington meet for the third round,  inter- Korean dialogue on pending issues including  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula can start. In  addition, consultations between the IAEA and North Korea on  instituting full nuclear safeguards can move forward. He  emphasized that to solve completely the nuclear problem, IAEA  inspection of Pyongyang's two undeclared nuclear sites and  mutual inspections by South and North Korea should be carried  out.    "If it is disclosed that North Korea diverted nuclear  material for other than peaceful purposes as a result of the  IAEA inspection, or if it is deemed unsatisfactory, then North  Korea will again face a serious situation," Han said.    The goverment expects North Korean action to enable the IAEA  to begin nuclear inspections immediately, so that a solution to  the problem can be found, according to Han.</p>

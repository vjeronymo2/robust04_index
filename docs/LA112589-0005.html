			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC FOR A STELLAR GENERATION;  </P> <P> SPACE: 'THE PLANETS' EXPRESSED AWE AND MYTHOLOGY; WHERE IS THE SYMPHONY TO  ACCOMPANY US INTO THE FUTURE?  </P> <P> Gustav Holst began writing "The Planets" in 1914. Its first performance, five  years later, was a symphonic celebration of planets Mercury through Neptune  (Pluto wasn't discovered until 1930). The music is beautiful and grand -- but  something is lacking. Despite its variety, there is no human adventure. The  planets, in those days, were still "gods" -- remote, aloof in a separate,  self-contained universe, hermetically sealed from human interaction or  contamination. The solar system was a very large and inaccessible place for  mortals.  </P> <P> Now another piece of music has played out; the last note of Voyager's Neptune  encounter fades into the vacuum as the spacecraft departs our solar system, to  be succeeded in the public mind by the discordance of the Bay Area earthquake  and Eastern European upheavals. But we come not to bury Voyager; rather to  praise. The brief encounter with Neptune was not an ending but a prelude to a  larger quest and a longer symphony.  </P> <P> After Voyager, the gods no longer reign. The planets belong to humankind.  </P> <P> The outer planets and their satellites were but tiny, pretty baubles in our  skies before Voyager's flight to Neptune and beyond. Now they are worlds in  their own right, concrete and beautiful in their gargantuan presence.  </P> <P> Gustav Holst was born too early. How was he to know the adventure of the  planets and man's place among them? There was no way then to experience, even  vicariously through the eyes of a Voyager, the pastoral solitude of  interplanetary cruising; the rolling, thundering crescendo of planetary  encounter.  </P> <P> I imagine him looking over our shoulders, following Voyager across the sky.  NASA's Goldstone antenna, a white leviathan in the center of an empty desert  stage, glows in a fading twilight, hard bright stars overhead, the silence of  the horizon dropping away into pink-gray distance. Why is it that this sight  and silence seems so much like music? Gustav, are you listening? Can you hear  the slow-motion turning against the sky?  </P> <P> It's time for a new musical genius to bring us a modern symphony of adventure  among the planets, of man's place among the gods. Let us hear the chaos of  departure from Earth's surly bonds, the basso profundo of planetary encounter.  It's time for that symphony, and I hope someone will write it, because it is  the beginning of a story of human drama of Wagnerian proportion. It will help  to tell us where we are and where we're going.  </P> <P> And where is that? "To the supermarket," some will say. "My feet are firmly  planted on Earth, and I'm going to work, I'm going home, I'm going to the  hospital to visit a friend. I need to tend my garden."  </P> <P> Worthy activities, but our children, or perhaps our grandchildren, are going to  live in space. The urge to explore and expand is inborn. We are going, sooner  or later, because we have no choice. Cast aside any debates about manned versus  unmanned space exploration. They are irrelevant.  </P> <P> As a species, we will begin by colonizing the solar system. We will break  ourselves -- bodies and spirits -- on new shores, and we will regroup and  plunge again, groping for dry land. Careers will be spent, lives lost in the  quest. Music will help us mend, and drive us forward again.  </P> <P> Many will not share our enthusiasm -- will not want to assume the hardships of  pioneering. They are the equivalent of the Europeans who stayed behind,  concerned with the problems of the Old World while explorers looked to the new.  </P> <P> Let them be. Very few will be able to go, anyhow. We will need their help, a  large home base for support while we explore and settle, until we are  independent. And what will explorers do for our homeland, our mother Earth at  that time? Probably the same thing that the United States of America did for  England in 1776. Children have no responsibility to their parents; only to the  children that follow.  </P> <P> Voyager represents the beginning of a magic age. Its goodby to Neptune is our  hello to the solar system. The journey will begin with small steps: footprints  on Mars, new ones on the moon. Every step will be hard-fought, but eventually  we will inhabit most of the solar neighborhood. At that point, we'll begin to  get restless again -- we'll turn up our music and consider how to follow  Voyager on a questing note, a trip to the stars.  </P></p>

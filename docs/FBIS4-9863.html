			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 Mar (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina wished newly elected OAS Secretary General Cesar  Gaviria success in leading that organization.    Our hope and wish is that he will be successful in his new  role, Robaina said in a statement to PRENSA LATINA when asked  about the nomination [as received] of the current Colombian  president to that important regional post.    Regarding the Colombian daily EL TIEMPO's retraction of  previous reports on an alleged guerrilla summit in Havana --  another current topic relating to that South American country --  Robaina simply said: "EL TIEMPO admitted we were right."    Robaina made that statement upon welcoming Zambian Foreign  Minister Remmy Kaindu Gilly Mushota [title as received], who  arrived in Havana today on an official five-day visit.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Euroc sells 18.3% stake in Aker EUROC, the Swedish cement group, has sold its 18.3 per cent shareholding in Aker, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, for SKr640m (Dollars 86.5m). The share stake has been sold to a number of institutional Norwegian and foreign investors. Euroc said it would make a capital gain of SKr60m on the deal and that as a result annual earnings would improve by about SKr40m. Euroc said the disposal would reduce the group's interest-bearing debt by NKr560m (Dollars 82.3m) to NKr3.2bn and strengthen its balance sheet. Aker said that more than half of the shares were placed in Norway among several institutional investors. Norway's state social security fund becomes Aker's biggest shareholder with 13.2 per cent. Uni Storebrand, the big insurer, will hold 9 per cent. Aker would not be drawn on details of the foreign investors. Mr Tom Ruud, Aker's chief executive, said the disposal had improved liquidity and cleared the way for the planned listing on the London stock exchange.</p>

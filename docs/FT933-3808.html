			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Publishing operations lift earnings at Paramount PARAMOUNT Commun-ications, the US media group rumoured to be considering a merger with Viacom Communications, has posted first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 120.4m, or Dollars 1.01 a share. A year earlier, the publishing, entertainment and theme parks group earned Dollars 114.3m or 96 cents. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.35bn from Dollars 1.06bn. The gain was led by near-record operating income from Paramount's publishing side and from sharply higher returns from its entertainment business. On Wall Street, shares in Paramount rose Dollars 4 1/4 to close at Dollars 61 1/8 . The stock gained Dollars 1 7/8 on Thursday amid speculation that Paramount was discussing a stock-swap with Viacom which would value Paramount at about Dollars 60 a share. The companies would not comment on the rumours, but it is believed that Mr Martin Davis, Paramount's chairman and chief executive has had informal discussions with Viacom's chairman Mr Sumner Redstone, for several years. Paramount has been looking for a merger partner since 1989, when its Dollars 200-a-share bid for Time failed. A merger between Paramount and Viacom would create a company with extensive cable and broadcast operationsas well as film and publishing businesses. Paramount, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 4.27bn, owns a leading film studio and television production company, as well as the Simon &amp; Schuster book publishing house and New York's Madison Square Garden sports arena. Viacom, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 1.86bn, is one of the most powerful players in cable television. Its networks include MTV, Nickelodeon and Showtime. Viacom is expanding overseas. MTV has recently entered Japanese and Latin American markets, and has a growing presence in Europe. The company also has an impressive television library of classic American TV shows. Paramount's entertainment division posted first-quarter operating income of Dollars 89m, up from Dollars 60.8m. Results benefited from box-office successes such as The Firm and Indecent Proposal. Paramount said its entertainment results also benefited from higher operating income from its theme parks. Analysts at Salomon Brothers noted that half of the revenue gain and about 75 per cent of the operating profit rise came from Paramount's four domestic and one international theme parks, acquired late last year. But Madison Square Garden deepened its seasonal loss. The publishing division posted record revenues for the quarter, led by strong gains from its educational books. Operating income from television programming fell in the quarter. Although syndication sales of popular shows such as Cheers and Star Trek: the Next Generation advanced, results at Paramount's jointly-owned cable operation, USA Networks declined.</p>

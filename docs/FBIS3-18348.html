			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by political correspondent Emily O'Reilly: </F> "Clarified: Why There Won't Be a Yes Or a No"]    [Text] Apart from flashing it in neon on Martin McGuiness's  forehead, the message from the weekend Sinn Fein Ardfheis  [annual conference] could not have been clearer: there will be  no definitive response to the Joint Declaration until and unless  the British reopen direct contact with the Provisional movement.    That line was given its clearest airing in the speeches of  Gerry Adams and Mr McGuiness, but it ran through the bulk of  contributions from the floor during the debate on what Sinn Fein  calls the Irish peace initiative.    It is not a new line. Sinn Fein's demand for direct talks  with the British in advance of a response to the Declaration has  been stated almost from the beginning of this phase of the peace  process. But the party used the opportunity of the hugely high  profile Ardfheis to ensure that neither the Irish nor the  British Government could be in any doubt about their intentions.    Sinn Fein insist that any such contacts would deal with  "clarification." The British, who have refused to reopen the  secret channels of communication, insist in turn that what Sinn  Fein want is tantamount to negotiation. The truth, as ever, is  in between.    Sinn Fein want the British to spell out their ultimate  intentions for the North -- they want to know how far that  government will go in forcing a political settlement between the  Unionist community in the North and nationalist community of the  whole island. They want to know, in effect, if Britain is  prepared to drop the Unionist veto.    The dropping of the veto would allow for the sort of  national  self-determination Sinn Fein wants: the island as a whole  deciding a political settlement free of the "impediment" of the  Unionist right to say No. To use a much over used phrase, Sinn  Fein wants a level playing pitch.    The flexibility and acknowledgement of the need for Unionist  consent that Sinn Fein speaks of is always in the context of a  post-veto Ireland. They insist that they will accept any  political settlement agreed to by the people, as long as all the  people of the island decide on it.    But this also implies that while Sinn Fein would find  Unionist consent desirable, that community's right to opt out of  some future arrangement would be severely limited. How strong a  voice would the Unionists have in the context of a 32-county  poll?    It is unlikely now that anything the Irish Government says  or  does to the Provisional movement is going to budge them from  their current position on direct contacts with the British.    Albert Reynolds cannot deliver what Sinn Fein wants even it  it was his political desire to do so. It is the British who  govern Northern Ireland who alone will decide its future.    Sinn Fein are also confident that the contacts with the  British will be reopened, though not in the short term. Indeed,  the party may be looking towards a post-Major administration  before the talks begin again.    But they already believe there is evidence that even this  administration is budging. Sir Patrick Mayhew's pleasant  sounding noises in the direction of Northern nationalists last  week, plus John Major's conciliatory article in the Irish News,  have been interpreted by Sinn Fein as a sign that the British  are softening their "no contacts" stance.    Sinn Fein logic naturally suggests that if the party  continue  to hold out for those contacts, then the British will eventually  relent.    They believe, in any case, that the British are now well  down  the disengagement road. They even acknowledged, for the first  time, that the Joint Declaration was a nationalist advance, as  was, they say, the Anglo Irish Agreement -- a document they  vehemently rubbished at the time.    Sinn Fein naturally believe that both advances emerged  directly from the Provisionals' ballot box-and-armalite tactics.  And, therefore, why should they now abandon such a "successful"  strategy, given their belief that the British are moving just  the way they want them?    The Government must now be aware that Sinn Fein have in  effect rejected the Declaration. It is not enough in itself to  engage them -- their old demands on the British remain.    Following the Ardfheis it will now be virtually impossible  for the Taoiseach [Irish prime minister] to state that Sinn Fein  must be given more time. They have made their decision -- they  want dialogue with the British and out of that dialogue they  want commitments to a British policy change on the Unionist veto.    The Government knows that is not achievable in the short to  medium term. Furthermore, they have signed a binding agreement  acknowledging the right of that veto to remain.    What options are now open to them? A resuscitation of the  talks process now seems inevitable.    However, the Government is unlikely to have much appetite  for  that, given the failure of previous talks to deliver anything  before and given the Taoiseach's belief that such a process  would have its best chance of success in an atmosphere of peace.</p>

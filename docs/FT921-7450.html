			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Good time to invest in German bonds NOW IS a good time to invest in German bonds, according to Mr Ulrich Ramm, executive vice-president in charge of analysis and corporate communications at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. Equities will depend more on a satisfactory outcome to this year's difficult wage round. 'Last year most investment was in long-term deposits. Now we, and foreigners, are optimistic for the medium term.' He expects inflation to peak in April at 4.5 per cent, and decline to 'three point something' in the second half. 'That means a good time for investors on fixed interest rates.' 'The equity market is a bit problematic with the current wage negotiations. The wage settlement in the steel industry was too high, but there is a chance the banks will get a deal not above 6 per cent. That would be a signal for the public sector and boost shares.' Mr Ramm expects interest- sensitive sectors, such as financials, construction and consumer demand-related stocks, to react first, with engineering and exporters advancing later.</p>

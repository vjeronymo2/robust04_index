			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Ambassador and the Change of </F> Government in North-West Frontier Province"]    [Text] According to a British magazine, John C. Monjo, the  U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, has played an important role in the  change of government in North-West Frontier Province [NWFP] and  the appointment of Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao as chief minister.  He also facilitated Sherpao's appointment by persuading Mir  Afzal Khan and three other provincial assembly members to  support Sherpao. The haste and bad taste displayed by the  federal government in replacing the Muslim League government in  NWFP and the maneuvers it adopted to tame Mir Afzal Khan  indicate that something must have been wrong there. But no one  could guess that the U.S. ambassador, who has long been like a  viceroy in Pakistan, was also involved.    Reports kept circulating in the past that the U.S.  Government  and its ambassador played a very important role in the transfer  of power in 1988. The country was suffering political  instability then. It was suspected that (?messages) were being  sought from Washington. Nevertheless, the U.S. interest was then  believed to have been confined to major issues and federal  government affairs only. The latest report, however, indicates  that the provincial governments also are now at the mercy of the  U.S. ambassador. A question may be asked about the way the U.S.  ambassador established contacts with Mir Afzal Khan via Manzur  Wattoo and convinced him to support Sherpao? How can we  complain about the U.S. ambassador or any other person if our  politicians are dependent on the advice of others on issues  relating to national politics and the country's democracy, and  are devoid of the capacity to decide themselves?    In view of the U.S. attempt to shape Afghan affairs  according  to its own perception, the government should clarify whether it  wants to push the U.S. policy through the NWFP government or it  intends to promote and protect national policies and interests.  The federal government should also explain what price it has  paid or will pay in the future for the political benefit it is  accruing through the U.S. ambassador. The ambassador himself  should also clarify whether he interfered in the affairs of  NWFP, and if he did then in what capacity.</p>

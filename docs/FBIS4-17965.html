			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 17 of 67] </F>   [Text] According to politologists, the negotiations between  Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministers on a stage-by-stage  settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problem held on April 21-22 in  Sevastopol were fruitless. The delegations of two countries  have not signed any documents. At the same time the Russian  party refused to sign the protocol of the negotiations "due to  non-constructive position of the Ukrainian delegation," as one  of the members of the Russian delegation said. As experts  assert, Kiev's position presents the major stumbling-block  because it deems it possible to preserve the Black Sea Fleet in  Crimea only on a temporary basis and insists on a joint basing  of the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy in Sevastopol. At the  same time the parties reached an agreement stipulating that Kiev  would receive 18.3 percent of the Fleet's ships and Russia would  buy the remaining part. To this effect Admiral EDUARD BALTIN,  commander of the Black Sea Fleet, answered the questions put by  our Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov.    IF: The first and the major question which I would like to  put to you is the division of the Black Sea Fleet. All  Russians, but not only servicemen, are deeply concerned over  this fact.    E.BALTIN: This problem is unclear until now. The Ukrainian  side puts forward quite different variants regarding the Fleet's  division, including the 50:50 proportion. However, it is not  clear for me what this means. It is necessary to take into  account the value of the property destined to division but not  only its quantity. We should introduce definite factors. For  example, the value of one naval engineer college in Holland is  equal to the value of a half of the Black Sea Fleet because  there are many mechanisms and equipment in the college,  including atomic reactors for submarines of two generations.    At the present stage Ukraine proposes to Russia to divide  the  Black Sea Fleet after its inventory as of December 1, 1992, that  is as of the day I took the office of the Black Sea Fleet  commander. However, it is known that before this date Ukraine  had already misappropriated 35 percent of the Fleet, including  material reserves of the Black Sea Fleet's rear service.  According to available information, total losses of the Black  Sea Fleet are 101,658 million rubles in 1991 prices.    IF: What are the largest sites misappropriated by Kiev?    E.BALTIN: First of all, I'd like to note that Russia has  lost two naval colleges and a unique center for re-training of  naval aviation pilots - it was the sole center in the USSR; the  country paid several billion rubles for its construction. The  center was used for training of carrier aviation pilots. There  was a unique equipment for aircraft's landing, a runway strip  with warming, a springboard, etc. A factory for the repair of  all major kinds of the Fleet's aviation equipment was in the  center in addition to the training base. Now Kiev tries to let  this center to Russia. In my opinion, it would be erroneous to  rent it because for Moscow it would be a gold rent - a company  of SU-27 aircraft assigned to the 60th corps of Ukraine's air  defense forces, an aviation grouping near the city of Saki, and  the Ukrainian garrison will be maintained at the expense of this  rent.    In addition, there is an agreement between the governments  of  the Russian Federation and Ukraine on the cooperation in the  sphere of ship building and ship repair signed on January 15,  1993 by the former Ukrainian premier Leonid Kuchma and Russian  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. In accordance with this agreement  the Russian party pledges to supply Kiev with accessory  equipment, material resources, armaments, and other military  equipment for the ships being built by Ukraine's Navy.    Kiev has received a missile cruiser Slava, minor  antisubmarine and assault landing crafts, and a patrol boat.  These ships were almost ready for exploitation (their readiness  was 65-85 percent). The time has passed but Ukraine has not  built a single ship. However, it has re-named the missile  cruiser two times, at first it was called Bogdan Khmelnitskiy  (the initiator of Ukraine's reunification with Russia in XVII  century - Interfax) and now - Vilna Ukraina. It is almost  ready for 90 percent and Kiev has no force to finish its  construction. Meanwhile, the cruiser has 16 rocket launchers  with the range 500 kilometers. There are no such ships either  in the Black or in the Mediterranean Seas, or in the composition  of the 6th Fleet of the US Navy...    Besides, the Ukrainian party started to dismantle the  cruiser  Varyag at the Nikolayev shipyards which was almost ready for  service; Ukraine intends to cut the cruiser for metal. The  cruiser Ulyanovsk can face the same fate. Destruction of the  Fleet is practically underway. I believe that in this case  Ukraine has inflicted damage not only to Russia because these  ships were the national treasury of all peoples of the Soviet  Union.    IF: It's not quite clear, why do we need to make inventory  of the Black Sea Fleet if a strict registration of all material  resources is obligatory held at the Fleet...    E.BALTIN: I believe that this inventory is nothing more but  an attempt of the Ukrainian party to prolong solution of this  issue and to avoid the agreements reached by Russian and  Ukrainian presidents earlier and a strive "to dig in an alien  bag." Both Russian and Ukrainian military departments know  everything about the Black Sea Fleet, they know about every  screw, not speaking about the ships.    I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta  agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training  of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on  the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money.  For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript,  which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more  than 5000 dollars. Ukrainian mariners are undergoing a more  serious training in the training detachments of the Russian  Black Sea Fleet and receive military professions almost free of  charge.    The majority of Ukrainians (thousands of them are on service  in the Black Sea Fleet) finish their training in the rank of  petty officers and are well-trained. As a commander, I do not  have any claims to mariners who swore the oath of allegiance to  Ukraine, they serve splendidly. Especially strong personnel is  being called up in Ukraine's western regions where conscripts  undergo moral training in military commissariats. The  conscripts are explained that they will be Ukraine's "gold fund"  and the Ukrainian people need them badly. There have been no  inter-ethnic conflicts among rank-and-file personnel. Ordinary  people understand everything.    IF: But it is quite natural that Ukraine needs its own Navy.    E.BALTIN: I believe that Ukraine claims for a part of the  Black Sea Fleet ships only in order to immediately sell them  abroad as scrap amounting to 120-140 dollars per ton. At the  same time, currently Kiev is experiencing the deepest crisis and  does not understand what threat for the country pose those  thousands of mariners who will be thrown into streets.    IF: Once upon a time you said that there is little water in  the Black Sea and much politics...    E.BALTIN: The situation has not changed. As a matter of  fact, there is too much politics around the Black Sea Fleet but  economy decides everything. I believe that extreme political  decisions are adopted at the time when the country's leaders  understand that the economy is experiencing a crisis. This  results in a confrontation between peoples.    IF: Over the last period of time several Ukrainian  politicians, including high-ranking ones, have voiced their  statements to draw "a third party" to solve the Black Sea Fleet  problems, they even called a concrete address -- the United  States. What is your attitude towards this fact?    E.BALTIN: I can express only my perplexity on this case.  Personally I categorically oppose Washington's participation.    It's primarily Russia's problem. Given historic and  political realities, Moscow is negotiating with Kiev. It's  hardly probable that the Russian Federation will negotiate on  the Fleet with the involvement of the American party.    In general, I believe that having interpreted the Moscow  agreement signed by presidents Kravchuk and Yeltsin on its own  way, Kiev has violated one of the major articles of this  agreement, namely on separate basing of the Russian Black Sea  Fleet and Ukraine's Navy. I am convinced that the presence of  two Fleets and headquarters in one place of stationing  disorganizes the work of the servicemen and destabilizes the  situation in Sevastopol.    In case the situation does not change, consequences can be  unpredictable.    In my opinion, absence of money for the construction of its  own base is the major reason of this position on the part of  Kiev. It's easier to live for somebody's money.    IF: What influence can exert the present situation in the  Black Sea Fleet on the international situation?    E.BALTIN: The activity of the West's forces on the Black Sea  is being strengthened because any vacuum in the political space  should be filled. Last year NATO's 15 ships visited the Black  Sea in accordance with planned exercises, with the participation  of Bulgarian and Romanian fleets as well. There has been no  such an intensive pressure before. According to available  information, a conference of NATO's Allied armed forces was held  late October which passed a decision to include the Black Sea  into the zone of NATO's interests.    According to the unanimously adopted document, a formation  of  NATO's ships consisting of 8-9 crafts should be created in this  region; it will exert control over the activity of other fleets  in the Black Sea.    Turkey has procured eight Knox frigates which are equipped  with missiles. The Turkish fleet has enormously increased its  missile potential.    IF: What is your attitude towards joint exercises which are  conducted between the fleets of the Russian Federation and NATO?    E.BALTIN: Such an exercise was conducted in the Norwegian  Sea  not long ago. One destroyer participated in it on the part of  the Russian North Fleet. A three-star admiral was aboard this  destroyer, However, a Norwegian rear admiral was commanding at  the exercises, it corresponds to the level of a brigade  commander...    IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy  Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him?    I'd like to note that in contradiction to the Yalta  agreements, since last August Kiev stopped to finance training  of the Ukrainian Navy personnel which is being carried out on  the base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet and takes much money.  For example, in the US Navy training of one naval conscript,  which is to last 48 days on international standards, costs more  than 5000 dollars.

A three-star admiral was aboard this  destroyer, However, a Norwegian rear admiral was commanding at  the exercises, it corresponds to the level of a brigade  commander...    IF: The Republic of Crimea has its first president - Yuriy  Meshkov. How you would build your relations with him?    E.BALTIN: Meshkov has made several resolute political moves  and this testifies to the fact that he is a resolute man; as any  military man I respect resolute people. At the same time I  believe that Meshkov has not made any constitutional violations.    IF: How the polemics around the Black Sea Fleet has  influenced its combat efficiency?    E.BALTIN: The level of combat efficiency has not lowered  compared, say, with 1990. The Black Sea Fleet has received  various awards for rocket firing, torpedo firings from  submarines, and for the operations of the tactical group of  missile boats. The marine infantry battalion on fire  preparation, which is the best in Russia, serves at the Black  Sea Fleet.    IF: What is your opinion concerning the plans to create a  Russian naval base in the Georgian port of Poti?    E.BALTIN: I see no sense in this idea. This zone is  deserted by the war; does Russia need this burden, is it not  beneficial to build a base on its own territory? There are  suitable places for this, say, in the region of Anapa. There  exist well developed infrastructures there. One should bear in  mind two notions, military necessity and economic expediency.  Any operation, even if it is thoroughly prepared, will fail if  it has no material support. Economy but not a military commander  is the major winner in a war.    IF: Are Russian ships on service in the Mediterranean Sea  now?    E.BALTIN: The Black Sea Fleet is permanently stationing  there  but given our economic opportunities the number of Russian ships  in the Mediterranean Sea is a minimum one, there are less than  ten ships there.    IF: Has the Black Sea Fleet suffered due to the fact that  Ukraine stopped power supply to Crimea for some time?    E.BALTIN: Of course, the Fleet has experienced several  losses, we were forced to use our own power supply systems,  diesel generators, and boiling-rooms, as a result we have spent  a great amount of fuel. It is known, that Ukraine is provided  with its own resources only for 30 percent, it receives the rest  amount from Russia. Consequently, Kiev has no right to speak  about possible energy blockade of Crimea.    In case it takes place, the Black Sea Fleet can lay several  underwater power cables via the Kerchenskiy bay to Russia within  two or three months and solve this problem. It is quite  possible from the technical point of view.    IF: They say that you perfectly shoot from any kinds of  arms...    E.BALTIN: This is my hobby. I think that every officer,  irrespective of the fact where he serves, should possess good  skills in order to shoot any kinds of arms.</p>

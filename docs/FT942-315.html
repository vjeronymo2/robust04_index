			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise firmer The performances of Enterprise Oil and Lasmo shares continued to indicate that, as the bid moves into its closing stage, the market believes that Lasmo will escape the clutches of Enterprise. That view was emphasised by news that three leading stockbroking firms, Nomura, UBS and Smith New Court, all independent of the bid battle, had advised clients to reject the Enterprise offer. Enterprise moved ahead 8 to 408p on turnover of 864,000 shares, while Lasmo held steady at 141p, still well below the bid value of around 170p a share. Turnover in Lasmo was a surprisingly high 6.3m, with a number of UK institutions said to have moved to buy the stock on the basis that it held long term attractions. It was pointed out by dealers that the buying of Lasmo had been carried out for account settlement and not for cash, indicating long term investment. It was said that the buying of Lasmo could have represented a 'cheap' way into Enterprise, in the event of it winning the bid battle. Marketmakers are now bracing themselves for a possible Enterprise raid for Lasmo shares, a move which is expected to take place from Thursday onwards, if Enterprise is seen to be within sight of victory. 'If there is no market raid, then the chances of Enterprise winning look pretty slim,' said one trader, who added that the market was also preparing for a sharp slide in the Enterprise share price if it wins control of Lasmo. The bid battle is thought to hinge on Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management, which speaks for more than 16 per cent of Lasmo stock.</p>

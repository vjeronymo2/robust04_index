They had a one-on-one conversation in the papal library.  Instead of 30 minutes envisaged by the protocol, the  conversation lasted for about an hour. Chernomyrdin told  reporters that the meeting was extremely effective and cordial.  Pope John Paul II remarked in Russian that this could not have  been otherwise as this is the first time a head of the Russian  government is received in the Vatican.    Later Chernomyrdin met with State Secretary Cardinal Angelo  Sodano. A guard of honour of Swiss guards salutted the  distinguished guest in the ceremonial hall of the Apostolic  palace.</p>

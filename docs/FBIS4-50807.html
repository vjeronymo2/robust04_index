			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporter Hu Qinghai (5170 3237 3189)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 May (XINHUA) -- Today in Beijing, the  Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in Business Activities  and the Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council jointly held  a forum on correcting the irregularity of spending public funds  on sightseeing tours abroad. Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the  State Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in  Business Activities, pointed out: The work of correcting the  irregularity of spending public funds on sightseeing tours  abroad has a good momentum, but the task remains very arduous.  All localities and departments should take a further step to  formulate measures, improve and strictly enforce rules and  regulations, perpetuate the correction results, prevent a  comeback, and strive for remarkable new interim achievements  this year.    State Councillor Li Guixian and Hou Zongbin, deputy  secretary  of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, attended  the forum and expressed their views on the matter. Others  present at the meeting included Li Shizhong, State Council  deputy secretary-general; Xia Daosheng, State Council Foreign  Affairs Office deputy director; and responsible persons of the  Foreign Ministry, the Public Security Ministry, and nine other  departments which have the authority to approve overseas travel  requests, as well as the responsible persons of the departments  of which more personnel are involved in overseas travel on  official business.    Xu Qing said in his speech: Generally speaking, all  localities and departments, attaching importance to this matter,  have worked in accordance with the central authorities'  instructions and seriously reexamined those overseas travels  which were actually sightseeing trips in disguised form made by  officials at government expense since 1 July 1992. Some  provinces and municipalities have sternly dealt with problems  discovered through the reexamination. At the same time, they  have stopped and canceled a number of unnecessary overseas  official business study tours and training activities. However,  the progress of the work is uneven. Other localities and  departments are not as serious and meticulous in reexamining  overseas travels, nor are they sternly dealing with discovered  problems. In some organizations and localities, the practice of  making overseas sightseeing trips in disguised form at  government expense remains unchanged. Some localities and  organizations are still organizing government-funded  inter-regional or inter-departmental overseas sightseeing tours.    Xu Qing put forward a three-point view on this year's work:    -- It is necessary to continue doing a good job in screening  the overseas travels which were actually sightseeing trips in  disguised form made by officials at government expense since 1  July 1992, and to stop the unhealthy tendency of making such  trips. No locality nor department is permitted to organize  government-funded overseas sightseeing tours under any pretext.  Anyone who makes an overseas sightseeing trip in disguised form  at government expense should be required to pay the "three  expenses [san fei 0005 6316]" and be dealt with seriously. To  deal with the travel regulations violators, we must not merely  warn them not to repeat the violation.    -- To stop the unauthorized overseas sightseeing trips, we  should take both stopgap and radical measures this year. The  stress of the work should be put on stopping unhealthy  tendencies, enforcing discipline, and preventing a comeback.  First, we should get at the root of the problem. In  particular, the central government organs should proceed from  strictly formulating official business overseas travel plan and  examine official travel requests in a responsible way. Second,  we should closely watch the applications for travel to popular  destinations and resolutely reduce excessive overseas travels.  Third, we should stop any government-funded overseas travels  processed through the tourism department and improve the control  of overseas training activities by the proper departments.  Fourth, it is necessary to improve rules and regulations and the  procedures for examining and approving overseas travel  applications.    -- It is necessary to step up supervision and inspection,  and  to accept the supervision by the masses. Any organizations or  individuals who violate the travel regulations should be placed  on file for investigation and sternly dealt with.    The responsible persons of the State Science and Technology  Commission, the National Tourism Administration, and the State  Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs delivered reports at the  meeting on their efforts to correct the irregularity of overseas  sightseeing tours at government expense.</p>

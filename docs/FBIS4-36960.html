			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, 11 Jun -- "MINURSO," the UN mission in charge  of organizing the referendum in the Sahara, refuted the news  reported by the "Polisario" [Popular Front for the Liberation of  Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] from Algeria, which maintained  that several thousand Moroccans have arrived in the Sahara.    A MINURSO official pointed out to AFP that "we have not  noticed anything, and we have not seen any vehicles carrying  persons to Laayoune, where the mission's headquarters are, and  we have not received any information in this respect from other  Saharan towns."    In a statement published in the capital Algiers, the  "Polisario" had announced the arrival of several thousand  Moroccans to the Sahara [word indistinct] in hundreds of buses.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> A MIGHTY BLOW FOR FRIENDLY PERSUASION  </P> <P> The drama of China and the Soviet Union today lies in the tension between  liberalization and democratization. The drama yet to come is the conflict  between the dream of democratization and its achievement.  </P> <P> Liberalization is what an authoritarian system's leaders concede to prevent  democratization. China's students, and the others demonstrating in Beijing and  other cities, ask for democratization, and China's situation has probably now  gone beyond the point where further liberalization by the leadership could  successfully deflect these demands. The government no longer appears to possess  the ability to reimpose itself. Even if it managed to convince the army to  attack the demonstrators, its authority has been wasted.  </P> <P> The students condemn corruption, social inequalities, political compromise. But  inequality and compromise are essential ingredients, and corruption an  inescapable one, in the reforms Deng Xiaoping has been carrying out in China --  to the extravagant praise of the same foreign commentators who now celebrate  the students. These are the reforms which have made China's economic progress  possible and presaged today's events.  </P> <P> Twenty years ago another generation of students was against just the same three  things: compromise, inequalities, corruption. They called themselves the Red  Guard and demanded "extermination" of the "devils and demons of revisionism."  They had a leader; they were driven by the messianism of the aging Mao Tse  tung.  </P> <P> There is no Mao today, thank God. There also is no evident force capable of  taking the place of a ruined government and producing a constructive solution.  There is messianism, unfocused. All that has happened is now to produce a  marvelous abstraction, a shining, beautiful something. It is wonderful,  alluring -- but no one should be surprised if it ends badly.  </P></p>

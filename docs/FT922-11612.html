			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: US selling hits drug stocks PHARMACEUTICAL stocks dropped sharply in afternoon trading. The falls in Glaxo, Wellcome, SmithKline Beecham and Reckitt &amp; Colman were responsible for almost 8 points on the FT-SE 100 Index. The initial pressure came from the US. Shortly after New York opened yesterday afternoon, trading in US pharmaceuticals group Merck was suspended in reaction to a large sell order which could not be matched with a buyer. Merck had produced disappointing results last week. It was down Dollars 1 7/8 by the time dealing was halted and was expected to reopen a further Dollars 4 lower. In London, dealers reacted by marking down any UK pharmaceutical companies with shares held in the US. Glaxo, 27 per cent owned by US investors, fell 35 before closing 19 1/2 off at 728p. Wellcome, weak all day, partly because of a large overhang of stock and also following a presentation, by Bristol Myers Squibb, of the US, about a possible rival to Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir, weakened further to close 47 down at 1027p. SmithKline lost 17 to 799p in spite of first-quarter results in line with forecasts. Reckitt has virtually no exposure to US markets but still retreated 18 to 650p. After London closed, trading in Merck restarted and the shares were quoted around Dollars 4 3/4 off in New York. Dowty races ahead Turnover in Dowty Group leapt to 17m shares, around 7 per cent of its issued equity, and the stock jumped 32 to 177p, making it the best performing stock of the day in percentage terms, after TI Group's Pounds 482m bid for the company. Some investors took the view that the bid was a 'one way bet' in which they gain in the event of a counter-bid from Smiths Industries, said to have had long standing ambitions on Dowty, or as a cheap way of getting into TI should the offer succeed. While many City analysts see the offer as a 'knock-out price', a few observers refused to rule out a counter bid by Smiths. Talk of an alternative offer from Smiths, along with two large lines of stock overhanging the shares, left Smiths 6 lighter at 308p after an initial rise. TI tumbled 47 to 669p, the biggest percentage fall of the day, with analysts remaining concerned about the dilutive effect of the bid on the company over the next two years. A steeper fall may have been prevented by the view that success could herald TI's entry into the FT-SE 100 Index. Power generation and regional electricity companies were hit by a statement from the National Grid that capacity could exceed demand by 57 per cent by 1997-98. However, analysts said the figure appeared massively overstated and was based on the assumption that new power stations would be built when there was no chance of making a return on them, and no out-dated plants would be shut down. The Electricity Package fell Pounds 62 to Pounds 3128. the Scottish generators bucked the trend, gaining ground ahead of the deadline for making a second payment on the partly-paid stocks. County NatWest said Scottish Power, up a penny at 98p on turnover of 17m shares, was the cheapest stock in the utilities sector and was likely to outperform the market by 15 per cent. Scottish Hydro-Electric rose 1 1/2 to 103 1/2 p on turnover of 8.6m. Kleinwort Benson successfully placed 8.93m new shares in property development and construction company Wilson (Connolly) at 192p. The placing with various institutions raised Pounds 17m and Wilson gained a penny to 200p. Lloyds Bank was 10 1/2 better at 406p ahead of a reported meeting to discuss a possible bid for Midland. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew published a positive note yesterday examining the financial implications of a takeover offer above the one from HongKong and Shanghai Banking. Hard-hit insurers bounced cheered by news that London &amp; Manchester had seen combined new business growth of 33 per cent. The group's shares improved 10 to 265p. Guardian Royal Exchange, an old bid chestnut, rose 8 to 143p. A squeeze in ECC sent the shares climbing 21 to 571p as some 1m changed hands ahead of a listing of the stock in New York next week. Oil group Lasmo declined 5 to 207p as securities house County NatWest put out a cautious note on the exploration sector. The house prefers Enterprise (off 4 at 392p) to Lasmo. British Aerospace was volatile. The stock climbed 16 on the announcement of a new chairman but ran into sellers to close 5 ahead at 348p on turnover of 3m. Tate &amp; Lyle retreated 11 to 415p on news that Pepsico is to renew its previous 10-year agreement for the use of Monsanto's Nutrasweet sweeteners rather than change to Tate's Sucralose. Share volume in Queens Moat Houses rose to 7.6m and the stock firmed 2 to 84p after BZW, its joint broker, issued a 20-page note recommending the stock. ICI was up comfortably in the morning ahead of the anticipated announcement that it was selling its fibres division to Du Pont, of the US, and buying their acrylics arm. However, the shares receded to end a net 2 off at 1364p. One dealer said the whole market was concentrating on the possibility that Hanson might sell its 20m-share stake in ICI. Hanson eased a halfpenny to 234p. BZW was said to be the latest house to cut profit forecasts. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (223). AMERICANS (4) Amer.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 3 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance  (MOF) on Friday [3 June] announced the abolition of restrictions  on foreigners investing in domestic banks -- another step in  Taiwan's financial liberalization and internationalization.    Foreigners and overseas Chinese were barred from investing  in  domestic banks even after the government lifted the ban on the  establishment of new banks in 1990. But from now on, MOF  officials stressed, foreign investors will be allowed to open  new commercial banks on an equal footing with domestic investors.    Foreigners must still abide by Article 25 of the banking  law,  which sets the maximum stake of any one investor in a single  bank at 5 percent, the officials noted.    In addition, they said, the remittance of investment funds  should comply with the requirements for securities investment  and foreign exchange settlement by overseas Chinese and  foreigners.    The MOF and the Investment Commission under the Ministry of  Economic Affairs will jointly screen applications from abroad,  they added.</p>

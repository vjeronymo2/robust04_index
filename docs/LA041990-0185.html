			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> HOSTAGE: Ex-hostage David Jacobsen is optimistic about reports (A1) from Beirut  that a U.S. captive there could be released this weekend. . . . "The fact they  asked for John Kelly is significant," said Jacobsen, who now lives in  Huntington Beach. Kelly was the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon when Jacobsen was  released in November, 1986, after 17 months of captivity. . . . Also, this is  the holy month of Ramadan, he noted, a time when Islamic countries often grant  amnesty to prisoners. David Reyes and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

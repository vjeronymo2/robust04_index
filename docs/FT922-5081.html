			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Hopes rise for declining rate of inflation THE RECENT fall in west German import prices accelerated in April, reinforcing optimism that inflation is on the way down again. Export prices rose further, but the rate of increase appears to be slowing, writes Christopher Parkes in Bonn. Cheaper fresh produce and raw coffee, down by 15 per cent and 4 per cent respectively on the previous month, contributed to a 2.5 per cent overall reduction against April last year, the federal statistics office said yesterday. The drop followed year-on-year falls of 1.5 per cent in March and 1.2 per cent in February. The 1 per cent increase in export prices followed a 1.4 per cent increase in February and 1.2 per cent in March. May inflation of 4.5 per cent, compared with 4.6 per cent a month earlier, matched most forecasts. These also predict a decline to around 3.5 per cent in mid-year, when special levies imposed last July on oil and other goods, drop out of the reckoning. Germany's recent rounds of wage settlements have not brought about the turnaround necessary to curb inflation, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, warned in Washington last night, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt. In a speech delivered to the American Institute for Contemporary American Studies, he said this was serious, even though 1992 pacts had been somewhat lower than those reached a year ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Belyakov report: "All Eggs in One Basket"] </F>   [Text] Cairo, 10 Jan -- Evaluating the recently ended  10-day joint Kuwaiti-Russian naval maneuvers held within the  framework of the agreement on military cooperation between the  two countries signed in Moscow at the end of November, a  spokesman for the Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense described them as  "excellent."    It would be possible to welcome Russia's contribution to  ensuring Kuwait's security. But there is the troubling fact  that Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation has begun before the  normalization of relations between Kuwait and Iraq and so  inevitably acquires an anti-Iraqi complexion. The door to  cooperation with Iraq -- a rich and influential state with which  we used to be linked by very close ties -- has thereby  essentially been slammed shut. In such a situation it is hardly  rational, as our new friends, the Americans, say, to put all our  eggs in one basket.</p>

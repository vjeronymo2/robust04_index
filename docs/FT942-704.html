			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Arts: 'Rage' saved by the acting - Theatre There is not much rage in the new play at the Bush, despite its title. No heavy bombs either, despite the fact that it is set in Slough. Here is suburban, middlebrow drama, heavily influenced by television. The toast to the Bush is that they do it so well. Richard Zajdlic, the author, is currently contributing to the TV soap, EastEnders. Rage may seem an odd play for the Bush to pick up, but at least the choice shows the theatre's versatility. The director is Mike Bradwell who has worked at the Bush, on and off, for years and knows the place inside-out. He can stage a success even with a text that belongs to another medium. Nothing in Rage is particularly surprising. It is the tale of a two parent, two children family on the verge of a 20th wedding anniversary of a marriage that has nothing much to celebrate except survival. The husband is a GP long out of love with his wife, but not much enamoured of anyone else. The wife still clings to him. Daughter Kate is doing A levels. Son Nicky is a bit of a drop-out. Kate is on the conventional pill, prescribed by another doctor. Nicky is on anti-depressants, prescribed by his father. By the end of the celebration, Nicky has committed suicide, possibly having stabbed a police woman in the course of an unexplained crime. The rest is essentially an inquest into how the family got into such a position in the first place, plus a vignette of a local reverend coming to show sympathy and a sub-plot about the woman police officer and her detective boyfriend. If it were the play alone, there would be nothing to write home about. Rage is redeemed by remarkable acting. Sue Johnston as the wife has few memorable lines, but she succeeds by her presence and her voice in putting feeling into cliches. Nicky Henson as the doctor has a slow start, mainly coming home tired to reach automatically for the whisky and soda. Yet as he stands on the stage, shoulders hunched, you can see that he might once have been a medical researcher in America rather than a GP in Slough and does not wholly regret the decision to stay with the hum-drum, including his wife. None of the other parts quite match these two. The portrayal of the visiting cleric at a time of grief is a mixture of the cheap and the insulting. The sub-plot of the affair between the police officers is plainly indebted to David Hare's Murmuring Judges and remains pointlessly obscure. Nevertheless, Bradwell's production demonstrates that it is just about possible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear: mediocre play, wonderful playing. Bush Theatre, London W12, (081) 743 3388</p>

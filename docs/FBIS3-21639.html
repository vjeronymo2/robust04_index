			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eliseo Zamora (not further identified) by </F> mobile unit reporter Mariela Diaz; date and place not given;  monitored in progress--live or recorded]    [Text] [Zamora] ...the United States of America and the  South American drug producing countries decided that traffickers  should be forced to violate our air space occasionally, and  sometimes our jurisdictional waters, when choosing the fastest  route.    [Diaz] Does this mean that drugs are brought to Cuba either  by plane or by boat? And how far off the Cuban coast are these  packages dropped?    [Zamora] As you said, they try to violate our airspace and  our jurisdictional waters. Of course, we always try to take  appropriate steps to prevent such elements from violating our  waters and our airspace. And as I was telling you, although our  territory is not internally affected by drug trafficking or drug  consumption and is free of organized criminal groups dedicated  to international drug trafficking activities, Cuba keeps as a  priority the battle against this evil--the battle against those  actions that seek to use our jurisdictional waters and our  airspace for illegal drug trafficking operations, or as shelter  to avoid the antidrug forces that persecute them in neighboring  countries. Thus, when our nation is enduring a serious economic  crisis, the product of the double blockade against our country,  our government's response to this evil remains solid and firm.    [Diaz] Your explanation is very clear; but this is a country  with an economic crisis, and I believe this could lead to a  social crisis. Worse yet would be that such evils proliferate in  our country. My question to you was about Cuba's real situation  concerning drug consumption and trafficking.    [Zamora] As you know very well, from the very beginning the  Revolution has provided everything to our citizens so they can  develop all their potentials in the educational, cultural,  scientific, and technical fields. And this has prevented our  citizens from expressing any interest or need to resort to the  drug phenomenon. This is the basic reason, and often our friends  abroad cannot understand it because they cannot conceive that  this problem does not exist in Cuba. But we who live in the  fatherland know that this is true, and that the Revolution is  the basic element that has helped us stay away from this evil  that is adversely affecting mankind.    [Diaz] Precisely. Roughly, how many criminal actions were  reported in 1993? Can you provide those figures?    [Zamora] By all means. To have an idea of the scope of this  international phenomenon, in 1993 a total of 3,3364 kg of  cocaine were seized in 79 different operations, which is an  increase of 104 percent as compared to 1992. These drugs are  dropped in packages through a system called plane bombing, then  are collected by fast boats. In 72 cases these drugs were found  on the Cuban coast or floating on waters near Cuban territory.  And 27 kg were seized from traffickers who were either trying to  carry the drug into the country or out of the country. The final  destination of these drugs was the European countries and  Canada; but, of course, the objective was the use of our  airports.    [Diaz] On another occasion I will continue talking with  Eliseo Zamora about the National Drug Commission founded in Cuba  in 1989. I know there are people in their homes who are still  willing to listen to us, especially when dealing with such  important subjects as this one.</p>

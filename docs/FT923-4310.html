			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / President keeps date with Brazil military BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor made his first public appearance yesterday since being accused in a congressional report of involvement in a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal. Defying threats of mass demonstrations calling for his impeachment, Mr Collor attended the yearly military parade to mark Independence Day. The occasion was marked by tight security, and Mr Collor arrived by helicopter rather than the traditional open-top car. He did not inspect troops. The opposition dropped planned demonstrations as they did not want to upset the military. Instead they have called for a day of national protest against Mr Collor on Friday. However, the end of yesterday's ceremony was marked by boos. Mr Etewaldo Dias, Mr Collor's spokesman, said that 'this is a normal part of democracy. I heard applause as well as boos.' All but four of Mr Collor's ministers were present, in an apparent show of unity. They have reiterated their decision to stay on until the congressional vote on whether to impeach Mr Collor, due in the next few weeks. The latest poll of congressmen, by the Jornal do Brasil newspaper, found 342 in favour of impeachment - more than the two-thirds necessary. Mr Collor's most immediate threat could come from the attorney-general's office, which is considering opening a criminal case against the president. The police are investigating a computer disc obtained by the Inland Revenue from the offices of Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the president's former campaign treasurer, who is at the forefront of the corruption investigation. The disc apparently lists government contracts, successful bidders, the percentage of alleged kickbacks and names of those who received payments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In the evening of June 14 Abkhazia cut back by 80  percent the supply to Georgia of electricity produced at the  Inguri power station.    Vice Premier of the Abkhaz government, Vladimir Mikanba,  told  Interfax that this was in retaliation at the acts of sabotage  carried out by Georgian forces in the Gali region of Abkhazia.  Electricity cables were destroyed leading to a loss of supply to  a number of regions, including the capital Sukhumi.</p>

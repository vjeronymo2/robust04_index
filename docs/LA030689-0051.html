			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Four people in Angers, France, have been given short, suspended sentences and  fines of $7,500 each for attacking a theater showing "The Last Temptation of  Christ." They were convicted of throwing tear gas bombs and pouring acid on  seats last fall at a movie theater in Angers, which is about 180 miles  southwest of Paris. Theaters throughout France were attacked during showings of  director Martin Scorsese's film, and French fundamentalist Roman Catholics  condemned the movie as sacrilegious and disrespectful in its depiction of Jesus  Christ.

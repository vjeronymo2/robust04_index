			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zoubir Ferroukhi: "Truth in Prices Has Started!"] </F>   [Text] The sudden increase in the price of fuel, tobacco,  and matches will certainly trigger a movement of revolt and  indignation among motorists and smokers, but the most surprising  thing, no doubt, is that those price increases occurred long  after the budget went into effect.    That is one thing. As it happens, two theories can be  considered. Either the increases were included in the budget, in  which case the chapter on that subject was not visible to  everyone. Or they reflected a decision anticipated by the  government outside the strict framework of the budget. For  another thing, it is undeniable that the system of transparence  is still far from being the main concern of our decisionmakers.    There was nothing to prevent either of the firms involved in  those increases from informing the consumer ahead of time and  providing the necessary explanations rather than suddenly  slapping him with higher prices--which they did, moreover, with  very poor timing. It needs to be remembered, first of all, that  as far as fuel prices are concerned, Naftal [National Enterprise  for Refining and Distributing Petroleum Products] could not have  made the decision itself, since those prices are regulated by  the state.    Increases require an executive decree by the government, and  that decree came early this week, followed by a letter from the  Ministry of Commerce to Naftal asking the latter to raise its  prices: to 8.50 dinars [DA] for premium gasoline, DA7 for  regular, DA6 for fuel oil, and DA40 per bottle of butane  (compared to DA30 previously). It will be noted that the  sharpest increase involves fuel oil, and at Naftal headquarters  yesterday, we were told that the charge for a 13-kg bottle of  butane was still a long way from reflecting truth in prices. In  the case of the other fuels as well, experts feel generally that  current prices are too low, if only because fuel is considered a  quality product.    The theory that what this involves is simply an effort to  bail out the state budget and make up the deficit does not hold  up. The budget deficit borders on DA120 billion, and it would be  hard to swear that that amount could be adequately made up by  this means. It is also out of the question that these increases  were included in the budget. Whether they may have been included  in a supplementary budget bill is another matter. The government  therefore must have made the decision regarding the measures in  question, probably with an eye to the political effect such as  step would have in Washington, where a financial bailout for our  country is being negotiated.    The gradual approach to truth in prices could be a sign  intended for the IMF, which must see concrete evidence that the  Algerian Government wants to pursue an austere and rigorous  economic policy. The choice of fuels and cigarettes is probably  not an accident. Because automobiles are considered a luxury in  Algeria--partly because of the preoccupation with life's sordid  aspects--and tobacco is a harmful product, the social effect of  the increases is lessened. Other measures will follow, also with  some flexibility, apparently, since some sources say that milk  is going to cost DA5 and a loaf of bread DA2.50 after Aid el  Fitr. That will not hit people's pocketbooks too hard.    As far as the unions are concerned, the higher price of fuel  and tobacco is not overly disturbing the morale of the workers'  representatives. "It does not bother us," is the response we got  yesterday at the People's Center, where people are happy that  the increases are not affecting staples.    It should be pointed out, however, that the price of fuel  oil  in particular is going to have an effect on bus and train fares  and on other services where fuel oil is essential. But the  toughest part may be still to come as far as the UGTA [General  Union of Algerian Workers] is concerned, and the upcoming  negotiations with the government are likely to be very stormy.</p>

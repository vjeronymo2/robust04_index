			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Rice-transplanting is in  full swing on the Yomju plain in North Pyongan Province which is  situated in the northwestern part of Korea.    The farmers there who had assiduously made farming  preparations from early spring are transplanting rice seedlings  on 500 to 600 hectares of fields a day by raising the operation  rate of farm machines including tractors, rice-transplanting  machines and rice seedling-plucking machines and scrupulously  organizing work when the season of rice-transplanting came.    The Yomju plain is one of the nation's major paddy rice  producers.    Agricultural production in the plain called Pura plain  before  the liberation of the country was insignificant under the  Japanese imperialists' colonial predatory policy.    After the liberation it has turned into a fertile land  reaping bumper crops thanks to the correct agricultural policy  of the DPRK Government.    The state has invested huge funds to increase agricultural  production on the plain. It has built the Kuam, Sorim, Yonggok  and Kwangbong reservoirs, more than 200 pumping stations,  waterways extending several hundred kilometres and many  irrigation setups.    The establishment of the Amnok River irrigation system with  the Lake Manpung as the main source helped solve completely the  water problem on the plain where a proper farming had been  impossible for want of water, although it had a fertile arable  land.    As a result of the completion of irrigation, not a small  area  of fields and tidal flats have been reclaimed and, now, the area  under paddy rice is six times as large as that at the end of  1944, the year before the liberation of the country. In the  1980s, more than 8,800 hectares of tideland have been reclaimed.    There are over 20 cooperative farms on the plain. Each  cooperative farm has scores of tractors and trucks, various  trailing farm machines, rice-transplanting machines, rice  seedling-plucking machines and other farm machines and means of  transport.    Their level of the application of chemicals is high. The  amount of application of chemical fertilizers per hectare was  more than two tons on the plain last year.    Food grain production has annually increased. A gain of more  than 12,000 tons was registered last year above the previous  year.    In the same period, the income share of each farmer  increased  12 percent in grain and 28 percent in cash.    The production of meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables also has  increased markedly.    The rural villages, with cosy modern dwelling houses,  schools, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens and welfare and  service facilities well arranged against the background of  orchards, resemble a fairyland.</p>

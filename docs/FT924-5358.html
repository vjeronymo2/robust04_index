			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Miyazawa avoids supporting Patten MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday listened politely to the democracy proposals of Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, but said only that Tokyo 'understands' the proposals and did not give a clear signal of support. Japanese officials said Mr Miyazawa was concerned he would anger China by expressing support for the proposals to broaden Hong Kong's democratic base. The US, Canadian and Australian governments have already announced that they support the plan. Mr Patten is in Japan until tomorrow to raise the consciousness of Japanese politicians about the position of Hong Kong and to encourage economic links with British colony. In spite of the indecisive response from Mr Miyazawa, the Hong Kong governor said he was pleased with the discussion. 'I think that the Japanese government recognises that the matter of the joint declaration (between London and Beijing on Hong Kong's status) is a matter for Hong Kong, the UK and China,' he said. British officials said Mr Patten understands that it is not the Japanese way to give the stamp of approval to his proposals, but he is keen to have Japanese politicians more aware of the sometimes heated debate between China and the Hong Kong government. AP adds from Beijing: China yesterday criticised Mr Patten for seeking wider support for his proposed political reforms.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Knitwear merger at Grampian GRAMPIAN Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, is merging Pitlochry Knitwear, its knitwear retail subsidiary, with the privately-owned Edinburgh Woollen Mill. Under the deal Grampian will own 25 per cent of EWM, a retailing company with turnover of Pounds 58m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m in the year to January 31. Pitlochry achieved sales of Pounds 23m and pre-tax profit of Pounds 600,000 in the 12 months to end-December. The enlarged EWM will have 200 retail units in the UK, of which 89 are in Scotland, and should produce combined turnover of more than Pounds 90m in the current financial year. Both Grampian and EWM's main shareholders have agreed that they intend ultimately to float the company. Mr Bill Hughes, Grampian chairman, said that the two businesses would combine EWM's strong high street presence with Pitlochry's larger out-of-town units. EWM has demerged its manufacturing operations from its retail side, while Pitlochry closed most of its manufacturing and has transferred the remainder to EWM under a separate deal.</p>

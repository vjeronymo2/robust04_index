			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Letter: Too sanguine a view of past recovery and current prospects Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, January 9) is too sanguine in drawing parallels between the 1981-83 recovery in the UK economy and current prospects. He argues that the 1981-83 recovery took place despite rising real interest rates, and hence we should not worry overly about high and rising real interest rates in 1991-92. However, he neglects to notice two important factors fuelling the 1981-83 recovery, apart from falling nominal interest rates from late 1981, which were negative portents. First, in 1981-83, sterling fell at the same time as inflation, so that our international competitiveness recovered from the absurdly damaging levels of 1980-81. In contrast, since mid-1990, our international competitiveness has deteriorated sharply, although it has now stabilised. Second, 1981-83 saw dramatic financial deregulation. Hire purchase controls disappeared. The clearing banks marched into mortgage markets, more than doubling their lending volume in 1981 to over 20 per cent of the building societies' level, and to over 35 per cent in 1982. By contrast, since the 1989 peak of financial liberality, the Building Societies Commission has tightened prudential controls, the asset position of lenders has deteriorated sharply, and bitter lessons of the consequences of poor screening of credit risks have been learned. Financial liberality is now in partial withdrawal from the excesses of the late 1980s. Finally, debt-to-income ratios are higher than they were in 1981, though backed by higher asset-to-income ratios. As most econometric models underestimate the role of debt, there must be caution about more optimistic forecasts for 1992. Without endorsing the Liverpool position, I stick to the analysis in my piece on productivity and competitiveness in the Autumn issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy: a modest exchange rate adjustment in the context of a wider EMS realignment would carry little inflationary risk, provided domestic disinflationary policies remained in place. Since our competitiveness against dollar and yen currency areas is in even worse shape than against Europe, the only hope is for a spontaneous rise in the dollar and yen. This is likely to occur later in 1992, but the position now is grim. John Muellbauer, Nuffield College, Oxford OX1 1NF</p>

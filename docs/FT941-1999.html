			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Business and the Environment: US finds traditional disposal hard to beat - Strict government rules have failed to achieve their goal of cutting the use of landfills / Worldwide waste Solid and hazardous wastes in the US have come under increasingly complex laws and regulations. Starting with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, which set up a complete management system for hazardous wastes and established disposal criteria for other categories of solid waste, the federal government's restrictions have had far-reaching effects on waste management. Not all of the rulemaking has been successful. The Superfund legislation of 1980 and amendments of 1986 have had unintended consequences and have failed to achieve their main purpose, which was to provide for the clean-up of toxic dumps. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to push yet another Superfund reform through Congress. Government efforts to direct waste management practices have also stumbled over simple economics: traditional methods of disposal such as landfills have remained stubbornly cheap, while favoured approaches such as recycling have generated a glut of unsaleable materials. The US produces around 196m tons of municipal waste a year - about 4.3lbs per person and almost double the norm in other industrialised countries. The EPA estimates that the US spends about Dollars 35bn (Pounds 23.9bn) a year on collecting and disposing of municipal solid waste, managing hazardous waste and cleaning up underground petrol and chemical storage tanks. Spending in these areas is rising faster than on any other category of environmental regulation. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that cleaning up Superfund toxic waste sites alone - excluding dumps on federal government property - will cost a total of Dollars 75bn. A separate estimate by the University of Tennessee puts the price at Dollars 151bn. To deal with solid waste, the EPA has set up a hierarchy of management techniques: 1. Reduce waste by preventing its creation; 2. Recycle and compost as much as possible; 3. Incinerate or treat waste in other ways to reduce its volume; 4. In the last resort, landfill. Of these approaches, reducing the source of the waste may be the most promising because the cost to businesses of installing new equipment can often be offset by savings on reduced raw material consumption. Environmental groups also argue for consumers to play a role in source reduction through 'precycling': choosing products which use less packaging or avoiding throwaway products. Recycling has proved a more mixed blessing. Many states and cities have set ambitious goals: between 1989 and 1992 the proportion of municipal rubbish recycled rose from 9 per cent to 14 per cent, while the proportion sent to landfills dropped from 84 per cent to 76 per cent, according to the World Resources Institute's Environmental Almanac. Seattle is often cited as the example for recycling. In 1989, the city raised its charge for picking up a second rubbish bin from Dollars 5 to Dollars 9 per month, and lowered charges for customers who recycled. By 1991, that fee increase had cut the proportion of households who put out a second bin from 39 per cent to 11 per cent. With other initiatives on recycling and source reduction, Seattle cut the solid waste it was disposing of by a quarter. But with a sluggish market for recyclables, it can now cost Seattle Dollars 10 a ton to get rid of recycled newspapers where it was once paid Dollars 10 a ton, and the city has had to stockpile or even landfill some recyclables such as glass. Critics of the EPA's insistence that recycling must come before other waste management techniques say there is a natural limit at around 30 per cent recycling, where simple economics override government policy. President Bill Clinton's recent order that the federal government must double the recycled content of its paper to 20 per cent is expected to boost the recycled paper market. Incineration has also gained ground in some states, especially in the north-east. Maine and Massachusetts incinerate more than 40 per cent of their solid waste, while Connecticut incinerates nearly two-thirds. Incinerator construction is spurred largely by the difficulty some cities have in persuading other localities to take their rubbish for landfilling, but incinerators are still greeted with universal suspicion, and no one wants them in their back yard. Landfill ranks at the bottom of the hierarchy, and it had been widely expected in the 1980s that tougher operating standards imposed by EPA and by the states would also make it less attractive in financial terms. Although the number of landfills open to receive waste fell from 20,000 in 1978 to 6,000 in 1986, the anticipated shortage of landfill space has not materialised. With dumped volumes dropping off in the recession at the start of the 1990s, solid waste companies have seen their earnings fall. The one place where landfills have been filling up rapidly is in the Mississippi basin, where last year's floods produced a morass of debris and sodden sandbags. In most cases, however, dump operators had to waive fees. In the end, the sheer accumulation of waste at the rate of nearly 200m tons a year will lead to shortages of landfill space. But for the foreseeable future, landfills remain the dominant form of waste disposal because they are the cheapest.</p>

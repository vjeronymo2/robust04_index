			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: A measured view on monopolies - As he prepares to step down as MMC chairman, Sir Sydney Lipworth talks about the commission's role as corporate policeman Sir Sydney Lipworth is aware of the public debate raging about the structure of the UK competition authorities and their recent performance. But the phlegmatic, South African-born chairman of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission is not about to let the controversy cloud his last days in office. Sir Sydney who steps down after Easter after more than five years as MMC chairman is happy to let his record speak for itself. Since 1988 the commission has published 112 reports, one-third of the total published since the MMC was set up in 1949. That represents an average of 22 reports a year compared with an average of five a year in the previous 40 years. In addition to its core responsibility of vetting monopolies and mergers, the commission has taken on an extra role as arbitrator for the newly privatised utilities, and under the Broadcasting Act, for independent broadcasters. Yet the average time taken to complete inquiries has come down considerably since Sir Sydney took charge. Monopoly inquiries which used to take anything up to four years are now dealt with in nine or 12 months as a matter of routine. Merger inquiries which used to take six months are now completed in three. And, Sir Sydney believes, the quality of the commission's work has more than been maintained. 'The MMC is a first-rate institution doing a first-rate job,' he says. Much as you would expect from this no-nonsense lawyer turned businessman, Sir Sydney puts up a robust defence to some of the more strident criticisms levelled at the MMC in recent months. But his mind is not closed to change. He is not unsympathetic, for example, to recent complaints from industry that the structure of the UK's competition authorities results in too much duplication of effort between the Office of Fair Trading and the MMC. 'Theoretically there must be something in it because theoretically there is an element of duplication.' But he would need to be convinced of the actual saving to industry before he would be prepared to change a system which has stood the test of 45 years. 'I'm not sure a single body would produce a better analysis of a case in the end, but it might be cheaper. The real question is: will the final result be more or less comprehensive? I think we should look at it.' Sir Sydney is less tolerant of the suggestion that the commission has 'gone soft' recently in its monopoly-policing role. Critics say the MMC has paid too much attention to the views of the companies under investigation. In 1991, inquiries into photocopiers, instant coffee and soft drinks left monopolies largely intact. Compare that with the reports that helped to liberalise industrial gas supply and weaken the link between brewers and pubs in the late 1980s. The break-up of brewing is now regarded by industry observers as having backfired. Those who accuse the commission of going soft believe the government's rejection of some of the more radical elements of the beer report caused the commission to take a more cautious approach. Criticism of monopoly investigations reached a peak with last year's report on new cars. The Consumers' Association accused the MMC of ignoring an independent report which showed considerable price differentials between cars bought in the UK and on the Continent. Instead, the association said, the MMC relied too heavily on information given by the manufacturers, which claimed these differentials were not nearly as large in practice as the independent research suggested. Mr Stephen Locke, CA's director of policy, said the MMC analysis could 'only be described as deeply flawed', and seemed 'ultimately to have been swayed by the arguments of the manufacturers'. These criticisms are rejected by Sir Sydney. The responses to the new-cars report were 'superficial, knee-jerk reactions' which 'overlooked what the report actually said'. He accuses consumer organisations of giving vent to their frustration that the commission did not find the extensive differences between UK new car prices and those elsewhere in the EC. 'Popular expectation is not necessarily a good guide as to what is the right answer. You don't need to totally restructure an industry to come up with a sound solution,' he says. Another reason which has been suggested for the increased caution exhibited by the commission is the growing number of legal challenges to MMC reports. The commission has been judicially reviewed nine times in recent years. Again Sir Sydney disagrees. In his view the increase in legal challenges is in line with an overall increase in challenges to quasi-judicial decisions of all types. To a certain extent he welcomes the legal challenges. 'I'd hate it if a court found that we had acted unfairly, but otherwise I think it helps to keep us on our toes.' The commission has won all nine of its judicial reviews, a record of which Sir Sydney is proud. But in general the nine cases have drawn attention to ambiguities in the wording of the 1973 Fair Trading Act which he says is 'beginning to look a bit dated'. Is he in favour of wholesale reform of UK competition legislation? It has been suggested, for example, that it is an outdated concept to decide whether a merger should be allowed to proceed, or a monopoly allowed to survive intact, based on whether it is in the 'public interest'. Some competition lawyers argue that the criteria to be taken into account when judging the public interest, as laid out in section 84 of the FTA, are too vague. They argue the MMC needs a stronger direction to focus more directly and rigorously on competition issues, leaving to the trade and industry secretary wider public interest considerations, such as the balanced distribution of industry and employment. Sir Sydney is not opposed to reform of the public-interest test but remains to be convinced. For all practical purposes, certainly when vetting mergers, the 1984 so-called 'Tebbit doctrine', which made competition the primary criterion of merger reference policy, has kept competition at the heart of the public-interest test, he says. Ultimately, he adds, a decision on the public-interest test is a political one. Whatever is decided, the commission can adapt to it, he says. If the aim was to produce a degree of extra certainty for industry in the way mergers will be judged, then narrowing the test would be the answer. But the present criteria for judging the public interest does offer a degree of flexibility, allowing ministers exceptionally to refer cases to the MMC on wider issues. In general, however, he believes there is room for strengthening the wording of the Fair Trading Act and improving some of its procedural tests, such as the test for complex monopolies, which he says are 'a bit artificial'. Where does he stand on the government's proposed reforms of UK law on restrictive trade practices and abuse of market power? The restrictive trade practices white paper proposed the introduction of a prohibition on anti-competitive agreements backed up by a system of fines, with the MMC or a tribunal of specially appointed MMC members responsible for imposing penalties. The abuse of market power green paper envisages a similar role for the commission in dealing with anti-competitive behaviour by dominant companies. Some competition lawyers and consumer bodies believe that if the MMC is to continue to be seen as a dispassionate investigatory body then it should not become involved in the impostion of penalties which will inevitably be seen as harsh. Sir Sydney welcomes the proposed reforms of restrictive practices legislation and sees nothing wrong in principle in asking the commission to play a role in imposing penalties. He insists the MMC already acts as a quasi-economic tribunal and has the flexibility to do the job. Many of the remedies, such as divestment, which it now has the power to recommend, are just as harsh for the businesses concerned as any fine is likely to be. If there is real concern about the imposition of large fines, perhaps the courts could be asked to play a supervisory role, he suggests. He is less convinced of the need for significant change in the law on anti-competitive behaviour by individual companies, however. 'Looking back, I'm not aware of many cases which would have called for a prohibition and fines, as opposed to our current system.' As he clears his desk for the last time he will reflect with some pride on the business-like approach he has injected into the commission's work since 1988. 'I found the commission in good shape and I hope I am leaving it in good shape,' he says. In reality, he will be a tough act to follow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brcko, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Six people were  wounded in an artillery shelling of the Serb town of Brcko in  northeastern Bosnia on Sunday, the town's press centre said in  the evening. [passage omitted] The enemy was again shelling  civilan targets, mostly residential buildings, inflicting  extensive damage, and only rain, which has forced most people  off the streets, kept the number of casualties as low as it was.  This was the eighth artillery shelling of Brcko in the last  month, and fifth from the direction of Croatia. A total of  seven people were killed and 46 others were wounded in the  attacks. The local U.N. observer team has duly informed the  Tuzla-based command of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for  northeastern Bosnia and the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo of each  incident, lodging protests.</p>

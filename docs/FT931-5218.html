			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage protection blow - Halifax gets tough on policies MORE THAN 180,000 borrowers from the Halifax building society are being told that their mortgage protection insurance is to be more expensive and poorer value from April. This insurance is taken out by home-buyers to cover the cost of their monthly payments if they cannot meet them because of unemployment, accident or sickness. Halifax borrowers will see annual premiums on Mortgage Payment Protector rise from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.90 for every Pounds 100 of monthly benefit, while unemployment cover is being halved from 24 to 12 months. Some people, however, will face a rise from Pounds 5 to Pounds 6.90. Their policies pre-date Halifax's change of insurer to Financial Insurance Group and do not allow for a change to their terms and conditions. Halifax is getting round the problem by cancelling these policies and offering the new one instead. It says those affected are 'a relatively small proportion of the total.' The waiting period before the plan pays out remains unchanged at 30 days and those who claim accident and sickness cover will still be protected for 24 months. Borrowers do not have much choice. If they do not accept the premium increase, the policy will lapse. Halifax is the latest lender to make changes to its mortgage protection cover because increasing unemployment has caused a big rise in claims. In January, Abbey National announced it was raising premiums on its Paymentcare  -underwritten by General Accident - from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.95 for every Pounds 100 of benefit. It said the period of cover remained unchanged at one year for unemployment and three years for accident and sickness claims. The waiting period is three months. Bradford &amp; Bingley is in talks with its insurer, Eagle Star, over its mortgage protection policy, which is held by 30 per cent of borrowers. 'We will have to increase the rate because of the claims situation,' said a spokesman, who expected the rise to take effect mid-year. Bradford's existing policy costs Pounds 6 per Pounds 100 of cover for 12 months and the waiting period is 45 days. Mortgage protection insurance is rapidly becoming the kind of cover which is there when it is not needed and absent when it is. Usually, the policy is offered only to new borrowers or those taking out a home improvement loan. The assumption is that people would not take out a large loan if they thought they might lose their job. Many people who become unemployed qualify for state income support to help with mortgage interest payments. These cover half the payments for the first 16 weeks - without having to wait for up to 12 weeks, as many lenders demand  -and the full amount after that. But those who have taken out their own mortgage protection insurance are not eligible for the state benefit.</p>

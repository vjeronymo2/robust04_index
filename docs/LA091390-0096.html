			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL SIGNED TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD HOLDERS  </P> <P> Merchants will be prohibited from requiring customers to write their credit  card numbers on the backs of checks for identification purposes under  legislation signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The new statute, effective Jan. 1, is the result of a bill (AB 2880) sponsored  by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos). It swept through both the Assembly  and Senate with little opposition.  </P> <P> Some merchants argue that they need the credit card numbers to help protect  against bounced checks, but credit card companies don't cover bounced checks,  according to Areias. And the numbers can be illegally used by thieves to run up  huge bills on cardholders' accounts.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another consumer protection measure (AB 2920), also authored by  Areias, is awaiting the governor's signature or veto. It would prohibit  merchants from requiring customers to write their home addresses or telephone  numbers on the front of credit card slips.  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Bills Signed  </P> <P> Graffiti: SB 1977 by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) to allow the courts to  suspend or delay for one year the driver's license of a teen-ager who is  convicted of defacing property with painted or other graffiti.  </P> <P> Drugs: SB 2739 by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to  require state agencies that receive federal "war on drugs" funds to report to  the Legislature on how they plan to spend the money.  </P> <P> Video Games: AB 3280 by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-El Monte) to prohibit  video games for use by youths under the age of 18 from containing paid  advertisements for alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.  </P> <P> Police: AB 1720 by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) to require a state  study of the feasibility of establishing a college scholarship program for  prospective police officers. A report with recommendations will be made to the  governor and the Legislature by Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Judges: SB 2023 by Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) to increase prison  sentences for persons convicted of using an explosive device or arson for  terrorizing purposes at the home or office of a judge.  </P> <P> Private Colleges: AB 2670 by Assemblywoman Marian LaFollette (R-Northridge) to  require the state to put up freeway direction signs to private colleges and  universities with an enrollment of 1,000 or more if so requested and paid for  by private donations.  </P> <P> Absentee Ballots: AB 3586 by Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) to  require county election officials to post notices of the date, time and place  where absentee ballots will be opened and counted.  </P> <P> Miscellaneous  </P> <P> Procrastination: The Legislature sent Gov. George Deukmejian more than 1,500  bills during the hectic final week of the recently concluded session. The  Assembly and Senate had sent the governor only about 700 bills during the first  eight months of the year. Under the state Constitution, Deukmejian has 30 days  to either sign or veto the last-minute barrage of measures. He recently took a  verbal jab at the lawmakers by saying, "Procrastinating is human nature, but  it's time for the Legislature to take a good hard look at its practice of  passing hundreds of bills, many of which are not controversial, at the tail end  of the session."  </P> <P> Capital Fact  </P> <P> The Latin words "Senatoris Est Civitatis Libertatem Tueri" inscribed above the  state Senate chamber rostrum translate into "It is the Duty of the Senators to  Protect the Liberty of the People."  </P></p>

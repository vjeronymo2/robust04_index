			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) on Thursday became the first California  legislator to endorse a proposed "clean government initiative" that would limit  lawmakers to serving 12 years in each house of the Legislature, as well as use  public financing for political campaigns.  </P> <P> Killea said she will help support backers of the measure -- written by  California Common Cause, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, and San Jose Mayor Tom  McEnery -- who hope to gather 700,000 signatures to put the measure on the  November ballot.  </P> <P> "I believe this initiative has been unfairly portrayed as an attack on the  state Legislature," Killea said about a measure that has drawn opposition from  many current legislators. "It is not."  </P> <P> Killea also said she would support another ballot measure aimed at cleaning up  the Legislature's ethics image by banning the payment of speaking fees to  lawmakers while establishing a new commission to set legislative salaries. It  would also set a limit on gifts and tightens conflict-of-interest regulations.  </P> <P> The second ballot measure is being drafted by the Legislature in response to  recent scandals, including the conviction of former Sen. Joseph Montoya  (D-Whittier) on political corruption charges, as well as public opinion polls  that show the public holds its legislators in low regard.  </P></p>

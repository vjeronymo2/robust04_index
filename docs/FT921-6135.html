			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Taiwan's privatisation programme gathers pace / A report on the progress of the island's plan for selling off state assets TAIWAN'S sell-off of state assets is to gather pace in the next few months with the listing of another six public companies and new share issues for some companies which are already listed. The island's privatisation programme has progressed haltingly since 1989, when the ruling Nationalist KMT government's Council for Economic Planning and Development set up a privatisation task force to develop a master plan for the sell-offs. Official estimates of total revenue from the privatisation programme are around TDollars 1,000bn (USDollars 40bn) by 1996, which the government hopes to channel into its USDollars 300bn National Development Plan, designed to improve the island's infrastructure. Five state enterprises have been listed: China Steel, China Petroleum Development and three commercial banks. Twelve per cent of China Steel and 21 per cent of China Petroleum Development have been sold by public subscription and allocated by lottery. Foreigners are not permitted to buy in the primary market in Taiwan. Securities analysts say the initial discount of 40 per cent was unnecessarily wide, as prices have often doubled shortly after issue. However, some have since fallen back and China Petroleum Development has recently been around 5 per cent below the original issue price. The sell off of Yang Ming Shipping started on February 25. Six companies due to be listed beginning in April are Yang Ming Shipping, Bank of Communications, Tang Eng Iron Works, Farmers' Bank of China, BES Engineering, and Taiwan Fire and Marine Insurance. Another 15 per cent of China Steel will also be offered, including about USDollars 400m of shares in an international offering underwritten and co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs of the US. As much as half of this will be sold in European markets. Analysts say that although this next stage in the programme could bring an estimated TDollars 350bn to government coffers, complete government withdrawal from public companies is being impeded both by labour unions and politicians. Companies selected for privatisation are those which are losing the edge in increasingly competitive industries such as banking, steel and petrochemicals, they say. Under the current programme, a maximum of 51 per cent of each company will be sold off, so as not to saturate capital markets and in order that the programme should be completed by the year 2000. Although companies with a 49 per cent government stake are technically private, government influence could and would still be brought to bear. Mr Chen Po-chih, professor of economics at National Taiwan University, says a large proportion of shares will be absorbed by employee compensation deals, and that high remuneration packages for public sector employees and the political cost to the nationalist Kuomintang government of creating redundancies are the main contributing factors to the government's cautious approach. Mr Chen says that there is a tradition of favour-granting surrounding state-owned enterprises, and those with vested interests are digging in their heels. Other analysts have criticised the government for not moving fast enough to privatise healthy companies, and for privatising the poor performers too quickly in order to avoid responsibility for inevitable redundancies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR," "AZG" dailies),  05/17/94--Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze phoned the RA  [Republic of Armenia] President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and said,  Georgian authorities will do their best for catching the  terrorists, who has blown a bomb in the Tbilisi Armenian Drama  Theater.    Georgian Minister of the Interior Aleksander Chikavidze  accepted the Armenian Charge d'Affaires Levon Kachatryan and  reported on measures taken for revealing the crime. He hoped  that this action won't affect the relations between Georgia and  Armenia.    Georgian Procurator General P. Babilashvili and Chairman of  the Security Service Sh. Kviria are ordered to carry operative  investigation, periodically reporting its results to the  President.    "AZG" reports, quoting the editor of the "VRASTAN"  Armenian-language newspaper, published in Tbilisi, Vahan  Bayburtyan, the information by Western agencies was wrong, and  nobody was killed as a result of the explosion. According to  the editor, only 5 persons are now in hospital, 3 of them  children wounded by glass splinters. Only one of the 5 injured  is in a heavy [serious] condition. This is Mikhail Hovsepyan,  61, dance teacher of the theater, who inhaled the hot air of the  explosion, and burnt his lungs. Doctors are now struggling to  save his life. Among the injured is the deputy director of the  theater Rafik Grigoryan.    According to Mr. Bayburtyan, the investigation has shown  that  the explosive and detonator used were of the same type as those,  used during the Sadakhlo bridge explosions. This lead is  probably pointing to Baku.    V. Bayburtyan also reported that Georgian President  Shevardnadze allocated 45-50 million rubles for eliminating the  consequences of the explosion.</p>

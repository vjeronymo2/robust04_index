			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: GM agrees deal with union over job cuts GENERAL Motors, the US carmaker which is in the middle of a restructuring, has reached agreement with the United Auto Workers Union which will allow the company to slash thousands of jobs. The new early retirement plan will be financed by up to Dollars 450m in joint UAW/GM joint training funds. The package comes in two parts. The first will be available to all active UAW workers aged 62 or older who retire in February or March next year. They will receive full pension benefits including healthcare. As an incentive, GM is also offering to contribute Dollars 13,000 towards the purchase of a new GM car. The second part lowers the age of retirement to 50 for workers who have been at the company for at least 10 years. GM is also eliminating its income limit so that retired employees will be eligible for full GM pensions even if they find jobs elsewhere. The UAW represents about 300,000 GM employees. The plan is believed to target about 22,000 GM hourly workers who have already lost their jobs but receive full salaries under GM's national contract with the UAW. Mr Stephen Yokich, head of the union's GM department, said that about 7,000 workers had indicated that they would accept the portion of the plan open to workers aged 50 to 61, although there is no way of knowing how many would actually retire. There are no estimates of how many workers would accept the portion open to employees aged 62 or over. 'This agreement demonstrates that we can work together to address the challenges faced by the union and the corporation,' said Mr Yokich. 'At the same time, it's clear that GM's problems cannot be solved a the bargaining table alone. Health care reform, realistic trade policies and a vigorous economic recovery are also essential,' he added. An earlier salaried employee buy-out programme was extremely popular, allowing GM to push forward its goal of cutting 20,000 salaried jobs by one year, to the end of 1993. The latest move comes at a time when GM is trying to restore the profitability of its loss-making North American operations. Earlier this month, GM unveiled plans to close nine more North American plants and dispose of about 14 per cent of its automotive components operations.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Seoul says North may collapse quickly South Korea should be prepared for a sudden and unexpected reunification with North Korea, President Kim Young-sam warned yesterday. Mr Kim expressed hope for a 'gradual and step-by-step' reunification, but indicated that North Korea's economic problems could cause a quick collapse of the country and its absorption by the South. 'The competition between the South and the North over which can create a better society is over,' he said in a speech marking the 49th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule. 'We must gather the strength and courage needed to endure the pain and sacrifice any unification may entail.' The South Korean leader formally offered to provide North Korea with the capital and technology to build light water reactors if Pyongyang accepts full nuclear inspections. North Korea said last week it would agree to replace its graphite reactors with safer light water ones as part of a deal with the US over its nuclear facilities, which are suspected of being used to produce atomic weapons. South Korea is competing against Russia for the supply of the light water reactors. Pyongyang has said it prefers the Russian models because of its experience in operating Soviet-designed reactors. South Korean reactors are based on US technology. Mr Kim described the offer of nuclear technology as the first investment in a 'joint project for national development' between the two Koreas. Absent from the president's speech was the hostile rhetoric South Korea has used to attack North Korea in recent weeks, following the death of North Korea's President Kim Il-sung. South Korea has conducted a propaganda campaign against the North to counter expressions of sympathy for the late president from radical students, who regard the former North Korean leader as a nationalist hero for his fight against Japanese colonial rule. As the students were conducting widespread and sometimes violent demonstrations in Seoul, the president warned that 'any challenges to our free and democratic system will not be tolerated.' Mr Kim pointedly left out of his speech any proposal for resumption of a planned inter-Korean summit or other forms of bilateral dialogue.</p>

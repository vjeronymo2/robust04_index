			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Italian unions call new general strike The confrontation between the Berlusconi government and Italy's trades union movement escalated yesterday with the calling of a new and more extensive general strike to protest against the 1995 budget. The fresh strike call came within hours of the government's decision to impose a confidence motion on today's debate in the chamber of deputies on the articles in the budget relating to pensions reform. The government's use of a confidence motion for the second time in the budget debate is intended to retain tight discipline among the fractious right-wing coalition. But it was also a clear signal to the unions that - despite the huge weekend protest in Rome of 1.5m demonstrating against the budget - the government was determined not to make more compromises. The general strike will be staged on December 2 and will last eight hours. This will cause much more disruption than the previous stoppage on October 14 which lasted four hours. Outlining plans last week for the demonstration in Rome, union leaders had more or less talked themselves into a new general strike if the government failed to respond by reopening talks on pensions. Yesterday the northern section of the engineering union said it would stage a three-hour stoppage today in protest against the government move and this will foreshadow stoppages elsewhere. In an effort to prevent further industrial action the government will meet the unions next Tuesday. The government had little option but to appear tough. The 1995 budget target of holding the public sector deficit down to L138,000bn (Pounds 55bn), equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP, is already at risk due to a combination of concessions and the higher cost of servicing Italy's debt stock. Some of the concessions relate to pension reform, making it easier for people to still benefit from early retirement provisions. But the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi has been pressing its partners in the right-wing coalition to accept a large number of amendments to pension reform. Some of these are in line with union requests which are seeking to avoid hardship cases and ensure that the reform is thorough - not a mere cost-cutting measure to reduce government spending. The government plans to raise L8,000bn through cuts in the pension benefits. Yesterday Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said the League amendments would cost an extra L11,000bn over the next six years. One of the two main amendments the League has sought to introduce concerns the process whereby those who retire either before the normal retirement age or before they have made their full contributions will be penalised. Mr Bossi has frequently threatened to break with the government over pensions. But yesterday a League spokesman said it would observe the discipline imposed even though it disapproved of the guillotine method of the confidence motion. To deflect attention from this volte face, Mr Bossi said the League would seek to establish a bridge with the government for renewed dialogue. By retreating Mr Bossi has shown he is not yet willing to break up the coalition. His stance yesterday was in part determined by the prospect of local elections this weekend where he needs the backing of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia to ensure League mayoral candidates win.</p>

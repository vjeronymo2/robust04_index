			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / OFT to probe used cars Used-car dealers are to be investigated by the Office of Fair Trading following a big rise in the number of complaints about second-hand cars. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday that the inquiry would focus on the Motor Code of Practice, a voluntary code operated by the Retail Motor Industry Federation and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Complaints about second-hand cars have risen from 51,000 in 1988 to 64,000 last year. Half concerned defects and about a third misleading statements. The federation, whose 12,500 members represent the bulk of the franchised retail motor trade, last night promised full co-operation with the inquiry on ways of improving the working of the code. It also called for the government to consider licensing all motor traders. Doing so could help bring under control what it described as thousands of 'Arthur Daley' garages outside the membership of either the SMMT or the federation. Mr Geoff Dossetter of the federation, while acknowledging the existence of some offenders in the 'official' trade, insisted that the vast majority of complaints were made against the unfranchised 'lower end' of the motor trade. The code was last changed in 1990 from requiring pre-sale inspection of second-hand cars against a checklist, to a system of after-sale inspection and the use of warranties. Sir Bryan said the rise in complaints suggested this change might be causing confusion among dealers. But it was also possible that general knowledge about the application of the code was poor. The inquiry would concentrate on finding ways of remedying the code's defects, he said. Mr Stephen Locke, Consumers' Association director of policy, said the inquiry was very welcome, if long overdue. 'Consumers have been hoodwinked, misled and conned for too long,' he said. There were many areas of concern, the most serious being the practice of 'clocking' and the handling of write-offs. The Consumers' Association looked forward to playing a constructive part in the inquiry to ensure a better deal for consumers, he said. Sir Bryan expressed concern that consumers were paying too much for new cars because of huge discounts given to commercial fleet buyers, and that their servicing costs had been pushed up because of the relative insensitivity to price of company car owners. The federation said it had long shared Sir Bryan's concerns about new cars. According to Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, which forms part of the federation, such discounts add as much as Pounds 1,000 to the cost of new cars bought through dealers. Discounts can be up to 40 per cent on sales of 200,000 or more new cars a year sold directly by manufacturers.</p>

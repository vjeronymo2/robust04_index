			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Doubts about education policy HEADS of the new universities and colleges of higher education are sceptical about the extension of performance-related pay and have little faith in the government's ability to conduct a coherent higher education policy, a Gallup survey said. Price Waterhouse, the consultancy company, received payments of more than Pounds 3m to help set up the government's student loans scheme, according to the National Audit Office, the parliamentary watchdog. That was more than Pounds 400,000 above budget, and represented nearly 6 per cent of the cost of the scheme, including loans made, over its first two years.</p>

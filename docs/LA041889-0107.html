			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO MOTIVE, SUSPECTS IN MISSION VIEJO SLAYING;  </P> <P> VICTIM OF FATAL STABBING IS IDENTIFIED  </P> <P> Authorities Monday identified a Mission Viejo man found dead in his home this  weekend as David Werner, 72, a retired stockbroker.  </P> <P> He died of suffocation and several stab wounds to the upper body, according to  a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Werner's body was found in his bed about 1 a.m. Sunday by his daughter,  Deborah, 40, who lived at the single-family home with him.  </P> <P> He retired from Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment banking firm, in March,  1981. Werner moved to his ranch-style home on the corner of the 27000 block of  El Moro from Lake Forest last year, authorities and neighbors said.  </P> <P> Investigators had no suspects, nor had they determined a motive. The cause of  death was determined by a preliminary autopsy, authorities said.  </P> <P> Neighbors remembered Werner as an amiable man.  </P> <P> "I remember seeing him working on his garden last week. He was a really nice  person," neighbor Lori Jones said. "He was quiet but always made a point to  stop and say hello."  </P> <P> "He used to let us play in his yard while he watched TV," said Jonathan  Freeman, 9, "or sometimes he would just come out and watch us play."  </P> <P> Others on the small cul-de-sac said they did not know much about Werner and his  daughter. Several said he was a quiet and peaceful person. His death, they  said, came as a shock to the neighborhood and left many residents fearful for  their family's safety.  </P> <P> "I have a newborn baby and small children," one neighbor said. "This really  makes me uneasy."  </P> <P> The man, who asked not to be identified, added that the lack of information  about the killing makes him more nervous.  </P> <P> Deputies are trying to determine a motive, Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt.  Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Olson said Werner's home had been ransacked, but no items have been reported  missing, which would suggest that robbery was not the motive.  </P> <P> Olson said investigators have also not detected a forced entry into the house.  </P> <P> Deputies parked a surveillance trailer at the home, locked doors and windows to  the home and guarded the area Monday as the investigation continued.  </P> <P> Werner's daughter is not staying at the home and could not be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Authorities said Werner is survived by her and by two brothers, of Fountain  Valley and Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> Olson declined to comment on whether investigators believe that the victim knew  his killer.  </P></p>

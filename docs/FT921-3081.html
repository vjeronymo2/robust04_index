			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (21): Growing pains curb investors - Palm Oil EARLIER this year, in the middle of Nigeria's blazing dry season, a bush fire raged for four days across 450 hectares of oil-palm plantation. For Presco, Nigeria's only fully private foreign investment in the palm oil sector, it was a minor setback in an ambitious and taxing agricultural venture, the outcome of which remains uncertain. The sector, which 14 years ago was a foreign exchange earner, has been identified by the government and foreign donors as an area for development. But Presco's fully integrated palm oil project, in Edo State, demonstrates the difficulties of successful investment in the industry in an inconsistent government policy environment. Experts say the sector's profitability is dependent on a ban on imported palm oil, introduced in 1986 to stimulate domestic production. The considerable investment now under way in the sector, by the World Bank, European Community and private companies, is predicated on that ban being maintained, at least until the naira is realistically priced. Last October, however, the government succumbed to politically connected businessmen, and allowed an 'import waiver' for 100,000 tonnes of palm oil. Further pressure resulted in waivers being issued for as much as 260,000 tonnes, although it is expected that only between 140,000 and 160,000 tonnes will actually come into the country. The move was a blow to investors. 'Agricultural investments of this kind don't show returns for at least seven years - that is the gestation time,' says one investor. 'What really upsets people is that you wake up on a Monday morning and the whole ball game has changed. There is no consistency of policy so how do you plan for the future?' However, with the naira now floated the competitiveness of the local palm oil sector with imports will have been considerably boosted and some of the traders who obtained waivers hoping for quick profits may be caught out. In the mid-1960s, Nigeria exported 400,000 tonnes of crude palm oil and a number of countries, including Malaysia and Indonesia, came to study the successful industry and take away seedlings. Then came the three-year Biafran civil war, fought across Nigeria's southern palm-oil belt, which disrupted production and destroyed many of the mills and plantations. The war was followed closely by the oil boom which made domestic production uncompetitive with cheap palm oil imports from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. Last year, it was estimated that domestic production - about 70 per cent of which comes from wild palm groves and small backyard crushing operations - was between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes, leaving a shortfall of at least 300,000 tonnes against estimated consumer demand of 900,000 tonnes. In spite of the ban on palm oil imports, 80,000-100,000 tonnes of smuggled oil has continued to reach the market to plug part of the shortfall. For more than a decade, the government has been trying to encourage domestic producers. The World Bank has been active in funding the sector since 1982 and the ban was introduced in 1986. As part of its drive to stimulate agricultural production, the government of former president Muhammadu Buhari in 1985 instructed Nigeria's large trading and manufacturing companies that they should invest in domestic food production or face losing government allocated import licences. Presco's palm-oil project, designed in 1985 by President Industries, a textile company belonging to the Chandrai Group, is one of the few agricultural investments undertaken under that policy which have not yet been written off and which stand a chance of turning a profit one day. Seven years and N148m later, Presco has just started production of oil. Half of its 6,000-hectare concession has been planted with improved variety Tenerra oil palms; the 10 tonnes-an-hour mill is fully operational and the refinery is just about to be commissioned. A packaging plant is also on-stream. Earlier this year President Industries sold 33 per cent of its shares to a Belgium company, SEAT, which is managing the project. If the project is successful, it will be because of its fully integrated design, from raw materials to finished product. It will also be a result of sound management. But the risks are considerable. Any big agricultural project must start from scratch - clearing, planting, developing infrastructure such as roads, housing and schools - and must then bear the considerable foreign exchange risks of investment in machinery. Other investments in the sector include: A Dollars 70m World Bank project to increase annual production by 100,000 tonnes, by rehabilitating old oil palm plantations and oil mills, building two new mills, encouraging small holder planting of 17,500 hectares and assisting the development of improved seedlings by the Nigerian Institute For Oilpalm Research; A Dollars 138m European Community Project to reclaim 27,000 hectares of land, plant 7,000 hectares of palm oil and rehabilitate and invest in new oil mills and refinery. Both projects depend on the government's policy of privatising the poorly managed palm oil estates. A successful privatisation of Okumu Oil Palm Company took place in 1990, with a Belgian company, Endofina, taking 40 per cent of the equity. But privatisation of the other big palm oil companies - Akwapalm, Risonpalm and Adapalm  - has been slow because of vested interests in the state governments which own the companies. Investors and foreign donors believe that, with the right domestic policies, the palm oil sector will be a significant growth area during the next decade.</p>

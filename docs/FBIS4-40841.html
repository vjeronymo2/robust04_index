			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko, the  chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, called  on Tuesday to extend the mandate of the members of the  Federation Council which expires in 1995.    His proposal is caused "not by the desire of lawmakers to  retain the positions, but by the interests of the state",  Shumeyko told reporters and explained that it is necessary to  preserve the experience accumulated by the members of the upper  chamber.    According to the constitution, the Federation Council is to  include two representatives from each subject of the Russian  Federation: one from the legislative and one from the executive  body of state authority. However, the upper chamber of the  first convocation was elected for two years in December 1993.    Shumeyko's proposal contradicts the constitution, but the  speaker believes the problem can be resolved through a  nationwide referendum. "This will be cheaper than new  elections", he said.    Shumeyko added that he had informed the president and the  speaker of the lower chamber about his decision. They both  "agreed in principle with that", he said.</p>

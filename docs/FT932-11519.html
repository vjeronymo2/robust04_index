			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Economics: Narrow UK money supply in spotlight THERE are few economic indicators in the UK this week, although provisional narrow money supply figures for April will generate interest. Rapid year - on - year growth in M0 has been cited as evidence that consumer spending is recovering. M0 has remained above the upper limit of the government's 0-4 per cent monitor range since February and, according to the latest median forecast, grew at a buoyant 5 per cent in the year to April. Given the recent upbeat comments of the Prime minister and the Chancellor about the state of the UK economy, Friday's monthly monetary report is also likely to be modestly optimistic. But the Treasury will be cautious about sounding too enthusiastic. Many analysts expect economic activity to show temporary signs of faltering before the year is over, similar to the pattern of recovery in the US. In the US, non-farm payroll figures at the end of the week will once again throw the spotlight on the strength of recovery. Last week, disappointing GDP figures pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending and weakening exports. But April's figures should show a rebound and economists are forecasting a 150,000 rise in non-farm payrolls. There is also a rush of data from Germany this week. March's industrial production and manufacturing new orders are both projected to fall as recession deepens. However, economists do not expect the Bundesbank to announce a further cut in official rates at its regular council meeting. Other economic highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists forecasts from MMS international, a financial information company.

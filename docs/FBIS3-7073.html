			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ]  Governor Yasushi Mieno said Thursday [24 March] the domestic  economy is improving, but more time is needed for the country to  crawl out of the adjustment phase.    Consumption and corporate production are recuperating and  corporate sentiment is improving, but capital investment is  still declining and the labor situation is deteriorating, he  said in a speech in Tokyo. He even cautioned that recent bright  spots in the economy could have been brought about by factors  concerning the fiscal year-end this month.    Mieno added that Japan will have to wait a little longer for  stock adjustments to be completed. He went on to say that the  capability of private enterprises and financial institutions to  manage risks is weakening, and called for the further  introduction of a competitive environment within the industry.    The governor warned that financial institutions are not  operating entirely in line with basic market principles and a  risk control that lacks such fundamentals may even result in  greater insecurity.    Further liquidation of nonperforming assets by financial  institutions is indispensible for recovery of the Japanese  economy, Mieno said.    Referring to the recent rise in long-term interest rates,  the  governor said this appeared to be a reaction to overheated  expectations of lower interest rates triggered by a recovery in  Japanese stock prices.    Mieno said any excessive movement of the rates is likely to  be corrected in line with the realities of business conditions.  With respect to efforts to beef up Japan's financial system,  Mieno noted the need to improve methods of settlement, in  addition to changes in corporate accounting and the tax system.</p>

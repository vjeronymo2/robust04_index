			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WORK TO BREAK BUDGET DEADLOCK  </P> <P> Democratic congressional leaders groped toward a compromise Friday on a  critical budget bill that would break a weeks-long deadlock and clear a path  for adjournment next week of the first session of the 101st Congress.  </P> <P> Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and House Ways and  Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) met privately throughout the  day in an effort to bridge differences over a roughly $6-billion revenue  package and cuts in the Medicare program. Separate negotiations were also  taking place to break a House-Senate deadlock over the controversial  "catastrophic" health insurance plan that the House wants repealed and the  Senate wants scaled back.  </P> <P> An agreement between the two committees on tax changes would complete work on a  roughly $14-billion deficit-reduction bill that must be passed if Congress is  to meet its budget goals for the year. The package, which will include dozens  of spending cuts, will also include savings achieved by automatic budget cuts  triggered Oct. 16 when Congress and the White House failed to meet the fiscal  1990 deficit target of $110 billion.  </P> <P> Those across-the-board cuts, known as a sequester, save more than $1 billion a  month. And the final fiscal package is likely to include as much as three  months' worth of the automatic savings. Passage of the deficit-reduction bill  would lift the automatic cuts for the remainder of the fiscal year that ends  Sept. 30.  </P> <P> House and Senate leaders were hoping for an agreement by late Friday night to  permit floor debate on the budget package beginning Sunday.  </P> <P> House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) predicted Friday that the budget  cutting bill will be satisfactory to President Bush, who this month challenged  Congress to pass a measure that would be stripped of extraneous items and  fiscal gimmicks and that would cut the federal deficit by at least $14 billion.  Bush said at the time he would veto unacceptable legislation and permit the  roughly $16 billion in automatic spending cuts mandated by the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law to remain in effect for the full fiscal year.  </P> <P> "Relatively speaking, it will be a clean bill," Foley said. "I don't think, as  I said before, there would be any reason for the President, on budget grounds,  not to accept it."  </P> <P> But Senate Republicans, who had not seen all the details of the emerging budget  bill being negotiated by Democrats, said it appears from its outlines that it  would not meet the $14 billion in savings demanded by Bush.  </P> <P> "They fall substantially short," said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico,  ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.  </P> <P> Congressional leaders are banking on White House acceptance of some budgetary  sleight-of-hand that the Administration agreed to in April's budget summit with  Capitol Hill. These include savings of $1.7 billion achieved by not calculating  Postal Service losses in the federal deficit.  </P> <P> House Budget Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Calif.) predicted that the  budget bill could be ready for consideration by the full House Sunday.  Referring to the decision to have Rostenkowski and Bentsen thrash out the  differences without other conference committee members present, Panetta said:  "At least we've got the two bulls in the corral."  </P> <P> The House passed its $11-billion version of the budget measure, known as a  reconciliation bill, in early October, adding to it dozens of unrelated  provisions that are being dropped in conference with the Senate. The Senate's  $14-billion version of the bill was passed Oct. 13.  </P> <P> The tax-writing committees must come up with at least $5.3 billion in new  revenues, plus a bit less than $2 billion in spending cuts, primarily in  Medicare. The overall budget package is likely to include changes in law that  would cut the deficit about $11.5 billion, plus the additional savings of $3  billion to $4 billion from the across-the-board cuts under  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.  </P> <P> The package is likely to include extensions of several popular but money-losing  tax breaks that are due to expire, including research and development and  subsidized housing credits.  </P></p>

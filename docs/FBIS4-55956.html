			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gizella Ivan: "Only the Parliament Has the Right </F> To Put a Stop to It; It Would Mean Loss of Prestige"]    [Text] Challenging the expo is a very harmful move, Chief  Commissioner Etelka Pataky Barsi said yesterday at a very  exclusive discussion. "And the reason is," she continued, "that  the world considers Hungary to be a democratic country. In other  words, once the country undertook international obligations, one  assumes that it will fulfill them."    "It never even occurred to me to consider the legal  consequences of a possible cancellation of the world fair," the  chief commissioner emphasized. (There are no legal consequences  of canceling the event, but the loss of prestige can be  considerable. And should an invited country have already  invested a certain amount in Hungary, and should the event be  canceled, the foreign country can sue for damages. -- Editor)    "The new government will most probably survey the issues and  projects in progress," Mrs. Barsi said, "but only the parliament  has the right to put a stop to them." According to the chief  commissioner, canceling the expo would be an illogical step for  several reasons, because the entire event is being organized in  such a way that almost every site can be utilized afterwards.    It seems that the antagonism between Budapest leaders and  the  programming office was revived in the last few days. According  to Budapest, the city needs 50 billion forints [Ft] to implement  the expo, but the chief commissioner says that the remaining  time is only sufficient to carry out work in Budapest in the  amount of no more than Ft24 billion, and that money is there.    "Some people also claim," the chief commissioner said, "that  the Universitas bonds are not successful, but actually they were  oversold."    To the question of MAGYAR HIRLAP--because Mrs. Barsi ran for  the parliament--how she imagines her work in the programming  office in the future, she replied that she did not run as an  individual representative. If all goes well, she wants to  continue to deal with the expo in the parliament, as well. True  enough, she will not always be able to participate in committee  meetings, but the Hungarian Democratic Forum thinks that it is a  good idea for someone to represent the expo in the parliament.  "I also kept my seat in Budapest, and I was not present at every  meeting, but if my work is scrutinized, it will be found that I  am among the top 10 people who did something for the city," Mrs.  Barsi said.</p>

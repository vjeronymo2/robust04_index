			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Victory For Clinton: First black woman Senator elected MS CAROL Moseley Braun (right) will become the first black woman in the Senate, after winning the Illinois seat, writes George Graham. All the evidence suggests it was her gender, rather than her race, which was the determining factor in her appeal to voters; at present the Senate boasts only two women members of any race. Her Republican opponent, Mr Rich Williamson, had struggled in vain against anonymity and remained almost totally unknown to voters right up to polling day. Ms Braun, by contrast, spent much of the campaign posing for the covers of glossy magazines, helped by a magnetic smile and a warm personality. She ran into trouble in the final weeks of the campaign because of reports that she had committed financial irregularities to ensure that her mother continued to qualify for Medicaid, which provides medical care for the poor. But sceptics' forecasts that this scandal would allow latent racism to come into play, and frustrate her bid for the seat, proved to be unfounded.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALMAN RUSHDIE AND KHOMEINI'S OUTRAGE  </P> <P> As American writers we believe in free speech, and defend Salman Rushdie's  right to publish his books without fear of physical reprisal.  </P> <P> Although many Muslims are genuinely distressed and offended by Rushdie's book,  they should be equally outraged by the terrorist fanatics in Iran who have put  a bounty on his head. Islam teaches moderation. The bullying actions of  Khomeini and other fundamentalist clerics who have offered money to murder an  author is a greater outrage than anything Rushdie may have written.  </P> <P> If Rushdie's book is offensive to Muslims, they have the right to protest  against it, to write letters of complaint to his publishers, to shun him or  despise him in any way they want. But to threaten to kill him or bomb his  publishers is an immoral act, an affront to democratic principles, and to  international law.  </P> <P> We believe that freedom of expression is the very atmosphere of democracy, the  cornerstone of our liberty. The principle at stake here is an important one to  us, for as writers we exercise it every day of our lives. We are not judging  the merits or defects of Rushdie's book, but are voicing the sentiments of John  Stuart Mill, who said: "If all mankind, minus one, were of one opinion, and  only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more  justified in silencing that one person, then he, if he had the power, would be  justified in silencing mankind."  </P> <P> Signed by 14 Orange County writers:  </P> <P> JEROME ROTH  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> FRANK McADAMS  </P> <P> Dana Point  </P> <P> DOUGLAS MUIR  </P> <P> Balboa Island  </P> <P> BERNARD HIMES  </P> <P> T.

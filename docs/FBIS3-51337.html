			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored by Panama  Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after  item.    Guillermo Albareda, secretary of the Gold Committee of the  National Mining Society (Sociedad Nacional de Mineria, SNM), has  said that whereas Peru produced 18 tons of gold during 1992, it  produced 28 tons during 1993. He added that 70 percent of the  gold was obtained by new or expanded companies. Among the major  investments he has cited were the Yanacocha Mine in Cajamarca  Department, which the U.S. company Newmont Mining has been  exploiting since last year, with an initial investment of $50  million. He has also attributed the growth in this sector to  expansion and modernization in the Retamas and La Poderosa  Mines. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2042 GMT 12 Jan 94)</p>

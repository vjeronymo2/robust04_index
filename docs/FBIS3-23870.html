			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Starostin, chairman of the </F> International Humanitarian Russian Fund, by Aleksandr Shinkin;  place and date not given: "`Russian' Can Speed Up Housewarmings,  but Its Program Requires State Guarantees"]    [Text] In December of last year, our newspaper wrote about  the Russian International Humanitarian Fund (see ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA of 23 December 1993 "`Russian' Will Help Its Own"), which  is engaged in the construction of housing in Russia for refugees  and forced resettlers from countries of the near abroad. We are  once again returning to this subject, taking into account the  numerous phone calls to the editorial office with requests for  assistance to contact the fund or to give more details about it.  The fund's capabilities and the problems that it is running into  are recounted by Ivan Starostin, its chairman.    [Shinkin] Ivan Fedorovich, tell me, did you keep your word  that the first group of refugees will be housed in new  apartments before the new year?    [Starostin] Have no doubts. More than 20 families, members  of  our fund, held housewarmings and celebrated New Year at the same  time. Very soon approximately 200 more families, as they say,  will have their corner in the motherland.    This, of course, is not a lot, but it is also not that  little, if you consider that, in fact, we have been working just  a little more than a year.    [Shinkin] On what conditions does the fund offer people  housing?    [Starostin] I will note that at a congress we approved  Russians who by force of circumstances have found themselves  outside the borders of their historic motherland and who desire  to return to it. Most of these people are not rich. Therefore,  the conditions in our country are most acceptable for them.  First, we sell the housing only at cost. Second, the fist  payment on the conclusion of the contract amounts to 20 percent  of the cost of the apartment. The remaining sum is paid over the  course of 10 years. At a time when other firms, as far as I  know, are selling housing, as a rule, at commercial prices and  immediately for full cost. Only a few can manage this.    [Shinkin] Do those who are returning to Russia have an  opportunity to choose where they will resettle?    [Starostin] Unquestionably. Of course, for the time being  the  housing fund has been established essentially in the European  part of Russia. But projects are also ready for its eastern  regions. In addition, our fund not only builds and buys  apartments in cities, but it is also building whole settlements  with socio-cultural purpose facilities and production premises.  Thus, our customers have to take into account only their  material capabilities in selecting their place of residence.  While in Moscow's outlying districts a square meter of housing  costs somewhere around 600,000 rubles [R], then, for example in  Krasnodar its price is lower by a factor of three.    [Shinkin] Several persons from Latvia in telephone  conversations with me have asked the editorial office about  assistance for your fund. There is the same kind of request in a  telegram from Estonia, on which there were more than 100  signatures. What, Ivan Fedorovich, caused this?    [Starostin] The fund's general problems, it must be assumed.  But the gist of them is this. The Russian Fund is not a  government organization. And we do not rely on state subsidies,  recognizing the limitation of the state budget and the profusion  of unresolved tasks in the country. Therefore, from the first  days we have counted on nonbudgetary sources of financing.    Understandably, a lot cannot be built on the personal means  of our customers. Credits are needed. If they are taken in  commercial banks, then this means that it is necessary to raise  the price of housing by a factor of 2.5-3. It is more  advantageous, as the calculations of economists show, to take  credit in the West. As early as the beginning of last year, we  reached an agreement with the leaders of the concern MK  Technology Trading and a number of American banks about  allocating credit under the fund program in the amount of $250  million. Moreover, under very favorable conditions. In addition,  the United States Department of State was also ready to offer  humanitarian credit in the amount of $5 million.    One requirement was raised on their part: the guarantees of  the government of Russia and the inclusion of the fund in the  implementation of the state program for alternative  construction. But we were unable to accomplish this in our  corridors of power. While former Vice President Aleksandr  Rutskoy did not skimp on promises, Shumeyko, Shakhray, and  others did not even deign to give us their answer.    [Shinkin] But, you will agree, Ivan Fedorovich, it is not a  rare case when personal interests are decided on the pretext of  common interests.    [Starostin] Doubts are understandable. Only we are prepared  to account for every cent. What is more, we are ready to assume  the work of representative of the government, which would  control how the money is being spent. Not to mention the fact  that we have already calculated the technology of returning it.    But the difficulty is that they do not even want to discuss  this question with us. Assuming, evidently, that there are  enough places for everyone in Russia, let them come. But the  problem is not that simple. As investigations show, about 17  million Russians want to return to the motherland in the near  future. Even our country is not in a condition to quickly  "digest" such a number. It also should not be forgotten that  there are many former servicemen among the homeless, and also  officers and warrant officers of subunits that will be withdrawn  from the countries of the near and far abroad. At the very  least, it is irresponsible not to take this into account.    [Shinkin] Judging by your words, you are not planning to  yield. Hope, it is well known, is the last to perish. At the  present time, we are conducting negotiations with the  Export-Import Bank of the United States on granting us favorable  credits in the sum of $500 million for 10 years. In addition, a  payment of 3.5 percent annual interest is envisioned for five  years. The project has received the preliminary approval in  congress, the State Department, and the Defense Department of  the United States. But, again, everything depends on state  guarantees.    Together with the Interdepartmental Commission on Social  Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families, our fund  submitted a request on 18 January to First Vice President Oleg  Soskovets for an examination of this question. We are prepared  to submit all of the necessary documents and detailed accounts.  Indeed, apparently, the appeal to the editorial office of  members of the fund is a result of this. They want to bring the  attention of the public to their needs. After all, I will  repeat, credits for us are an opportunity to accelerate housing  construction. But this means to support and inspire confidence  in 300,000 persons who are forced to abandon the places they  lived in. Three hundred thousand--this is the figure of the  number of members of our fund today. They deserve the attention  of the Government of Russia.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The editorial office will report in subsequent issues about  what kinds of results were obtained by the appeal of the leaders  of the Russian Fund and the Interdepartmental Commission on  Social Problems of Servicemen and Members of Their Families to  First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets.    The International Humanitarian Fund "Russian" can be  contacted as follows:    Address: 42 Shchepkin Street, Room 1701, Moscow, 128857.    Telephone for information: (095) 971-96-25.    [Begin boxed item]  <H3>  From a Speech by Nikolay Pankov, Chairman of the Executive  Committee of the Rodina Association </H3>   "Assistance to refugees and those forced to resettle  requires  a comprehensive approach. But, in our opinion, it is necessary  for the Russian side in cooperation with Russian communities and  Russian social organizations to adopt a number of immediate  measures. First, there is a need for a precise schedule of  activities of state and local organs of authority and the broad  public on the reception of the resettlers. Second, a program is  necessary for the resettlers that would provide for annual  quotas, determine specific oblasts and krays, and allocate  finances for the creation of an appropriate infrastructure. To  compile such a program requires a realistic forecast of the  expected number of resettlers. Only the Russian communities are  able to do this. And, third, Russia should insist on signing  special agreements with states of the near abroad, whose policy  is the reason for the departure of Russians, according to which  these states would assume a specific part of the expenditures  for resettlement, which would create normal conditions for the  departure of Russians--sale of apartments, issuance of  transport, containers, and so on."

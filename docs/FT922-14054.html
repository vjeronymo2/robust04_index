			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Impatient GM board flexes its muscles: The humbling of Robert Stempel 'YOU'VE just got to have the patience to stay with me,' declared Mr Robert Stempel, the embattled chairman of General Motors, when he recently pointed out that reviving the ailing car manufacturer would take quite some time. But this week the board sent him a powerful message that its patience is wearing mighty thin. Non-executive directors, in an extraordinary display of muscle-flexing, forced a shake-up of GM's senior management. It has humbled Mr Stempel by removing him as chairman of GM's key executive committee, which oversees the company between board meetings. He has been replaced by Mr John Smale, a non-executive director who was formerly head of Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products group, and appears to have played a key role in prompting the boardroom mutiny. It has also demoted Mr Lloyd Reuss, the chairman's much-criticised right-hand man, who has been replaced as group president by Mr John Smith, the head of international operations. Less than two months ago, amid persistent speculation that Mr Reuss's star was waning, Mr Stempel told a news conference: 'Lloyd's my guy.' Mr Stempel, 58, remains as chairman of the group, but the board has apparently put him on notice that he will have to act much more toughly and decisively to keep the position over the long term. 'Regaining profitability requires a more aggressive management approach to remove excess costs,' it pointedly declared in a statement after the Monday board meeting which pushed the upheaval through. Yesterday Wall Street gave its own verdict on the changes, marking the company's shares up Dollars 1 1/4 to close ar Dollars 38 in the hope that the new team will move decisively to solve the group's chronic problems in North America, where its automotive operations had an operating loss of Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4bn) in 1991. Over the next few weeks the company is expected to announce further large first-quarter losses, when smaller Detroit rivals Chrysler and Ford may have operated profitably. All of the Big Three US car manufacturers have been hit by recession, which has cut demand for vehicles, and increased supply, thanks to the growing output from Japanese car plants in North America. But both Ford and Chrysler have moved more aggressively than GM over the past few years to streamline their manufacturing efficiency. When Mr Stempel replaced Mr Roger Smith, GM's controversial and authoritarian chairman in 1990, his appointment was seen as a big opportunity for the bureaucratically hidebound giant to reverse the slide in its US car market share, which has dipped from 47 per cent at the start of the 1980s to 35 per cent now. Mr Stempel, who has an imposing 6ft 4in frame and booming voice, was hailed as an engineer who would inject excitement into the company's range and a collegiate leader who would inject a sense of purpose into management and bite the bullet on much-needed plant closures. He has done much in each of these areas, but he has not done enough, fast enough. Critics say he is a man who prefers evolution when market forces are demanding a revolution. Last December, after prodding from the board, he did announce plans for a restructuring, with more than 70,000 job losses and the closure of 21 plants over the next few years. The company is also reorganising its North American management structure, which will change the cumbersome system imposed by Mr Roger Smith in 1984. This is an extremely delicate task - the 1984 upheaval threw the company into months of turmoil - and the man responsible for overseeing the change has up to now been Mr Reuss, who had ultimate charge of GM's North American car operations. Mr Reuss, aged 55, who tends to dress in three-piece suits and monogrammed shirts, cuts a distinctly provincial Middle American figure. He has long been out of favour with the board. When Mr Stempel became chairman, the board wanted him to appoint Mr Jack Smith as president, but he insisted on Mr Reuss, his longtime sidekick and one-time rival for the top job. When the appointment was announced inside GM, some white collar workers jeered. Critics said the appointment was a classic example of what was wrong at GM, with an inbred corporate culture and bureaucratic dead hand encouraging croneyism and rewarding employees for long service rather than performance. This week the board said enough was enough. Mr Reuss is being shunted off to head a rag-bag of activities, including the development of new cars. Mr Jack Smith, his replacement, is a very different type of manager. Aged 54 - he celebrated his birthday on Monday  - he is an approachable, down-to-earth man who was born in New England and rose through the GM ranks on the financial side. But he really made his name in Europe in the mid-1980s, when he took charge of GM's operations and played a key role in turning what had been a heavy lossmaker into the most profitable of the six big European volume car manufacturers. Key ingredients included strong products, flexible factory practices - and a lack of strong Japanese competition. Although Mr Smith always stresses that the European turnround was a joint effort which took a decade, the board is clearly hoping he can work similar effects in the US. In Monday's statement it pointedly said the appointments would 'promote the adoption of best practices throughout the corporation, such as the operating techniques which have proved so successful for GM's international oper-ations'. But GM in the US is an infinitely more complicated animal than in Europe, and it is questionable how rapidly Mr Smith can get to grips with the immense task. A huge question mark also hangs over the relationship between Mr Stempel and Mr Smale in the running of the business. Mr Smale, who has been on the GM board for a decade, is credited with turning Procter &amp; Gamble in the 1980s from a sluggish giant into an aggressive, financially successful business. He knows what it takes to turn a complacent bureaucracy around. But will what he knows coincide with what Mr Stempel thinks? And, if not, which voice will prevail?</p>

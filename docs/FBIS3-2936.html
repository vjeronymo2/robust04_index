Speaking to members of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Li stressed  the need to readjust the educational structure in line with the  needs of a socialist market economy.    To this end, it is necessary to greatly improve basic  education and vigorously develop vocational education in both  urban and rural areas, he told a forum attended by CPPCC  National Committee members.    Higher education should focus on improving teaching quality  and running universities and colleges better, he said.    The vice-premier also emphasized the importance of research  and teaching in basic science.

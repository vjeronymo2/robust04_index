			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (1): Towards a state of grace - A pro-business government has achieved political stability while maintaining economic growth The inter-war Czechoslovakia which is preserved in sepia photographs and the still modern buildings of its avant-garde architecture was a prosperous, bourgeois democracy in the heart of Europe; it was a normal country. The post-communist Czech Republic, divorced from Slovakia since January 1993, is well on its way back to that state of grace. Keeping the new state on the straight and narrow path of recovery is a pro-business government headed by an abrasive, opinionated, but undoubtedly clever, man. In style and substance, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, far more closely resembles his political idol, Britain's Margaret Thatcher, than any of his counterparts elsewhere in a central Europe released from Soviet bondage only five years ago. Alone among post- communist politicians, Mr Klaus manages to combine clear and unequivocal public statements about the virtues of hard work, private enterprise and free markets with a subtle manipulation of the state budget to ease the pain of transition and keep the electorate on his side. 'The government will not subsidise or bail out bankrupt companies. It is prepared to act as a catalyst for change or to share in restructuring costs, but then all involved - the government, creditors and the enterprise itself  -have to sacrifice something,' says Mr Jiri Waigl, the prime minister's chief adviser. Not everyone is impressed. Mr Milos Zeman, who leads the main non-communist opposition grouping, the social democrats says: 'Klaus was fine for the first, restrictive phase. His time is over. The problem is that he does not know it yet.' But neither, it seems, does an electorate which voted heavily for Mr Klaus in the June 1992 elections and reconfirmed its support by backing candidates linked to his party, the Civic Democratic party (ODS), in last month's local elections. Opinion polls also continue to give him and his party top rating. Barring accidents, Mr Klaus, a 52-year-old macro-economist, looks well set for another term in office as head of a coalition government after general elections scheduled for mid-1996. The economy is his strong point. As finance minister he masterminded the economic reform strategy which came into effect in January 1991, a year after the pioneering 'shock therapy' Polish reform programme. Whereas Poland faced hyper-inflation and was saddled with a Dollars 42bn foreign debt, Mr Klaus inherited a decaying but cautiously managed economy with relatively little debt and stable prices. While Poland and Hungary became bogged down in complicated, government- managed privatisation schemes Mr Klaus, contemptuous of the capacity of governments or bureaucracies to manage enterprises, boldly struck out on a two-stage mass privatisation programme. The results have been spectacular. By early next year, around 80 per cent of the economy will be at least partially privatised. At that point the fate of the Czech economy will be largely in the hands of enterprises and the managers and investment funds set up to exercise corporate governance on behalf of more than 7m small shareholders. The most painful part of micro-economic readjustment at the enterprise level is probably about to begin. Hundreds of former state-owned enterprises have already shed up to half their bloated workforces and disposed of assets. But few have actually closed or been forced into bankruptcy. The bankruptcy and related laws are on the statute book, but the courts are inexperienced in commercial matters and overloaded. The pace of bankruptcies should rise sharply in the new year, and so, temporarily, should unemployment. The jobless rate is currently around 3.5 per cent nationally, but far lower in the Prague region where around 60 per cent of GDP originates. Increasingly, influential policy makers such as Mr Josef Tosovsky, the central bank governor, argue that without a labour shake-out from dying companies, the pace of economic recovery risks being stunted by labour and other shortages. The difficulty lies in convincing Mr Klaus that the political fall-out will be less than feared, provided policy makers concentrate on removing bottlenecks to growth in what is already an expanding economy. This means difficult decisions in politically sensitive areas, such as raising public utility tariffs and rents so as to encourage labour mobility by freeing up the property market. Mr Klaus has already shown he can be stubborn in such matters. After months of work by bankers and lawyers, he turned down flat a plan to build a toll motorway from Heidelberg to Prague when he found that the tolls would have to be so high that only German motorists could afford them, but not Czechs on an average monthly wage equivalent to about Dollars 250. For all the razzmatazz about the market economy, Mr Klaus is acutely aware that daily life remains a struggle for most of the 10.3mCzechs, while the fruits of change as yet are being enjoyed by a fairly thin, albeit highly visible, stratum of society. His delicate political antennae have helped ensure that, unlike elsewhere in the region, the Czech communist party stands no chance of returning to power in a new guise. The communists retain electoral support among the old and those nostalgic for the old social safety net and easier work practices. But the majority continue to share the optimism shown by Mr Klaus about the future. There are blemishes on the record. One is the prime minister's constant humiliation of President Vaclav Havel, who is in many ways a far more representative figure of the traditionally tolerant, sceptical, bucolic and somewhat shambling Bohemian of popular stereotype than the austere, rather Germanic, Mr Klaus. Another is the Czech approach to the civil rights of an uncomfortable minority within their ranks - the country's nearly 250,000 gypsies, many of whom were rendered stateless after the divorce from Slovakia. Increasingly however, the Czech Republic is being perceived, along with Poland, as the economic success story of central Europe. Of that region, it is the most prepared country for entry into the European Union. Foreign capital has been flowing into the republic in embarrassing amounts. Reserves have risen virtually to equal the nation's foreign debt. The credit rating agencies give it investment grade listing, Czech companies and banks have been welcomed back to international capital markets while the government is repaying its own loans at a fast clip. Above all, the economy is expanding again while the budget remains balanced and inflation is dipping towards single digits. The Czech Republic is closer to complying with the 'convergence criteria' laid down by the EU Maastricht summit than most of the EU's current members, and is more politically stable, too. Mr Klaus, in an elegant overcoat and carrying a silver-topped cane, looked at least the equal of his western counterparts at the EU summit in Essen earlier this month. He has clear views on the future shape of an enlarged Europe and on the errors of Europe's current policies. Prague did not break free from Moscow only to fall under the thrall of centralising, socialistically inclined Brussels, he tells the west. He also blames excessive social security costs for Europe's high unemployment and loss of global competitiveness. Until now, western Europe has liked to view itself as the senior party when advice was required. The Czech Republic under Mr Klaus has become the most forcible advocate in former communist Europe of the need for a genuine dialogue. Both sides will probably benefit from the exchange.</p>

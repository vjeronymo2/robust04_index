			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BELEAGUERED BAT GAINS BY 38%  </P> <P> BAT Industries PLC, the British conglomerate fighting a takeover bid from Sir  James Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd., today reported a 38% jump in  profits during 1989.  </P> <P> The results were helped by record earnings from the group's tobacco interests  and a near doubling of profits at its financial services division.  </P> <P> BAT said last year's net income totaled $2.07 billion, compared with $1.5  billion in 1988. The latest results included a $197-million one-time gain from  restructurings.  </P> <P> Annual sales increased 25% to $35 billion from $28 billion.  </P> <P> BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy described the results as excellent in light of the  "distractions forced on us by Hoylake."  </P> <P> The $21-billion Hoylake bid has been suspended while U.S. state insurance  regulators review the effect a change of ownership would have on BAT's Farmers  Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.  </P></p>

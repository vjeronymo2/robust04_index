			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 19, RIA -- "Russia's cooperation with  NATO should be in line with its possibilities and intentions,"  NATO information department chief Francois Vilaneque told RIA.  Commenting on Moscow's intentions to win a special status in  relations with NATO, he compared the Partnership for Peace  Programme with a restaurant in which every visitor chooses a  dish to his or her taste. "Russia is a client like any other,"  said the department chief, "on accepting the programme, it has  every right to build and develop its relations with NATO as  believes most useful for her."    The NATO session in Brussels this week confirmed its former  position: The Partnership for Peace Programme includes standard  principles for all states joining it and cannot grant advantages  to anybody. Having accepted its principles, every country  chooses forms and volume of its individual participation in  accordance with its wishes and capacities.</p>

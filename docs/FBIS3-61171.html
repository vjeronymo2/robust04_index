			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjorn Hygstedt: "Threatened Businessman Flees </F> Estonia"]    [Text] It took four years to get the boat factory outside  Tallinn, Estonia, going. But it took a Swedish businessman only  20 minutes to pack his bags and leave the country after threats  from one of the city's Mafia-like organizations drove him to  flight.    Molds and other equipment, computers, fax machines, and  telephones worth 3 million kronor in all were left behind in the  industrial plant.    "Four years of hard work and then everything has to end like  this just because we happened to get in the way of extraneous  interests," said a spokesman for the D-boats company in Taby.  <H5>  Six Hundred Plastic Boats </H5>   In 1990 D-boats formed the Fibertec joint venture company  with the Majak fishery kolkhoz in Tallinn. Last year Fibertec  produced around 600 plastic boats of various sizes, primarily  for the Swedish market.    At first all went well. There was a good atmosphere at the  factory--in spite of some language confusion and an unsettled  political situation with increasingly vociferous Estonian  demands for independence and liberation from the Soviet Union.    But after Estonia became a sovereign state, law and order  was  seriously undermined. Various crimes can be committed almost  unchecked because of widespread corruption among customs agents  and policemen. A fact that the highest police leadership now  openly acknowledges.  <H5>  Infiltration </H5>   Swedish authorities and ministries have tried through many  different channels to speed up and support the construction of a  functioning society based on law with aid for institutional  sovereignty. But neither white gloves, deterrents, nor the  transfer of advanced information has helped; corruption has  spread, and organized crime is infiltrating farther and farther  into spheres of power.    According to Fibertec's former administrative chief, an  Estonian, it began when one of Tallinn's metal gangs, which earn  incredible sums from the export of primarily stolen scrap metal,  wanted to acquire the Majak partner's attractive deep-water port  in the Kopli district south of the center of the city.    One of the gang's members, a karate instructor, had a  lifetime membership in the Majak kolkhoz. Using big bribes and  explicit threats, the gang succeeded in getting the kolkhoz  members to not only approve incorporating the kolkhoz but also  elect the karate instructor as its managing director.    After that things moved quickly. All the chiefs of the  former  kolkhoz's satellite companies were kicked out, and soon it was  the turn of Fibertec and D-boats.    "One day a tough gang came and said they were going to sell  the industrial buildings and that we had to get out. Our  production chief, Lars-Olof Berntsson, protested and said Majak  could sell only its own share," someone in the D-boats  management told SVENSKA DAGBLADET.  <H5>  Warning From Enforcers </H5>   A few weeks later the production chief was warned about the  gang's enforcers and their methods by his own personnel.    "Berntsson was advised to return home immediately. He fled  to  the Swedish Embassy before leaving Estonia head over heels."    No one in the company dared get in touch with the Tallinn  police, but a report was filed with the Swedish police. Several  people have also been questioned closely about what happened.    "Here we sit and we were not able to take a single ore with  us. We think it is irresponsible of the government and the  Export Council not to warn Swedish businessmen who are  considering investing in Estonia about the increasingly powerful  crime gangs," said a company spokesman.    Staffan Sodersten, the Export Council's marketing chief, is  well aware of the development not only in Estonia but also in  Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia.    "It has clearly worsened just in the past year and it is  shocking how fast it has happened. But we cannot very well  advise people against doing business in Estonia, although we  urge them to be extremely vigilant," Sodersten said.  <H5>  Case Not Unique </H5>   Threatened Swedish businessmen who are forced to flee from  Russia and the Baltic states have become a dismal reality in the  wake of poverty.    "Unfortunately the case in Tallinn is not unique. We have  also acted via the Swedish Embassy in Moscow," said Christine  von Sydow of the Foreign Ministry's trade section, who is  responsible for the mixed commissions that administer the free  trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.  <H5>  Aid To Be Maintained </H5>   Von Sydow said she would not advise Swedish businessmen  against making investments in Estonia and the Baltic region  either.    "But we communicate the anxiety we feel about the grave  situation via many different channels. I do not believe in  withholding aid as a `punishment,' but rather in intensifying  support in order to hasten an improvement in the legal system."    Alar Streimann, trade counsellor at the Estonian Embassy in  Stockholm, insists that there is no threat to Swedish firms in  Estonia.    "If someone has problems they should report the matter to  the  police so it can be investigated. A corrupt police system? There  is no proof of that, but the police are poorly equipped."</p>

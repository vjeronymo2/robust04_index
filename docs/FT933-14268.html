			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Technology: Just the ticket for Spielberg The thunder of dinosaur feet in Jurassic Park is likely only to be beaten this weekend by the thunder of movie-goers' feet as they stampede to cinemas to see Steven Spielberg's latest blockbuster movie, which is previewed in the UK this evening. Those who prefer to turn their backs on this somewhat prehistoric method of getting a seat can use technology to ensure a place at the front of the queue. MGM Cinemas is using a fully automatic ticket booking service for customers in 34 cinemas in the London and Brighton area, including the Trocadero in London's cinema land in the west end. A telephone call will enable customers with credit cards to book a seat at their first choice cinema or at a nearby venue if that is not available. And, assures Keith Pullinger, assistant to the general manager at MGM, there will be enough lines to ensure that every caller gets through. 'I defy anyone to get their phones answered as quickly as we can.' The numbers to be called will be advertised in the local press - each of the 34 cinemas has been allocated a different number. Callers hear a recorded announcement asking questions about the film, day and time. By pressing the number indicated after the time or film the preference is registered. The most popular film is always listed first, says Pullinger. 'Seventy-five per cent of bookings now are for Jurassic Park.' Once the details, including the credit card number, are determined, the main computer, which is operated by Computicket, sends them to the cinema requested using the Paknet radio data network. Confirmation is then sent back to the computer centre and the tickets printed out in the cinema for collection. If the caller does not have a modern tone telephone, the system will switch the caller to a human operator. According to Pullinger the Computicket service is unique in offering both a manual and automatic booking service.</p>

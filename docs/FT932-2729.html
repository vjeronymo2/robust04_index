			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright offer for sale oversubscribed The public offer for sale for Carpetright, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, closed oversubscribed yesterday, writes Maggie Urry. Details of the level of subscription and allocations will be announced next week; dealings begin on Wednesday. The placing of 25.5m shares with institutions was oversubscribed, with investors rep-orted to have received about a quarter of those they sought. The offer of 13.7m shares is believed to have been comfortably oversubscribed, with some applications thought to be from institutions disappointed in the placing.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Appetisers: Two rebirths TWO LONDON restaurant renaissances. First, Beauchamp Place on the site of the former Menage a Trois at 15 Beauchamp Place, SW3 (Tel: 071-589-4252). Bright decor, Mediterranean influences on the menu and a mouth-watering wine list at extremely keen prices. Second, Walsh's, a seafood and oyster restaurant at 5 Charlotte Street, W1, (071-637-0222) where Rue St Jacques used to be. Owned by the family which founded the Wheeler's restaurants, its decor bears an eerie resemblance to the original. ***** Two useful addresses omitted from our round-up of restaurants in theatreland. L'Escargot has now reopened at 48 Greek Street (071-437-2679). It is just around the corner from the not to be missed Crazy for You at the Prince Edward Theatre while, for opera goers, there is the long running Cafe Pacifico, 5 Langley Street, London WC2H 9JA. (071-240 7075). ***** My recent article on matching food and wines excited the senior management at The Savoy. Now every Thursday the food and beverage manager, head chef and sommelier meet to discuss and taste dishes and match them with suitable wines from the Savoy cellars for the following week's dinner menu in the River restaurant (071-836-4343). The four-course menu with a glass of different wine at each course is Pounds 45 per person including VAT, service and, if you are on the right table, a view across the river Thames. ***** Finally, to Hortus, the gardening magazine, a sister, Convivium, a quarterly journal devoted to good eating. It offers first-class writing, sympathetic line drawings and is available at annual subscription of Pounds 25 from Convivium, The Neuadd, Rhayader, Radnorshire LD6 5HH, Wales. Tel 0597-810227, fax 0597-811386.</p>

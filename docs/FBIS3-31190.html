			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 13 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel's visit to India and Thailand last week was meant to  indicate that despite the Czech Republic's interest in  membership in the European Union and other similar structures of  integration, the country was not taking a "Eurocentrist" stand,  the president said on Czech Radio today.    The president's speech was recorded in Thailand, during his  visit there. "Our foreign policy is aware of the world's  current interconnections," Havel continued, adding that  especially now that the Czech Republic had become a member of  the UN Security Council it did want to carry a "commensurate  portion of responsibility for the current state of the world."    Havel also said that talk is often heard of the chasm  separating the wealthy north and the poor south, but many who  speak of the problem do not even know enough about it or do not  really care.    He noted that the Indian section of his tour was planned a  little unconventionally, in that it did not include those  locations usually seen during state visits, and was informal.  The president pointed out that India was a functioning  democracy despite the great problems it was experiencing, and  its enormous number of citizens, nationalities and religions.  Havel called it a "phenomenal" fact, even more so when viewed  by someone who comes from a country where "we are constantly  fighting to find a political culture under conditions of a  relatively prospering, relatively homogeneous nation of ten  million."    Speaking about his visit to Thailand, Havel said democratic  structures were beginning to function in that country. Its  earlier "more authoritative" government had protected Thailand  from communism, he said, adding that he found it interesting  that the country had always managed to resist "various dangers  from the outside" and had never become a colony.</p>

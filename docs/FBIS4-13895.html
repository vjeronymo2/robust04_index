			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Apr. 24 (INA) -- An Iraqi newspaper said  that the West which shed tears on human rights maintains  indifference over human rights abuse in Saudi Arabia.    The paper AL-THAWRAH, organ of the Arab Ba'th Socialist  Party, said the imperialist West defends the Saudi regime which  throws Saudi strugglers from planes or leaves them in the Sahara  to face horrible death.    The paper said that the Western political deception is an  expression to the savageness of the colonialist mentality and  disregard of human rights when the affair is not linked with its  sphere of hegemony.    The paper said that human rights standard should be one in  the world and must conform with the International Declaration of  Human Rights and the UN charters and its correct and not  selective applications.    The paper stressed that human rights in Saudi are abused  while suspicious claims and lies are propagated by the American  State Department against Sudan, Iraq and other countries.</p>

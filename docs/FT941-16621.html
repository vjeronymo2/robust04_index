			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mortgage relief Where tax relief on mortgage interest is given under Miras, can the gross interest be deducted from income for the purpose of establishing whether any higher rate tax is payable? I am, of course, aware that relief from higher-rate tax is not given on the mortgage interest. No, your higher-rate liability for 1993-94 will be calculated as though you had no mortgage. Section 369 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, as amended, says: '(3A) In computing for the purposes of excess liability the total income of a person for any year of assessment, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any amount of relevant loan interest to which this section applies. '(3B) In this section, 'excess liability' means the excess of liability to income tax over what it would be if all income tax not chargeable at the lower rate by virtue of section 1(2)(aa) were charged at the basic rate, or (so far as applicable in accordance with section 207A) the lower rate, to the exclusion of any higher rate. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

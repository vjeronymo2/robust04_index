			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Soyabean price rally triggered by planting plans NEWS THAT US soyabean farmers intend to plant 800,000 fewer acres than grain analysts projected prompted a rally of 5 to 6 cents a bushel in Chicago soyabean futures in early trading yesterday, while wheat and maize prices also advanced. The US Department of Agriculture in its quarterly survey of farmers' spring plantings intentions estimated that 59.3m acres of soyabeans would be sowed this year, down from 59.33m last year, and well below trade expectations of 60m. The report also surprised wheat traders. It said record hard red spring wheat plantings of 18.96m acres are expected, above the 18.7m planted in 1992, but below trade estimates of 19m. Wheat prices gained 2 cents per bushel in early Chicago trading in response to the news. Spring wheat, which is high in protein, is often exported to the EC for bread baking. Plantings of durum, another variety of spring-planted wheat, were projected at a record low 2.09m acres, down nearly 500,000 from 1992. Although maize plantings were estimated nearly 1m acres above industry projections, at 76.49m, maize futures prices also managed a slight gain, carried along by the soyabean and wheat rallies. Mr. Victor Lespinasse, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago, said the wheat data were particularly encouraging.</p>

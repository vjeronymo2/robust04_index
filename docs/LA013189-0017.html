			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE  </P> <P> It was our first night in Los Angeles. Our daughter had some of the relatives  over for a party and about 10 p.m. (midnight in Omaha), jet lag had set in and  I went to bed.  </P> <P> Next morning I woke to find that I had slept through an earthquake described by  my daughter (who is used to them) as the sharpest she could remember (Part I,  Jan. 19).  </P> <P> My wife sleeping next to me in the same bed, stated that the bed was jumping up  and down and she thought that she had vertigo again.  </P> <P> The dog and cat went berserk. I was told that the chandeliers swayed for  several minutes.  </P> <P> This is no way to show hospitality. My kids may be trying to tell me something,  but we are going to stay with them for a week anyway.  </P> <P> It will take more than an earthquake to scare me out of town, but I am glad  that I live in Omaha where we only have tornadoes and blizzards.  </P> <P> NORM KORNEY  </P> <P> Omaha  </P></p>

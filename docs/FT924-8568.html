			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (4): The customer now comes first - Retail banks are employing contractors to sort out their IT requirements COUTTS Bank clings assiduously to the frock coat and royal family image that befits a 300-year-old bastion of the English establishment. Customers need Pounds 70,000 a year to open an account and, once they have done so, claim the famous red leather chequebook holder. The atmosphere projected by Coutts seems a world away from hole-in-the-wall cash machines and computer driven funds transfer networks. But Coutts knows its 40,000 wealthy customers expect more than a quaint uniform and impeccable social connections. Foreign exchange - in serious sums - is a common preoccupation of Coutts account holders. The bank's 30 exclusive branches handle some 1,200 sterling transactions every day. These involve amounts large enough to be extremely sensitive to slight variations in exchange rates. Until this year, foreign exchange transactions required confirmation with Coutts head office and extensive manual intervention. Although customer disquiet has not been in evidence, since 1988 the bank has been trying to automate a large part of this process and tidy up its service. A heavily-adapted software package from McDonnell Douglas, International Banking System (IBS), was brought in and applied to the task of pushing most foreign exchange work out to the branches. In terms of customer service, the Pounds 700,000 project has allowed Coutts to concentrate on what it is best at. The personal touch is what differentiates Coutts from High Street banks such as its parent NatWest. Now the branch staff have greater autonomy over straightforward deals and foreign exchange specialists are only called in for the tricky minority of transactions. Replacing administrative chores with keystrokes has eliminated a lot of donkey work, leaving Coutts people with more time to attend to its well-heeled customers. The choice of IBS was a mark of Coutts' independence. NatWest runs IBM mainframes, but Coutts is happy to stick with Digital Equipment hardware. McDonnell Douglas makes hardware, but Coutts was only interested in its software offering. It saw IBS as a system that could be drastically changed to meet localised needs. McDonnell Douglas' willingness to co-operate is a clear sign of its steady drift out of the hardware sector. The erstwhile box-maker is keen to establish a new image as a flexible systems house that can supply appropriate programs to run on whatever hardware platform suits the user. This is a trend that suits the finance sector with its multiplicity of systems. No one IT supplier can meet the needs of a large bank and the days of computer companies presuming to dictate the agenda of financial institutions are well over. Barclays Bank keeps its branch network running with a wide range of computer and banking equipment. For the past four years this catalogue of gadgets, ranging from bomb detectors to ATMs, has been maintained by one IT supplier. Barclays appointed Olivetti to take over the task of dealing with 200 separate maintenance contracts in a deal initially worth Pounds 56m. The policy has worked, and Barclays has just renewed the arrangement with a Pounds 100m contract that takes it up to 1997. Mr Brian Newman, a senior purchasing manager with Barclays, says Barclay's is now down to 20 sub-contractors for branch automation, all dealt with by Olivetti. Barclays signs the cheque and gets on with its primary concern of retail banking. Going to one IT company to manage branch systems has not committed Barclays to one source of computers and software. Quite the opposite. Like McDonnell Douglas, Olivetti has learnt to co-exist with whatever equipment the customer installs. Mr Newman perceives a neat irony in this. 'Ironically, Olivetti have won relatively few IT contracts during the life of the branch automation arrangement,' he says. Building societies have become indistinguishable from banks in retail services and hard-headed IT strategies. The National &amp; Provincial is buying in software from financial systems giants and commissioning adventurous work from small development shops. N&amp;P is trying to galvanise its senior executives with a Pounds 300,000 suite of software from NCR. The idea, feted in IT industry jargon as groupware, is to encourage live pooling of the management process. Familiar PCs run the NCR Co-operation program across 60 desks. A graphics-based front-end encourages directors to break away from their secretaries and share decisions with colleagues through the key-board. N&amp;P used The Software Partnership, a 100 strong systems house in Cheshire, to pull its Max telephone banking package together. The Software Partnership is in business to promote Architect, a software tool written with the banking sector in mind. Architect, says The Software Partnership's marketing director Mr Nigel Walsh, 'can connect any device or network into the bank's financial products'. It provides a formal framework for programmers working on a project and automates much of the time-consuming coding process. For Pounds 500,000 N&amp;P got Architect, the hardware to run a telephone banking system, and a result that its marketing department thought would appeal to younger customers. The Marlborough Stirling Group (MSG), a Cheltenham-based software house, is dedicated entirely to financial advice programming. It installs packages that guide bank staff through financial counselling with the customer. Unlike large systems houses MSG has stuck to the one niche, employing its own actuaries and legal experts. MSG charges between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 750,000 per institution. Banks and building societies have recognised the value of an IT consultancy with a dedicated knowledge base. After eight years in business MSG, counts the Bristol &amp; West building society and Allied Irish Bank among its clients. For them, MSG represents a practical answer to a specific problem. And there is no danger of a small consultancy trying to expand its involvement and lecture to the entire business. Persuading the notoriously opinionated IT industry to work to the customer's blueprint has never been easy. In the past large suppliers were all too keen to elevate IT as an end in itself. But financial institutions have found that by confining contractors within strict project guidelines they can reclaim the high ground of policy making and get back to banking. It is one innovation that will certainly benefit the customer.</p>

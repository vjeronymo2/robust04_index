			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Observer: Sucking up My, my. The Bank of England seems to be working itself up into a complete tizzy about Crest, its answer to the stock exchange's failed Taurus share settlement scheme. Iain Saville, the project controller, has done something few Bank of England officials ever dare to do. He's written a letter to the Investors Chronicle in a bid to get across his side of the argument. Moreover, today sees the first of a series of Bank of England roadshows up and down the country, enabling investors to moan at Pen Kent, the closest there is to a Bank troubleshooter. Not since former deputy governor Kit McMahon led a US roadshow in the 1970s to drum up support for the Britain's first Yankee bond issue has the Bank ever waged such a high-profile publicity campaign.</p>

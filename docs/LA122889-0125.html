			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOSURE OF MONTEREY COUNTY'S FT. ORD CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Budget cuts and logistical demands are leading top Army planners to consider  closing sprawling Ft. Ord in Monterey County and moving its primary tenant, the  7th Infantry Division (Light), to Ft. Lewis, Wash.  </P> <P> The cost of operating the beachfront facility, its potential real-estate value  and its distance from Travis Air Force Base -- a problem emphasized during the  invasion of Panama -- led to the reassessment of the fort's future, according  to two independent military newsletters.  </P> <P> The impact of closing the 28,000-acre facility could be significant in Monterey  County. Nearly 16,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians employed at the fort  generated about $970 million this year in payroll, contracts and federal aid to  local schools, the Army said.  </P> <P> At the same time, closure of the 28,057-acre facility could open much acreage  for development in one of the most affluent resort areas on the coast.  </P></p>

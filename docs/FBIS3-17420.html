Yeltsin: "With Deep Respect </F> and Gratitude"]    [Text] To the participants in the International  Scientific-Practical Conference dedicated to the 40th  anniversary of the start of the opening up of virgin lands and  fallow lands and to all participants in the virgin lands project    I wholeheartedly congratulate you, dear friends, on this  noteworthy date in the history of the peoples of Russia and all  the CIS countries -- the 40th anniversary of the start of the  opening up of the virgin and fallow lands.    The rapid opening up and development of vast, bleak,  previously unpopulated territories in Siberia, the Volga region,  the Urals, Kazakhstan, and other parts of the country  constituted a magnificent occurence in the life of our country  and our people. In the difficult postwar conditions the country  was embarking on the solution of the tremendous problem of  ensuring reliable self-sufficiency in food, and first and  foremost in grain.    Around 2 million young people responded to the call to open  up the virgin lands. Through their persistent work and with the  whole country's help a new grain-producing region was created.  The practical experience of opening up the virgin lands and the  fallow lands provides convincing evidence that, if people pool  their efforts, success is guaranteed even in the most difficult  task. That experience is especially valuable in the present,  complex time. The CIS countries can overcome the crisis and  resolve their complex problems quickly only if they act together  in close collaboration and cooperation in all spheres.    I pay deep respect and gratitude to all who contributed to  opening up the virgin and fallow lands, who devoted the best  years of their lives to that cause, and who made great efforts  to create prosperity for our people.    I wish you, dear comrades, good health, happiness, and new  successes.    [signed] B. Yeltsin.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Trade News: China pushes to join Gatt in EC talks TWO DAYS of high-level talks between the European Community and China opened yesterday, with the Chinese pressing their case for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs on Trade and the EC expressing concern about Beijing's growing trade surplus. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political relations, are to take part in the second plenary phase of talks today. The future of Hong Kong will also be on the agenda, a Brussels official said. The EC's dilemma is how to encourage economic reform in China as a catalyst to political reform, while at the same time defending its markets against what it considers unfair competition. EC officials said yesterday that China's trade surplus with the EC had risen to 'worrying levels', increasing from Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 940m) in 1988 to an estimated Ecu10bn at the end of 1992. 'The deficit is still growing, while EC exports have stagnated since 1986,' said one Brussels official. Last month, the EC took action to protect Community bicycle-makers from alleged 'dumping' by Chinese producers using unfairly low prices. It announced it would set duties at 34.4 per cent of the net price before customs clearance, following evidence that imports of racing, mountain and other bikes had more than tripled to 2.1m - or 10 per cent of the EC market. The Community has also sought to block toys and footwear imports. The Chinese are anxious to avoid these kind of bilateral trade pressures through Gatt membership. But an EC official stressed yesterday that China's import regime fell well short of free market principles. 'This will be of prime concern to the Community and other contracting parties during accession negotiations to the Gatt.' The EC pledged to hold 'a frank dialogue' with the Chinese on human rights as part of a progressive normalisation of political relations. This policy follows the suspension of high-level contacts and a freeze on co-operation in June 1989 after the Tienanmen Square massacre which lasted until October 1990.</p>

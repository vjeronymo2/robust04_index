			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Amato prepares to replace minister: Italian premier moves to repair damage caused by further resignation THE Amato government yesterday sought to shake off the image of a lame-duck administration in the wake of the weekend resignation of Mr Gianni Fontana, minister of agriculture, who had become swept up in Italy's continuing corruption scandals. Instead of marking time until the next main event in the political calendar  -the referendums set for April 18 - without replacing him, Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, yes terday said that he intended to appoint a new minister as soon as possible. It had been previously suggested that Mr Amato would make no new appointment at least until the referendums. One of the 10 referendums concerns the abolition of the Ministry of Agriculture and the devolution of decisions in agricultural matters to the regions. However, the agricultural minister has to watch over at least three key and controversial areas - the future of the Gatt talks and the impact of any agreement on Italian farmers, especially of oilseeds; the bitter dispute between Italy and the EC over milk quotas; and this month's outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Italy, caused by cattle imported from Croatia, which has led to a tough ban on meat exports. These considerations, combined with the obvious signals of weakness in any decision not to replace Mr Fontana, appear to have persuaded the prime minister. The portfolio was held by the Christian Democrats and replacement would have to come either from the same party or from the ranks of technocrats. Mr Fontana, 48, is under investigation by magistrates in his home base of Verona for alleged illicit financing of political parties. He is the fourth minister to resign in just over a month. Mr Giovanni Goria, who resigned as finance minister because of his alleged involvement in irregularities in a savings bank scandal, has since been cleared by magistrates. Meanwhile, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana the former EC commissioner, who resigned as Italy's environment minister last month and left the Socialist party in protest at Mr Amato's attempts to find a political solution to the judicial problems presented by the corruption scandals, was elected the leader of the Green party over the weekend. A total of six ministers have resigned since the Amato government was first formed at the end of June last year. The prime minister now faces an uphill task in convincing both the members of his own four-party coalition and the rest of parliament that he has the will to keep governing. The leaders of most of the political parties have begun discussions to consider whether a new, broader-based government should be formed after the referendums to carry out essential constitutional reforms. But the parties' positions remain riven by internal rivalries and suspicions.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(g) to define ``harvester''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a person who commercially takes molluscan shellfish from their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing waters, by any means. Harvester is defined because,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this proposal, this person has responsibility for tagging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product as to where it was harvested and when. Harvesters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expected to have an identification number issued by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish control authority. Harvesting is generally illegal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without such a number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to define the term ``importer'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(h) as the owner of the imported goods or his  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative in the United States. This is the person who is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for ensuring goods being entered are in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all laws affecting the importation. Importers may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always directly handle the imported food, but they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of products they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer for entry into the United States and therefore are subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to part 123.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recognizes that the term ``importer'' is often used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to describe not only the owner of the goods or his representative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the United States (that is, the importer of record) but also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes freight forwarders, food brokers, food jobbers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers, and steamship representatives. These other agents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often represent the importer for legal and financial purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not necessarily related to the safety of the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate to focus the HACCP requirements that bear on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imports on these persons if they do not have authority to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions affecting the product's safety or wholesomeness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to define a ``lot of molluscan shellfish'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(i) as no more than one day's harvest from a single,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined growing area, by one or more harvesters. This definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes the quantity of shellfish that represents a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lot for tagging or labeling purposes. Lot distinctions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to differentiate shellfish harvested from different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growing areas or at different times. The time limit of one day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is imposed because the safety of a harvesting area can change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> daily as the result of rainfall, tides, winds, and other events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can bring contaminants into the area. The ultimate safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of raw molluscan shellfish is contingent on the water quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvesting area. To ensure product safety, shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvesting areas that are subject to appropriate state control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are closed to harvesting within 24 hours of a finding of adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. The lot definition, coupled with the harvest date on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvesting tag, provides evidence that the shellfish were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvested when the area was safe and open for harvesting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(j) that ``molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish'' means any edible species, or edible portion of fresh  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or frozen oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops, except were the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scallop product consists entirely of the shucked adductor mussel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The distinction between molluscan shellfish and crustacean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish, which include crabs, shrimp, and lobsters, is made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because molluscan shellfish are commonly eaten whole and raw,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while crustacean shellfish are not. The safety of molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish therefore reflects the quality of the waters from which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are harvested and requires special public health controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the agency is proposing to amend the definition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``shellfish'' in &sect;1240.3(p) (21 CFR 1240.3(p)) to make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the proposed definition in &sect;123.3(j).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to amend the term ``shellfish'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;1240.3(p) to read ``molluscan shellfish'' to make the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent between parts 123 and 1240. Because the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish in its common usage, i.e., an edible mollusk or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crustacean, includes crabs and lobsters, the agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is necessary to be more specific and accurate in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition and consequent application of the requirements in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The proposed requirements for tagging do not apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to crabs and lobsters or to scallops when the final product is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the shucked adductor muscle only. The agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expand the definition in &sect;1240.3(p) to include scallops to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it consistent with the definitions in proposed part 123 and with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements under NSSP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is proposing to define ``potable water'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(k) as water that meets EPA's primary drinking water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Those regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide limits for certain microbiological, chemical, physical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and radiological contaminants that can render water unsafe for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed definition is slightly different from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``potable water'' in &sect;&sect;1240.3(k) and 1250.3(j) (21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 1250.3(j). That definition also references the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of EPA in 40 CFR part 141 but further includes FDA sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in 21 CFR parts 1240 and 1250. Those sanitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements apply to interstate travel conveyances that must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take on water at watering points. Such requirements are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant to these proposed regulations and thus were not included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposed definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to define ``processing'' and ``processor'' in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.3(m) and (n) broadly to ensure the safety of seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the application of HACCP principles throughout the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood industry. The definition of ``processor'' is intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all seafood processors that handle products in interstate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commerce, such as shuckers and other processors of raw molluscan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shellfish, factory ships, packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehouses. Those who process low acid canned foods are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included, even though they are subject to the HACCP controls of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 113. Those controls are targeted toward a limited number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety hazards. These proposed regulations require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors apply HACCP controls to all likely safety hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

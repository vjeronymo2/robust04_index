			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 6 May (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee, president of China, and  chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected work in  Shanghai from 26 April to 6 May. He went deep to grass-roots  units to conduct investigations and studies on issues concerning  reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability,  and to seek opinions on a wide range of issues from people from  various sectors.    Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee; and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Jiang  Zemin inspected some large and medium state-owned enterprises  and met with some enterprises' factory managers (managers) to  discuss issues concerning establishing a modern enterprise  system on a trial basis. Jiang Zemin stressed large and medium  state-owned enterprises' important position and role in building  and developing a socialist market economy, pointing out that the  underlying way to improve large and medium state-owned  enterprises is to further deepen reform, transform enterprises'  operating mechanisms, and build a modern enterprise system. He  said that Shanghai was in a good position to establish a modern  enterprise system on a trial basis. He urged the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee and government to continue to create a  good environment and conditions for enterprise reform, and to  make positive efforts to study ways to transform government  functions, improve the management of state assets, improve  enterprises' internal management, build a social insurance  system, refine the market system, and reduce enterprises'  excessive burden so that work on establishing a modern  enterprise system on a trial basis can be carried out in an  organized and systematic manner.    At a meeting with leading cadres of some districts,  counties,  bureaus, and enterprises of Shanghai to discuss issues on  strengthening party building, Jiang Zemin said that we should  pay great attention to strengthening party building and  improving the party's leadership throughout the process of  reform, opening up, and modernization. He urged party  committees at all levels to earnestly study Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and to further ensure that this fundamental  ideological work is carried out properly. He said: We should  uphold and refine the party's system of democratic centralism,  pay attention to selecting and educating young cadres, reinforce  and improve the building of grass-roots party organizations, and  increase the party's rallying power and combat capabilities. To  suit the new situation of developing a socialist market economy,  we should forcefully promote socialist spiritual civilization,  raise the people's overall educational level, and advance  development in all social sectors.    During his stay in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin also heard reports  by concerned departments on local economic construction, the  state of reform and opening up, development in Pudong,  Shanghai's urban construction, the "vegetable basket" project,  party building, and the promotion of spiritual civilization. He  fully affirmed the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and  government's achievements in resolutely complying with the  nation's general work demand for this year and in carrying out  the principle on economic work which were set forth by the  central authorities; in properly handling the relationships  between reform, development, and maintaining stability; and in  maintaining the good development trend of reform, opening up,  and economic construction. He said: The party Central Committee  and State Council's policy on developing and opening up Pudong  is firmly established and will not change. Developing and  opening up Pudong not only affects Shanghai's development but  also is an important symbol of China's reform and opening up.  The development and opening up of Pudong over the last four  years has forcefully boosted Shanghai's economic construction  and has served as a locomotive in developing the economy of the  entire Chang Jiang Valley. Practice shows that the central  authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong is  completely correct. We must follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  instruction that "We should ensure Pudong's development; we must  not waver and must see to it that the work is completed," and  ensure that this transcentury great project is properly carried  out. Jiang Zemin expressed his hope that the comrades in  Shanghai will persist in emancipating their minds and in seeking  truth from facts, and, in light of the new situation concerning  reform, development, and social stability, that they will  maintain and develop the good situation and do their work in all  areas even better.    Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his  inspection tour included Zeng Qinghong, director of the General  Office of the CPC Central Committee.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy-back lifts recs Cazenove, the stockbroker, moved swiftly to implement Midlands Electricity's buy-back programme, purchasing 21.2m shares at 725p apiece in a deal identical to that carried out some weeks ago by Northern Electricity. Cazenove had to move sharply to buy the shares ahead of Midlands' 'closed' period which commences tomorrow. Turnover in Midlands reached 46m shares. Midlands' buy-back involved its broker buying in stock from institutions and selling other recs back to them in a deal involving a tax credit for the stock sold. Midlands shares moved ahead 13 to 714p as its buy-back was completed, while other recs raced higher as Cazenove bought in Midlands stock and sold back other recs shares. The institutions chased those stocks which have permission to buy in shares but have not yet done so ahead of their respective closed periods. These included East Midlands, which forged ahead 25 to 713p, and is entitled to buy in 21.9m shares ahead of its closed period due to start in the middle of this month; and Eastern, which can buy up to 38.4m shares until October 12. Eastern advanced 20 to 727p. Yorkshire, 19 1/2 stronger at 710p, and Southern, 27 higher at 721p, were other recs entitled to buy in stock but yet to do so. Yorkshire can buy up to 20m shares and Southern's limit is 27.2m.</p>

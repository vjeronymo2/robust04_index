			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank holds fall to 6% despite markets downturn Bayerische Hypo-Bank yesterday announced a set of 10-month results that compare favourably with those of other leading German banks, which have suffered steep declines in profits as a result of weak bond markets. The Munich-based bank said group operating profits were 6.5 per cent lower at DM807m (Dollars 514m). Mr Eberhard Martini, chairman, said the year-end figure should be about the same as 1993's. Like its German competitors, Hypo-Bank suffered from the downturn in bond markets, with its own-account trading in securities, foreign exchange and other financial instruments showing a loss of DM63m against a profit of DM174m in the same period last year. However, the bank showed a 9.4 per cent rise, to DM1.6bn, in partial operating profits, which reflect basic loan, savings and other customer business. This was mainly attributed to a 12.5 per cent increase in the interest surplus, to DM3.4bn, reflecting an improved interest rate margin and an expansion of its mortgage banking business. Hypo-Bank's commission surplus eased by 4 per cent to DM731m. This was mainly because of lower securities business, with payments transactions up considerably and lending fees showing a slight improvement. Loan-loss provisions were 9 per cent lower at DM873. Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, wants to build up a strong investment banking unit in London, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Dresdner said there was no question of it turning its back on the Frankfurt financial centre. 'We want, rather, to build up successively a strong investment banking unit in London,' it said. It said any large international bank seeking a role in investment banking had to have a presence in London. The bank was responding to a question about an article in the financial newsletter Platow Brief which said Dresdner was planning a strategic restructuring of its activities in London. In October, Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said it planned to concentrate all its investment banking activities under a single management structure in London.</p>

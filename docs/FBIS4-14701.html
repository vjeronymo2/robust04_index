			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the CONTACT news agency, the Georgian  head of state [Eduard Shevardnadze] met Barukh Birenbaum,  Israeli ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Georgia  [name and title as heard]. Mr. Shevardnadze familiarized the  visitor with the current complicated political and economic  situation in Georgia, which caused the postponement of his  official visit to Israel until a more suitable time. The  Israeli ambassador accepted the explanation given by the  Georgian head of state with understanding and expressed hope  that the visit would take place in the near future.</p>

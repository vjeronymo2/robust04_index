			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Venezuela reform agenda is long - but time is short / Examining the problems laid bare by the abortive coup against Perez AN ABORTIVE coup two weeks ago has laid bare many of the problems facing Venezuelan society but was not a direct result of the government's economic reform programme, according to politicians, economists and diplomats in Caracas. A series of interviews suggested the need for reform in the armed forces, the electoral and political system and improved provision of public goods such as education and health. There was doubt about the capacity of the government of President Carlos Andres Perez to address all these issues. The president said in an interview that the coup of February 4 was being planned before he took office three years ago. This version of events, supported by others close to the armed forces, would rule out his economic reform programme as the direct cause of the coup. However, the coup leaders appear to have been influenced in their timing by the belief that support for the government among the population had reached a low ebb. This perceived lack of support - senior figures in the president's own Democratic Action (AD) party say their polls suggest it is concentrated in the middle classes rather than among the poor - amplified the dangers presented by the coup attempt. However, Mr Perez's assertion in the interview that there was little support for the coup among the armed forces is questioned by some individuals close to the army. According to one of them, up to a quarter of the army's 40,000 officers and men may have backed the coup, and as much of 80 per cent of its firepower. That the coup failed was a consequence of ineptitude in its planning and the rebels' failure to secure their first objective of capturing or killing the president. The coup leaders had not gained support in the air force or in the streets and did not take over the capital's television and radio stations, a lapse that allowed the president to make a broadcast to the country. The origins of the coup lay with a group of soldiers who passed through the Venezuelan military academy in 1974 and 1975. The rebel's ideology appears, to a European eye, an anachronistic farrago of idealism and Latin military machismo. Their leader, Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias, had charismatic qualities which appealed to young officers, an increasingly disgruntled group whose standard of living had declined dramatically under the last two governments. According to Gen Italo del Valle Alliegro, a former defence minister and head of the armed forces, Venezuela's military has tended to draw its personnel from all of Venezuelan society. 'A military caste, such as in Argentina, Ecuador, Peru and even Colombia, doesn't exist in Venezuela.' The military's support for the democratic order appears, partly for this reason, to have been taken for granted and the army, in common with other institutions of state in Venezuela, left to decline. Salaries are extraordinarily low. A general receives 70,000 bolivars (Dollars 1,100) a month, now being increased by 30 per cent, a figure that will do little but keep pace with last year's inflation. The perception among some lower-ranking officers has been that many of the higher command are raking off large sums of money. Persistent accusations of corruption against politicians and senior military men - and the failure of successive elected governments to improve the state of the oil-dominated economy, particularly since the end of the 1970s oil boom - have encouraged an ill-defined desire among some Venezuelans for a 'new beginning'. According to one diplomat, this may be a signal that rather than strengthening over time, democratic institutions begin to weaken. It is 34 years since the downfall of the last military dictatorship in Venezuela; the memories of it are much fresher in Argentina, Brazil or Chile. The government has reduced some opportunities for corruption, although even the president admits it remains a problem. None the less, memories of his previous administration, in power at the height of the oil boom - have not helped his reputation as a fighter of graft. The reputation of politicans and political parties is low. 'The government doesn't set a very good example,' said Mr Freddy Rojas, president of Fedecamaras, an organisation representing Venezuelan business interests. 'We need to 'moralise' the government,' said Mr Julio Camino, an AD deputy. Herein lies the importance of further electoral reform. President Perez has moved some way towards this, introducing direct elections at a local level. However, his proposals to introduce 'uninominal' or direct voting of deputies to the national legislature have been blocked. The current system has the parties creating 'slates' of candidates. Once on the slate in the right area, a politician's future is thus guaranteed. His loyalty thereafter is then to the party chiefs so that they keep him on the slate, rather than to the people who voted for him. This system of party patronage works right down to the lowest level. Rather as in the Soviet Union, having a friend in the party determines, for example, whether an individual gains access to a hospital bed. In embarking on a Dollars 4bn programme to improve the provision of health care, education and other aspects of social welfare, the government is recognising that there is a lack of public investment in these areas, although whether it will tackle chronic poor maintenance which blights the Venezuelan public sector is another question. Mr Robert Bottome, an economist and publisher, says the government has had some success in cushioning the effects of its economic programme on the poor, providing food and income support for mothers, for example, to cover for increased costs associated with lost subsidies. However, it had patently failed to provide goods associated with public investment. Mr Bottome's solution, at a time of budgetary stringency, would be to accelerate the privatisation of Venezuela's public sector enterprises to generate funds for public investment in areas such as health. Even excluding oil, the public sector in Venezuela accounts for 28 per cent of gross domestic product. The coup attempt, if not a direct result of the economic programme, can be seen as a manifestation of a more general economic malaise. If President Perez is going to tackle these problems, his agenda is a long one. The events of two weeks ago suggest he may not have as much time as he thought. A Venezuelan military court yesterday charged 33 mid-ranking army officers with leading or helping to stage the attempted coup on February 4, Reuter reports from Caracas. Those charged, who include alleged coup leader Lt Col Hugo Chavez Fras, face a maximum of 28 years in prison.</p>

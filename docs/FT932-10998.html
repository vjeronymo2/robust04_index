			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Book Review: Gurus of how to get more for less REINVENTING GOVERNMENT By David Osborne and Ted Gaebler Addison-Wesley Pounds 19.95/Dollars 22.95, 405 pages The publishing world has long recognised that books by business management gurus such as Tom Peters and Peter Drucker can be big money-spinners. The same has not been true about books on public-sector management, until the arrival of Reinventing Government. When the book was first published in the US last year, it shot into The New York Times non-fiction best-seller list for eight weeks. In its ninth reprinting, it is now being promoted to receptive audiences around the world. The authors were barely known in the US until the book's publication. Ted Gaebler is a management consultant who was formerly city manager of Visalia, California, and Vandalia, Ohio. David Osborne is a writer, journalist and political consultant. The success of the book means that they now command superstar fees for speaking at conferences and advising politicians. This week, top British civil servants and local government managers will hear Mr Osborne in a programme of seminars organised by the Civil Service College. The book's message is simple - there is a revolution under way in government, as people demand more from public services while being prepared to pay less in taxes. Getting more for less is creating an entrepreneurial spirit, the authors say, which is transforming the public sector 'from schoolhouse to state-house, city hall to the Pentagon'. The traditional model for delivering public services is the top-down bureaucracy designed to ensure equity of treatment for the taxpayer by delivering identical services to all. But consumers are no longer happy with standardised public services. Quality, choice, responsiveness and competition are what the punters have become accustomed to in the private sector. They now want the same in the public sector - and want it for less. That requires public-sector managers to behave more like entrepreneurs, defined by the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say as shifting 'economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield'. The authors set out 10 principles around which entrepreneurial government can be established. These include old favourites from mainstream business management literature, such as decentralisation, meeting the needs of customers and becoming mission-driven. But there are also more fundamental points which justify the title of the book. For example, public funds should be used to encourage the private sector to provide services, rather than to create new public agencies and organisations. Success should be measured in terms of outcomes, whether it be educational qualifications or successful operations, rather than budget size or staff numbers. Public services should invest in prevention rather than cure. Above all, the role of government is to steer, not to row. This is the core of the 'reinventing government' approach, a new vision of public services in which the state sees its job as enabler rather than doer, purchaser rather than provider. Along with most 'how to manage' books, this volume is stuffed with success stories which illustrate the new entrepreneurialism, almost entirely drawn from US experience. It also has its heroes such as General Bill Creech, who reorganised the Defence Department's Tactical Air Command along decentralised lines and revolutionised its performance. Only passing references are made to public-sector reforms in other countries such as the UK, New Zealand and Australia. This is a pity, since New Zealand, in particular, best embodies the spirit of reinventing government, with all public services now provided under contracts which clearly specify outcomes. Such omissions irritate UK admirers of the book, including Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister. He points out that the government published its Citizen's Charter, commended by Osborne and Gaebler, on the very day that the two authors submitted their manuscript to the publishers. However, it is the theoretical underpinning of the public service reforms now under way across many of the advanced economies which accounts for the book's deserved success. It provides a rationale for the practices which public-sector managers in a variety of countries have adopted in the search to get more for less from public funds. The success of the book also marks what is described as a paradigm shift in thinking. In the 1980s, it was the Reagan-Thatcher agenda which dominated problem-solving in government. This sought to force back the boundaries of the state, privatising some public services and withdrawing altogether from others. A new agenda has emerged in the 1990s, which is more concerned with making public services efficient and effective than in cutting them down to size. It is also an agenda which finds support across the ideological spectrum. In the US, it is the Democrats who have taken up the cause, in contrast to the Bush administration which, with honourable exceptions, neglected such domestic issues. It is natural territory for Bill Clinton, who spent time reinventing the Arkansas state government during his governorship. In Australia and New Zealand, it was Labor administrations which launched public-sector reforms. In the UK it has been the Conservatives under John Major who have seized the 'reinventing government' agenda, a clear break with the Thatcherism which preceded it. Whatever the political stripe of the politicians, they are all responding to the same demand for better-quality public services at less cost. For the ambitious public-sector manager, Osborne and Gaebler are now required reading.</p>

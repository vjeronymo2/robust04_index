			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Observer: Phoney warfare Shame. Japanese bureaucrats have been receiving nuisance telephone calls at home. Japan's Ministry of Finance says some senior officials have recently received so many rude calls that their numbers may be deleted from the ministerial directory, which oddly enough seems a national best-seller. The ministry won't elaborate further. More tantalisingly, neither will it point a finger of blame. Cynics suggest listening to the accents of the callers. Are they heavily US-inclined? Maybe Washington's trade negotiators have alighted on new methods of negotiation . . .</p>

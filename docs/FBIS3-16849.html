			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Andrey Naryshkin, ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 21 Mar -- Participants in the talks between  government delegations of Croatia and the Serb Republic of  Krajina due to open at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday  will strive toward an agreement on stopping hostilities  immediately.    The talks, which are to be resumed, as is known, at the  initiative of the Russian side, will be based on a draft  agreement on a cease-fire drawn up by specialists from UN  peace-making forces. The Croat delegation is expected to be led  by Hrvoje Sarinic, head of the republic's security service, and  the Serb delegation by Rear Admiral Dusan Rakic, defense  minister of the Serb Republic of Krajina which Croatia does not  recognize. Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the Russian  president, the Russian and U.S. ambassadors in Croatia as well  as officials from UN peace-making forces and the international  conference on former Yugoslavia are to attend the talks as  mediators.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from trustworthy  sources in Zagreb that the basic content of the draft agreement  boils down to the following:    - The sides agree to cease armed operations forthwith and  also to cease fire on all lines of contact as of a date to be  agreed;    - The tactical deployment of the armed forces which are  situated along the line of contact and within a radius of 10 km  in all directions relative to the line of contact will be frozen  on the day the agreement is signed and movement of military  units and sub-units will be banned;    - All targetable weapons will be deployed outside the  region of the line of contact: mortars and antiaircraft guns at  least 10 km and artillery and tanks at least 20 km;    - All sub-units to be withdrawn from the line of contact  by at least 1,000 meters;    - Observance of the cease-fire is to be monitored by the  UNPROFOR and the EC observer mission;    - Joint commissions are being set up at all levels and  their main task is to mark the terrain where the sides'  disengagement lines are situated and to investigate any  cease-fire violations;    - A certain number of checkpoints will be opened along the  entire line of contact. Conditions for the joint commissions to  meet at the checkpoints will be created.    A separate point treats the need for the sides to meet to  discuss the conditions for the reduction of the armed forces  within the 10 km security zone.    On the eve of the talks Vitaliy Churkin is holding intensive  consultations in Zagreb with the highest UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] officials and with representatives of the international  conference on the former Yugoslavia.</p>

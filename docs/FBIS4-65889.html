			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Solbes: `EU Is Mistaken in Its </F> Economic Analysis for Spain'"]    [Text] Brussels -- Spanish Economy Minister Pedro Solbes  Monday [16 May] described as pessimistic the economic forecasts  for 1994 and 1995 made by the European Commission. The European  commissioner for finance -- Denmark's Henning Christophersen --  presented these forecasts to the economic and finance ministers  of the European Union [EU] yesterday. The Community's executive  forecasts economic growth in the EU of 1.6 percent for 1994 and  2.5 percent for 1995.    Solbes told the press that "Spain fundamentally disagrees  with the European Commission with respect to economic growth,  reduction of the public deficit, and inflation," and that this  opinion is shared by the rest of the Twelve.    Christophersen estimated that Spain will have GDP growth of  1.1 percent in 1994 and 2.3 percent in 1995, a public deficit of  7.2 percent (1994) and 6.6 percent (1995), and an inflation rate  of 4.8 percent this year and 4.6 percent next year.  <H5>  1.3 Percent Still Stands </H5>   However, the Spanish Government stands by its growth  forecast  of 1.3 percent for this year and between 2.3 percent and 2.6  percent for 1995.    The Community's forecasts for Spain contrast with the  optimism of the country's leading financial circles, most of  which have revised upward their forecasts for that indicator.    Solbes stated that for the present the Spanish Government  knows only the estimates issued by the Bank of Spain, and is  awaiting the results of the national audit for the first quarter.    The atmosphere of economic confidence has developed in Spain  since the provisional results for the first quarter -- which  show that the economy grew by 0.5 percent of GDP over the first  period of the previous year -- became known.    The improvement is attributed to the strong growth in  exports, but also to a slight improvement in domestic demand.  The Spanish minister insisted that the Commission is also  mistaken about inflation, in setting a percentage of 4.8 percent  for Spain, with "so emphatic an assertion that prices are not  falling in Spain."    The Spanish economic authorities forecast an inflation rate  of 4.2 percent for this year.    The Spanish minister maintained that "this assertion is just  a half-truth," because underlying inflation (which does not  include food) is falling, and wages are performing better this  year than in the previous year.    Solbes specified that food prices performed very poorly in  1993, owing mainly to the devaluation of the peseta.    With respect to the public deficit, the commissioner  believes  that Spain will end 1994 with a deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP,  while the government forecasts 6.4 percent.    "This figure is quite realistic, because Social Security has  performed better than expected. To talk about 7.2 percent makes  no sense," Solbes said, rejecting the Commission's argument that  the autonomous communities' enormous deficit will have a  negative impact on the overall average.  <H5>  Agreement on Employment </H5>   The only point of agreement between Christophersen and  Solbes  concerns the unemployment figures, since they both agree that  they will be around 22.3 percent over the next two years.    The Spanish minister did not rule out Spain's being able to  create jobs with an economic growth rate of around 1.5 percent  of GDP.    He pointed out that "it is possible in theory, although  hitherto Spain has been unable to do so because of the  rigidities of the labor market, now modified by the labor  reform."    In order to revive the Community's economy, he emphasized  that it is necessary to continue to lower long-term interest  rates, and he even mentioned the possibility of Europe's  departing from the U.S. model with regard to increasing interest  rates, "because otherwise economic growth and recovery will be  curbed."</p>

Rustamov, Institute of Petrochemical Processes, Azerbaijan  Academy of Sciences; UDC 665.633.252:665.642.9]    [Abstract] An optimum process flow for refining petroleum  benzin that makes it possible to obtain both benzene and AI-93  high-quality unleaded gasoline was developed on the basis of a  process that was previously developed at the Institute of  Petrochemical Processes of the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences.  Three versions of the petroleum benzin-refining process were  studied: 1) catalytic enrichment; 2) removal of the  70C-90C benzene fraction from the petroleum benzin for  subsequent enrichment; and 3) removal of the benzene fraction  for petrochemical purposes, removal of the low-boiling through  70C (l.b.-70C) fraction for subsequent etherification  by C[.sub]1[/]-C[.sub]3[/] monohydric alcohols, and  removal of the 70C through catalytic cracking  (70C-c.c.) fraction for catalytic enrichment and subsequent  mixing with the l.b.-70C fraction after etherification. The  catalytic enrichment was conducted on a consolidated laboratory  unit with a fluidized bed of zeolite-containing catalyst such as  Tseokar-2 at a temperature of 100-120C and pressure of  2.5-3 MPa. When petroleum benzin was subjected to catalytic  enrichment under stringent conditions (i.e., at 520C), a  yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 according to the  motor method (98 according to the research method) of 82.9  percent was achieved; however, the said gasoline had a high  aromatic hydrocarbon content (49.2 percent). Under less  stringent conditions (i.e., at 480C), the gasoline yield  increased to 87.2 percent and the content of aromatic  hydrocarbons dropped to 37.2 percent (the said gasoline had an  octane number of up to 83.5 according to the motor method and  94.5 according to the research method). Catalytic enrichment of  petroleum benzin without the 70-90C fraction resulted in an  84.8 percent yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85  (motor method) and with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 39  percent. The third version of the process resulted in a 5  percent increase in gasoline yield. The said gasoline had a  reduced aromatic hydrocarbon content and an oxygen-containing  compound content of 2.5-2.6 percent. In addition to boosting  aromatic hydrocarbon production efficiency, the new process flow  also eliminates a number of the problems involved in producing  high-octane fuels.

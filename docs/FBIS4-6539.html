			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Handa, from the "Building of the New SDF </F> Following the End of the Cold War" series; part two entitled  "Self-Defense Forces Incapable of Fighting Due to Lack of  Bullets"]    [Text] "The only imperfection is that there are few bullets  to shoot on the rare occasions they are required." As stated  in a "senryu" [Japanese traditional satirical poem] composed by  a member of the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], the  Self-Defense Forces [SDF] have suffered from chronic shortages  of ammunition. Although ammunition factories are fully capable  of production, half of these factories are not in operation.    Chugoku Kayaku Corporation [CKC] is engaged in filling  cartridge cases with gunpowder (the main office is in Kure,  Hiroshima Prefecture). There are eight assembly plants in  Yoshii, Gunma Prefecture, but only half of them are operating  every day.    Four years ago, when the number of contracts received from  the Defense Agency [DA] reached its peak, CKC extended its road  to construct new factories along it. However, at the moment no  new factories are found, and only weeds grow near the road.    There are more than 10 ammunition manufacturers in Japan,  but  only two companies are engaged in filling cartridge cases with  gunpowder. CKC exclusively handles large ammunition, such as  artillery shells and guided missiles; 87 percent of its sales  rely on contracts received from the DA.    Following the conclusion of the Cold War, the growth of the  DA budget for purchases of ammunition leveled off in line with  the sluggish rise in the defense budget. In the draft 1994  budget, the defense budget decreased compared to that of the  previous year. Due to the increase in expensive ammunition such  as guided missiles, the budget for artillery shells was reduced,  while the number of cartridge cases to be filled with gunpowder  also decreased. The amount of orders received by CKC fell to  two-thirds of that during the peak.    Tomihiro Umeyama, head of CKC's Tokyo branch office, said  frankly: "Further sluggishness in the size of orders could  result in a severe situation, such as deteriorated quality and a  drain of technicians."    On the other hand, an official from the DA Equipment Bureau  [DAEB] said: "It is impossible to increase the defense budget  for the sake of one private company." However, at the same time  he added: "From the viewpoint of national security, the  bankruptcy of an ammunition manufacturer could cause problems."  It is common sense in the international community that  ammunition should be produced domestically because, in case of  emergency, there is a possibility imports will be suspended. A  DA officer merely reiterated the routine remark: "The company  should make increased efforts."    More than 1,300 manufacturers do business with the DA; this  number is even larger if subcontracting companies are included.  Reduction in the defense budget is a direct issue of life and  death for the defense industry. However, the DAEB is helpless  because "the development of the industry is beyond our  responsibility." Some officials even retort aggressively: "If  they are really faced with difficulties, they will raise unit  prices. If they do so, we will simply have to buy more  expensive products."    The essence of the problem is believed to lie in Japan's  defense philosophy itself. When the "National Defense Program  Outline" was formulated in 1976, the DA stipulated that in an  emergency the SDF should be able to fight for one month, and  thus began storing ammunition. However, total stores of  ammunition, including reserves at the end of 1992, are 127,000  tons, far short of the goal of a one-month stock.    On the other hand, the DA did not hesitate to purchase the  most advanced equipment for frontline defense, including the  F-15 fighter, Aegis ships with superior air defense capability,  and airborne warning and control systems (AWACS).    A colonel with the Ground Staff Office offers  self-criticism,  saying: "If there is insufficient ammunition, the latest  equipment will be nothing but paper-mache. The absence of  objections to distorted procurement programs proves the DA has  become insensitive under the prolonged peace."    Disarmament brings out the reality of an "army" incapable of  fighting.</p>

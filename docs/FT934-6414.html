			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Sheehy in bid for National Lottery Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, has put together a consortium to plan a formal bid for the licence to run the National Lottery. The company, called Rainbow, brings to eight the total of identified consortia committed to launching a bid or seriously considering one. Apart from Sir Patrick, Rainbow's members include Mr Richard Wheatley, chairman of Leo Burnett, the marketing and advertising company; Mr Trevor Thatcher, former managing director of Vernons Pools; Mr Peter Borer, until recently managing director of BR Telecommunications; and Mr Barry Skipper, former chief executive of Booker's food distribution division. Rainbow said that if it decided to go ahead it would have the backing of a number of blue-chip companies. The aim, it said, was to put together a management team capable of running the lottery. In spite of Sir Patrick's chairmanship of BAT, it is unlikely that the company will provide financial backing. Leo Burnett will be closely involved in planning the bid. It has appropriate marketing experience from its involvement in helping to launch the successful lottery in New Zealand. Sir Patrick, acting as chief executive of Rainbow, said the group was evaluating the draft invitation to apply. 'In the event that we decide to proceed with a formal application, I am pleased to say that we can rely on the financial support of very major blue-chip organisations,' he said. The announced bidders for the National Lottery include: The Great British Lottery Company, including Granada and Carlton; Camelot, backed by Cadbury Schweppes and Racal; and a joint venture between NM Rothschild and Tattersalls of Australia.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Serb newspapers ignore plight of besieged Moslems: International Press Review -  Serbia Duga, the most popular magazine in Serbia, was impossible to find last week. There had been a rush to read the confessions of Mrs Dafina Milanovic, whose bank, Dafiment, failed last year, leaving her depositors clamouring for about Dollars 300m. The interest in matters financial came as the foreign press was asking whether the Nato ultimatum would end the tragedy in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Serbia's state-run media ignored the plight of the Moslems and denounced the West as warmongers conspiring against Serbia. The media is one of the main pillars upon which President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia has built his regime, using it to whip up ethnic hatred against his opponents. Tiny B-92, a Belgrade radio station, and a handful of objective and independent publications, are overshadowed by the gigantic Television Serbia, which spews a mixture of lies, bigotry and misinformation. In the Duga article, members of Serbia's ruling elite were alleged to have been involved in financial wrongdoings, which led to the collapse of Dafiment, one of the biggest banks in the Balkans, and left tens of thousands of Serbian citizens without any savings. At first, Mrs Milanovic's remarks seemed a scandalous expose of the murky world of Belgrade's powerbrokers. But her revelations stopped short of implicating Mr Milosevic and his allies. Instead her roster included people who, in varying degrees, were Mr Milosevic's opponents and could now be made public scapegoats. Duga fits in the largest category of Serbian publications, those which pretend to be independent but are actually run by the regime of Mr Milosevic. However, each issue offers a bizarre range of view-points: from the fascist to liberal. Of special interest in Duga is the diary of Mrs Mirjana Markovic, the wife of Mr Milosevic. Her musings on the nature of life, spring-time in Belgrade often sound the death knell for the political rivals of her husband or herald an imminent Machiavellian manoeuvre by the Serbian President. The diary of Mrs Markovic is then reprinted in Politika, the oldest and most influential Serbian daily. This traditionally pro-government newspaper over the past year has softened its tone after an unfortunate period as a screeching mouthpiece of Serbian nationalism. In Belgrade, three other daily papers are published: ultra-nationalist and anti-Western Vecernje Novosti, sensationalist Politika Express, and liberal Borba. While each claim a high circulation, readership has fallen drastically with the impoverishment of the population and the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The centrepiece of the Serbian media is Television Serbia, the motor of the government's propaganda machine. It is most powerful in rural parts of the country, where the illiteracy rate is higher, and is especially important in Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia, where newspapers are rare commodities. The main news programme, Dnevnik 2, sets the tone of popular opinion. Its content is so tightly-controlled that it must be approved by the highest level of government. Information is re-packaged in such a way that, for example, the Serb assault on Gorazde is portrayed as a desperate counter-attack by heroic, bare-handed Serb defenders. Any public appearance of Mr Milosevic is the top item on the news. It goes to great lengths to mould public perceptions. At the weekend President Bill Clinton was depicted as an 'enemy of the Serbian nation' for his calls to launch air strikes. Television Serbia broadcast a remarkably unflattering photograph of him with mouth agape. Television Serbia over the past few years has sacked dozens of liberal and talented journalists leaving a cast of the obedient who serve up a nightly diet of dull and rambling programmes, in the old-fashioned communist style. There is a small but flourishing independent media which openly critices official policies. Tiny B-92, the courageous independent radio, cannot even be heard in all of Belgrade. The group of dedicated reporters has managed to excel even in the most adverse circumstances. Vreme, the respected weekly, Nin, which has emerged as a non-partisan magazine, and Borba, the only liberal daily, are an island of sanity in this hostile sea of nationalist hatred. In Kosovo, the mostly ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia, Albanian-language broadcasting was shut down four years ago by Belgrade, but the press has rebounded. Bujku, the daily, is controlled by the biggest Albanian party. Koha, Forumi and Zeri, independent weeklies, offer a range of political view-points. The campaign against the independent media in Serbia reached fever pitch with Nato air strikes against Serb targets in Bosnia, when the credentials of thirteen journalists working for foreign media were revoked. Belgrade radio warns of dark days for Yugoslavs working for non-governmental media. The state of the Serbian press reflects the moral disarray of the country. As Belgrade heightens its rhetoric against the outside world, the independent media remains at the mercy of a merciless regime.</p>

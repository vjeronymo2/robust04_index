Heavy rain and fog over the city may also have contributed  to  a grounding of aircraft and the silencing of rival artillery  fire.    With the peace depending on the cooperation of President  Borhanoddin Rabbani, and his response still unknown, thousands  of local residents took advantage of the first lull in fighting  in almost a week to flee with all their belongings.    Scores were reported dead and more than 3,000 people wounded  in the six days of clashes tied to a power struggle in which  Hekmatyar and his ally, Uzbek warlord 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, have  been attempting to oust Rabbani.    Sources inside the Dostam camp, which has been most active  in  Kabul and backed by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of  Afghanistan] faction, said he would also accept international  calls for a brief ceasefire.    Pakistan, in a "fervent appeal" Thursday, urged all warring  Afghan factions in Kabul to agree to a 24-hour truce starting at  1100 GMT Friday so that all diplomatic and UN personnel living  in Kabul and civilians wounded since the New Year's day coup  attempt could be "evacuated on an emergency basis."    "There is no problem from our side," Hekmatyar said.    In a radio message conveyed to the foreign office from his  Charasyab base east of Kabul, Hekmatyar said "we can stop  fighting (from late Friday) to enable UN personnel and foreign  nationals to leave Kabul" and evacuate casualties.    Moreover, hundreds of Afghanis are still trapped in their  shattered homes awaiting medical asistance. Many who did leave  were travelling to Kabul's most northerly district, Khairkhana,  which has been free of shelling.    "I don't know where to go but they told me that it is safe  in  Khairkhana," said one man leaving the city, Agha Mohammed. "I  have no relatives there and I have no money to hire even a small  room, but living in the open is better than getting hit by  rockets."    Mengal Hoseyn, the Afghan premier's representative in  Islamabad, said Hekmatyar "responded positively" to the  ceasefire proposal on humanitarian grounds.    Asked if Dostam, whose forces are engaged in the battle,  would also be ready, Hussain said "all forces fighting to oust  Rabbani will be ready" for a temporary ceasefire, "including  Dostam."[passage omitted]</p>

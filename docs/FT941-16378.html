			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Washington casts cloud over UN peacekeeping: Edward Mortimer examines the consequences of diplomatic friction on prospects for peace In a grim report at the weekend, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, voiced grave doubts about the organisation's ability to keep the peace in Somalia after March 31, when US and European troops are due to pull out. His proposal for a residual force of 16,000-20,000 soldiers was based, he said, on what was available, not what was needed. UN peacekeeping may have passed its peak, after a year of passion and recrimination in the long on-again off-again romance between the UN and its most powerful member, the US. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the UN, does not put it in quite these words, but her message in a recent interview with the FT was clear: from now on the US, in its contribution to UN military operations, will specialise in activities where the risk of casualties is low. Other governments are getting that message, and the UN secretariat is wondering how many in future will expose their soldiers to risks the US is not prepared to take. When then-President George Bush addressed the UN General Assembly in September 1992, he spelled out concrete ways in which the US would support Mr Boutros Ghali's Agenda for Peace. For instance, it would train its troops jointly with those of other countries, and incorporate peacekeeping into US manuals of military doctrine. Under President Bill Clinton these promises have yet to be implemented, although Ms Albright insists they will be. 'My sense is, we're getting there,' she says, summarising discussions on the subject with high-ranking US officers. 'Peacekeeping is a growth industry for the military.' If so, it is an industry with acute growing pains. In Bosnia, the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) has been largely powerless to protect the civilian population, let alone halt fighting. The US refused to send troops of its own unless a peace agreement was first accepted by all three warring parties. Instead it advocated helping the Bosnian government with arms deliveries and air strikes. When Nato, under strong US pressure, agreed to threaten air strikes if Serb forces continued the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo, Mr Boutros Ghali said he would expect to be consulted, since air strikes would have to come within the overall context of the UN operation. This, reported as asserting a right of veto, provoked a marked cooling in US-UN relations. Worse was to come. The debacle in Somalia on October 3-4, when 12 US soldiers were killed and the body of one dragged through the streets of Mogadishu in full view of television cameras, confirmed the fears of many Americans that Mr Clinton's 'multilateralism' meant exposing their troops to unjustified risks, for causes unconnected with US national interests. Mr Clinton promptly changed tack on Somalia, announcing the March 31 deadline and giving priority to a political settlement between the Somali factions. He blamed the UN for the previous policy, which was to hunt down the recalcitrant warlord, General Mohammed Farah Aideed. This caused intense resentment at the UN: it was done without consultation, and the hunt for Gen Aideed had been a mainly US enterprise. Then on October 13 the USS Harlan County, which had been due to land a contingent of US troops in Haiti as part of a UN operation to restore deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, pulled out of Haitian territorial waters, deterred by a crowd chanting that they would turn the operation into 'another Somalia'. Ms Albright insists that Somalia 'has no connection with Haiti'. The Haiti operation, she says, was not peacekeeping or peace enforcement: it was a technical training mission. . . They only had side arms, and were dependent totally on going into a non-hostile environment.' Yet UN officials remain bitter about the US's abrupt and unilateral abandonment of a plan which they had put together under intense US pressure. As Ms Albright says: 'It's easy for other people to make judgments about our troops.' What is not easy is for UN headquarters to know whether and when, in the future, it can count on US troops being available. A 'presidential decision directive,' setting out criteria by which the US would decide first whether to vote for new peacekeeping forces and second whether to contribute its own troops, was the subject of prolonged argument within the administration last year, and has still not been published. But already the US has become harder to convince on both counts. The Security Council has become less willing, in Ms Albright's words, to 'throw a peacekeeping operation' at every problem which crops up - as was shown in November when it refused a request for a small peacekeeping force in Burundi. As for US troops, Ms Albright suggests there should, in future, be a 'division of labour,' with each country doing what it is best at. And what the US is best at, it seems, is such things as 'logistical support' or 'lift capability,' rather than frontline peacekeeping duties. Few now imagine that any US troops will be sent to Bosnia, even if a peace plan is agreed. Meanwhile, the administration has promised to ask Congress for a supplemental appropriation of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) to pay off the US's arrears of unpaid peacekeeping dues. (This year's bill is likely to reach Dollars 1.3bn, for which Congress in October voted only Dollars 400m.) The US is assessed for 25 per cent of the UN's regular budget and 31 per cent of the cost of peacekeeping operations. According to Ms Albright, 'fairness dictates that our portion should go down and the amount owed by nations whose economic power has increased dramatically over the past two decades should go up' - a reference to Japan and Germany. The US is also at odds with Mr Boutros Ghali over attempts to reform the UN bureaucracy. Not satisfied with having its own nominee, Ms Melissa Wells, as undersecretary-general in charge of administration, it is now demanding the creation of a new office of inspector general. The secretary-general points out that he has already abolished 30 per cent of top posts in the secretariat, and redeployed hundreds of staff from headquarters into 'the field'. But, he adds drily, 'when member states have difficulty in providing their contributions, they have to invent excuses'. Mr Boutros Ghali is anxious to repair relations with the US, knowing that without the positive backing of its richest and most powerful member state the UN can achieve little. But his irritation boiled over when he heard Ms Albright say, in early November, that 'by the end of this calendar year we expect to pay more than Dollars 1bn in regular budget and peacekeeping assessments'. Such figures are meaningless, he says, unless you set them against the size of the outstanding debt. Ms Albright is equally irritated by his attitude. 'The secretary-general overdoes this,' she says. 'We are the biggest payers. . . We are providing the bulk of everything.' In the wake of November's Nafta vote she is confident Congress will agree to Mr Clinton's request for a supplementary contribition. 'But there is nothing people like less than to be badgered, and Mr Boutros Ghali has a tendency to badger.'</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / The Lex Column: BT AT&amp;T's application for a telephone licence in the UK is pretty clearly a response to BT's similar application in the US a few weeks ago. It seems likely that the next move on this crowded chess board will be an attempt to get government approval for AT&amp;T and BT to lease lines in each other's markets. International calls could then be handled by one company along the entire route, bypassing the current cartel system. In the first instance both AT&amp;T and BT will be interested in operating this for the largest corporate customers, and call rates will fall sharply. But there are wider implications. The UK-US link is already the busiest intercontinental route and it may suck more business out of continental Europe as companies re-route calls to the US via cheaper UK lines. Continental telecoms companies may thus be forced to open up to similar leasing deals to avoid losing call traffic. Such pressure is likely to spread, and the cartel system will slowly crumble. That is a mixed blessing. International calls are highly profitable, so while AT&amp;T will not have to give up profits to other national telecom companies, overall revenues will be under pressure. Large companies will need growing call volumes or increasing market share to benefit. AT&amp;T and BT clearly think they have the muscle to win. Presumably BT's enthusiasm can only be increased by the thought that in the early stages AT&amp;T will go after the same corporate customers which Mercury has tried to make its own.</p>

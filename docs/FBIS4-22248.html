			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Aushev, by Vakhtang Dzhanashiya, </F> under rubric "Ingushetia": "President Aushev: `The Ingush Want  To Have What Is Theirs Returned'"]    [Text] For the second time Hero of the Soviet Union  Ruslan Aushev has been elected president of Ingushetia. What is  his political program?    [Dzhanashiya] Practically speaking, it is not realistic to  talk about Ingushetia without touching upon the question of  Prigorodnyy Rayon...    [Aushev] We have stated in our constitution that the  returning of land that was illegally seized from Ingushetia is  state policy. And we intend to resolve this problem only by  political means.    Yes, today that part of Prigorodnyy Rayon where the Ingush  used to live and from which they were deported is under the  legal jurisdiction of North Ossetia. But I believe that, in the  final analysis, we shall convince even the residents of North  Ossetia themselves that it is impossible to live by taking what  is needed.    And when people say that the Ingush have territorial claims,  that is untrue. The Ingush do not have any territorial claims  against anyone. The Ingush say, "Return to us what was taken  away in 1944."    I feel that the Constitutional Court must say its weighty  word about who is right and who is guilty. At least it can say  whether the Ingush are right or are not right, whether their  demands are just or unjust, and whether the question is being  raised correctly or incorrectly. It is not just a matter of  territory, but also of human rights.    [Dzhanashiya] But let's be realists: the people in the  Russian Ministry of Defense are mostly interested in allowing  North Ossetia to keep Prigorodnyy Rayon. The strategic Military  Georgian Road runs through part of Prigorodnyy Rayon.    [Aushev] Then let them declare that the Military Georgian  Road, by virtue of its strategic importance, is federal  property. We do not reject that!    [Dzhanashiya] Refugees are a serious destabilizing factor.  With increasing frequency we hear voices saying that the  republic leadership is incapable of resolving the problems of  the Ingush nation...    [Aushev] The reason why the conflict arose was to drag out  the resolution of the territorial problem. And to "hang onto" it  the problems of the refugees, the restoration of housing, the  people who have vanished without a trace, etc., etc. The tasks  were clearly formulated when the provocation was being prepared.    [Dzhanashiya] You mentioned provocation... Who had an  interest in that?    [Aushev] (Laughter.) As they say in political language,  "definite political forces."... In Moscow the opinion has  developed that Prigorodnyy Rayon must be given back to the  Ingush. In Vladikavkaz, people understood that this must somehow  be disrupted. Two circumstances came together: Ossetia has to  understand the Ingush, and the center has to understand  Chechnya. It was hoped in the center that Chechnya would go to  the assistance of the Ingush. And, consequently, the Chechen  side could be accused of aggression and the "Chechen question"  could be resolved by military means. However, Dzhokhar Dudayev  make an official declaration of neutrality.    [Dzhanashiya] The economic situation in the republic is  catastrophic. Unemployment is fantastic...    [Aushev] Yes, 56 percent of the able-bodied population are  unemployed. Ingushetia has been fighting for survival during its  entire history. So people have learned how to feed their family  without governmental assistance. A year and a half after the  formation of the Chechen Republic, everyone has forgotten about  Ingushetia -- but we have survived.    Currently the question of creating an economically favorable  zone is being decided. Reform of agriculture has been begun. The  land is rich and has high harvest yields. We have our own  petroleum, and it is sufficient for us. It is necessary to  engage in the development of the petroleum complex. To create  small and medium-sized enterprises on the basis of the latest  technologies. Small repair and processing shops, etc. Does  anyone think that we will not feed 300,000 people? Of course  we'll feed them!    And we must keep on learning and learning. And use force to  make anyone learn if he does not want to. We must send our young  people absolutely everywhere -- to whatever countries,  republics, regions -- just so that they can learn. To turn the  republic into a republic.    [Dzhanashiya] The traditional teyp (kinship clan)  structure of society is preserved in Ingushetia. How do you view  the reformation of that structure?    [Aushev] I feel that in the teyps there is much  that is good. Many people are disciplined by the fact that it is  necessary to answer to their own and other teyps.  Life itself will change the teyp system of Ingush  society. Today many traditions are being broken. When a person  becomes a private property owner, he will not need either a  teyp or anything else.    [Dzhanashiya] The Aushev teyp is a respected one,  but not one of the traditionally first ones. Doesn't there arise  a disbalance between your present position and the vanities of  certain leaders of the traditionally strong teyps?    [Aushev] Absolutely not. I have taken a stand above all  teyps, above all my relatives: the president must be  neutral. They themselves say, "You're not an Aushev. You're the  president of Ingushetia." And I agree with that.    [Dzhanashiya] The Ingush used to have one seat in the State  Duma. In the election you supported Aleksandra Momdzhyan, an  outsider and the wife of your friend General Ochirov...    [Aushev] We based our decision on the fact that the Duma is  elected for a two-year period. In this kind of situation there  is no time to wait for someone to learn how to operate, to wait  until a candidate becomes a deputy. Work of creating legislation  is difficult and requires certain skills. Aleksandra is a  well-known specialist and a doctor of sciences. As for her  nationality, what difference does it make? I am happy that the  Ingush have once again demonstrated their internationalism.

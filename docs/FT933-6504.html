			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Hoover wins Pounds 1m Scottish sweetener GLASGOW Development Agency confirmed yesterday that it had made a contractual agreement worth around Pounds 1m with Hoover for the transfer of its manufacturing output from Dijon in France to Cambuslang, near Glasgow, creating a further 400 jobs at the plant, Robert Taylor writes. Last winter's announcement of the move to Cambuslang provoked accusations in France that the move was in conflict with European Community regulations. The matter is under investigation by the European Commission. Mr Lew Scott, Hoover's vice-president of manufacturing, said yesterday the agreement had been 'one of a number of key factors in giving our parent company the confidence to commit itself to the consolidation of production at Cambuslang'. Hoover has agreed to maintain the expanded level of employment at the plant. It will repay in full or in part the financial support from the agency if employment falls below an undisclosed figure over the next five to 10 years. The agency, a joint private-sector and public-sector enterprise, said its aim had been to secure the existing total of nearly 1,000 jobs at the plant and ensure Cambuslang could provide 'production facilities of sufficient quality to support the company's longer-term competitive position'.</p>

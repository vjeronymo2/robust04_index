			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], stressed the illegitimacy of A'li  'Abdallah Salih as chairman of the Presidential Council, the  illegitimacy of [words indistinct] in the Presidential Council,  the illegitimacy of the speaker of the House of Representatives,  and the illegitimacy of the Yemeni Reform Alliance group in the  House of Representatives.    At a news conference in Aden yesterday evening, attended by  representatives of local, Arab, and international press, brother  'Ali Salim al-Bid explained that legitimacy and constitution  complement each other. He said that the constitution specifies  that the Presidential Council will consist of five elected  members; the five members of the Council should then elect their  chairman after they have taken the constitutional oath.  However, that did not happen because al-Bid has not yet taken  the oath. Therefore, the chairman has been illegally appointed  and has not been elected by a complete council as the  constitution specifies.    As for 'Abd al-Majid al-Zandani, his membership of the  Presidential council is illegitimate because he took an oath  contradictory to the oath specified by the Constitution. The  same applies to the speaker of the House of Representatives and  those members of the Yemeni Reform Alliance parliamentary group,  who took an oath contradictory to the one specified by the  Constitution.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid condemned the declaration of the  state of emergency by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, whom he described as  a dictator. Brother al-Bid pointed out that the Constitution  specifies that a state of emergency may only be declared  following a resolution by the National Defense Council, which  met only once three years ago.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid added that all the resolutions  adopted by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are illegal because they were  issued in the name of an illegitimate chairman. He said:  Legitimacy today is the legitimacy of national unanimity,  represented by the document of pledge and accord, and we take  our legitimacy from our people, national unanimity, and the  higher interests of the homeland and their balance in society.    He explained that there are many details which could be  specified to emphasize the illegitimacy of many of the existing  institutions. He said: We will soon present [word indistinct]  our opinion of the legitimacy.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We are approaching the 21st  century, but there are those who refuse to recognize human  rights, who try to limit civilian life, and who work toward  consecrating armament, and pulling us back to the middle ages.  That is why these people have rejected the course of the  document of pledge and accord and have imposed this war on us,  by which they direct strikes and stab at Yemen, its unity,  people, and national [word indistinct].    In his replies to questions from the correspondents about  the  military situation, brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid stressed that 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and the forces of the Al al-Ahmar gang are  deployed along the past division lines in order to renew the  secession. He also emphasized that the al-Amaliqah units  stationed in Abyan did not enter it during the war but were  stationed in that governorate for four years, where they have  their own camps. On the other hand, our units deployed in the  Northern governorates were placed either in the same camps or  neighboring ones. These camps were hit and destroyed.    He pointed out: When we approached unity we did not think of  the military tactics of attacking it. We entered the union  peacefully. Our aim is to construct our state in a peaceful and  democratic way. We believed that the democratic forces and  civilian life would influence and contain these military forces.  However, in the end the military forces have disregarded  everything, usurped freedom, opened detention camps, killed  women and children, militarized the country, and spread terror  and terrorism everywhere. This is the proof of their aggressive  spirit and the inherited mentality of invasion in order to  spread hegemony and [word indistinct].    The brother secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party  reiterated that the aggressive way chosen by the dictator 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and his gang will not succeed. He pointed out  that a new situation has been created among our people, and that  many units led by the Al al-Ahmar gang have been forced to fight  their brothers, shell the cities and villages, and to kill and  shed the blood of the innocent. Therefore, they are working  toward severing the ties of fraternity, friendship, and unity  among the sons of the Yemeni people, and they are destroying the  union with their actions, which stem from a mentality of  invasion, occupation and looting.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We have exhausted all the  means of [words indistinct] and accepted all solutions, but  unfortunately we are today forced to defend ourselves in a war  which is imposed on us. We consider ourselves (?bound) by the  document of pledge and accord [words indistinct] this document.    He stressed: We stand by all the honorable patriots and all  the good-intentioned forces in order to build a democratic  Yemen, as a country on whose basis we agreed unanimously in the  document of pledge and accord.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on all the soldiers and  officers, whom the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih throws in the  fire of death, to resort to reason and patriotism and to abandon  that unpatriotic and inhuman course.    He emphasized loudly: Rest assured that Aden will be  impregnable to the invaders.</p>

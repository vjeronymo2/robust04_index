			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: US must plug the sinking ship Sir, The US and its perennial budget deficits can be likened to an overloaded ship with a hole in the bottom. President Clinton's tax increase amounts to starting up another bilge pump, but his temporary stimulus means it is running backwards and pumping more water into the ship. Unfortunately, his spending cuts only reduce the hole from 500 cm to 300 cm. This isn't going to save the ship. For those who look hopefully to the small pick-up in the economy, I would point out that even a sinking ship occasionally rides a wave; however, it frequently founders in the next trough. We, the people, must insist on fixing the hole permanently with the balanced budget amendment and the line item veto. There is no time to lose; the foreign crew who have been fueling the pumps with their loans may take to the lifeboats. Erik N Dunleavy, 141 Centre Island Road, Oyster Bay, NY 11771 US</p>

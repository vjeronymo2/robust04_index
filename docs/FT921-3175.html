			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (11): Welcome boost for private enterprise  -Ecobank sponsors venture capital fund targeted at medium-size business FOSTERING private enterprise is one area of African economic endeavour where there has long been more talk than action. That is why plans to set up a west African venture capital fund targeted at medium-size business have been welcomed by entrepreneurs and governments. The proposal is the more welcome because it is unashamedly profit-motivated, and envisages a close link between equity investment and managerial advice and assistance provided by an independent management company. The fund, Ecoventures, sponsored by Ecobank, which operates in five West African countries, plans to invest in, manage and then divest high-growth, medium-scale indigenous businesses. Later this year, the sponsors hope to raise Dollars 20m, the bulk of it from institutions and high net-worth individuals in the five target countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo. The target is to raise Dollars 5m from donors or investment companies such as the Commonwealth Development Corporation, Dollars 10m from African institutional investors (pension funds, insurance companies and multinationals) and the remainder from rich people. Regional diversity is important, with the sponsors anxious to avoid accusations of Nigerian domination from neighbouring states which are hypersensitive on this issue. Ecoventures will invest in a range of high-growth - and high-risk - activities with assets of up to Dollars 1m. The trick is to catch a business near the start of its growth curve and achieve above-average returns. Such projects are easier to find than is often suggested: some successful African businesses show internal rates of return of 50 to 120 per cent - adequate to compensate for the likely combination of high inflation and currency depreciation. The key to such funds is the exit process. Ecoventures sees two main exit routes - the sale of its equity through the stock market or to individual shareholders in the fund who may wish to retain their shares in a thriving business. It envisages a 12-year closed fund with a three-tranche subscription timetable in years one, three and five. The management services element will be provided by a small group of young, aggressive entrepreneurial professionals whose task will be to ensure that if management of the companies in which the fund takes a minority stake does not measure up, it is strengthened or replaced. The project makes sense all round - capital gains for the investors, improved management skills and profits for the target firms, greater tax revenue, more jobs and increased exports for the government. A second venture capital project - Risk Fund - is being sponsored by the government-controlled Raw Materials Research and Development Council. It hopes to raise Dollars 30m, mainly from the private sector (60 per cent) to fund high-risk, high-return industrial projects. Already, several banks have promised to join the scheme, along with a clutch of prominent global companies - Mobil, Glaxo, Unilever, Volkswagen, Nestle, Guinness, Cadbury and Dunlop. The promoters hope to attract support from foreign institutional investors, including agencies such as the International Finance Corporation. Unlike Ecoventures, the Risk Fund will be targeted solely at Nigeria. The government supports the scheme and has promised to promulgate a Venture Capital Decree soon which will sweep away many of the obstacles currently clogging capital market wheels, including one that bans insurance companies from participating.</p>

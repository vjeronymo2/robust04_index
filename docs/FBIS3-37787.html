			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin </F> by Sergio Sergi in Moscow; date not given: "`It is a Mistake To  Put Russia Out of the Game'"]    [Text] Moscow -- [Sergi] How was a turning point on Bosnia  possible? How did you construct this diplomatic success?    [Adamishin] We had been moving toward this goal for almost a  year and a half. At that time, we had already made a proposal  at the UN General Assembly to demilitarize Sarajevo and place it  under UN protection. We worked with all the sides but certainly  used the leverage that we have had on the Serbs. I believe that  it is difficult for anyone else to have more influence than us  in this field. It was not that we were defending their position  to the bitter end or that we were manifesting our pan-Slavism.  The Serbs were aware of the fact that we supported a balanced  political settlement.    [Sergi] Therefore they took you seriously.    [Adamishin] Now they believe in us. For this reason, when  Yeltsin made a proposal for the unilateral withdrawal of their  heavy weapons from the hills around Sarajevo, they said yes. It  was the culmination of our efforts as well as a clear  manifestation that political methods prevail over the use of  force when settling conflicts.    [Sergi] This was a point of major dispute between Russia and  the foreign governments.    [Adamishin] Yes. You see, we share more or less the same  view as our partners on "what" must be done. However, the  positions diverge on "how" it must be done. We have always been  supporters of political methods over the use of force except for  very specific, restricted cases regulated by the United Nations.  For this reason we did not like the NATO ultimatum which, to  tell the truth, shuffled the cards. The talks had already begun  and the ultimatum made the Muslims become more uncompromising.  The situation became difficult, there was no way out. Russia  brought its own influence into play to find a way out. If  things go well, if the other side now does what the Serbs have  done, we will truly be able to speak of an opening in the  Bosnian situation. After Sarajevo, the accord can be further  extended.    [Sergi] What guarantees do you have that the Serb side will  not have second thoughts?    [Adamishin] The guarantees are those of the Bosnian Serbs'  elective assembly. The decision was not made by one man alone.  I do not see any reason why they should break their promise.  The weapons have been withdrawn.    [Sergi] Your envoy, Churkin, has said that if the Serbs were  to change their mind, even Russia will change its position. Is  this so?    [Adamishin] I do not want to consider hypothetical  situations. And then I would not want to contradict Churkin who  has done very well.    [Sergi] We have also been forced to note some rigidity over  the past few hours. Yeltsin has given a warning, Churkin has  again pointed his finger against the ultimatum. Strong notes...    [Adamishin] I have not noticed these strong notes. In my  opinion the NATO ultimatum could be judged even more severely.    [Sergi] So you are still using soft notes?    [Adamishin] For me they are. You see, the NATO ultimatum  took over from the United Nations to put us out of the game. Or  rather, thinking that we would be placed out of the game. I  repeat: the ultimatum upset negotiations. I have already said  that the Muslims immediately became more inflexible. The  ultimatum is a mistake. It was made on the wave of public  indignation over the Sarajevo market massacre. I fully share  this indignation, but taking decisions of such an importance  with consequences that are difficult to calculate on the basis  of emotions is a little too much.    [Sergi] There are reports that the massacre was the work of  Muslim formations. What do you say?    [Adamishin] If the Serbs had been guilty, it would have been  made known immediately. If there had been certain evidence, it  would have been made known. We also have some information in  our possession that would point to strangers not from the area  as being guilty.    [Sergi] Strangers in which sense?    [Adamishin] I am referring to people that arrived in Bosnia  from outside...    [Sergi] From where?    [Adamishin] What do you mean from where? It is a known  fact that there are various kinds of mujahedin on the Muslim  side. This is what I mean when I refer to people that came from  outside.    [Sergi] Do you mean that you actually know about this.    [Adamishin] I would not want to swear to the leaks. But they  do exist.    [Sergi] Do you have some clue if not certain evidence?    [Adamishin] We can judge on the basis of what the others  say.  We are distant from these places. The results of the  investigations to date tell us that it is not known where the  grenade came from. Officially I must keep to these versions.  However I have read -- and these are leaks from Western sources  -- about the involvement of forces that are not connected with  the parties in question.    [Sergi] It has also been said that with your initiative you  have done a favor to the West, which could not wait to get  itself out of difficulty after the threat to bomb. Is this so?    [Adamishin] First and foremost, we did something entirely in  favor of Sarajevo. If, along the way, we also did a small favor  to the West it would not be a bad thing either.    [Sergi] Could there have been a secret accord between  Yeltsin  and Clinton? The United States could have reasoned this way:  If Russia convinces the Serbs to withdraw we will publicly  recognize your diplomatic success...    [Adamishin] You do not have a very good opinion of us. You  think that we would act upon the suggestions of others. Russia  has carried out an independent role, its own role, over the past  months. We would like to see it concerted with the positions of  the others, but it is the others that sometimes push us out.    [Sergi] What will the next move be?    [Adamishin] In my opinion it should be an attempt to go  beyond the Sarajevo accord. That is, the search for a global  solution to the conflict. We are close enough to the result.    [Sergi] Churkin has returned to the area of conflict. Why?    [Adamishin] He is going to Croatia where our battalion is.  To stay there. To avoid any incitement or wrong moves. He  will be in Sarajevo on his birthday.    [Sergi] If there was no secret accord with the White House,  are we therefore witnessing the onset of a new rivalry between  Russia and the United States?    [Adamishin] I would not want to light the fire on  diversities. Certainly, as I have already said, we did not like  the NATO ultimatum also because of the fact that it excluded  Russia from the decisionmaking room. And all this while the  positions on the crux of the problem were quite close. We do  not agree that NATO should decide on these matters. If it is a  matter of using force in international relations the Security  Council must give the authorization.    [Sergi] The partnership is not in danger then?    [Adamishin] We want a partnership with the United States and  NATO. But it should be seen as being a two-way street. We do  not like this partnership if decisions are made without  consulting Russia.</p>

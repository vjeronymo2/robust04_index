			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (24): A nettle to grasp - The domestic price of petrol THE PRICE paid by Nigerians for petrol at the pump is perhaps the most important indicator of the transitional council's ability to force through necessary but politically unpopular reforms. Fuel prices are absurdly low. Nigerian petrol prices are equivalent to Dollars 6.2 per barrel, compared with an OECD average of Dollars 114.1 and an OPEC country average of Dollars 27. Drivers in Lagos can fill their tanks for N0.7 (3 US cents) a litre. Motorists in the north, however, regularly pay high prices from black market vendors because pumps have run dry. The reason is that speculators buy fuel to smuggle to neighbouring countries for huge profit. With comparative pump prices per litre of N9.72 in Benin, N10.93 in Cameroon, N14.61 in Niger and N16.11 in Chad, it is a lucrative business. While cheap domestic fuel is filling the pockets of smugglers, it is also leaving a gaping hole in Nigeria's federal budget. The gap has grown in recent years as petrol prices have failed to keep pace with inflation. The pump price has increased by 77 per cent between 1987 and 1992 but, in real terms, this amounted to an 85 per cent decline. According to an internal report from state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), the government allocates 300,000 barrels a day of crude for domestic processing at a cost of N20 a barrel. At less than Dollars 1 at current exchange rates, this is far below the Dollars 6.5 a barrel that NNPC needs to cover the technical costs of production. It also compares with an international price of nearly Dollars 20 a barrel, representing an annual loss to the government of N41bn. The lost revenue would cover nine-tenths of last year's budget deficit. This is not the only loss to the state. The total cost to NNPC of processing, refining and transporting crude is N21.3bn. NNPC, however, receives only N4.7bn at the regulated supply price, while the margins of downstream retailers are depressed. The result, according to the NNPC report, is that: 'The entire downstream petroleum industry is well advanced in a process of decapitalisation and decay as participants suffer a whopping deficit of N59.41bn a year, equivalent to Dollars 27.1 per barrel.' NNPC estimates that to eliminate the N59.4bn revenue shortfall would require a rise in domestic petrol prices to N9.9 per litre, an increase of more than 1,300 per cent. World Bank officials believe that an increase to about N5 per litre would eliminate much of the distortion. The government recently raised the price of airline fuel by 400 per cent to N5.5 (22 cents) a litre, limiting the increase in domestic air fares to 200 per cent. But the nettle yet to be grasped is the raising of petrol prices. The transitional council has set up an independent monitoring body to help ensure that extra revenue would be properly spent and not find its way into the pockets of government officials. It may prove difficult, though, to convince a sceptical Nigerian public.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / News Corp raises payout on 84.5% increase NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media group, reported yesterday a surge in profits with almost all its divisions, notably newspapers worldwide and US television, contributing to the revival of the company. In the UK, BSkyB made its first profit and newspapers such as the Sun and The Sunday Times benefited from cost cutting while advertising and circulation revenues remained flat. Group net profits for the year ended June soared 84.5 per cent to ADollars 978.9m (Pounds 439m) from ADollars 530.5m a year earlier as revenue rose 4.9 per cent to ADollars 10.69bn. The annual dividend is going up from 2.5 cents to 3 cents a share. The two biggest components of the improvement were: a turnround from a ADollars 56.8m loss to a ADollars 177.3m profit from associate companies, including BSkyB satellite television operation in the UK and the Ansett airline business in Australia; and a reduction from ADollars 931.7m to ADollars 737.1m in net interest expense following the equity issues and debt restructuring which have returned the group to financial health. The company excluded an ADollars 114.6m abnormal loss from the result (ADollars 29m loss previously), mainly reflecting unrealised exchange losses in the Ansett group. News Corp's operating income in the UK rose from ADollars 381.8m to ADollars 401.9m, as operating profits from UK newspapers increased 9 per cent. The company said advertising and circulation revenue had remained flat and the result came mainly from operating efficiencies and plant modernisation. 'Operating profits at the Sun, News of the World, and The Sunday Times all showed significant gains,' said directors. The company said its 50 per cent stake in BSkyB contributed Pounds 26.7m to profits, compared with a Pounds 13.3m loss. Revenues grew more than 60 per cent as the number of subscribers to films and sport grew. Operating revenue from the US rose from ADollars 880m to ADollars 964.3m as Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television turned in record profits. Directors said profits rose 6 per cent in the magazine and inserts business while HarperCollins books made flat profits. Operating earnings from Australia and the Pacific Basin rose from ADollars 328.9m to ADollars 336.1m. Lex, Page 16 News International results, Page 18 John Fairfax results, Page 22</p>

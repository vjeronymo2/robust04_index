			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST-MINUTE AMNESTY BIDS MUST BE MADE IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> In an effort to cut down on long lines at legalization offices throughout the  region, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said Friday  that they will require last-minute amnesty candidates from a seven-county area  to make their applications at the INS' Hollywood office.  </P> <P> Staff shortages at 10 legalization offices serving the INS' Los Angeles  District meant that undocumented aliens hoping for a last chance to qualify for  amnesty under the 1986 Immigration and Reform Act were being turned away at  many sites.  </P> <P> Aliens were camping out overnight at some offices, and violence broke out at  the Santa Ana office.  </P> <P> Problems had been reported at other INS offices throughout the Southwest, but  lines were longest in the Los Angeles District, officials said. By dedicating  the Hollywood office entirely to the late applications, officials said, they  hope to relieve the other offices.  </P> <P> "People are not going to be sleeping in parking lots in this region or anywhere  else in the country," said Ben Davidian, INS Western regional commissioner.  </P> <P> Davidian said that when INS Commissioner Gene McNary in Washington was told  about the long lines at some offices, he ordered local officials to come up  with an alternative.  </P> <P> Immigrant rights advocates criticized the solution.  </P> <P> Susan Alva, an attorney with the Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, said: "We  understand there has to be some sort of system. But the idea they came up with  totally misses the boat. It appears totally intended to alleviate their  black-eye image, to take the lines off the street. To have that one office deal  with a seven-county district is ludicrous. It's going to require people to  travel from Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange County to this one office.  It's insane."  </P></p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Registered interest in BT sale disappoints THE NUMBER of registrations in the sale of the government's remaining holding in British Telecommunications remains well below the number in the last sale of BT shares. The Treasury yesterday announced that after 600,000 new registrations in the last week the total number had risen to 5.2m, compared with 5.25m in 1991. However, 2.4m individuals, being qualifying BT shareholders and eligible BT employees, were automatically registered compared with 1.1m last time. 'After excluding those automatically registered the figures are really quite disappointing,' said one telecommunications analyst. Of those registering, 2m chose to go through one of the share shops with 1.4m registering with the Share Information Office. Applications through most share shops close July 12 and the public offer in the UK closes July 14. Trading in the new shares starts July 19. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said he believed the result showed that BT3 was on course for success. Those applying through share shops will get a greater allocation of shares than applicants through the information office, if there is a big demand. UK private investors will receive discounts of 10p on all three instalments. The overall price, which will determine the sum payable in the third instalment, is to be determined by the bids for shares made by the institutions after the book building exercise gets under way tomorrow.</p>

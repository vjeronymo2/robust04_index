			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Lib Dems launch recruitment drive THE LIBERAL Democrats are to embark on a membership drive in an effort to capitalise on this month's election successes. The party is aiming to attract an extra 10,000 members, equivalent to lifting membership by about 10 per cent. The meeting agreed to pursue a 'twin track' approach in the aftermath of the elections, with the party continuing to emphasise its independence while pursuing co-operation with other parties on matters of common interest, particularly at the local level.</p>

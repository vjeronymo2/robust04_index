			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a speech by Lu Ping, director of the PRC's Hong </F> Kong and Macao Affairs Office, at a luncheon held in his honor  sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the  Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong  Kong Industries, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce,  at the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel on 6 May]    [Text] In the spring of 1979, when the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office under the State Council of China was just a  "new-born baby", Deng Xiaoping met in Beijing with Lord  MacLehose, the then Governor of Hong Kong. Mr. Deng told him in  earnest that:    "Hong Kong is going to be handled by us as a special region  and a special question. By 1997, no matter how the question of  Hong Kong is being resolved, its special status will be  guaranteed.    "That is to say, in a considerably long period of time  between this century and early next century, Hong Kong may  practise capitalism while we practise socialism. Therefore,  investors around the world should have nothing to worry about."    Then, in 1984, when Mr. Deng met with the then British  Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr. Deng stressed to Sir  Geoffrey Howe that:    "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be maintained  without a guarantee on its continued capitalist system," and, "I  am confident that the principle of `one country, two systems' is  workable."    Mr. Deng's remarks were by no means casual. What he said was  the conclusion drawn after considerable investigations and  studies.    Before the negotiation between China and Britain on the  question of Hong Kong started, Mr. Deng held talks with people  from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong many times to make  field studies.    A special team was set up to look into this question. I was  then a member of this team. The team first analysed the factors  leading to the economic success in Hong Kong and the conditions  under which they were formed. Then, the team studied whether  these factors could continue after 1997. The answer was  positive.    A twelve-point policy was formulated. This policy was laid  down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and later in the  Basic Law, and they are the basic policies of the Chinese  Government regarding Hong Kong.    I want to emphasise that these basic policies are not the  result of the Sino-British talks. They were, as a matter of  fact, laid on the negotiating table by the Chinese Government  right from the beginning.  <H5>  The Reason </H5>   Now, let me talk about why China decided to adopt the  principle of `one country, two systems' to settle the question  of Hong Kong:    -- First, it is the best and the only solution for  maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. To look  for a solution, we took into consideration the historical factor  as well as the current status quo of Hong Kong. The solution  will not only have to be acceptable to China, but also to Hong  Kong and to the British side as well. There should be as little  changes and disturbances as possible in 1997.    -- Second it is good for the country as a whole. For the  modernisations to succeed, we need a bridge to carry us to the  Western world, and for the Western world to come to the China  market. Hong Kong has been playing this role all along, and  China wants it to continue to do so by retaining its  capitalistic characteristic. We believe that a socialist  mainland and a capitalist Hong Kong can co-exist in harmony in  such a way that they can supplement each other instead of  confronting each other.    The mainland can contribute to Hong Kong its huge market,  abundant human resources and ample supply of raw materials.  Hong Kong can contribute to the mainland its advanced  technology and management skills, its wide contacts with the  Western world as well as its strong financial market.    Cities like Shanghai can never take the place of Hong Kong  because no matter how developed Shanghai becomes, it will remain  socialist. Shanghai will serve the country as a socialist  metropolis, while Hong Kong will play a different role in its  capacity as a capitalist special administrative region.    -- Third, it is a big move in the course of reunification of  China because by offering Hong Kong as a blue print to the  settlement of the questions of Macao and Taiwan, China sets an  example to the world that it can settle disputes in a peaceful  way through mutual accommodation.    Therefore, the 'one country, two systems' principle is by no  means a transient or an offhand policy, nor is it a manoeuvre.  It is truly China's long term policy.  <H5>  No Change </H5>   Some may worry that someday China's policy might change. My  answer is: "No matter what happens, the principle of `one  country, two systems' will not change for at least 50 years,  because it is a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good  for the country and good for the rest of the world. It is also  acceptable to all. [no closing quotation marks as published]    Why would China want to change it? It is the responsibility  of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that the  principle of 'one country, two systems' as well as all the basic  policies laid down in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law  are being fully carried out.    The principle of `one country, two systems' is embodied in  all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the  National People's Congress and has become a national law. It  has to be observed not only by Hong Kong but also by the rest of  China for matters relative to Hong Kong.    It took four years and eight months to work out the Basic  Law. As the Chinese saying goes: "One word is worth a thousand  pieces of gold." The Basic Law is worth much more than that.    If we are not serious in carrying out the principle of `one  country, two systems', why on earth should we waste such a lot  of time, money and energy to put it into law? I wish to repeat  that the principle of `one country, two systems' is guaranteed  by law.    I foresee that the principle of `one country, two systems'  will not change not only within 50 years, but much longer. The  obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage of  socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a  strong socialist state.    In this whole course of building socialism Hong Kong will  continue to play its important role as a bridge between China  and the Western world.  <H5>  Two Aspects </H5>   Of course, by `one country, two systems' we mean that the  main body of the country practises socialism, which is the  fundamental system of China, while as a supplement to the  socialist state, Hong Kong continues to practise capitalism.    Therefore, when we say there will be no change in the  principle of `one country, two systems', there are actually two  aspects: The capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain  unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the country  will also not change, otherwise it will be one country, one  system', instead of 'one country, two systems'.    There are some who believe that only when China turns  capitalist that Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This  is an entirely wrong concept.    I want to ask, if in case (which is an impossible  supposition) China turns capitalist as some people wishfully  think, where will Hong Kong stand? Can Hong Kong continue to  play its role as a bridge, which contributes as a major factor  to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability?    Chinese leaders are determined to build a strong socialist  China. Any movement or action to change this direction may cause  chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy.    Hence, any foreign government or Hong Kong people trying to  exert pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed.  China would not want itself to be rampant with chaos.    Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a  turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution,  which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai  to some extent, could still exercise some control over the "Red  Guards". Back in 1967, it was premier Zhou Enlai who at the very  last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" sending troops to Hong  Kong.    Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and  stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict  self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong? It has  been, and still is, the People's Liberation Army, under the  strict orders of the Central Government, who have been guarding  the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the stability in Hong Kong.    Therefore, in order to maintain the prosperity and stability  of Hong Kong, it is of vital importance to maintain the  stability of China, without which, the principle of 'one  country, two systems' will be built on sand.  <H5>  Value of Hong Kong </H5>   I would like to stress that the value of Hong Kong to China  has been and will be its economic value. Hong Kong has always  been an economic city, never a political city. If you ask  anyone in the street, what he or she is most concerned with, I  bet over 90 percent will say, it's their livelihood.    It is precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value  that China formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong. Of  course there are always a handful who are so naive to think that  they can turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to  influence the mainland in the sense of politics. If that were  the case, Hong Kong would be of negative value instead of  positive value to China. This is disastrous for Hong Kong.  <H5>  Hong Kong People Rule Hong Kong </H5>   In order to put the principle of `one country, two systems'  into practice, we have to adopt the policy of letting Hong Kong  people rule Hong Kong and allowing Hong Kong enjoy a high degree  of autonomy. To preserve the capitalist system in Hong Kong, we  need Hong Kong people who are familiar with the capitalist  operations to manage themselves.    As stipulated in the Basic Law, after 1997, Hong Kong will  enjoy its own administrative, legislative and judicial powers.  All daily affairs, except those concerning foreign affairs and  national defence, will be managed by Hong Kong itself. We have  been repeatedly told by our leaders that Hong Kong shall not be  dealt with as we did with Shanghai.    No department or province will be allowed to interfere in  the  internal affairs of the Hong Kong SAR, and this should be made  known to everybody, starting from now. Therefore, in promoting  the Basic Law, we should not only promote it in Hong Kong, in  overseas countries, but also within China.    In future, any department when dealing with Hong Kong, must  abide by the Basic Law, and it is the responsibility of the Hong  Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that everything is done in  this manner.    To take the airport question as an example, it is because  the  SAR government still does not exist that China is at present  negotiating with the British side for the benefit of the future  SAR. If it were after 1997 such an affair would be an internal  affair of the SAR, and it would be entirely up to you to decide  what you want.    The reason why we set up the Preliminary Working Committee  is  mainly to provide an opportunity for Hong Kong people to  participate in the preparation of the SAR, to provide a solid  foundation, an optimum starting point for the SAR government, so  that when the time of July 1, 1997, comes, what Hong Kong people  have will continue to be an economically prosperous, financially  sound, socially secured Hong Kong, with everything in order and  well-prepared.    This is a tremendous task, but I and my colleagues all  regard  it as an honoured task endowed upon us by the 1.1 billion  people. That is why I always said to my colleagues we should be  fully dedicated and consecrated to the success of this lofty  cause.    Before concluding, I would like to reiterate that it is my  responsibility to see that the principle of `one country, two  systems' being put into practice, that the Basic Law is fully  carried out; that Hong Kong will continue to prosper, that Hong  Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, that `Hong Kong  People rule Hong Kong' all will be strictly observed.    People will continue to enjoy their present way of life; and  that all of you present here today will be given the chance to  further Fat Choy [make money].</p>

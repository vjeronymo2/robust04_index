			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Technology: Expertise on the take-away menu / Describing how companies can benefit from buying R&amp;D services off the shelf Research and development may be different from cleaning lavatories or guarding factories, but like these support operations there is a thriving contract industry. In tune with the government's renewed emphasis on innovation, contract research organisations (CROs) believe they can play an increasing role in the transfer of technology to British industry. The work of the CROs covers the same range of activities provided by an in-house R&amp;D service. Contractors can conduct strategic research that companies need for their next generation of products or services. They can develop new products, and they can carry out routine testing. Some CROs carry out strategic research on a 'club' basis, with several companies coming together to support projects of mutual benefit. For example, manufacturers placed contracts with the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA) for research into generic problems associated with meeting controls on noise emitted by vehicles. A research club can also unite companies that are part of a supply chain. Geoff Callow, research manager at MIRA, cites vehicle handling as an area in which no single supplier can solve the problems. Indeed, a company working in isolation could come up with technology that causes headaches elsewhere. MIRA can communicate with anybody in the supply chain. Callow says that just 10 per cent of the organisation's activity is what he would recognise as research. The other 90 per cent is testing and development work, something that is especially relevant to small companies. The sophisticated instruments needed to make detailed measurements are often beyond their means. By spreading the cost over a large number of customers, CROs can assemble impressive arrays of instruments. The Leatherhead Food Research Association, for example, recently invested Pounds 75,000 in a laser microscope. The RA's researchers used the microscope to look at the structure of delicate samples that would suffer under the treatment meted out by other microscopy techniques. The laser microscope can show the structure of low-fat spreads and bakery products, specimens that are easily damaged when put under an ordinary microscope. CROs can also bring expertise and measuring equipment to large companies. The Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research Institute (AMTRI) has an impressive background in machine tools. In the course of its work over the years, the institute's researchers have developed a considerable understanding of why machines vibrate, for example. Much of its work involved testing prototype machines for companies to detect design faults that might affect product quality when the equipment reached customers. 'We have portable people and technology that we can take to a site and make measurements with instruments that clients do not have,' says Neil Parkin, marketing manager of AMTRI. There is nothing unusual about the technology used to measure vibration, says Parkin, 'but we can trundle it around'. Holroyd, a maker of machine tools, is one of AMTRI's customers. 'We brought AMTRI in to measure our machines and tell us what had gone wrong in them,' says John Owen, engineering director. When Holroyd wanted to design computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools it did not have the ability in house to develop the CNC part of the machine tool, the software and electronic microprocessors that control the machinery. AMTRI designed the CNC system while the company's engineers produced the mechanical designs. Holroyd gained considerable experience working with AMTRI. This proved invaluable when the company wanted to develop its own CNC technology. When moving into new areas, says Owen, it is better to start off small and to expand the in-house facility gradually. Contract research can be especially valuable when a company has to respond to immediate problems. From time to time the food industry has scares about contaminated food. This can mean overnight work for researchers at the Leatherhead Food RA. As Mark Kierstan, director, puts it: 'If someone claims to have contaminated your products, how do you test for it?' Similarly, if glass turns up in jars of food, did it come from a thermometer, a broken jar, or was it inserted after the food left the factory? 'Few firms have their own electron microscopist who can answer such questions,' says Kierstan. Nearer to the frontiers of science, Kierstan believes that CROs offer companies greater flexibility to change course or to close research projects. If a company wants to investigate a new area of science - biotechnology, for instance - it takes time to set up a research department. 'You will be two years down the road before you have done one day's work,' says Kierstan. 'You may not be able to buy the best biotechnologist, but there is nothing to stop you from renting one for a few days.' A company that buys time from a research organisation wants to guarantee that the results of the research it pays for do not end up in the hands of its competitors. All contract research organisations, and increasingly university groups that do contract research, go out of their way to maintain confidentiality, so much so that some CROs will not talk about their work. Walk around the corridors of the Leatherhead Food RA, for example, and signs on the doors mark out those laboratories where researchers are dealing with the confidential problems of a single customer. Contract researchers admit that while they may not transfer commercially sensitive knowledge directly from one project to another, other clients will benefit from the general increase in knowledge brought about through a particular contract. This may prompt customers to wonder if paying a CRO to do R&amp;D for them supports work that will benefit competitors. The CROs response to this is that every project builds on research that went before. Today's contracts build on previous work as they also strengthen the research organisation's science for the future. The CROs argue that their ability to deal with problems across a broad spectrum gives contract researchers an edge over a dedicated laboratory.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               WHERE THE MONEY GOES Income for contract research received in 1988/89                                          Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CROs AIRTO members                            190m Others                                    60m Total                                    250m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Educational Institutions Universities                             150m Polytechnics and colleges                 30m Total                                    180m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Research council institutes              100m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Government laboratories DTI                                        4m - 5m MoD                                       55m Others (including AEA Technology)         80m Total                                    140m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grand total                              670m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Contract Research Business in the United Kingdom, by M J Ringe  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

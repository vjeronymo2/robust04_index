			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou with </F> unidentified correspondents following a Government Committee  meeting in the Chamber of Deputies building--live]    [Text] [Correspondent, in progress] ....FYROM [Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. This recognition comes when  Greek-U.S. relations are on a very good level. Do you believe  it could shake these relations? Do you believe this recognition  spells a worse course for the Skopje issue?    [Papandreou] These are two questions: First, certainly it  has some repercussions for Greek-U.S. relations. We have  expressed our strong displeasure, but we would like to believe  that the wording of the decision that was adopted -- it does not  use the word pressure but refers to exercising influence  concerning the issue of differences, as they are called in the  document, between Greece and Skopje -- may be utilized, I say  probably be utilized, positively. This is something we expect  but we don't know. On Skopje, you asked a second question....    [Correspondent, interrupting] Does this development spell  something worse....    [Papandreou, interrupting] Look, I think it encourages Kiro  Gligorov, who does not live the reality. The reality is that  Greece is in a position to isolate this country economically if  Greece so decides. If it makes that decision, it would mean  collapse. We are--in a strange irony--virtually the only Balkan  country with no territorial designs on Skopje. Opposition  between us and Skopje increases. I believe that Gligorov, no  matter how many countries recognize him, cannot escape the basic  question: What would Greece do? Greece can do a lot. I  believe this will be understood by our friends, our allies,  everyone.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, right up until the U.S.  recognition of Skopje was announced officially, did the Greek  side, did you personally, do anything to avert this action?    [Papandreou] Look, I can say this: First, I talked to  President Clinton in Brussels. Second, I had high level  contacts about three days ago. I don't know, I cannot give  details, but I did what I thought was possible and decent on our  part. There is also the issue of decency and pride.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, in its recognition  announcement, the United States uses the phrase: Differences  between Greece and Skopje. I would like you to comment on this  placing of an ally on the same footing as a country that until a  while ago was hostile to America.    [Papandreou] I agree with the reasoning behind your  question.  This is why we expressed our strong displeasure. We could not  return to a dialogue unless our three conditions were satisfied.  We follow a policy of two stages, two phases: The first phase  concerns the [Macedonian] constitution, the emblem of the  Veryina Sun, and propaganda. The second phase then is that we  go toward some economic normalization, primarily in the economic  sector [as heard]. But dialogue starts on other issues,  including the name, on which our positions remain irrevocable.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, Andonios Samaras [opposition  Political Spring party chairman] said yesterday that, according  to his information, the Skopjeans are giving nothing; they won't  even change [their] flag in return. He also discussed either a  struggle by the government or its resignation. Would you  comment on this statement by Samaras?    [Papandreou] I don't think there is any reason to comment on  it. There is no reason to comment on it.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, based on information that  you  already have, do you believe that a concession by Skopje at a  later stage based on Greek demands is feasible?    [Papandreou] I am optimistic but insistence, patience, and  determination, which we have, are necessary. We are prudent but  we don't forget our national interests. We have a duty both to  the nation and the people.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, could it be that the  recognition, this action by the U.S. side, occupies you ahead of  your visit to the United States the date for which has already  been announced?    [Papandreou] No.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, do you think you might  propose to the president holding a conference of the political  leaders. The official opposition party, through Chairman  Miltiadhis Evert, today called at least for the formation of a  national council on foreign policy.    [Papandreou] Well, it is a proposal. It has some meaning.  We will consider the proposal. Concerning a meeting chaired by  Konstandinos Karamanlis, there is not actually any objection; it  is a matter of time as to when we and, naturally, the president  will decide on it.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, would you like to comment  on the NATO decision yesterday on Bosnia?    [Papandreou] Yes, it is very unfortunate. It is an  absolutely wrong, guilty decision, because: How did the  Yugoslav crisis begin? Who is responsible for the crisis?  Unfortunately, it is [the responsibility] of the European  Community, you know. It is a responsibility that Greece,  unfortunately, also shared fully. We should not forget this.  There are tremendous responsibilities in this. Since 16  December [1991], the course has been charted. Now we have  military intervention to implement peace. It is an incongruous  scheme. The military intervention has no goal. What is the  goal of the intervention? Is it to strike at one of the three  parties to the dispute and the conflict--Serbia? Is it designed  to make it bend on its knees? What problem would this solve in  the region and what are the possibilities of the war expanding?  I don't want to be more precise or any clearer this time. But  there is a possibility of the war expanding. We adopted a firm  stance at the NATO summit, which is why the decision then was  quite good. I don't forget, we should not forget, that the  European Union's decision on Monday was a great success for the  Greek Presidency, I believe. But the same foreign ministers,  within the NATO framework, have decided on something that, in my  opinion, is a major blunder.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, why didn't the Greek side  exercise the right of veto.    [Papandreou] It can, it could. It did not exercise it  because then we would also have become part of the Yugoslav  crisis. We have undertaken a responsibility. We said clearly  why we are not participating and we will not allow the AWACS  [Airborne Warning And Control System] to move from Aktion or the  Greek crews to participate in the AWACS in the event of war.  Greece is very, very clear: We are staying out of the military  intervention in the Balkans. We consider it disastrous.    [Correspondent] Prime Minister, given the major crisis in  Bosnia and the possibility of a more general conflagration, how  do you judge the U.S. move to recognize Skopje? Does it  contribute to stabilization or does it contribute to  destabilization?    [Papandreou] Our position is clear: It does not contribute  to stabilization. What would contribute to that is pressure to  have concessions made, that is, to eliminate the aggressive,  irredentist nature of this state so that we can return to a  dialogue. Then, there would be normalization and a contribution  to peace in the region.    [Correspondent] You pinned many hopes on the White House.  Have they been belied now? Could it be that this option was  wrong?    [Papandreou] Look, it is not an issue of an option. It was a  good--and there is a good--relationship. And a good personal  relationship between was created this time between President  Clinton and me. But we know very well that no states, certainly  not the superpowers, move on the basis of personal friendship or  partisan identities or positioning. They move on the basis of  strategic interests, as they interpret them.</p>

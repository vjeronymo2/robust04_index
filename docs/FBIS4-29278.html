			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- More than half of Korean  businesses with 100 or more workers had completed  labor-management wage negotiations as of Wednesday, showing a  higher rate of settlement than last year, the Labor Ministry  said Thursday.    The ministry reviewed wage negotiations at the 5,483  businesses with 100 or more employees across the nation and  found that labor and management at 2,761 firms, about 50.4  percent, had agreed on pay hikes for this year.    The rate compares with the 39.3 percent recorded for the  same  period last year. The negotiation settlement rate reached 50  percent on June 28 last year.    The average wage increase at businesses which have settled  negotiations was 6.5 percent, a bit higher than last year's 5.2  percent. The rise was attributed mainly to the relatively  higher commodity prices earlier this year and the overall  business recovery, according to ministry officials.    Of the large business groups, Samsung showed the highest  rate  of settlement with 30 of its 35 subsidiaries, about 85.7  percent, having reached agreement, followed by Lucky-Goldstar  with 66.7 percent of its businesses wrapping up pay negotiations.    The ministry expected that wage negotiations will be  concluded earlier this year than in 1993, although some  automobile and shipbuilding firms have reported disputes to the  ministry after failing to conclude a settlement.</p>

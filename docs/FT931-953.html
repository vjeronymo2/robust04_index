			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Sharp decline at BNB Resources Correction (published 30th March 1993) appended to this article. BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and advertising group, returned a 73 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 712,000 for 1992. Mr David Norman, chairman, blamed a rise of Pounds 1m in rental costs and a reduction of Pounds 1.2m in bank interest income. Barker's regional communication side lost Pounds 446,000. The core advertising business increased profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 2.46m despite volume decline in the market, said Mr Norman who expects stabilisation, if not growth, in UK demand this year. Turnover was up to Pounds 62.9m (Pounds 54.9m). A final dividend of 3.3p is proposed for a maintained total of 4.9p uncovered by earnings per share of 3p (8.3p). CORRECTION BNB's core business is executive search, selection and recruitment advertising. It was incorrectly identified in last Friday's edition.</p>

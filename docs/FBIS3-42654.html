			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Magadan Oblast Statistics Administration: "The </F> Economic and Social Development of Magadan Oblast for Nine  Months of 1993"]    [Text] The results of nine months of this year  indicate a further exacerbation of the economic situation in the  oblast. The economic reforms that are being conducted are still  not having the necessary effect either on the sphere of turnover  or on the development of production in all branches of the  economy.  <H5>  Privatization and Destatization of the Economy </H5>   The most widespread method of privatization is sale by  commercial competition and auction. The prevailing sale price  exceeds the initial one by a factor of 15.    The number of enterprises that have changed form of  ownership  through the auction method is growing. Twenty-eight such  enterprises were counted in the oblast on 1 September; of these,  10 chose the first variant of privileges, 17--the second, and  1--the third. The size of authorized capital of joint-stock  companies totals 1.44 billion rubles [R].    In the structure of privatized enterprises, enterprises in  trade (46 percent), everyday services (22 percent), and public  catering (9 percent) predominate.    As before, the oblast center leads in the number of  privatized facilities in the oblast (93 enterprises), followed  by Yagodninskiy, Tenkinskiy, and Susumanskiy Rayons.    According to the status on 1 October, eight enterprises were  privatized in industry: the Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant,  Central Lespromkhoz, the AO [joint-stock company] Idyeya, 100  NKhP [petrochemical enterprise]--Magadan, the sausage factory,  the Sever-Evenskiy Fish Plant, Vtorchermet [state trust for the  preparation and processing of scrap nonferrous metals], and the  AO Magadanenergo [Magadan Power].    In a number of rayons, work on the establishment of peasant  (farmer) units has become somewhat more brisk. By 1 October in  the oblast they numbered 317, with a land area of 2,544,000  hectares, Of these, 304 farms are engaged in livestock raising  and plant growing.    In nine months of this year, 9,100 apartments with a total  area of 410,000 square meters were privatized in the oblast at a  cost of R473 million, 9 percent of these in September. In the  period that has passed, more than 5,200 applications to conduct  privatization were filed. In comparison with nine months of last  year, the extent of privatization in the oblast increased by a  factor of 2.7. This is associated with activation of the process  of privatization in the city of Magadan.  <H5>  Finances and Monetary Circulation </H5>   Enterprises and organizations of the oblast received profits  of 71.9 billion rubles [R] in January-August of this year.  Enterprises of the state sector get 99 percent of all profits,  and its main part--R60.5 billion (84 percent) is received by  industrial enterprises.    The measures being undertaken to stabilize the national  economy will not lead the economy of the oblast out of the spin  of the "inflationary spiral."    As before, a large number of unprofitable and costly  enterprises are functioning. At the beginning of September their  share was 39 percent on average for the national economy;  however, it was significantly higher in individual branches: in  everyday services for the population--75 percent, trade--57  percent, communications--46 percent. The overall total of  financial losses reached R6 billion.    The continuing nonpayments crisis is complicating the  financial situation of enterprises. Nonpayments to suppliers in  industrial and construction enterprises amounted to R47.2  billion, increasing in August by 12 percent, the indebtedness of  purchasers--by R111.8 billion (38 percent).  <H5>  Price and Wage Rate Indices </H5>   The increase in prices continued in January-September of  this  year. Consumer prices for goods and services in this period grew  by a factor of 24.8. The rates of increase in consumer prices  for the quarter on the average amounted to: January-March--21.1  percent, April-June--23.5 percent, and July-September--33.2  percent.    The highest rate in price increases occurred in paid  services  rendered to the population. Since the beginning of the year,  prices and wage rates for services requiring payment grew by a  factor of 113.8, which exceeds the rate of increase of consumer  prices for all goods by a factor of 16.7. The most significant  increase in prices occurred in: apartment rent in buildings of  the state housing fund (by a factor of 525.3), dormitory rent  (by a factor of 131.9), services of a legal nature (by a factor  of 377.4), public bath and shower services (by a factor of  175.7), services for the maintenance of children in preschool  institutions (by a factor of 51.8), intercity telephone  communications (by a factor of 31.1), and the cost of concert  tickets (by a factor of 28.5). Everyday services since the  beginning of the year increased in price by a factor of 25.5.    Consumer prices for all consumer goods increased since the  beginning of the year by a factor of 6.8, and in September, 31.8  percent. In the commodity group structure, consumer prices for  food products have a higher rate of growth. The average monthly  rate of price increases for foodstuffs amounted to 26 percent,  and for industrial commodities--21 percent.    The cost of a minimum consumer selection of 19 main food  products in the oblast center in September amounted to R51,406,  or, for example, more than in the city of Vladivostok by a  factor of 1.8.  <H5>  The Social Sphere </H5> <H5>  The Demographic Situation </H5>   The demographic situation in the oblast remains difficult.  This year for the first time the oblast became one of those  oblasts with natural population loss, when the number of deaths  exceeds the number of births. Regardless of the drop in the  rates of migration, the balance of migration (the difference  between the number of arrivals and departures) remains negative.  The total population for the beginning of October, according to  preliminary calculations, was 511,800 persons, falling by 4.5  percent in nine months.  <H5>  Labor Resources and Monetary Incomes of the Population </H5>   The decrease in the number of workers in oblast enterprises  (without taking commercial structures into account) continued in  August of this year.    In September 1993, 453 unemployed citizens applied to the  oblast employment center for job placement. On 1 October the  number in search of work who applied totaled 2,687 persons.  There were 1,914 persons with unemployed status, of whom 71.2  percent were receiving benefit.    The average wage of workers in enterprises of the oblast  continues to grow. The level reached R192,800 in August,  increasing with respect to the previous month by 19 percent.    In spite of the recalculation of wages in organizations  financed at the expense of the local budget, the gap in wages in  branches of material production and the nonproduction sphere  continues to be big (R217,600 and R136,400 respectively).    Among the regions of the Far East, Magadan Oblast firmly  occupies first place in the level of wages. However, Kamchatka  Oblast leads in the rate of growth for the previous month (142.6  percent against 119.1 for Magadan Oblast).    For January-September of this year, the monetary income of  the population of the oblast, according to preliminary  estimates, increased in comparison with the corresponding period  of last year by a factor of 12, and in September to January by a  factor of 6.    However, inflation introduces adjustments to incomes: As a  result of the limited effective demand on the part of a  substantial part of the population, the share of consumer  expenditures fell from 35 percent in January to 28 percent in  September.  <H5>  Consumer Market in Goods and Services </H5>   The production of consumer goods amounted to R36.1 billion,  which is 11.8 percent higher than last year's level. The  production of food products is increasing only in cost terms,  the output of meat decreased in natural terms by 28 percent,  sausage items--by 17 percent, whole milk products--by 39  percent, bread and bakery products--by 17 percent, nonalcoholic  beverages--by 48 percent, and mineral water--by 72 percent.    The production of nonfood consumer items in comparison with  January-September of last year was cut by 35.6 percent and  amounted to R2,869.1 billion.    The increase in goods turnover owing to price increases  amounted to R62 billion. In physical volume, 23 percent less  goods were sold to the population than in the corresponding  period of last year.    The extent of implementation of paid services in existing  prices amounted to R17.8 billion. Of this, state enterprises  rendered the population of the oblast 98 percent of the volume  of paid services, and private enterprises--2 percent. In  comparable prices this volume was reduced compared to the level  of last year by 66.1 percent, and in per capita terms, by 64.2  percent. The repeated freeing of prices for energy sources led  to an increase in the cost of all types of paid services. Prices  increased especially sharply for passenger and everyday  services, and also for communications services and public and  children's preschool institutions.  <H5>  Material Production </H5> <H5>  Industry </H5>   In nine months of 1993, state enterprises, joint-stock  companies, and associations produced products in current prices  worth R352.2193 billion, including in September--71.364.7  billion. In comparison with January-September of 1992 this  volume increased by a factor of 9.5.    It was possible in September to stabilize the work of  enterprises somewhat, and the output of products increased by  1.9 percent in comparison with the same month of last year.    A reduction of the output of products in natural terms is  observed in more than 70 percent of the named articles taken  into account in periodic reporting. Among these are electric  power, steel, precast reinforced concrete, walling materials,  industrial wood, lumber, trailers and semi-trailers, drilling  rigs and others, including consumer goods.    Since the beginning of the year, a decline in production has  continued to be observed in all industrial branches. Nonferrous  metallurgy enterprises and the food processing and fish  industries exceeded the September levels of last year.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   The reforms being conducted in rural areas have not yet been  able to correct the difficult situation in the agrarian sector  of the economy.    Due to financial difficulties the sovkhozes were unable to  acquire a sufficient amount of fuel. As a result, by 12 October  about 10 hectares of potatoes and 11.5 hectares of vegetables  were not harvested.    Preparation of the fields for next year was going on  simultaneously with harvesting. Land plowed in the autumn for  spring sowing exceeded last year's level by 960 hectares, and  winter crops were sown on 48 hectares.    The state of affairs with the preparation of fodder causes  alarm. By the beginning of October, 10,900 tonnes of hay, or 27  percent of the plan, were received, according to formal  documents.    The state of affairs in livestock breeding is also not  improving. A substantial drop in the cattle population and a  lowering in its productivity led to a slump in the production of  food products.    In nine months of this year, the sovkhozes of the oblast  sold  7,600 tonnes for slaughter. In comparison with the very same  period last year, the production of meat fell by 20 percent.    The extent of the decrease in milk production amounted to  8,000 tonnes.    Less eggs were produced in all poultry farms, except for the  Yagodninskiy Rayon.  <H5>  Capital Construction </H5>   Because of inflationary processes and difficulties in the  transition period, the rates of capital construction in the  oblast continue to decrease. In nine months of this year the  introduction of fixed assets (in current prices) totaled R6.1  billion and exceeded the corresponding period of last year  (owing to an increase in prices) by a factor of 4.4.    Owing to all sources of financing in the oblast, 24,700  square meters of general residential buildings area, or 398  apartments, were introduced, and compared to data for nine  months of 1992 the introduction of housing was reduced by 12,000  square meters (by 33 percent). The acuteness of the housing  problem in the oblast is partially being removed owing to the  redemption of housing from the population. Thus, for nine months  of this year, owing to the resources of republic and local  budgets, the administrations of the city and the rayons of the  oblast acquired about 500 apartments, of which 395 apartments  are in the city of Magadan.  <H5>  Transport and Communications </H5>   The problem of freight and passenger transportation remains  acute. In comparison with last year the transport of freight by  general use motor vehicles was reduced by more than half (50.3  percent), and freight turnover decreased simultaneously by 36.2  percent. This reduction is explained by the incomplete delivery  of national economic freight to the trading port of the city of  Magadan.    Transportation by general use buses fell by 10 percent,  amounting to 36.3 million persons. Passenger turnover was  reduced by almost half (44 percent).    Income received from the main activity of communications  enterprises grew by a factor of more than 12.  <H5>  Material-Technical Supply </H5>   Preparation of enterprises for work under winter conditions  proceeded over the summer period. The reserves of coal in  Magadan Oblast at the beginning of the cold season totaled  693,000 tonnes, 4 percent less than last year.    The reserves of solid fuel in the enterprises of the  joint-stock company Magadanenergo exceed last year's by 21  percent and totaled 385,000 tonnes.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>   The foreign trade turnover of the oblast for nine months of  this year reached $36 million. Products in the amount of $15.5  million were exported to foreign firms, and goods totalling  $20.5 million were imported. As before, imports exceeded  exports, as indicated by the negative balance amounting to $5  million. The increase in export deliveries for the past month is  insignificant--$1.4 million, and imports remained at the level  of eight months. In the last quarter, as in the previous one,  exports increased by $6 million, and revenues from abroad  dropped significantly.    The mass appearance on the foreign market of enterprises of  new forms of economic management is observed under conditions of  the formation of market relations--these are joint-stock  companies and associations, joint enterprises, partnerships with  limited liability, firms, companies, individual private  enterprises, cooperatives, and others. They are responsible for  an overwhelming proportion of exports--75 percent--and one-fifth  of imports of the oblast.    The share of foreign enterprises in the oblast's exports and  imports is insignificant--less than 1 percent.</p>

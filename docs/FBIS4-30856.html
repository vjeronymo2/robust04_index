			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F> Kosovo, by Elida Bucpapaj in Tirana; date not given: "The  National Cause Is Very Tangible"]    [Text] [Bucpapaj] At the end of the international  conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Warren Christopher announced  that "the question of Kosova is being examined as part of the  efforts to prevent the conflict spreading." Is this not very  little, or does it conceal a subtext?    [Rugova] It is not little, because you are aware of the  stance of the United States, declared by President Bush and  subsequently by President Clinton and his administration, that  it will not allow a conflict in Kosova or Serbian aggression in  Kosova. I was personally pleased that this statement was also  made on the occasion of the conference and before the  Bosnia-Herzegovina contact group. As Mr. Christopher said, the  problem of Kosova is, of course, the focus of  conflict-prevention meansures, and it is important that it was  mentioned in this situation, because I also sent a letter to the  contact group recently, urging them to consider the issue of  Kosova. These are, therefore, matters that should develop and  should be watched, but I repeat again that it is of ultimate  importance that the issue of Kosova was mentioned here too.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, I believe that your Gandhi-ism is now  well understood after a 26-month-long massacre in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. What may the future show us?    [Rugova] Indeed, there has been understanding for what I  call a peaceful movement, which some others call Gandhian,  others political, and so forth. It is a good thing that it has  met with international understanding. Of course, this has  yielded its own results. The cause of Kosova has been affirmed,  as has the Albanian cause. Albania's opening and involvement in  international institutions have also been very important. As  for the future, in the situation in Kosova today, we can  continue to not respond to provocations, because it is in the  Serbian interest to start a conflict, after which we do not know  what would happen. You see the case of Bosnia. The war started  easily, but is difficult to stop. It is therefore very hard and  unpromising for the Albanians, but the organization we have  achieved and our parallel systems and institutions have enabled  us to survive and to resist, of course with optimism that the  issue of Kosova will be solved. However, this will be a process  of talks and negotiations. I can say that I expect a better  future, but we must work. In politics, I favor tangible action,  every day building a little something, so that step by step we  create elbow-room under that savage occupation in which we find  ourselves.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you think that Britain has  abandoned its traditionalist policy after Douglas Hogg's visit  to Kosova?    [Rugova] Following the contacts we have had with Mr. Hogg,  his visit to Albania two years ago, our meeting in London last  December, and his recent visit to Prishtina, I can say his visit  was very important as a significant gesture. It was not merely  symbolic that he came to Kosova, because he visited all the  centers, the capital cities, of the former Yugoslavia. I can  say that Britain has shown great understanding of the Albanian  cause and the issue of Kosova. Britain, as you know, is very  well aware of the Albanian problem and the problem of Kosova.  One hundred years ago, even at the time of the League of  Prizren, Britain had very clear ideas about the unification of  the Albanian territories; however, at that time, we were very  weak diplomatically and politically. Today, Mr. Hogg said that  we was interested in finding some solution for Kosova and in the  start of some sort of dialogue and discussion. This was indeed  his main aim, like that of many European countries that are  interested in mediating and assisting. His presence in  Prishtina was therefore important.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, the 26-month-massacre in  Bosnia-Herzegovina openly shows indifference at the highest  international level. But, on the basis of the results of the  Geneva Conference, with regard to territorial relations, what is  your prognosis for the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Rugova] It remains to be seen whether or not  Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain the same state as it was when it  was recognized, whether it will be partitioned according to the  Bosniak-Croatian agreement on a federation and later a  confederation, or whether this process of internal unification  and further confederation will continue. Indeed I think that the  international community is making efforts to stop the war once  and for all and then see -- but, as we see, it is very  difficult. We can say that now that the war has begun it is  difficult for the world to involve itself and, of course, states  are wary of entering into a conflict whose end is unknown. The  question is now whether Bosnia- Herzegovina will be divided or  will remain, and whether the international community and the  United Nations will remain true to their principles regarding  countries or various territories they have agreed to protect. I  also see this as a long process.    [Bucpapaj] In the light of history, mentioning here the  League of Prizren in 1878, 1912, 1945, and so forth, Albania has  had many historic opportunities, lost opportunities. Now,  thanks to democratic processes, do we have a new historic  opportunity?    [Rugova] If we look at matters so simply, we might consider  these, from the perspective of today, as lost opportunities, but  I mentioned earlier the League of Prizren and the years 1912,  1913, 1919, and 1945. It is a fact that today we are in a very  different situation, I mean regarding Albanian potential.  Kosova, even though occupied, has intellectual potential. The  Albanians are no longer 80 percent illiterate as they used to be  throughout the Albanian lands. However, today, we are also  more-or-less handicapped because we have been invaded and  subjugated; Albania has been isolated for 50 years and has been  economically backward, i.e., with many problems, without  contacts and friends. Friends are very important. However, in  the last few years Albania has also revived and has opened up  and become stronger. We in Kosova have asserted ourselves as an  international entity, and so on, step by step. We must first  create sympathy, then friends, and there is the chance today for  a comprehensive Albanian policy. We possess diplomacy, which,  although young, we are attempting to turn into an Albanian  diplomacy. It is important to be organized and to have a  thoroughly democratic orientation, because it seems to us that  the word democracy has become a slogan for us. We must  therefore preserve the democratic mechanisms that operate in  Albanian society in Albania, in Kosova under the present  circumstances, and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], because democratic mechanisms ensure that  the cause advances in an organized fashion. Today, we must draw  lessons from what we may call these past opportunities, although  they have their own place in history. Even the League of Prizren  created an international precedent and raised demands; the  Albanian problem was put forward for the first time, as the  Ottoman Empire began to fall apart. In 1912 and 1913, we  remained as a movement. It is another matter that we were not  prepared and had no historical experience, but now let us draw  lessons and not allow such situations to repeat themselves. Let  us also take 1945, when territories were divided and redivided,  what was Yugoslavia was federalized, and the borders between  Italy and the former Yugoslavia were changed. In this sense, we  must draw lessons. Even in the efforts we are making today, we  must do something for the future. As a generation, this burden  has fallen to us, as in 1945, 1913, 1918, and 1986. We have an  advantage and must use this opportunity to the utmost. There  are therefore many opportunities for cooperation between these  democratic mechanisms in Kosova and Albania. Of course, the  economic revival coming to Albania is a very important factor.  Even in Kosova, under these conditions of occupation, people  are making ends meet; there is an economy, and there is human  solidarity. Similarly, let us use the diaspora for our common  good and organize it. In all events, it is an opportunity. Now  I do not want it to remain a mere opportunity, and let us keep  it open.    [Bucpapaj] Even after Mandela's victory in South Africa, a  typically colonial apartheid system like that in Kosova exists  in the middle of Europe. Will a limit be reached here?  [sentence as published]    [Rugova] This is happening. This apartheid is continuing and  being strengthened in Kosova. Of course, it will have limits  and I hope that it will not persist like in South Africa. This  is not a racial apartheid, because both we Albanians and the  Slavs are Europeans. However, it is an ethnic racism, and we  see tragedy in Bosnia, Croatia, and also in Kosova, where there  is emigration because of repression. We are working to ensure  that it does not last long, and it is important today that  international attention is focused on this apartheid and  discrimination in Kosova and has called it by its true name.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, your frequent presence in Tirana  suggests the coordination of viewpoints and options with the  policy of Tirana. Can you add something here?    [Rugova] Perhaps this is not the first time, but it is the  first time in 50 years, if not since 1918, that we have begun to  work together in the political sphere. This is very important.  As you know, since 1918, and indeed since 1912 and 1913 when  Kosova was invaded, under Montenegro, Serbia, and the former  Yugoslavia we have unfortunately never had positive cooperation  with the mother country. Even the war ended without any  cooperation, if we look at matters as events. Now we have  managed to create this cooperation. President Berisha, myself,  and the Albanians in Macedonia now act. It is extremely  important that we should meet and contact each other. Of  course, in the last few years, I have passed through here almost  every month, because that is the way I travel for security  reasons. Sometimes I joke that Tirana Airport is the safest in  the Balkans, but there is another side to this. It means I  travel on Albanian soil. However, it is very important today  that we see each other, meet, and create a comprehensive  Albanian policy. It is good fortune that President Berisha, the  Albanian Government, the parliament and the people support  Kosova. There is understanding, and this is guarantee enough.  We must continue in this direction.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you place any hopes in the results  that will emerge from the census of the Albanian population in  Macedonia?    [Rugova] The problem of elections is still being discussed.  I do not know if any decision has been made to announce this  census, which was to be held in June. It would be a good thing,  and I have spoken with Albanian political parties and groups in  Macedonia about this, to be organized, for the Albanian deputies  who are in power, and the Albanian ministers too, to make  preparations to ensure that there is as little rigging as  possible, as little speculation as possible, and for the real  figures to emerge. I have asked for, and we are working for,  the best possible preparations, whether this census is to be  held in June or in the autumn, because it is a census to be held  under international supervision and on this census will depend  the involvement of the Albanians in the institutional structures  of the Macedonian state as an ethnic and Albanian community on  its own territory. We must, therefore, be serious.    [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, what advice would you give this  pluralist and multiparty newspaper in Albania in this tragic  situation that has overtaken the Balkans?    [Rugova] Since we are all in this maelstrom, I pray to God  that we will emerge from this situation as easily as possible,  because wars today, as we see in Bosnia, are tragic. The  weaponry is not equal, and it is not an equal struggle. As I  said earlier, we have found ourselves in a very serious  situation and must be careful in everything. As for Albania, I  think that the results of the last two or three are very great.  We must all understand that we too, beyond the current borders,  are concerned and watch Albania in admiration for every effort  it is making. I think that a sound basis has been created, and  that good democratic, institutional, and economic foundations  have been laid. Every month in the last two years, I have  noticed changes, economic revival, and willpower among people.  Of course, we cannot expect changes within one or two years,  but sound foundations are being laid. Albania and all Albanians  have now accepted pluralism. Here we must find paths of  coordination, harmonization, and agreement. Of course, if we  mention the government's position we must realize that these are  elections for a four-year or eight-year mandate. The political  parties, groups, and associations must make efforts to prove  themselves, not to bring down so-and-so or to back so-and-so.  They must prove themselves, always within that mighty structure  we call the national cause, which I do not wish to remain a  slogan, a romantic phrase, or a piece of socialist romanticism,  but something tangible. The national cause is very tangible,  and we must see each other, meet each other, and travel,  breaking down these borders and within them building an Albanian  society wherever we are. We must therefore find an  understanding, despite the difficulties, and I again say, not as  a slogan, that we must work continually. Understanding is the  basis of national interests. Among ourselves, we are all of one  blood, one people. However, like a family, we must find  understanding; otherwise we cannot get on. This is also the  basis of democracy and the basis of society, but I believe that  we are successfully taking the first step.</p>

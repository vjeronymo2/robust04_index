Conventional  single-crystal substrates must satisfy several difficult to  satisfy requirements: structurally compatibility with the film,  a coefficient of thermal expansion compatible with that of the  film, and chemical inertia toward the film material, in addition  to matching degree of modularity and of its plane surfaces. A  comprehensive study has yielded an alternative solution to the  problem: a substrate with a bicrystalline structure with proven  strontium titanate as the preferred material. This choice had  been confirmed experimentally on the basis of quality control by  optical and x-ray inspection methods. A thin high-T[.sub]c[/]  ceramic film was grown on a heated substrate by the vapor  deposition process from two rotating identical solid ceramic  disk targets, which had been produced from the same mixture of  Y,Ba,Cu oxides. The targets were placed at a right angle to one  another and symmetrically at a 45 angle to the substrate  (``on base of a right equilateral triangle''). They were  vaporized by identical YAG:Nd+++ lasers operating in  synchronism, the two also mutually orthogonal laser beams being  focused each by a lens for normal incidence on the respective  target. The vapors emanating from the targets were channeled to  merge into one stream normally incident on the substrate  oriented. Specimens of such a structure were examined under a  polarization microscope. Measurements revealed a 2-periodic  anisotropy of the reflection coefficient for polarized light as  a specimen was rotated about the axis perpendicular to the  substrate surface, the amplitude of this anisotropy being  largest for light of 1 eV quantum energy and in this case  obeying the Malus law. The structures were also tested for Raman  scattering of light by the films. Interferometers built on such  substrates were tested for response to intensity oscillations of  an external magnetic field. Microbridges and quantum  interferometers were formed by standard methods of optical  photolithography. The critical current density in the direction  across the seam of the bicrystal-substrate was found not to  exceed a few kA/cm[.sup]2[/] and the critical direct current  for thus produced Josephson junctions to be within the 30 A   I[.sub]c[/]  300 A range. Their current-voltage  characteristic fitted the RSJ hyperbolic model, with blurring in  the vicinity of the critical current caused by the fluctuation  component of the junction current. A magnetometer containing  such a d.c. interferometer connected into the appropriate  electronic circuit had an energy resolution of  3.1x10[.sup]-30[/] J/Hz and a field sensitivity of  6.6x10[.sup]-13[/] T/Hz[.sup]1/2[/] at the 500 Hz  frequency.

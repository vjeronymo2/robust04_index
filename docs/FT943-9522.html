			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Minorco backs offshoot in purchase Minorco, the Luxembourg-based offshore operating arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, is backing a Dollars 405m acquisition by its Terra Industries subsidiary. As a result Terra will emerge as one of the largest producers of nitrogen fertiliser in North America and a leading methanol supplier. Terra is to buy Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals from its shareholders, who include Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund. To finance the purchase, Terra, quoted in New York, plans to use about Dollars 50m of its own and AMC's cash, issue Dollars 100m of new common stock and secure Dollars 250m of additional and long-term debt. Minorco has given Terra an option to sell it about 13.3m shares at Dollars 7.50 each, and this private placement would boost Minorco's ownership of Terra from 53 per cent to 60.5 per cent. Citibank has committed to provide all the debt financing. Terra, which produced net income of Dollars 22.8m on revenues of Dollars 1.2bn last year, is seen as one of Minorco's successes since it was split from Inspiration Resources, another Minorco offshoot, in 1991 to concentrate on its core agribusiness. Minorco said yesterday that the AMC acquisition would increase operating earnings at Terra and Minorco when many of Minorco's other big projects were in the development stage and consuming, rather than generating, cash flows. AMC's balance sheet included Dollars 216.8m of long-term debt at June 30 and it expects to have Dollars 86m of net working capital when the deal is closed at the end of October. AMC reported net income of Dollars 26.8m for the six months ended June 30 on revenues of Dollars 231.8m. If the deal had been completed at the beginning of 1994, Terra's earnings for the half-year to June 30 would have been 63 cents a share compared with 55 cents without the acquisition. AMC's two nitrogen manufacturing plants - at Blytheville, Arkansas, and Verdigris, Oklahoma - will double Terra's nitrogen fertiliser production capacity and give it the opportunity to reduce by 10 per cent its outside purchases of nitrogen fertiliser for resale through its retail network. Terra produces 1.3m short tons of anhydrous ammonia, upgrading 600,000 tons into 1m tons of solutions, over 250,000 tons of urea and 100,000 tons of ammonium nitrate. AMC's plants produce 1.4m tons of anhydrous ammonia, 1m tons of which are upgraded into 2m tons of nitrogen solutions and 480,000 tons of urea. AMC also produces 280m gallons a year of methanol from its plant in Beaumont, Texas, compared with Terra's present 40m gallons from its Woodward, Oklahoma, plant.</p>

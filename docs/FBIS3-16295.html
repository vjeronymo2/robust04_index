			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuriy Vakhrin: "Choice Has Been </F> Made But There Is Still No Agreement"]    [Text] Yaroslavl -- The Yaroslavl people have formed a new  legislative organ with an imposing name: the Yaroslavl Oblast  State Duma. The elections were deemed valid in 17 out of 23  districts. That is, six deputies' seats will be empty for at  least two months. But it is entirely possible they will be  empty until the fall. The Duma deputies will now schedule the  date of repeat elections.    No municipal organs of power were elected in the cities of  Rostov and Rybinsk. The elections of the municipal committee in  the oblast center were also almost disrupted: Here only 15  deputies' seats acquired incumbents and in seven districts the  voters essentially refused to use their legal "right to vote."    The voters' level of activeness has been very low. Only 33  percent of people with the right to vote came to the polling  stations. In two districts of Rybinsk and four of Yaroslavl,  the number of those who went to the polls was lower than the  control level of 25 percent.    In all 14 districts were formed on the territory of these  large industrial centers. And in eight of them where elections  were nonetheless valid a critical level of tension persisted  until nearly the very last hour of work of the polling stations.  Here the control level of voting activity was just exceeded.    The situation was saved by the inhabitants of the rural  rayons. And not only because they are traditionally more  responsive to appeals to take part in such campaigns. The  inhabitants of villages and small towns were better informed  about their candidates.    I personally, compelled by my job to read the entire local  press from cover to cover and to listen to the local radio and  watch oblast and city television programs, managed to learn the  names of the contenders for a seat on the municipality only at  the polling station, from the ballot slip itself.    It may be supposed that a substantial proportion of voters  who wanted to vote did not want "improvisations" in front of the  ballot box and preferred to stay home on Sunday. Others,  although they did come, were unable to make a choice and marked  the box "against all deputies."    Probably the Yaroslavl people's activity was influenced to  some extent also by "political fatigue" and the general  political situation in Russia recently. A serious analysis by  specialists is needed here. Especially as the election  situation in neighboring oblasts -- Ivanovo and Kostroma  Oblasts, where the voting is scheduled for the second half of  March -- is similar to the situation observed in Yaroslavl  Oblast. There is the same growing decline in voters' interest  in the elections, the same lack of information about the  candidates. And -- particularly important -- the same old idea  of the new organs of power.    At any rate, the majority of Yaroslavl people have obviously  elected another soviet but not a legislative chamber of a fully  empowered component of the Russian Federation. During a poll  over 70 percent of respondents, for instance, unequivocally  expressed themselves in favor of the idea that the new oblast  Duma should work on the basis of voters' instructions.    At a press conference devoted to the results of the  elections, Yaroslavl Oblast Governor Anatoliy Lisitsin frankly  stated that their results could have been utterly different had  it not been for the constant attacks of Vladimir Varukhin, the  president's representative in the oblast, who sought to disrupt  the elections. "During meetings with inhabitants I was often  asked: Why go to the elections if the president's representative  states that the elections will be repealed, that they will be  moved to the fall. That of course affected people's mood and  introduced confusion.... The voters' activeness could have been  far higher had it not been for the negative role of the  president's representative."    It is sad, but each disputing side has some truth. This  became possible in the absence of precise, clear legislation on  elections to the oblast legislative organs of power and  self-management. The statute on elections in the oblast was  reworked three times. For instance, the governor initially  confirmed this statute io the basis of the "Penza option"  guaranteeing representation in the Duma for each administrative  formation irrespective of the number of inhabitants.    Defending it, he appealed to the Constitution, which gives  components of the Federation the right to determine the election  procedure independently. Threatening a court investigation, the  president's representative achieved a change to this statute on  the elections but in the name of safeguarding citizens'  constitutional guarantees to equal electoral rights.    As a result the districts had to be re-formed in such a way  that they contained an equal number of voters. This  reorganization alone added to the confusion and disoriented both  candidates and voters.    One side, for instance, suggested that the elections be  deferred. The other would not agree to this for anything. The  local "red directors" recently "clashed" strongly with the  governor. They used threats and ultimatums to force him to  lower local taxes, established by the previous oblast soviet.  Nothing can now patch up this breach in the budget. That is  why the governor categorically refused to remain any longer  without his legislator partner, without his protection and  support.    The president's administration tried to reconcile the  quarrelling sides and to reason with them. N. Medvedev, leader  of the administration's department for work with the  territories, traveled to Yaroslavl. In vain. Three days before  the elections, when everything was already prepared for the  voting, the president's representative suddenly sent a  representation to the governor (and published it in the press at  the same time) suggesting that the elections to the local organs  of power be cancelled.    The elections nonetheless took place. But the last Sunday in  February brought no conciliation. The situation now is taking  shape in such a way that a succession of court cases on  recognizing the elections to the municipalities as invalid may  now ensue in the oblast.</p>

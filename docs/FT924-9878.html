			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (3): All eyes on Jack Frost - Neil Buckley assesses prospects for a surge in world prices DON'T be surprised if oilmen become obsessed with weather forecasts this winter, or suddenly start talking about Mount Pinatubo. Of all the factors influencing oil price movements over the next few months, weather could be the most important. The markets and oil companies alike are hoping for a colder-than-normal winter for the first time in five years. Their hopes were buoyed last month by predictions from a senior forecaster at the US National Weather Service that October to December temperatures were likely to be colder than normal over much of the mid-west and north-east of the US. Scientists also say atmospheric dust from last year's eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines gave many parts of Canada east of the Rockies their wettest and coollest summer in a century, and could make the North American winter particularly cold. Cold weather across the northern hemisphere could push up underlying demand for crude oil by 0.6m barrels a day  - sufficient to make a significant difference to prices. It would also bring about a large draw on oil stocks which are already at a four-year low, helping to push prices up in the first quarter of next year. Mild weather, on the other hand, could see prices weakening towards the end of the fourth quarter, and, with less of a draw on stocks, first-quarter prices next year would continue to be weaker. Given average weather, the fundamentals for oil prices look relatively strong. Moreover, in spite of continuing tensions in the Middle East, many observers believe 1993 could see more price stability than in recent years. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed at its September meeting in Geneva that its market share for the fourth quarter should be 24.2m b/d, with Kuwait allowed to continue to increase its output as it rebuilt its oil industry after the Gulf war. This would imply total Opec production rising to about 24.5m b/d. However, true Opec output in September is already estimated to have been higher than that  - at around 24.7m b/d  - and forecasts of average output over the fourth quarter range from around 24.7m b/d to a maximum of 25.1m b/d. Despite this, analysts generally agree that Opec output will be closely balanced by the actual call on its oil, producing a tight market. Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the international consulting group, sees average Opec production at 24.8m b/d in the fourth quarter, with underlying demand between 24.6m and 24.8m b/d. This is based on estimated world demand of 68.6m b/d and a draw on world stocks of 1m b/d. Kleinwort Benson, the London brokers, projects Opec production at 25.1m b/d, but says this will be matched by demand, with a draw on stocks of only 600,000 b/d, and world demand at 68.3m b/d. The outlook for oil prices is therefore positive. Mr Mehdi Varzi of Kleinwort Benson is sticking to his forecast of Brent crude prices reaching a peak of Dollars 22 a barrel this winter, and averaging Dollars 20 for the whole of 1992. Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of CERA, broadly agrees, basing his forecasts on the Opec basket of crude prices  - nowadays just over Dollars 1 a barrel cheaper than Brent crude. While the Opec basket averaged only Dollars 18.69 a barrel up to October, Mr Stanislaw sees it climbing towards Opec's target of Dollars 21, averaging Dollars 20.50 over the fourth quarter. For the year, this would lift the average price of the Opec basket to Dollars 19.10. A cold winter could add 75 cents to the price, he adds. There are, however, other factors apart from the weather which could boost prices. One is what CERA calls the 'capacity factor'. Most estimates put Opec production at only about 1m b/d less than its total capacity. Some of the difference is accounted for by heavy, sour oil which is not very attractive to the market, so the real leeway is very small. This makes the markets nervous, and some observers believe any short-term supply disruption  - for example, a sudden cut in exports from the former Soviet Union as recently happened with natural gas  - could produce a price spike of up to Dollars 25 a barrel. In the longer term, the most important factor is economic growth  - and particularly the rate of economic recovery in North America and Europe. CERA forecasts world economic growth in 1993 of 1.5 per cent, only a slight improvement on this year's 1 per cent. However, outside the the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development countries, as well as eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, oil demand growth continues to outstrip growth in gross national product. Overall, CERA expects average world oil demand to grow by about 0.5m b/d next year  - as it did this year  - to about 67.7m b/d. 'One thing we have learned is that oil demand continues to grow in spite of any recession in the developed countries,' says Mr Varzi. Moreover, production by the former Soviet Union is likely to continue to fall, from an average of about 9.1m b/d this year, possibly as low as 8m b/d in 1993, allowing some room for increased production by Opec and elsewhere to be absorbed. The second important factor influencing oil prices in 1993 is whether Iraq is permitted to begin exporting oil again. This poses potentially the most serious threat to the delicate balance within Opec and in the world oil market. Some observers have suggested that if Mr Bill Clinton is elected US president, he might adopt a less combative stance towards Iraq than President Bush, which could speed up Iraq's return to the market. Recent reports from Iraq that Saddam Hussein's power may be weakening have produced speculation that Iraq could return sooner rather than later. The 12 other members of Opec have said that room will be made for Iraq in the oil market when it comes back, calling for adjustments in each member country's production. This could provoke a bitter row. Iraq's re-entry would probably be most difficult in the second quarter of next year when oil demand is traditionally low. If it did not come back until later, when there is greater seasonal demand for Opec oil, and an improving economy and cold winter weather might further boost demand, there is still a possibility that Iraq could be absorbed without too much turmoil. There are other views, however. 'I have a slightly perverse theory that Opec might actually find it easier to absorb Iraq in the second quarter, when the need to cut back on production to make room for it is most obvious,' says Mr Stanislaw. 'Opec performs best, relatively speaking, in a crisis.'</p>

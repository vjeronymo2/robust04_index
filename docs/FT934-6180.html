			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Spanish unions take to streets Spain's two largest unions staged big protest marches in 50 cities yesterday evening against the government's economic policy. Some 40,000 were estimated to have turned out in Madrid and nearly 60,000 in Barcelona, far higher numbers than the protest organisers had expected. The turnout is likely to fuel rank-and-file calls for a general strike next month, which until yesterday had seemingly divided the union leadership. The demonstrations were the first test of strength by the unions against government plans to restore competitiveness by imposing wage restraints, reducing benefits and overhauling labour market legislation to allow part-time employment, apprenticeships and easier dismissal procedures. The Communist-led Commissiones Obreras union has called for national mobilisation to paralyse the country on December 17, but the rival Union General de Trabajadores, which co-sponsored yesterday's protests, is more hesitant, believing a full strike could prompt the government to take even tougher economic measures. The two unions staged a successful 24-hour strike in December 1988 that forced the government to withdraw a planned youth employment scheme and to increase pensions and unemployment pay. A half-day general strike last May in protest at social spending cuts was poorly attended, however. The government is due to meet the unions today in a last effort to salvage a social pact on incomes policy and labour reforms under discussion since September. But it has warned that it will impose its policies next week if there is no agreement. The employers' confederation, which held separate talks with the government yesterday about the social pact, termed the proposed labour markets reforms as 'too weak'.</p>

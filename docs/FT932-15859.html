			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: BBL chooses insurance partner BANQUE Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian bank, yesterday deftly put an end to 18 months of speculation about several possible partners for its insurance activities. It has finally selected Royale Belge and Winterthur - the Belgian and Swiss insurers - as the company to help it develop insurance products. The decision may call into question the involvement in BBL of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services company. Internationale Nederlanden Groep spent most of last year examining a possible bid for the bank. ING, which owns a 10 per cent stake in BBL, eventually decided that the price was too high to launch a takeover, but the Dutch group nevertheless still hoped to collaborate in the expanding field of 'bancassurance'. Yesterday, BBL said that Royale Belge and Winterthur, both of which have stakes in the company, would be given prime responsibility for the reinsurance of risks taken on by BBL Life and BBL Insurance, the bank's insurance subsidiaries. The association would help reduce risks and lighten solvency demands, said the bank. ING was not available for comment. Three weeks ago, Belgian newspapers reported that Mr Aad Jacobs, ING's chairman, was on record as having said that he would consider it an 'unfriendly' gesture if the Dutch company were to be excluded from bancassurance developments with BBL. The framework agreement with Royale Belge, nearly 50 per cent of which is controlled by UAP, the French insurer, and Winterthur will last for at least five years. The agreement is also 'linked to the stability of the bank's share register', BBL emphasised in a statement yesterday. Royale Belge and Winterthur will also be given priority for the underwriting of other non-BBL insurance products, although BBL said that there would still be some room for collaboration with its other insurance company shareholders. BBL, which is one of Belgium's three largest banks, last month announced that its net consolidated profits had dropped to BFr3.6bn in the 15 months to the end of 1992. That compares with BFr4.5bn in the 12 months to the end of September 1991.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Williams buys US lockmaker Williams Holdings yesterday boosted its presence in the US security market with the Dollars 80m (Pounds 54m) purchase of a commercial locks manufacturer, Corbin &amp; Russwin. The deal, Williams' largest acquisition since the Pounds 330m purchase of Yale &amp; Valor in 1991, will propel the group into the number two position for commercial locks in the US, after Ingersoll Rand. Industry sources estimate Williams will have 24 per cent of an annual market for locks and door-closing devices worth roughly Dollars 623m, while Ingersoll Rand is thought to have 34-36 per cent. Williams is paying cash to buy the Corbin &amp; Russwin architectural hardware business from Black &amp; Decker. Corbin and Russwin claims roughly 10 per cent of the builders' hardware market in the US, supplying cylinder and mortice locks to commercial customers such as hospitals. Black &amp; Decker is retaining the retail business which supplies locks for domestic uses. Corbin &amp; Russwin has been rationalised in the past two years and achieved profits of Dollars 3.3m on sales of Dollars 78m in the year to December 31, after heavy restructuring charges. Further charges are expected as the business is integrated with Yale in the US, but Williams maintains the acquisition will not dilute earnings per share. The deal is expected to increase Williams' year-end gearing from 40 per cent in December 1992 to roughly 60 per cent. However, Mr Nigel Rudd, chief executive, said he was comfortable with the increase. Indeed, given Williams' spread of business and Dollars 370m in long-term borrowing facilities, he was prepared to see gearing rise to as much as 100 per cent if the right acquisitions appeared. The group had nothing in its sights but would be looking to expand the security division in Europe. Williams had been stalking Corbin &amp; Russwin for more than two years. 'The deal makes huge commercial sense to us,' he added. The Yale business in the US had been focused, until now, on door-closing devices. This brought Yale back into locks, for which it was more widely known in Europe. Worldwide annual sales of the Yale security division would be about Dollars 300m after the acquisition, two-thirds of which would be in the US. The acquisition's net assets at completion are expected to be Dollars 35m. Background, Page 17; Lex, Page 14</p>

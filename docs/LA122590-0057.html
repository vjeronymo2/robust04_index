			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Carolco Says It Is Innocent: Independent movie maker Carolco Pictures Inc.,  trying to regain credibility after its chairman was slapped with a court order  limiting his operating abilities, denied that it had done anything wrong. Los  Angeles-based Carolco, which released "Total Recall" and "Jacob's Ladder" this  year, also said the court order would have no effect on its operations. The  order, issued last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, froze 2.2 million  Carolco shares owned by Mario Kassar and told the company not to approve any  loans or financial transactions with Kassar without court approval.  </P></p>

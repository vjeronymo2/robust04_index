			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Peugeot chief warns on sales Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of Peugeot Citroen, the French motor group, yesterday warned that the French car market was still in a fragile state and that sales were likely to fall again once the short-term stimulus provided by the government's incentive scheme wore off. The car market was badly affected by the recession last year, with the number of new car sales falling by 18.3 per cent. However a government scheme to offer payments of FFr5,000 to people trading in vehicles more than 10 years old to buy new cars helped to fuel a 13.8 per cent sales increase during the first four months of this year. Yet Mr Calvet said on French radio that the scheme was likely only to have a short-term effect and that car sales 'may fall or even return to a relatively weak level' when it ends next year.</p>

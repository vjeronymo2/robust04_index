			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (3): Towards more flexibility - Cost-effectiveness Even the most mundane workplace is cocooned nowadays in a network of wire; data links, several kinds of computer cable, telephone cords and - hiding in this web - electrical power leads. 'Any change of hardware can result in a change to the cabling,' says Stephen Hill of Oscar Faber Information and Communications. 'And of course no-one knows which are the original ones, so new cable is simply piled into the trunking.' Moving desks can be just as chaotic, as the confusion over what goes where is compounded by the fact that nothing seems to match. A PC cannot use a mainframe terminal wire any more than it can a power lead - as service engineers sometimes find to their cost. This is no isolated problem. Offices 'churn' constantly, moving half their work positions within the first year of occupying a building and up to 30 per cent annually after that, says Mr Hill. More than half require re-cabling, costing up to Pounds 400 per person. One solution has emerged over the past five years, however. Structured wiring schemes (SWS) involve highly specified cabling which can accommodate a wide variety of users. Conversion equipment and special junction boxes mean that people and their computers can be moved around easily and simply. The cabling works for any kind of hardware, so that, too, can be moved or changed. This cuts the cost of churns to Pounds 20 per person, says Mr Hill. The extra cost of SWS pays for itself in two or three years. But what about a mechanical digger waiting to wreak havoc in the road outside? Simple, he says. Lay in a second, standby, connection. 'The cost is negligible if provided at an early stage.' One of the main complaints of engineers is that such systems have to be retrofitted because they are not involved early enough in planning services. Developers argue that so much is determined by planners and tightly constrained finance that it is pointless calling on engineers until the detailed services are required. This is compounded by the strangely British way of completing buildings before anyone knows the specific needs of occupiers. Developers and agents argue that tenants will not take premises until they see everything in place. Occupiers then merrily tear out thousands of pounds' worth of fittings to replace with their preferred options - or make the best of services such as cabling and air conditioning that are patently unsuitable. Some progress has been made towards the US technique of taking buildings only to 'shell and core' stage. This means that the frame and cladding are finished but only the main services are installed in the core. Occupiers then specify what they require on the lettable floor areas. The reason is more to do with a fall-off in speculative development than any change of heart by developers, however. Pre-lets are now the norm, so they are dealing with an occupier who will specify the services needed. The spin-off is more 'appropriate' buildings, says Kevin Cooke, divisional director of cost consultants AYH Partnership. 'We can now get past the agents and their demands for excessive specifications,' he says. Power-loading is his particular bugbear. Reducing the specification on one 400,000 sq ft scheme in London from 25 to 15 watts per sq metre cut capital spending by Pounds 400,000 and maintenance-running costs by Pounds 80,000 a year. Another message getting through to occupiers at this early stage is that buildings should not be judged solely on initial construction prices. Life-cycle costing, which takes into consideration the running and maintenance bills for plant and equipment, has been preached by engineers and surveyors for years. Now they can make a case directly. Developers remain unconvinced. 'We see the looks on people's faces when presented with bare concrete and pipes,' says one. 'They want something nice to look at before putting their hand in their pocket - even though they know it could all come out later.' But while buildings remain hard to let, developers find they have to pay this double cost of fitting and refitting themselves, so the prospect of more shell-and-core schemes - and 'appropriate' servicing - has brightened. Institutional funders are also being won over, as the core services can be matched to their standards even if letting areas are tailored for individual users. Whether this survives a market recovery remains to be seen. But both funds and occupiers are adjusting to the idea that they should be demanding buildings flexible enough for tomorrow's tenants - whoever they might be.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- China has made marked  achievements in revitalizing cotton production thanks to the  widespread application of new cotton growing techniques.    According to an on-going national conference on cotton  production here, the new techniques widely applied include  improved strains of seeds that promise high yield and resistance  to diseases, plastic film covering in the early period of  growth, application of mixed fertilizer, transplantation of  cotton seedlings and sowing of de-haired seeds.    Over the past five years, nearly ten varieties of improved  cotton strains, including Zhongmian 12, Zhongmian 16, Zhongmian  17, Lumian 10 and Emian 18, have been widely applied. The  Simian 3 developed by Jiangsu Province boosts per unit cotton  yield by about 20 percent as compared with common varieties.  The de-haired cotton seeds have been extensively applied in  Anhui and Xinjiang.    Xinjiang, which reported a good cotton harvest last year  despite the widespread drop in output in other areas of the  country, uses plastic film covering in 96 percent of its cotton  fields and Shandong applied plastic film covering and seedling  nursing and transplantation in three-fourths of its cotton  growing areas.    The photosynthesized trace element fertilizer, which can  raise cotton yield by at least 10 percent, is also widely used.    China is one of the biggest cotton growers in the world. Its  annual output hit a record 6.25 million tons in 1984. But over  the past two years, due to infestation of cotton bollworms,  adverse weather conditions and reduction in cotton growing  acreage, the cotton output has dropped for two successive years  to 3.76 million tons in 1993.    The central government has made great efforts to boost  cotton  acreage since the beginning of this year and achieved some  results. Reports from various places show that the cotton  acreage this year is much more than last and all localities have  adopted early preventive measures against cotton bollworms that  have eaten up millions of tons of cotton over the past two years.</p>

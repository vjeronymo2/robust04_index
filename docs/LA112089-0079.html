			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTINGHOUSE SEEKS FEE HIKE AT NUCLEAR SITES  </P> <P> Westinghouse Electric Corp. is proposing big increases in the fees that it  receives from the U.S. Department of Energy for managing nuclear weapons  plants.  </P> <P> Westinghouse officials said they want two to three times more for managing  three nuclear weapons facilities and three other DOE nuclear units. The weapons  facilities are Savannah River in South Carolina, Fernald near Cincinnati and  the Hanford nuclear reservation near Richland, Wash.  </P> <P> The Pittsburgh-based company earned $39 million in award fees this year, which  are based on the company's performance in operating the plants. It estimates  that it will earn up to $50 million in fiscal 1990 under existing contracts.  </P> <P> William M. Jacobi, vice president in charge of Westinghouse's governmental  business operations, said the company seeks the higher fees because of "risks  we're seeing now that we didn't see before."  </P></p>

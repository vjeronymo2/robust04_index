			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: USD SURVIVES CAL BAPTIST RALLY IN OPENER  </P> <P> The University of San Diego baseball team survived a late rally by Cal Baptist  in winning its season opener, 7-6, Tuesday at Cunningham Stadium.  </P> <P> Tom Cheek, a former Mt. Carmel High pitcher, allowed one run in the ninth but  retired Cal Baptist with the tying run on third to record the save. Lou  Skertich, who pitched three innings relieving starter Pat Fitzsimons in the  third, was the winner.  </P> <P> Kevin Herde, a freshman from San Pasqual High, hit a two-run home run to center  field in his first collegiate at-bat. USD led, 7-2, after four innings but  allowed Cal Baptist back in it with three errors.  </P> <P> Geoff Martinez was three for five with two doubles and two runs batted in and  Kyle Sebach earned his first college save as U.S. International defeated UC  Irvine, 4-1, in a nonconference game in Irvine.  </P> <P> Sebach, a former pitcher for Santana High, came on in the seventh with two on  and no outs. He got out of the jam unscathed and finished up for the save. Mike  Whisonant (1-0) pitched six innings for the victory.  </P> <P> It was USIU's first victory in four games. The Anteaters fell to 2-2.  </P> <P> Eric Judson and John Meyers went two-for-four with an RBI as UC San Diego won  its season opener and first game played on its new field, 9-3 over Christ  College Irvine. Rick Rupkey pitched five innings and scattered four hits in  picking up the victory.  </P> <P> San Diego State defeated Spain, 12-1, in an exhibition game at Smith Field.  Steve Murphy had three hits and two RBI. Six SDSU pitchers combined for a  two-hitter.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Marty Dow, center for the San Diego State basketball team, missed practice with  a sore right foot.  </P> <P> SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said Dow's injured tendon is in a soft cast and that  he is "50-50" for Saturday's game against U.S. International University in the  San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "It's been bugging him for some time," Brandenburg said. "We'll just keep him  off it for a couple of days and then check it. If it's sore, we'll put it back  in (the cast), and if not, he'll go."  </P> <P> Dow is one of just two Aztecs to start all 23 games this season. He is  averaging 12.3 points and 6.1 rebounds a game.

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Germans protest at racist attacks ABOUT 180,000 Germans staged rallies across the country yesterday, marking the grim anniversary of the Nazi Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews in 1938 and protesting against recent rightist attacks on foreigners, Reuter reports. Mr Ignatz Bubis, head of Germany's Jewish community, told a memorial service in Frankfurt that the recent right-wing violence did not mean that German democracy faced an imminent threat or that Germany was staging pogroms again. But he added: 'We must. . . see it as our duty to warn the current generation where the path of violence and support for extreme right-wing parties can lead.' The Bonn government confirmed it would pay DM975m (Pounds 395m) to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution who previously received little or nothing because they had lived in former Communist bloc states.</p>

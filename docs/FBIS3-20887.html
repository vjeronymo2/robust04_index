This subprogram, known as Chippac, is being  managed by the Bull company.    The heads of the European ESPRIT research program have just  entrusted the management of the Chippac microassembly program to  Bull. This subprogram, to run for two and a half years, is to  use models to demonstrate the operational reliability of  multichip modules (MCM) and single-chip modules (SCM) designed  on the basis of the results of several previous studies of  substrates and modes of connection. Other European companies  will also participate in this project, notably Framatome, GEC  Marconi UK, IMC, Alcatel-Mietic, SGS-Thomson, and Telefonica.  The results of Chippac will have to be suitable for use in  applications as varied as information technology,  telecommunications, robotics, transport, or even for the general  public. Participants in the Chippac project will initially  concentrate on several basic studies of modules, starting with  the problem of the reliability of bare chips. In particular,  Chippac will seek to develop testing methods and tools to enable  the quality of bare chips to be guaranteed before their assembly  on the module (KGD: known good die). Two further studies will  concentrate on ceramic (particularly low-temperature cosinters)  and organic substrates, with the aim of comparing different  kinds of products, and determining the limits and rules for  their design.  <H5>  A Thorough Study Based on Ball Bearings </H5>   Chippac will also look into modes of interconnection of bare  chips (known as "first level of connection"). Wire connection  up to 75fm and by TAB without bossing onto the chip (connection  on the strip being by means of the pins of the chip) will be  particularly investigated. The second level of connection  (assembly of the module on the card) will also be investigated  in a study dedicated particularly to ball bearings. The aims of  Chippac are also concerned with the characteristics of modules.  The SCM model will have to be able to encapsulate a 15 x 15 mm  chip comprising over 400 E/S, operating at over 100 MHz and  dissipating up to 10W. The module will need to be sufficiently  reliable to be suitable for information technology and  telecommunications applications. One of the MCM modules on a  ceramic substrate (MCM-C) will need to contain 32 chips,  including 24 bare ones (connected by TAB without bossing), and 8  encapsulated in ultraflat cases (TSOP). The external  connections will need to operate at up to 33 Mbit/s, and the  internal ones at up to 75 Mbit/s. The desired dissipation level  is between 100 and 200 W. This configuration will also be  tested on a MCM-L model (organic substrate). Another MCM-C  model will use flip-chip technology to connect a 9-memory  microprocessor. Finally, a MCM-L model needing to operate at  around 1.5 GHz in very severe environmental conditions will also  be tested.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SAVING THE EARTH'  </P> <P> The story asks, "Will U.S. consumers do without air conditioners in new cars?"  This sacrifice to save the planet from further destruction. Probably not.  </P> <P> But will U.S. citizens put up with no shelter for the homeless, inadequate  health care for the poor and elderly, failing savings and loans, decaying inner  cities, pollution, etc., etc.? Will we pay more than a billion dollars every  working day for "defense?" You betcha!  </P> <P> HARRY RORICK  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

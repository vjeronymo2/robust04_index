Radetskyy visited a garrison stationed in Vinnytsya Oblast.    During the meeting with officers and generals at the  headquarters of Ukraine's Air Force, Vitaliy Radetskyy stressed  that the merger of the Air Force and Air Defense had been  suspended. It is necessary to work on this problem as a  promising one. The defense minister presented the new Air Force  commander -- Lieutenant General Volodymyr Antonets, appointed to  the post by a Ukrainian presidential edict.    "We are military people and must fulfill our supreme  commander's order," commented the minister upon the changes in  the personnel. "Rally passions within troops are  inadmissible...."    Radetskyy also met with officers of the command of the 43d  Strategic Rocket Troops and stressed once again that Ukraine is  a missile and space power and that even after the program for  nuclear disarmament is completed, missile specialists will have  to fulfill specific work for the defense of our country.</p>

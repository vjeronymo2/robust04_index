			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAMPRAS CLIMBING TENNIS LADDER;  </P> <P> RATINGS: AFTER WINNING THREE TOURNAMENTS, FORMER PALOS VERDES HIGH PLAYER IS  RANKED 14TH.  </P> <P> Almost 19 now, Pete Sampras finds himself each morning facing one of the curses  of maturity: the drudgery of shaving.  </P> <P> But even on those days when one of America's future hopes to win Wimbledon  decides to skip the razor, a rosy glow still peeks through the stubble.  </P> <P> Here, clearly, is a man on the brink who is in the pink.  </P> <P> Last week, Sampras showed how rosy his future is -- and how slim the margin is  between a hot young talent and a champion.  </P> <P> It happened in a match against Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg, the semifinals  of the Volvo Los Angeles Tennis Championships at UCLA Tennis Center. Edberg won  it, 6-2, 6-7, 6-1, but Sampras left everyone, including Edberg -- the world's  No. 2 player -- impressed.  </P> <P> "He's a very dangerous player," Edberg said. "With time and matches, I think  he's going to be a top 10 player very soon. He's got all the ingredients to be  a very good player if he keeps working."  </P> <P> Sampras showed off all the weapons in his arsenal in Saturday's semifinal, a  duel that matched up two of tennis' premier serve-and-volley specialists:  Sampras often aced a flatfooted Edberg, blasting his first serve consistently  in the 115-m.p.h. range.  </P> <P> He also hung tough against Edberg's high-kicking rocket serve, ripping a series  of blistering backhand winners past the onrushing Swede.  </P> <P> Sampras hit more winners that afternoon than did Edberg.  </P> <P> The difference in the match was experience. For every brilliant shot Sampras  hit, Edberg had an even better reply.  </P> <P> "I think I have all the shots I need," Sampras said. "It's just a matter of  putting them all together at the same time."  </P> <P> The way Sampras is playing, that time doesn't seem very far away. He has had an  outstanding year -- winning three tournaments -- and his world computer ranking  has climbed to No. 14.  </P> <P> This week, Sampras was playing in the ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio -- one of  a series of hard-court tournaments leading up to the U.S. Open. He has now  reached the semifinals of two consecutive tournaments, including the Players'  International in Toronto.  </P> <P> As a sophomore at Palos Verdes High, Sampras was unbeaten in 56 sets and  captured the Southern Section CIF 4-A title. The following season he turned  professional, almost as an afterthought.  </P> <P> In April of 1988, Sampras skipped four days of school and proceeded to knock  off two top touring professionals -- Ramesh Krishnan and Eliot Teltscher -- in  the Champions Cup at Indian Wells.  </P> <P> He quit the Palos Verdes High team, kept the check for $7,000, and said goodby  to amateur days.  </P> <P> Sampras credits his fast start this year to a preseason conditioning regimen.  He took on a new coach -- Joe Brandi of the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy --  who put him through a weightlifting and running program, in addition to five  hours of tennis each day.  </P> <P> It paid immediate dividends. Sampras reached the quarterfinals in Sydney,  losing to Mats Wilander, and the semifinals in Milan, where he lost to Ivan  Lendl.  </P> <P> Then Sampras started going all the way. He broke into the Top 20 at the U.S.  Pro Indoor Championships in Philadelphia in February, knocking off Tim Mayotte  and Andre Agassi on his way to a final against eventual French Open champion  Andres Gomez.  </P> <P> Once there, Sampras defeated Gomez in straight sets, 7-6, 7-5, 6-2, winning the  same tournament where it all began two years before, when Sampras had battled  through the qualifying draw as an amateur.  </P> <P> "The conditioning is the biggest factor," Sampras said. "It's carried me  through the whole year to this point."  </P> <P> The week before Wimbledon, Sampras won a grass-court tournament at Manchester,  England.  </P> <P> Tennis experts believe that if Sampras can harness the thunder of his attacking  game at Wimbledon, he can become this country's best chance to win tennis'  biggest prize.  </P> <P> Wimbledon was Sampras' biggest letdown of the year, however. He got an unlucky  draw -- grass-court expert Christo van Rensburg of South Africa -- and was  eliminated in the first round in three tough sets.  </P> <P> "I prepared well for Wimbledon," Sampras said. "I just didn't play well."  </P> <P> He bounced back a week later, however, winning a tournament in Tokyo.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's realistic for me to win Wimbledon yet," Sampras said. "I  think I'll play my best tennis in my mid-20s, so I have a lot more chances at  it. I don't want to put extra pressure on myself."  </P> <P> That laid-back approach has been the hallmark of Sampras' career -- going back  to age 14, when he switched from a two-handed backhand to improve his  serve-and-volley game.  </P> <P> In doing so, Sampras was going against the grain of most junior players, who  were developing as base-line counterpunchers.  </P> <P> Sampras took it a step further by seeking out competition against older,  stronger players.  </P> <P> Instead of focusing on winning matches, he honed his aggressive game against  the hard hitters, and along the way he learned the fine art of improvisation so  vital to attacking players.  </P> <P> "I didn't have a high ranking in juniors," Sampras said. "I was playing to  improve my game, and it's really paying off right now. It was a move I made for  the long run."  </P> <P> The one-handed backhand -- taught to Sampras by his first coach, pediatrician  Peter Fischer -- is also reaping rewards.  </P> <P> It improves Sampras' range and gives him an array of spins -- slice, flat or  topspin -- for all situations. It also helps Sampras charge the net quicker on  his approach shot.  </P> <P> A six-foot, 180-pounder, Sampras seemingly has only one weakness -- inside his  own head. He admits his concentration lags at times.  </P> <P> "If I'm up a service break in the second set, sometimes I'm already looking  ahead to shaking the guy's hand after the match," Sampras said. "I've got to  constantly remind myself to concentrate on every point."  </P> <P> When Sampras wins the mental battle with himself, his opponents often fall as  well.  </P> <P> In last year's U.S. Open, Sampras beat defending champion Wilander -- a crafty  base-liner -- in a draining, five-set, second-round match played in sweltering  humidity.  </P> <P> Sampras' concentration never flagged in that one. At other times. . . .  </P> <P> In the semifinals at Toronto this year, Sampras faced longtime nemesis Michael  Chang, whom he has been battling since both were 10.  </P> <P> Sampras won a tiebreaker in the second set to pull even, but eased up on Chang  in the third and lost the match, 3-6, 7-6, 5-7.  </P> <P> "I should have won that one, but I let it slip away," Sampras said. "That's one  reason I haven't had too much success against Chang at the pro level. He's not  going to give you a match . . . you have to earn it. But I'm sure we're going  to be going at it many more times before it's over."  </P> <P> Sampras also lost this week to Chang, 7-5, 6-4, in the ATP Championship.  </P> <P> Edberg didn't seem to think Sampras' concentration lapses were a serious  obstacle.  </P> <P> "It happens to everybody," Edberg said. "It's just a matter of learning, being  out there and playing matches."  </P> <P> While Sampras continues his lessons, he represents part of the changing of the  guard -- the youth movement that includes Chang, Agassi and others -- in  American men's tennis.  </P> <P> To set up that Toronto meeting with Chang, Sampras defeated veteran John  McEnroe, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, in the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> "That was a thrill," Sampras said. "At first I was a little nervous. For the  last 10 years, I've looked up to him. At first, I was playing John McEnroe --  the legend. Then I started playing the ball."  </P> <P> Right now, Sampras' computer ranking is only a rung below McEnroe's 13th.  </P> <P> For Sampras, that's only a step away from putting legends behind him, and  starting some of his own.LORI SHEPLER / Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

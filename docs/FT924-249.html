			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: BAe falls on broker reratings DEFENCE contractor British Aerospace (BAe) was among the most heavily traded stocks in quiet Christmas Eve dealing as most analysts cut profits forecasts for 1992 and 1993. The shares were off 12 at one stage but rallied to close 5 down at 157p after some 2.6m dealt. The downgradings followed a company meeting with analysts on the previous evening. Hoare Govett, the company's broker, was said to have cut back its estimates but was unavailable for comment. County NatWest lowered its forecast to a loss of Pounds 865m for 1992 from a previous Pounds 840m loss prediction, mainly because of 'massive exceptional charges'. The house also cut the 1993 forecast to a Pounds 60m profit from Pounds 105m. However, County is sticking to its 'hold' advice for short term investors and believes the stock will 'outperform' in the long term. Smith New Court is predicting a loss of Pounds 1.075bn. Analyst Mr Chris Avery said: 'There is going to be a Pounds 1bn exceptional charge. If you are going to have a blood bath, what is the point of showing any profit at all?' HSBC responded to a rally in Hong Kong and to recent broker buy recommendations. The London stock rose 8 to 486p and the Hong Kong stock 9 to 473p. SG Warburg firmed 5 to 545p, reflecting the consistent high levels of activity on the London stock market since the Conservative election victory. The effect of forecast and rating downgradings in the UK and US lopped a further 8 off Glaxo, which closed at 748p. P &amp; O recovered 8 to 508p as a recent fall prompted by a debt downgrading provided a cheap buying opportunity. BP was one of the most actively traded stocks in the market, with the shares maintaining their recent strong showing and closing 4 higher at 241 1/2 p. The buying came mostly from the US, where investors now speak for more than 21 per cent of the shares. Lasmo's recent sale of assets continued to attract buyers and the shares added 2 at 158p. The regional electricity stocks were bought by income funds. East Midland, which goes ex-dividend on January 18, put on 4 to 420p and Yorkshire, xd on January 4, gained 4 at 499p. Welsh Water, whose sale last week of a stake in South Wales Electricity netted a profit of around Pounds 17m, rose 7 to 521p. USM-quoted jeans manufacturer Pepe fell 5 to 4p after reporting a Pounds 10m loss and a restructuring. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (113).

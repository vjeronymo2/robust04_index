			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> CAUTION ON PREGNANCY TESTS  </P> <P> Women using home pregnancy tests apparently get incorrect results about 10% of  the time because they make mistakes using the tests, raising unfounded hopes  and fears, researchers said last week.  </P> <P> Based on a new study evaluating two popular home pregnancy tests, the  researchers said the tests themselves are highly accurate when used properly,  but they are so complicated that users often produce errors.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is the kits themselves are accurate and perform well. But in  the hands of lay people who are not used to doing home testing, many mistakes  can be made," said Jocelyn Hicks, chairwoman of laboratory medicine at  Children's Hospital National Medical Center in Washington. Hicks recommended  the tests and instructions be simplified.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for the companies that make the two tests involved in Hicks' study  said they were confident in the accuracy of their products and the clarity of  the instructions.  </P> <P> Hicks obtained 200 urine samples from urban adolescents and gave them to a  variety of non-technical hospital employees, such as secretaries and janitors,  to test with two popular home pregnancy tests. A test, sold as e.p.t. Plus and  made by Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J., produced incorrect results  -- false positives and false negatives -- in 9.5% of the cases. A test called  ADVANCE and made by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., produced false  results in 12.5% of the cases, the researchers said.  </P></p>

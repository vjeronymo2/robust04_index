			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sandra Brasil] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Ministry of the Army purchased 112  portable Igla anti-aircraft missiles and 56 launchers from  Russia on 31 May. This type of missile is used by ground  soldiers to shoot down low-flying planes and helicopters. The  Army said the missiles are 100 percent efficient.    According to General Gilberto Serra, head of the Army Social  Communications Center (Cecomsex), the Army used part of the $100  million it has allocated to purchase Russian armaments to  purchase the missiles.    "We purchased the missiles because it was good business. We  are conducting studies to manufacture them locally, but it takes  a country 10 years to develop the appropriate technology for  that type of equipment", the general said.    Serra said this is the first time Brazil has purchased  weapons in Russia. The deal was made possible thanks to an  agreement signed between the Industry and Commerce Ministry and  the Russian Federation providing for the import and export of  the most diverse kinds of products manufactured in the two  countries.    In the next four years the trade exchange between Brazil and  Russia should reach $2 billion.    The Army General Staff is analyzing what other kinds of  military equipment could be purchased in Russia with the  remaining $100 million allocated to the Army by that  international trade agreement.    "Our interest is in purchasing as much as possible with as  little money as possible. The Igla missile has already been  tested under battle conditions, and it is one of the most modern  in the world," Gen. Serra said.    Negotiations between the Brazilian Army and the Russian  weapon industries started in September of last year, when  Minister Zenildo de Lucena visited Russia.    The Army informed Armed Forces members about the purchase of  the 112 anti-aircraft missiles and 56 launchers on 27 May. Each  missile is 1.68 meters in length, and missile and launcher  together weigh 18 kg.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The economic low point has been  overcome in many countries in Eastern and Central Europe. This  applies, above all, to the pioneers of reform -- the Czech  Republic, Poland, and Hungary -- but also to Slovenia, Estonia,  and, a bit farther behind, also to Slovakia, the Eastern and  Central Europe Association (OMV) announced in Hamburg at its  members' meeting on Thursday [28 April]. The importance of  Eastern Europe for German foreign trade has increased. Foreign  trade turnover with this region increased by at least 6 percent  in 1993 to 88.2 billion German marks, while foreign trade as a  whole decreased by 10 percent, the OMV annual report says. The  share of trade with Eastern Europe in Germany's total foreign  trade amounted to 7.7 percent.    The association is confident that the positive effects of  trade and cooperation on economic growth will increasingly  benefit also the weaker economies and will thus support the  reform process, the report says. This applies to the CIS  countries, even though in particular in Russia inflation had  declined by the end of 1993. Romaine and Bulgaria, for their  part, are orienting themselves toward market economy but do not  yet show any real success, the report says. Members of the OMV  are all leading German companies which conduct trade with  Eastern and Central Europe or produce goods there.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA press service: "The People With </F> the Weapons Should Not Go Hungry"]    [Text] Where are we to get money? This may be the most  acute issue at this time. Unfortunately, nobody has the  answer--neither the people's deputies, nor the Ministry of  Finance, nor the director of an enterprise that has been forced  to give one employee in three leave without pay.    Where are we to get money? They come with this question to  the commanders of military units--not just officers, but by now  also women with children. However, the commanders have nothing  to say in response, to say nothing of accommodating them.    Where are we to get money? Our readers bring up this  question  in almost all their letters to the editor. If NARODNA ARMIYA  knew the answer or could show the way out of this difficult  situation, it would have done so long ago. However, what are we  to say, esteemed reader, if the supreme officials of the country  are not in a position to say something specific in response to  the "question of questions...." Therefore, we will only paint  the picture that has now emerged with regard to the provision of  funding for the Ministry of Defense. We hope that you will  understand the situation.    Toward the end of December of last year, the minister of  defense of Ukraine, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, wrote  yet another letter to Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, the acting prime  minister of Ukraine. The letter said that "the 472.0 billion  karbovantsy allocated as of 27 December made it possible only to  issue pay and allowances to servicemen for November and, in  part, December. An emergency situation is developing in  sustaining the routine activities of the troops. The absence of  financing makes it impossible to settle with energy suppliers  for electricity, heat, and gas used. As a result, the supply of  electricity, heat, and gas to military settlements has been  turned off (Kotovsk, Desna, Sevastopol, Kharkov, Pervomaysk...)."    An endorsement by Yukhym Leonidovych appeared on this  letter,  owing to which 200 billion karbovantsy were allocated for  foodstuffs and 140 billion karbovantsy for wages. (Incidentally,  the Ministry of Defense was supposed to get them in early  December.) However, the minister of defense had sought 700  billion karbovantsy to overcome the crisis situation. This was  the minimum, he said. This was by no means satisfactory, and as  early as 5 January, Major General Ivan Shtopenko, chief of the  financial directorate of the Ministry of Defense, wrote a  memorandum for the minister of defense recalling that "a  critical situation has developed with regard to funding priority  payments. Repeated appeals by enterprise directors, army  collectives, people's deputies, and trade union organizations  addressed to government organs with regard to the emergent  situation have been forwarded to the Ministry of Defense,  instead of being considered and instead of practical measures  being taken. The requirements to meet the priority needs of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine for January of this year come to 1.313  trillion karbovantsy, of which 743 billion karbovantsy is for  pay and allowances for servicemen.... Besides, it is necessary  to pay back the arrears of 720 billion karbovantsy for 1993."  [The above quote is rendered in Russian in the original]    How is the military department provided for following the  many appeals to the supreme officials of the country? We find  the answer in a letter from Major General Ivan Shtopenko and  Major General V. Krokhin, chief of the directorate of foodstuffs  supply of the logistical headquarters of the Armed Forces, to  Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Valeriy Shmakov: "As of 21  January 1994 the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine received funding  in the amount of 25.0 billion karbovantsy, which comes to 1.0  percent of the needs for January of this year.... Military  collectives and the families of servicemen are finding  themselves on the brink of ruin."    What can we add to this....    Major General Ivan Shtopenko said in a conversation with a  NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent: "Letters are just what they are,  but you cannot help matters just with letters. The minister of  defense begins virtually every day by visiting either the  Cabinet of Ministers or the Ministry of Finance. We use every  opportunity to get yet another portion of funds."    Incidentally, Ivan Ivanovych himself sets out for the same  addresses every morning. When a NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent was  talking to him in his own office, the Ministry of Finance  called. At the other end of the line they joked: "We have  already allocated a room for you here...."    You may have grown tired of reading excerpts from official  documents. However, we deliberately cite them so that you will  first better understand the state of affairs and second, so that  nobody will get the impression that the military department  headed by General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy is  sitting on its hands. This is why we offer yet another letter,  this time to President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk, which was  signed by the minister of defense. "I report that the Ministry  of Defense of Ukraine submitted, at the appointed time,  substantiated calculations of the minimum need for monetary  funds in 1994 in the amount of 63.7 trillion karbovantsy to the  Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the Commission for Issues of  Defense and State Security of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.  The above notwithstanding, the Ministry of Finance, without  coordinating this with the Ministry of Defense and without  grounds, included the limit of outlays of the Armed Forces of  Ukraine in the amount of 14.7 trillion karbovantsy in the draft  1994 State Budget, which comes to only 23 percent of real  needs." The letter goes on to say that the proposed amount "will  make it possible to ensure only the issuance of pay and  allowances to servicemen, wages to the personnel, payments for  foodstuffs, clothing, and related gear (10.9 trillion  karbovantsy), which comes to 74 percent of the envisioned quota,  and what remains (3.8 trillion karbovantsy) does not even cover  outlays to meet the vital needs of the Armed Forces (fuel and  lubricants, municipal utilities, and so on). With this budget  the Ministry of Defense will not be able to sustain the program  to maintain the combat readiness of weapons and military  materiel and lay the foundation for the programs of development  of promising weapons and military materiel models."    The minister of defense sent this letter to the president on  the eve of consideration of the 1994 budget. (Similar letters  were also sent to the chairman of the Supreme Council, the  acting prime minister, the chairman of the Supreme Council  Commission for Issues of Defense and State Security, the  minister of finance, and others). Certain things were factored  in, but....    The chief of the financial directorate of the Ministry of  Defense reported to General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy  Radetskyy: "In keeping with the 1994 budget approved by the  Supreme Council of Ukraine and the calculations of the Ministry  of Finance, in January 1.6 trillion karbovantsy should be  transferred to the Ministry of Defense in January, and 1.2  trillion karbovantsy in February. Actually, 169.3 billion  karbovantsy were received in January and 99.0 billion  karbovantsy in February, or just 9.6 percent of the amounts due  which were approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine to fund  the troops...." [Above quote is rendered in Russian in the  original]    This is the way it is....    What is the way out? The chief of the financial directorate  of the Ministry of Defense believes that the issue of financing  for the Armed Forces of Ukraine should be raised promptly at an  extraordinary meeting of the Defense Council of Ukraine. Do they  really fail to understand there that the people with the weapons  should not go hungry?...    Let us believe that this will be beneficial. However, it is  impossible to overlook the main point: Life will not improve  until the economy begins to work and a strict financial and  credit system is established. Therefore, nobody will give us an  answer to the question about "where we are to get money"  tomorrow morning. Let us look the truth in the eye: Things are  not going to get better in the immediate future, including pay  and allowances for servicemen. We have to be prepared for that  and not expect new "presents" from life.    Unfortunately, we are not finishing these notes on an  optimistic note. One cannot spread butter on bread with lines  from quoted documents or buy apples for children with them. We  will repeat that there is just one thing we want: We should  demonstrate understanding for all this and not resort to extreme  measures, as some are proposing.</p>

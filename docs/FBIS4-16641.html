			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev supports the  idea of uniting the CIS armed forces. He believes that this  question may be discussed at the end of the year.    He told Interfax that after the creation of joint armed  forces one could then talk about the formation of a CIS defense  union. "This is something far more significant than the  collective security agreement," he said.    He noted that the military tackle not only tactical but also  strategic problems. "Our strategic future lies in a joint armed  forces and a defense union," said Grachev.</p>

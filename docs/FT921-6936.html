			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: Murdoch takes command as Fox chairman resigns MR RUPERT MURDOCH is to assume direct management responsibility for Fox, the Hollywood studio and television network, following the resignation of Mr Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive since 1984. The resignation, which Mr Diller yesterday insisted was amicable, still caught the US entertainment industry by surprise. Mr Diller, 50, one of the leading executives in Hollywood, has successfully built the Fox Television Network, the fourth US national network and one that boasts hits such as The Simpsons. He has also created Fox Broadcasting, which delivers five nights of prime-time programming to 131 US television stations. Several entertainment industry insiders yesterday expressed scepticism about whether Mr Murdoch - whose News Corporation interests include newspapers, magazines and publishing as well as film and television - would actu-ally assume a hands-on role at Fox. Although Mr Murdoch has made Los Angeles one of his main residences, running a Hollywood studio is considered by Wall Street analysts an unlikely role for the Australian-born tycoon. Although Mr Diller said he and Mr Murdoch had no disagreements, the departing chairman did say he had told Mr Murdoch of his desire to own an equity stake in Fox. This was not possible, Mr Diller said, since Fox is wholly-owned by News Corporation. Mr Diller said yesterday he had yearned 'to have my own company in whatever shape or size I am comfortable or capable of creating or acquiring'. He said he had held no direct talks about a future activity, but termed his decision to resign 'a positive move'. Speculation on Wall Street centred on whether Mr Diller might seek to put together a company to make a bid to acquire NBC Television from General Electric. Another possibility raised by analysts was that Mr Diller might join forces with Mr David Geffen, the record and film industry mogul, to launch a new venture. Mr Diller described this as speculation, but added: 'David Geffen is my friend. Who knows?' News Corporation does not provide detailed figures for Fox, but the group's last results showed ADollars 124.38m (USDollars 93.5m) of operating income from television and ADollars 67.7m from filmed entertainment divisions, in the six-month period to December 31. Twentieth Century Fox, the film studio, is expected by analysts to earn operating income of around USDollars 150m in the financial year to June 30, while forecasts for Fox TV stations call for operating income of around USDollars 160m in the same period. The Fox Broadcasting division is expected to earn between USDollars 40m and USDollars 50m in the financial year to June.</p>

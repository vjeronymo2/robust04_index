			<p>BFN     [Text] At today's news conference in Paris, French Foreign  Minister Alain Juppe announced that Slovenia will be the only  country from the former Yugoslavia at the Conference on  Stability in Europe that will be given the status of a potential  EU member. As REUTER reports, a decision about Slovenia's  participation at this conference was made at the last moment, as  our country was not on the list of nine invited central and  Eastern European countries last week.    The French decision about this was also supported by  Germany.  It is known that our country, as opposed to Poland, the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Lituania,  Latvia, and Estonia, has not signed the associate EU membership  agreement yet.</p>

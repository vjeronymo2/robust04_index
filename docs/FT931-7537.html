			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council contracts out its exchequer THE LONDON Borough of Bromley is to contract out most of its exchequer department in the largest out-sourcing contract signed for local government financial services. The contract has been won by Capita Managed Services, a subsidiary of the fast-growing Capita Group. The value of the contract is Pounds 24m over five years, four times larger than the previous largest contract for such services. It is expected to save the council Pounds 1m, according to Mr David Bartlett, Bromley's borough treasurer. The 170 staff will be transferred to Capita on their existing terms and conditions. The company plans to set up a centre in Bromley to provide services to public-sector organisations throughout the south-east, including councils, NHS trust hospitals and grant-maintained schools. Capita will take over the collection of council tax and national non-domestic rates. There will be performance-related payments if it meets targets for revenue collection. The contract also covers the payment of salaries to the council's 10,000 workforce and the administration of pensions. Other financial services in the package include the payment of councillors' allowances. Payment of housing benefit and council tax benefit will also be administered. Capita is the only out-sourcing company to have taken over the payment of these benefits. The first such contract was won in East Cambridgeshire last spring. Three companies were shortlisted for the contract secured by Capita, and all presented their plans to the workforce. Capita won the greatest backing in a ballot of staff, 98 per cent of whom endorsed the decision to contract out. Mr Bartlett said: 'This move will help us to protect the position of our employees, whose work is shrinking as schools opt out and we contract out other functions. If they are in the private sector, they can bid for other contracts in the very large public and private sector market for these services. 'It also fits with our strategy of turning Bromley into an enabling authority. By contracting out work such as financial services, we can provide a more cost-effective service for residents.'</p>

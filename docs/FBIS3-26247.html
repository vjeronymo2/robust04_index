			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Zhou Guangzhao, president of the </F> Chinese Academy of Sciences, at Beijing Airport on 23 January;  from the "Report on Current Events" program; passages within  quotations are recorded]    [Text] Led by Zhou Guangzhao, president of the Chinese  Academy of Sciences [CAS], the delegation of scientific and  technological experts from Mainland China returned to Beijing on  23 January from Taipei via Hong Kong. Interviewed at Beijing  Airport, Zhou Guangzhao said that the scientific and  technological circles on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should  further learn from each other's strong points to supplement  their shortcomings in order to develop both sides' science,  technology, and economies.    [Zhou Guangzhau] "The delegation that visited Taiwan this  time consisted of 25 members, including eight CAS academicians."    Zhou Guangzhao said: The 25 members of the delegation,  including experts from CAS, relevant universities, the General  Iron and Steel Research Institute of the Ministry of  Metallurgical Industry, and the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation, as well as experts from a few domestic  iron and steel corporations who are in charge of technology,  took part in the conference on science, technology, and industry  of both sides for 1994. At the conference, experts from both  sides delivered many reports on iron and steel and materials and  exchanged information in this area, touching especially on the  prospects for cooperation in the field of rare earths.    Zhou Guangzhao said: Scientific and technological experts  from mainland China attended the conference at the invitation of  Taiwan's Institute of Industrial Technology and iron and steel  companies; they were warmly welcomed as compatriots by their  counterparts in Taiwan; while in Taiwan, they visited the Taiwan  Central Research Institute, the Taiwan Institute of Industrial  Technology, the Iron and Steel Corporation in Gaoxiong, Taiwan's  Qinghua University, Jiaotong University, the Xinzhu  Science-Based Industrial Park, and the Palace Museum of Taiwan.    Zhou Guangzhao noted: Mainland China's iron and steel output  has topped 80 million metric tons, and further efforts will be  made to expand production. In addition to expanding the output  quantitatively, efforts will also be made to promote development  qualitatively.    He said: There has been notable development in Taiwan's iron  and steel industry in recent years. Although the island's steel  output is much lower than ours, their technology is more  advanced. To bring about a massive development of the iron and  steel industry in Mainland China in the future, we can invite  Taiwan counterparts to participate in certain forms of  cooperation, including cooperation in learning from the  automated management system for the iron and steel industry  developed by Taiwan.    [Zhou]: "I think scientific and technological personnel from  both sides are very enthusiastic about strengthening  cross-strait scientific and technological cooperation."    Zhou Guangzhou, president of CAS, said: Scientific and  technological personnel from both sides of the strait are every  enthusiastic about strengthening cross-strait scientific and  technological cooperation. The Taiwan counterparts we have met  have demonstrated great interest in expanding cross-strait  cooperation. There are many problems in scientific and  technological cooperation, however, that require further  improvement. For example, we are all Chinese, and we all hope  for the peaceful reunification of China. However, at present  there is no direct air service. Actually, the flight time from  Beijing to Taipei is less than two hours, but to go to Taipei,  one must go through Hong Kong. Wang Fosong, vice president of  CAS, had planned to go to Taiwan, but he was unable to go  because of his status. Many people in Taiwan have expressed  their dissatisfaction with this. I believe many obstacles will  be overcome in the days to come.    Zhou Guangzhao: First, we hope science and technology  circles on both sides will strengthen cooperation and exchange  in the area of personnel and information. In the future, both  sides should cooperate in earnest. On the one hand they should  cooperate in transforming scientific and technological  achievements into productive forces and expanding the production  of rare earths in China, which occupies an advantageous position  in the world's rare earth resources. This is because Taiwan  needs rare earth materials in developing its high technology.  Taiwan can join us in making further studies on investing in  the establishment of a rare earth joint venture enterprise. At  present, science and technology circles of Mainland China and  Taiwan are conducting further consultations on relevant projects  for this year. Responsible persons from the Taiwan Institute of  Industrial Technology will soon visit the mainland. It is  expected that some agreements on cooperation projects may be  concluded by the mainland and Taiwan.    [Zhou]: "I had always wanted to visit Taiwan. I had also  heard many stories from people who have visited Taiwan, but to  go there in person is different from hearing from other people.  I really felt as if we were one family. I felt the cordiality  and the warmth. They gave us a warm reception."    In conclusion, Zhou Guangzhao stressed: Through this visit  to Taiwan we have gained some personal experience. Taiwan's  science and technology circles have overcome difficulties,  welcomed their counterparts from the mainland without a hitch,  and successfully convened this beneficial conference. With  actual deeds, they have expressed their strong desire to push  for closer scientific and technological cooperation between both  sides. Taiwan has made great progress in developing high  technology, especially in the area of computers and  microelectronic chips. Their methods of introducing new  technologies, making use of them, and assimilating them are  worth emulating by the mainland. Both the mainland and Taiwan  have their strong points in developing science and technology.  We should strengthen cooperation in this area.</p>

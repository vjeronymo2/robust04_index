			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kandryshev: "`Ruslans' for Grachev"] </F>   [Text] During a recent visit to the Aviastar Aircraft  Construction Plant in Ulyanovsk, admiring the An-124 Ruslan  heavy air transports in the assembly shop, Minister of Defense  P. Grachev asked the generals escorting him: "How many of these  aircraft do we need?"    The generals did not think long: "100."    Of course, being used to the principle of "ask for more,  they  will give you less," the generals overstated the number.    Nevertheless, P. Grachev promised the Ulyanovsk aircraft  builders to order a dozen Ruslans for the quick response  forces. But for an enterprise that is experiencing  difficulties today marketing the Ruslan, even such a  compartively small order would be a blessing.    In this regard, it is appropriate to recall that the An-124  aircraft was created specifically for quick-response operations  of a global nature for timely airlifting of heavy armament.  Incidentally, when the Ruslan was being developed and put into  production, the Afghan campaign was in full swing, and D.  Ustinov, the minister of defense at that time, is considered the  "godfather" of this aircraft.    Only the events of recent years, the temporary refusal of  the  Ministry of Defense--the sole customer--to purchase An-124  aircraft made it possible to create the civilian Volga-Dnieper  Air Transport Company, which operates aircraft with the largest  carrying capacity and which gained world notoriety by  transporting unique cargo on Ruslan aircraft.    Grachev's plan to order An-124 transport aircraft for quick  response not only confirms the thoughts expressed by I.  Serebryakov in the article "Russia's Military Doctrine"  (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, No 8, 1994) but also expands them in that  the Ministry of Defense, possibly, is going the way of creating  quick response forces of unspecified, but apparently sizable,  numerical strength.    As we know, the missions of quick response forces are  basically punitive in nature, unlike deterrence forces.    But since use of quick response forces outside the CIS is  fraught with a corresponding reaction by public opinion both  within and outside Russia, as well as other consequences, it is  natural to ask: Why are quick response forces being created that  are equipped with heavy armament, for the airlift of which the  Ministry of Defense plans to order the mighty Ruslans?</p>

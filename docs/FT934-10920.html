			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: IDs: don't leave home without one Sir, Liberty, the civil liberties group, is correct to suggest that personal identification cards could be used to discriminate against certain sections of society - those engaged in mischief. ('Plans for ID cards attacked,' October 25). For nine years I have lived as a British expatriate in societies which have required me to carry their own identification papers. Magic] ID cards ensure a swift passage through immigration; facilitate bank transactions; produce registered mail from behind Post Office counters; smooth (as far as is possible) relationships with the tax man; and even provide proof of ownership for the dog's own, health-related, ID card. IDs offer evidence of legal entry and authorised residence, and satisfy policemen who use spot checks to 'discriminate' against criminals, drug traffickers and illegal immigrants. Resent my ID card? No. I wouldn't leave home without it. Barbara Green, Buzon 162, Mijas-la-Nueva, Mijas 29650, Malaga, Spain</p>

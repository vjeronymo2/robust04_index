			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Hiroshima May 26 TASS -- "Even the most thorough  international inspection of North Korean atomic facilities,  carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),  will [not] be able to decide for sure whether North Korea is  developing nuclear weapons or not," a Russian armaments expert,  who wanted to remain anonymous, told ITAR-TASS. The expert is  now attending the U.N. disarmament conference in Hiroshima.    He explained his point of view by the specifics of the  nuclear technology used by North Korea. Even if IAEA inspectors  get access to the nuclear wastes and to the rods of the reactors  supposedly used for the development of atomic weapons, even if  they get a chance to analyse these materials, they will not be  able to decide for sure whether Pyongyang is developing a  nuclear bomb or not," the expert stated. In his opinion, this  explains North Korea's stand on the inspection of its nuclear  facilities. "If North Korea allows the IAEA to carry out a  thorough inspection," he said, "this will only increase  suspicions that Pyongyang is hiding something from the  international community, because IAEA experts will not be able  to arrive at any definite conclusion."    The Russian expert believes that suspicions about North  Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons could be fully  dispelled or, on the contrary, confirmed only if a  representative international team of experts would carry out a  lasting and broad examination of North Korean nuclear  facilities, tantamount to permanent control over them, which  should continue for several months. "The several days, during  which a IAEA inspection will last, cannot resolve the problem of  North Korea's nuclear programme," he noted.    Stressing that this was merely his personal opinion, the  expert said that he doubted very much the existence of nuclear  weapons in North Korea today. "This is why it is necessary to  continue the efforts to solve this problem through a dialogue  with Pyongyang, and not by means of punitive sanctions against  the Korean People's Democratic Republic," he stated.</p>

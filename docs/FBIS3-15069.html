			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has  told Interfax, the leader of Bosnian Serbs Radovan Karadzic who  Tuesday met in Moscow with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, has welcomed the initiative by Russian President Boris  Yeltsin on holding in Moscow a summit meeting (4+1 -- Interfax)  to reach as early as possible an understanding on peace,  comprehensive settlement of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the lifting of sanctions from the new Yugoslavia.    Answering the wish by the Russian president, Karadzic said  that during the preparation for the meeting Bosnian Serbs will  show a maximum of contructiveness, with due account of the  quality criteria for the territorial delineation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Karadzic voiced gratitude for the decisive actions of the  Russian president for the political settlement of the crisis  around Sarajevo.    Kozyrev and Karadzic have said that arrival of a Russian  peace- keeping contingent in Sarajevo, the strict performance of  its duty as part of the UN Protection Force are a weighty and  stabilizing contribution creating prerequisites for further  progress in normalising the situation in the city and around it.    Karadzic said that the Bosnian Serbs agree to the opening of  an airport in the city of Tuzla that will welcome deliveries of  humanitarian cargoes. Bosnian Serbs proceed from the fact that  Russian observers will take an active part in the control over  the non-military use of the airport. This goes in line with the  desire of the envoy of the UN Secretary General on the former  Yugoslavia.    For its part, the Russian side said about preparedness to  send its observers to Tuzla. [sentence as received]    During the discussion of the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the Russian side pointed to the need to show the maximal  restraint and cooperation with the UN Protection Force. This  was welcomed by Karadzic and other leaders of the Bosnian Serbs.  <H5>  "NATO ACTION NO ACCIDENT," RUSSIAN DEFENSE OFFICIAL SAYS </H5>   The shooting down of four, presumably Serbian, planes by  NATO  air force was "no accident," a senior official in the Russian  Defense Ministry told Interfax.    He said that "the Americans who have long since sided with  the Muslims always wanted to put pressure to bear on Bosnian  Serbs. The UN 'no-flight zone' resolution was passed more than  a year ago but never applied until now even though it had been  repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croatians."    The official said that the NATO action in which USAF jets  were involved was directed less against Bosnian Serbs than  against Russia which had scored significant successes "along the  Yugoslav line." He believed that "the noise over the Ames' case  was consistent with the action in Bosnia. Americans do whatever  they want and behave as if they won the cold war."    On the other hand, he did not want to make the U.S. more  guilty than it was. "There was no evil design in letting the  planes drop their bombs before shooting them down. In  Bosnia-Herzegovina where the positions of the warring parties  tend to 'intertwine' it takes just minutes from the take off to  the start of bombing," he said.</p>

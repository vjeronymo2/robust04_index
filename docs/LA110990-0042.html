			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUERS SUED  </P> <P> In response to "Some Hero's Welcome: Rescuer Sued" (Metro, Nov. 2):  </P> <P> The article about the rescuers being sued by the person they rescued is quite  upsetting but typical of today's sue-happy mentality.  </P> <P> Here we have two men, one a Los Angeles police officer, Loran Dale Turner, and  one an average citizen, Jim Campbell, who stop, put their lives in jeopardy by  being on foot on the San Diego Freeway with the danger of being struck by an  oblivious driver, and by being in a pool of gas gushing from the victims'  overturned car with the danger of an eminent fiery explosion.  </P> <P> These were two men rising to the challenge who could have just as easily called  the Fire Department or ignored the situation altogether. And what happens: They  get sued because one of the persons whom they dragged from the car was struck  by that oblivious driver while they were dragging out others.  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that the 17-year-old was injured in the second collision, but  had the officer and good Samaritan not removed her from the car, she would have  gone up in the fireball of that inevitable crash. And to suggest a flare  pattern first before rescuing, or a flare pattern at all with all that gas, is  naive at best. Please keep publicizing names of plaintiffs' attorneys. It makes  the public aware of who is really behind such despicable suits.  </P> <P> The girl would do better to send a thank you note than a summons.  </P> <P> RANDY POST  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Lifeboat overturns The Hartlepool lifeboat overturned twice in violent seas as it stood by an empty oil tanker from which all but a skeleton crew had been airlifted after it ran aground off Redcar, Teesside. A crewman was swept away from the self-righting lifeboat and rescued by an RAF helicopter. The remaining crew of six returned the boat to port.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  on tax affairs is poised to offer several options on how to  finance income tax cuts beyond next year, sources close to the  panel said Monday [4 April]. These options include a rise in  the consumption tax rate, a new tax on returns from gambling and  a cut in tax-free corporate reserves set aside for bad loans,  they said.    These tax increase proposals will be detailed in a report to  be presented by the Tax Commission to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa by the end of June, they said.    In an interim report submitted last November, the Tax  Commission proposed raising the consumption tax rate, but  stopped short of making a proposal on how much.    The sources said the final report may offer three proposals  on the size of the tax rate increase -- "big," "medium," and  "small."    The issue of how to finance income tax cuts and how to  reform  the tax system in the face of the aging of Japan's population  have been in the spotlight for months as Hosokawa failed to sell  a plan to introduce a new welfare tax.</p>

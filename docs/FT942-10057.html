			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Two face fraud charges after Belling collapse Two men linked to the loss of Pounds 2.3m from the pension fund of Belling, the cooker manufacturer which collapsed two years ago, were yesterday charged with defrauding or attempting to defraud companies and private individuals in the UK and abroad of more than Pounds 20m. The charges follow a 15-month joint investigation by the Staffordshire police and the Serious Fraud Office into an advance fee fraud which is thought to cover the US and Europe. Mr Charles Deacon, a solicitor from Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Mr Keith Fuller, a business consultant, were charged with 16 and eight counts of fraud and attempt to defraud respectively. The charges date from 1986 to 1992 and range from claims as small as Pounds 100,000 to allegations that Mr Deacon and Mr Fuller conspired to obtain Dollars 5m from a Finnish food producer. The case was transferred to the Nottingham Crown Court.</p>

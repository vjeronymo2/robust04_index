			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yasar Rizvi: "Need To Stop Foreign Cultural </F> Invasion"]    [Text] The Pakistani people, showing their full faith in  the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] in a huge majority, have given  this party its third opportunity in the nation's history to form  a government. After taking over the government, it is its  responsibility to make good on its election promises and focus  on changing the condition of the people. It is a welcome  development that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued an  ordinance to fulfill her election promises. Pakistan is an  Islamic nation. It was established on the Islamic principle. In  addition to protecting the nation's physical boundaries, it is  the foremost duty of the government to protect its ideological  boundaries. A country that is ideologically weak suffers from  internal strife; an example is the recent division in the Soviet  Union. In contrast, an ideologically strong nation can overcome  all difficult and testing problems. The latest example of this  is Afghanistan, which defeated a superpower and is busy building  a new country. After Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan, Pakistan is  the strongest fort of Islam. All those satanic forces that want  to hurt Muslims are focusing their ugly eyes on Pakistan. In  these modern times, any country can be weakened without any  military action by weakening it on the inside. Therefore, the  easiest system for it is to affect any country's ideological  perspective in the name of culture. This way, one can bring  about a revolution according to their wishes. In Pakistan, under  this cultural campaign, and in the name of cultural heritage,  innocent minds are being made prey. The electronic media is  airing programs which are opposed to our Islamic and cultural  beliefs. These are nothing more than meaningless noise. They are  using inconceivable language, strange clothing, jiggling bodies,  and trying to put these ideas in the minds of the people, as if  this is our culture. All this is done by the  government-controlled electronic media. The hand that holds the  pen and the mind that represents purity are both being eroded by  shameless and wayward behavior. If we do not stop this spreading  flood, then it will drown our traditional and cultural pride.  This country was not made easily, and we will not let it become  a victim of foreign conspiracies. It was not established by the  sacrifices of some joker. The devout blood of innumerable young  men was shed on this land. Its progress is the result of the  hard work of thousands of young people. That is how the dawn of  independence emerged finally to give light to the lightless  eyes. We request of the federal cultural minister that he stop  the spread of this flood with his wisdom and strategy. We hope  that he will take some action immediately and will keep his  promise.</p>

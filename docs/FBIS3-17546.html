According to Petrov, the United States was still waiting to  meet its pledges under the Russian-US-Ukrainian memorandum which  was signed early this year, during President Clinton's visit to  Moscow. The United States pledged to foot bills for the  production of nuclear fuel in Russia whereas Russia pledged to  deliver the fuel to Ukraine.    The absence of the promised money could put off the delivery  of fuel to Ukraine. The transfer of the nuclear ammunition from  Ukraine to Russia, where it is to be turned into fuel, would  take fairly long.    Earlier this week Ukrainian officials, including Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  indicated that Kiev could reconsider the schedule of the  transfer of the nuclear ammunition to Russia if Moscow failed to  deliver fuel to the Ukrainian power plants.    In Petrov's view, procrastination, on the part of the United  States, could provoke a new crisis in Russian-Ukrainian  relations.    The United States would meet its pledges. So would Russia.  But it remained unclear, said Petrov, why Kiev was apt to offer  highly emotional response to purely technical problems.</p>

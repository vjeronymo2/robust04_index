			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SAYS HE WAS BAPTIZED, CALLS IT NORMAL  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that he had been baptized  as a boy and considers that "quite normal."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, 58, who has said before that his mother is a devout Christian, a  member of the Russian Orthodox Church, was asked at a press conference here  whether he, as a result, had been christened.  </P> <P> "Yes, I was baptized," he replied. "I was christened, and I think this is quite  normal." He did not elaborate.  </P> <P> His wife, Raisa, said later that she, too, had been christened.  </P> <P> "We were born in the 1930s," she said, "and baptism was normal in our families  at that time."  </P> <P> But their own children, a son and a daughter who are now in their mid-30s, were  not christened, the Soviet First Lady added.  </P> <P> "They belong to a different era . . . ," she said.  </P> <P> Raisa Gorbachev, a former instructor of Marxist-Leninist theory, has said  before that she is a firm atheist but that she respects religious beliefs.  </P></p>

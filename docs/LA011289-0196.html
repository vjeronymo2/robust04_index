			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> SWING TUNES GREAT BUT NOT THE RENDITIONS  </P> <P> The most appropriate theme for the Big Band Classic concert at Ambassador  Auditorium in Pasadena last week would have been "I've Heard That Song Before."  </P> <P> While none of the 21 performers on the bill, which will be repeated Friday in  Irvine, actually performed the tune, the audience that packed the theater no  doubt could say those very words about every other tune offered during the 2  1/2-hour tribute.  </P> <P> The third in the Big Band Era series, this concert's purpose was to rehash the  white swing music of the late '30s and early '40s.  </P> <P> Those applauding wildly the efforts of the Harry James Orchestra (a ghost band  whose leader died in 1984) and singers Connie Haines, Art Lund and the Lancers,  were, for the most part, cheering nostalgia. While the concert promised the  best of James, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, the Pied Pipers, et al, what was  forgotten was the quality that made those names musical institutions.  </P> <P> The Pied Pipers, for instance, wouldn't have survived a single night had their  singing been as out of tune as the Lancers' was.  </P> <P> While the James aggregate -- populated, oddly, with youngsters whose parents  were probably too young to remember much about the Big Band Era -- performed  capably, albeit with not much spirit, Haines and Lund seemed oddly out of  place.  </P> <P> Lund, whose seven-tune set included a few megahits ("My Blue Heaven,"  "Mam'selle"), has lost most of his once-rich baritone voice. But his segment  was unpretentious and pleasant enough.  </P> <P> Haines, on the other hand, wallowed in embarrassing self-aggrandizement as she  flitted about the stage coarsely whispering some of her hits ("You Made Me Love  You," "Swing Time Up in Harlem"). Her voice, too, has suffered the ravages of  time.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that these shows tend to take on a sideshow appearance, the  saddest thing is that the life left in the era's repertoire is not explored.  The songs deserve playing, not a mere rehashing that will turn them into museum  pieces.  </P> <P>  Connie Haines, Art Lund &amp; the Lancers join the Harry James Orchestra in  songs by Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman and Harry James on Friday at 8 p.m. at the  South Coast Community Church, 5120 Bonita Canyon Road, Irvine. Tickets: $10 to  $12; information: (714) 856-5000.  </P> <P> </P></p>

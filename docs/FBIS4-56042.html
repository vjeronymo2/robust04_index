			<p>BFN     [Text] The Croatian Parliament's Chamber of Counties has  resumed its work. It is debating a draft law on income  taxation. The House of Counties is also expected to discuss the  remaining nine points on its agenda today. Opposition deputies  are not taking part in today's session, which is scheduled to  begin at 1300. The interparty consultations are expected to  begin at 1130. We have learned unofficially from Deputy Ivan  Matija that the opposition will suggest to the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community] at these consultations that a parliament  inquiry should be launched into a letter allegedly sent to the  U.S. Congress by Mesic and Manolic.</p>

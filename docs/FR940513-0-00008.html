			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that the proposed regulations would result in a regulatory burden and that while some improvement in clarity and flexibility is offered, the benefits do not appear commensurate with the time and cost of implementing the changes. The commenter also stated that conflicts of interest have not been improperly or inadequately handled and that there is no reason to believe the proposed changes will provide any significant improvement in avoiding, handling, or reporting conflict-of-interest situations where an institution has been complying with the present regulations. According to the commenter, the proposed regulations would require substantial effort to revamp policies and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA Board has not undertaken this revision of the standards-of-conduct regulations because of improper or inadequate handling or reporting of conflicts of interest. Rather, as noted earlier, the revision is intended to update the regulations to reflect statutory changes and a change in the focus of the FCA's regulatory oversight of personnel matters, as well as to respond to section 514 of the 1992 Act. While the FCA recognizes that the revamping of policies and procedures requires substantial effort, the final regulations attempt to minimize any burden by providing a delayed effective date. Also, the FCA has adjusted the proposed regulations in response to comments where it was possible to achieve its objectives by less burdensome means. The final regulations place more responsibility on the institutions and their officers and directors for identifying possible sources of conflict and developing adequate controls, but also offer more flexibility for developing procedures that effectively address significant conflicts without imposing burdensome requirements that are ineffective in preventing conflicts of interest. While this will initially require more work, the FCA believes that it is a more effective approach to conflicts of interest and that it more appropriately reflects the focus of the responsibility for preventing conflicts of interest and the role of the FCA as regulator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter supported four of the primary FCA policy objectives, namely: (1) Enhancing each association's accountability for sound standards-of-conduct programs; (2) maintaining high standards of conduct to ensure the proper performance of System business; (3) holding directors and employees to the same standard where the potential for conflict is the same; and (4) establishing that the internal corporate matters of devotion of time to official duties, political activity, nepotism, exchange of gifts, and improper use of official property are best left to each institution's board of directors to oversee through the implementation of a standards-of-conduct policy. However, the commenter disagreed with the proposed strict prohibition of a director purchasing property acquired by the institution through foreclosure. The Board's response to this comment is addressed in detail later in the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following narrative summarizes the comments received on the various sections of the regulations during the comment period, in response to the Regulatory Burden Notice, and as a followup to the Dallas meeting, and provides the Board's response to those comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 612.2130_Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While no comments were received regarding the proposed changes to this section, the FCC provided comments on the definitions in the existing regulations for ``controlled entity'' and ``officer'' and requested the FCA to define the terms ``financially obligated'' and ``business proprietor'' to clarify how the prohibitions in proposed &sect;&sect;612.2140(g) and 612.2150(h) are intended to interface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC recommended changing the definition of ``controlled entity'' to one similar to that used in the attribution rules of the lending limit regulations. See 12 CFR 614.4358(a)(3). Specifically, this would increase the 5-percent threshold for control in existing regulations to a 50-percent threshold. The FCC believes that 5-percent ownership is a very stringent and perhaps unrealistic test of control, and that the term ``controlling influence,'' without a higher threshold is perhaps too vague to be meaningful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board does not believe that the definition of control in the lending limit regulations is an appropriate definition for standards-of-conduct regulations. The purpose of the definition of control in the lending limit regulations is to identify when borrowers are so related that they should be regarded as a single credit risk. The purpose of the definition of control in the standards-of- conduct regulations is to identify when an interest is so significant that if an individual were to act on a matter concerning the related party, there would be an appearance of a conflict of interest. Consequently, the FCA believes that the control threshold for standards of conduct should be much lower than the control threshold for the purposes of lending limits. Control thresholds used in regulations directed at conflicts of interest are typically much lower. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires disclosure of certain transactions with the institution of individuals owning 5 percent or more of a class of the institution's stock. The Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision have similar requirements for institutions they regulate that are public companies required to register under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Comptroller imposes similar disclosure requirements on all national banks when they sell their securities, whether or not they are public companies. The phrase ``exercises a controlling influence'' is intended as a catch-all to capture those situations in which a person does not meet the objective control tests, but for some other reason has the power to control the management of the entity's policies. This term is a common component of control definitions and has long been a component of the part 612 definition of control without causing a particular problem. The definition is used to determine when a director or officer must recuse him or herself and in the reporting provisions, both of which are direct responsibilities of directors and employees. Such persons are likely to know when they are in a position to control management of the entity's policies, and, if in doubt, should err on the side of recusal and reporting. For the reasons stated above, no change has been made to the definition of ``controlled entity.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Waterloo Station project BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 20.85m design manage construct contract to refurbish a four-storey office building for British Rail at Waterloo Station. With the offices situated above the main entrance to one of London's busiest stations, the P&amp;0 company's project team faces the task of stripping out the interior and refurbishing the building through very restricted access, alongside a pedestrianised station concourse and a taxi cab access road. A continuous planning dialogue between British Rail and Bovis will ensure that minimal disruption is caused to the 250,000 commuters who pass beneath the building every day. The Bovis team has just 16 months to create three office suites, each providing about 60,000 sq ft of lettable office space. Whilst the majority of the floor area will be of an open plan design, at least 10 per cent will be cellularised. As well as the structural alterations and additions, Bovis will be managing the fitting out for British Rail tenants. These include British Transport Police, for whom a new police station is being created, and European Passenger Services, a subsidiary of British Rail. Internally, each building will feature raised floors, suspended ceilings, carpets and partitions. New services, including power, heat and air conditioning, will be installed within ceiling voids.</p>

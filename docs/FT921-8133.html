			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Bridging the lifecycle gap Companies are facing increasing demands to provide comprehensive information on the environmental impact of their products. But considerable sums could be wasted because the methods used to measure these impacts are so inadequate. The data are generated by a method called lifecycle analysis (LCA), which involves a laborious collection of information on the environmental impact of the product - from its manufacture through to its disposal. The Landbank Consultancy, an environmental advisory group, estimates that a simple inventory to compare the performance of, say, three types of packaging, would cost between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 25,000. More complex analysis could cost Pounds 120,000. Demands for lifecycle information are coming from two sources. First, the market for goods with a low environmental impact is growing as consumers, companies and governments call for 'green' products. Second, new regulations, such as the imminent Eco labelling scheme, will force companies to conduct LCAs if they wish to earn labels. Companies producing certain commodity products, such as glass and cardboard, could possibly spread the cost of LCAs by pooling their resources and financing the research through their trade associations. But this opportunity is only available to a few because lifecycle information is becoming competitive. This is especially true for end-products, such as those stocked by retailers, but it affects components too. Those companies which have products with low environmental impact and, more important, the data to back up their claims, are well placed to win market share. This is already happening in the chemicals industry because users are demanding the information to help them redesign their manufacturing processes. Procter &amp; Gamble, the household products company, has been one of the early pioneers of LCAs. It has used the information to reduce the impact of its products on the environment and to back up claims in its sales literature. David Hammond, P&amp;G's environment affairs manager, says the real value of the information lies in the way it is used. 'The competitiveness of LCAs is related to the subsequent ingenuity in reducing the environmental impact of the product,' he says. Martin Houldin of consultants KPMG says a distinction has to be drawn between the information produced by LCAs and the analysis done on the data. 'There is no reason why a lot of the raw data can't be shared, but the value of the information produced by LCAs is in the judgments made about impact,' he says. It is the need for such judgments - and the lack of standard guidelines on how to make them - that is causing headaches for those involved. A typical difficulty is how to weight a product's impact on the ozone layer against its contribution to global warming. 'There is no whizzo way of looking at all the impacts and then making a judgment,' says Houldin. Now two initiatives are under way to try to create consensus on what would constitute universally acceptable terms of judgment. The Confederation of British Industry is co-ordinating an effort to bring environmentalists, academics and business people together to develop independent evaluation techniques. Separately, companies such as Shell, Unilever, BASF, P&amp;G and Enichem are supporting the Society for the Promotion of Lifecycle Development. The society has been set up by industry to encourage debate on how to improve LCAs. Unless these initiatives lead to a way of balancing environmental judgments, companies will be short changed when paying for LCAs.</p>

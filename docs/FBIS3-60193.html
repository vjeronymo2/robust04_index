			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Jammu, Jan. 14 (UNI) -- The Central intelligence  agencies have been warned of possible strikes by  Pakistan-trained militants in New Delhi and Bombay following  reports that a number of them had infiltrated into India.    Intelligence sources here said interrogation of some top  militant leaders and foreign nationals nabbed by the security  forces revealed that the Pakistan ISI [Interservice  Intelligence] had decided to send in trained militants from the  coastal borders of Gujarat and the deserts of Rajasthan, instead  of the Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab borders. The ISI is trying  to send in armed men and weapons through these circuits in view  of heavy snow in the high mountain passes of the Kashmir Valley  which has made movement virtually impossible, they said.    The sources said the Kashmir militants and some Islamic  militant organisations in India had established a possible base  in Bombay where they were now trying to strike in order to  target the country's commercial capital. The recent arrest of a  large number of ISI men and other foreign nationals from various  part of the country including Bombay, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and  Rajasthan were clear indicators of the nexus between some  overground and underworld organisations and the armed  insurgents, they said.    The sources said the interrogation also revealed links  between the ISI and Kashmiri militants with the Kerala-based  banned Islamic Seva Sangh (ISS) and Islamic Student Sangh (ISS).  Various fundamentalist and Islamic organisations have been  actively supporting these anti-nationals who have established  links with the underworld dons in Bombay and outside India.    The sources said there was concentrated [as published]  effort  by the Pakistan Army to revive the nexus between the Punjab and  Kashmiri militants.    The militants were now adopting the new route of Sri  Ganganagar in Rajasthan and the Gujarat coast to smuggle in arms  and ammunition, the sources added.    Some Kashmiri woollen merchants who visit different parts of  the country during winter to sell their goods have been found  smuggling weapons, sophisticated wireless sets, books on  guerrilla warfare and other subversive material on their way  back to Kashmir.    The security forces and the State Police on their part have  set up inter-border check posts to check such acts.    According to the sources the peaceful resolution of the  Hazratbal [shrine] crisis had dealt a severe blow to the morale  of the militants. It had not intensified inter-gang clashes  among them but also made it difficult to re-group and chalk out  fresh strategies against the security forces. [sentence as  published]    Several top leaders of militant groups may have left the  Valley to safer hideouts in view of the increased pressure by  the security forces, they felt.    During the past one month, there has been a decline in  militant killings. The sources attributed this to the general  resentment against the militants with the local people now  readily coming forward with information about the hideouts of  militants.    The sources said recently a US House Committee report had  revealed that the ISI had established countrywide network and  was responsible for a series of bomb blasts in Delhi and Bombay  in 1992.    The sources expressed serious concern over information that  Nepal was being used by Kashmir, Islamic and Arab subversives to  hold meetings to chalk out strategies. An increasing number of  militants had fled to Nepal as the ISI is making a bid to  establish a "jehad [holy war] council" in the Valley consisting  of top 15 militant organisations.    There had also been an increase in drug-trafficking on the  Jammu border as the Army in Pakistan had launched a major  crackdown on drug lords in the Sindh and Balochistan Provinces.    An official report said terrorist outfits involved in drug  running have been increasingly using India as a transit point.    The report said terrorism and insurgency with all the talk  about "self-determination" and struggle for "independence" have  been used by the outlawed militants outfits to provide a  camouflage for smuggling of narcotics, bound for western  destinations through Delhi and Bombay.</p>

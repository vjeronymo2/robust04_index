			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ART BREATHES LIFE INTO 'CHRISTMAS MEMORY'  </P> <P> Love seen through a prism of nostalgic reverie creates the beauty of Truman  Capote's "A Christmas Memory." It's a wonderfully sentimental story that not  only basks in the essence of the season but reminds us of what an affecting  writer Capote could be, before the caricature of his personality obscured his  talents.  </P> <P> There's admiration in the Alternative Repertory Theatre's reading of "A  Christmas Memory," an appreciation of the written and spoken word that spirits  the imagination in all of us. It's this fondness that makes the experience at  the tiny playhouse so touching.  </P> <P> ART, a symbol of pluck on the Orange County theater scene if ever there was  one, has often been knocked for failing to vivify the usually difficult plays  it takes on, but that can't be applied here.  </P> <P> Under Joel Cotter's deft direction, Barbara Sorenson and Lee Clark personify  the simple humanity of Capote's story in pure ways.  </P> <P> Clark is Buddy (the 7-year-old Truman) and Sorenson is a cousin in her 60s.  Black sheep in a distracted, strait-laced family, they find joy and comfort  when together. Their love justifies each other, especially during Christmas as  they go about a fruitcake ritual, making then mailing them to presidents,  postmen, strangers -- anybody who has struck their fancy during the year.  </P> <P> Capote's language is dear, delicate and without a trace of cynicism as he  covers the mundane but illuminated events of the day. It's a tale for children  as well as adults: youngsters will enjoy the images of flying kites, ogre-like  moonshiners and small-frame Christmas glory; their parents will enjoy the  intimacy of the emotions.  </P> <P> Before "A Christmas Memory," the troupe offers readings from six other  holiday-oriented stories.  </P> <P> It's a welcome potpourri that veers from the arch sentimentality of O. Henry's  "Gift of the Magi" to "The Indian Giver," Steve Martin's parody of it. We also  hear from Dickens' ("Happy Happy Christmas"), Clement Clarke Moore (that old  chestnut "Visit From St. Nick"), Jonathan Winters ("The Snowman") and Jerry  Gordon (the finger-snapping beatnik ode, "A Tomato Colored Headband").  </P> <P> As with "A Christmas Memory," the actors (Amy Larson, Gary Christensen and  Clark) enliven the experience for us. You can feel good about this program, on  all levels.  </P> <P> Even the ticket price is appropriate -- your choice of toy donations for  children, non-perishable foods for the homeless or any spare cash you might  have to help out this always struggling theater.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A CHRISTMAS MEMORY'  </P> <P> An Alternative Repertory Theatre reading of the Truman Capote story and other  holiday tales. Directed by Joel Cotter. With Barbara Sorenson, Lee Clark, Amy  Larson and Gary Christensen. Lighting by David C. Palmer. Sound by Gary  Christensen.

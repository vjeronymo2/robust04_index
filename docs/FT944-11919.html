			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets The smallest of the world's emerging markets recorded the biggest gains in the nine months to the end of September, according to data compiled by Kleiman International, the US-based independent analysts. In local currency terms Egypt rose by 115 per cent since the start of the year and Ghana by 120 per cent. However, there was also clear evidence that among the more important and liquid markets, Latin America had staged a robust recovery from setbacks earlier in the year. Brazil's performance was boosted by what was seen as the successful introduction of the last stage in the economic reform process in July - the switch to a new currency, the real. Since then the Sao Paulo equity market has retreated, but analysts consider that it is now poised for a year-end rally. Salomon Brothers said this week that, along with Mexico, an improvement in the outlook for company earnings and a more promising political outlook should provide the incentive for a rise in prices. In contrast Salomon has lowered its asset allocation to Argentine equities on expectation of higher US interest rates, given that this market is the most vulnerable in the region to rate moves. The IFC has launched new stock indices for South Africa, available both in global and investable versions. The indices are composed of 63 stocks with a market capitalisation of some Dollars 139bn, or 62 per cent of the stock market's total capitalisation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------- EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                   Dollar terms                       No. of     Oct. 28     % Change     % Change                       stocks        1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America       (208)         738.85         +0.2        +13.6 Argentina            (25)         916.84         -2.3         -7.8 Brazil               (57)         426.02         +9.2        +83.1 Chile                (25)         835.47         -0.2        +51.4 Colombia 1           (11)         824.53         -3.6        +27.9 Mexico               (67)         918.35         -4.5         -8.7 Peru 2               (11)         193.60         +2.6        +60.1 Venezuela 3          (12)         549.70         +2.3         -7.1 Asia                (557)         276.59         -1.0         -5.0 China 4              (18)         101.48         -1.5        -32.0 South Korea 5       (156)         148.76         -1.5        +25.9 Philippines          (19)         323.00         +0.2         -5.1 Taiwan, China 6      (90)         151.71         -3.4        +12.2 India 7              (76)         132.36         -1.1        +13.6 Indonesia 8          (37)         109.94         +0.4        -11.8 Malaysia            (104)         304.44         -1.0        -10.2 Pakistan 9           (15)         412.23         -0.9         +6.3 Sri Lanka 10          (5)         191.84         -2.5         +8.2 Thailand             (55)         444.21         -1.4         -7.0 Euro/Mid East       (125)         116.69         +1.0        -31.1 Greece               (25)         220.44         -1.9         -3.2 Hungary 11            (5)         182.32         -0.8         +9.4 Jordan               (13)         154.12         +0.2         -6.9 Poland 12            (12)         515.90        -10.3        -36.9 Portugal             (25)         126.89         -1.2        +11.5 Turkey 13            (40)         114.17         +5.6        -46.3 Zimbabwe 14           (5)         264.02         -1.5        +30.6 Composite           (891)         360.35         -0.3         +1.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                               Local currency terms                    No. of        Oct. 28     % Change     % Change                    stocks           1994    over week   on Dec '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America       (208) Argentina            (25)     562,652.45         -2.3         -7.8 Brazil               (57)  1,350,985,929         +8.8     +1,229.4 Chile                (25)       1,374.75         -0.2        +44.2 Colombia 1           (11)       1,224.12         -3.9        +32.0 Mexico               (67)       1,359.90         -4.0         +0.8 Peru 2               (11)         262.94         +2.5        +65.3 Venezuela 3          (12)       2,146.60         +2.4        +51.0 Asia                (557) China 4              (18)         109.35         -1.5        -33.4 South Korea 5       (156)         155.72         -1.6        +24.1 Philippines          (19)         388.54         -1.0        -12.5 Taiwan, China 6      (90)         148.32         -3.4        +10.9 India 7              (76)         147.50         -1.1        +14.5 Indonesia 8          (37)         129.65         +0.3         -8.9 Malaysia            (104)         286.81         -1.0        -14.9 Pakistan 9           (15)         573.22         -0.9         +8.5 Sri Lanka 10          (5)         203.75         -2.5         +6.7 Thailand             (55)         439.45         -1.3         -9.1 Euro/Mid East       (125) Greece               (25)         346.83         -1.0         -9.8 Hungary 11            (5)         233.40         +0.1        +15.6 Jordan               (13)          223.54        -0.2         -6.6 Poland 12            (12)         749.08         -9.6        -32.2 Portugal             (25)         134.48         -0.4         -2.6 Turkey 13            (40)         1,935.14       +6.9        +33.0 Zimbabwe 14           (5)         323.85         -1.3        +51.6 Composite           (891)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / IMF yet to agree Pakistan package AN International Monetary Fund delegation left Pakistan last night without reaching agreement with the interim government on economic measures which would be backed by IMF loans. Mr Saeed Qureshi, secretary general of the finance ministry, said there were 'no major ticklish issues left'. But he conceded that details on revenue collection and control of government spending needed to be finalised. The caretaker prime minister, Mr Moeen Qureshi, is expected to announce economic reforms on Saturday which will include steps to increase revenues and reduce expenditure to cut the country's large budget deficit. Among measures being considered is a larger wealth tax on rich landowners, whose political influence has enabled them to escape heavy taxation. The government may also seek to merge up to 21 federal ministries into other ministries. The government hopes that the measures will secure the IMF's agreement to provide Dollars 1.2bn of loans. Mr Mohammad El-Erian, the IMF mission leader, will brief colleagues in Washington before a recommendation is sent to the fund's board. Mr Qazi Aleemullah, Pakistan's finance secretary, said there was a 'more than 80 per cent chance' of agreement. Pakistan expects Dollars 1bn from a combination of the IMF's Extended Finance Facility and Extended Structural Adjustment Facility over three years. The government is also seeking up to Dollars 200m as a Structural Adjustment Facility to meet short-term balance of payment needs, of which the first tranche could be made available in September. Ratification of the longer-term package would await the arrival of a new government after October elections.</p>

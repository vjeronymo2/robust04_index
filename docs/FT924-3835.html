			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UN fears it can only 'ease the passage of history': How restricted resources and powers may prevent UN troops from fulfilling their already limited tasks Thirty-tonne British Warrior fighting vehicles, French Sagaie light tanks with 90-millimetre guns: this is the new UN image in the former Yugoslavia. In as much as the weapons are more potent and up-to-date than those seen in other UN peacekeeping operations, they are signs of a new departure. But they may well become symbols of frustration in the first blue-helmet operation in continental Europe. 'Anybody working here is bound to be frustrated by the limits of what we are allowed to do,' a UN official admitted this week. Fourteen generals and brigadiers head a combined military force of more than 22,000 in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. With further deployments now being studied as a preventive measure in Macedonia, the UN already has more troops in the ex-Yugoslav republics than in Cambodia, more than it despatched to the Congo in the early 1960s, and almost twice as many as were engaged in all its peacekeeping operations this time last year. But it is questionable how far these forces will be able to fulfil even their limited tasks, with the resources and powers they now have. The initial UN Protection Force was set up in February following the ceasefire in Croatia to stop renewed fighting. Twelve enlarged infantry battalions, backed up by logistics and support troops, were given the job of 'demilitarising' four zones, covering about a third of Croatia, in which Serbs made up the majority or a substantial minority. This meant ensuring the withdrawal of forces, disbanding any remaining troops, impounding their weapons, and seeing that the police respected civil rights. In the central zone known as Sector West, it has largely worked. Police carry only handguns and act like police. But in Sector East, abutting Serbia, and in the mountainous southern Krajina region the situation is described as 'nearly anarchic'. Talks on demilitarisation have got nowhere. Croatian troops are meanwhile said to be 'visibly gathering' across some UN Protected Area borders, moving up from the agreed lines of withdrawal, especially in the southwest near Zadar. Croatia says it wants the UN out by the end of March, when its current mandate ends. UN officials, diplomats and politicians in Zagreb believe that would lead, perhaps within days, to new hostilities, since Croatia would seek to repossess at least parts of these areas. The more recent UN force in Bosnia has a different job and and different organisation. As in Somalia, the UN is breaking new ground trying to protect relief supplies in the middle of an ongoing war. The 6,000 British, French, Canadian and Spanish troops sent to protect aid routes - in addition to forces despatched earlier to secure Sarajevo's airport and help supplies to the besieged Bosnian capital - are funded directly by their governments and not out of the UN's overstretched funds. General Philippe Morillon, the UN's French commander in Bosnia, has a high profile in negotiations between the warring parties, but is regarded in UN circles as a loose cannon. The troops' new role is itself controversial. Dr Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, has questioned the wisdom of resorting to military means to support humanitarian aid, insisting that the use of troops for this purpose 'must remain a temporary and exceptional measure.' After delays in deployment, the troops have found their operations obstructed by local militia commanders, mainly - but not solely - Serbs. The new Canadian battalion and a company of Dutch transport troops have been kicking their heels in Croatia, waiting to move to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka. This is not only an important aid route but the only one of the new UN operations scheduled to be based in a Serb-held area. 'Without the Serbs' co-operation a lot of things can't be done,' a UN officer commented. UN forces, finding it increasingly difficult to appear even-handed, are afflicted by a sense of powerlessness. Serb helicopters flout the ban on military flying to re-supply front-line forces. But prospects for taking military action against them are complicated by the presence of UN ground troops, who would be vulnerable to retaliation. Gen Morillon takes a broad view of the UN force's humanitarian mandate. But if the troops' role is extended, for instance to evacuating refugees, it could cause problems. Since many of the male refugees fleeing Serb attacks wear uniforms, the UN could be accused of providing direct military assistance. On the other hand, it could equally be accused of abetting 'ethnic cleansing' by moving civilians away from their homes. UN commanders hope the conspicuous presence of their armoured vehicles will build local communities' confidence. But many Croats and Moslems see the UN as an irrelevance or even an encumbrance. 'If I were at the receiving end of the shells,' said a senior French diplomat, 'I would not be grateful for the kind of help I've been receiving.' The UN's Bosnia-Hercegovina headquarters at Kiseljak could support a much larger operation, as could the British army's logistics base. But from humanitarian aid to intervention, even against fifth-rate military opposition, is a large leap. UN officials do not see western governments being ready to pay for an indefinite mission. Colonel Michael Dewar, deputy director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says the UN might muster enough forces to set up safe areas for Moslems. But to separate and disarm forces throughout Bosnia, he reckons, would require hundreds of thousands of troops; setting up a cordon sanitaire around Sarajevo alone would need at least 50,000. The military advice governments are receiving is that intervention would be extremely complex and costly and could even make things worse. Without it, the best the UN can do, says Col Dewar, is to mitigate the damage. It will be doing no more than 'easing the passage of history.'</p>

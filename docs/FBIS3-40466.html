It is expected that  new functions will emerge through high-order gathering of enzyme  proteins, and we can now expect research to move in the  direction of greater efficiency and higher functions in  immobilized enzymes, biochips, and the like thanks to the  establishment of this method.    The group led by professor Kokubu has been conducting  research to synthesize molecular ceramics. Researchers have  combined enzyme immobilization with gel-sol techniques by making  use of the fact that synthetic bimolecular membranes form  precise gathering sites on the molecular level. This development  originated in research that uses these gathering sites as  molecular molds where the myoglobin is immobilized in a  polysiloxane film.    More specifically, an amphipathic compound with a phosphate  group (Fig. 1) is dispersed by ultrasonication in solution and a  specified amount of an alkoxysilane compound (Fig. 2) dispersed  in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid is added. After  additional ultrasonication, an aqueous solution of myoglobin is  added, and the mixture is cast to form a film containing  immobilized protein. The researchers then immerse the film in  chloroform to extract and remove the bimolecular membrane, and  they have studied the resulting siloxane polymer containing  immobilized myoglobin (Fig. 3) by X-ray diffraction, etc.      The researchers determined that protein plays a decisive  role  in memory formation because imprinting does not occur if protein  synthesis inhibitors are injected. Then the Tsukada group  focused on messenger RNA, which carries the blueprint for  protein structure, and searched for mRNA that was present in  particularly large amounts in the imprinted group.    As a result they found two mRNAs. When they analyzed the  base  sequences, the researchers discovered that these substances were  a kainic acid binding protein that strongly binds to glutamic  acid, which plays a role in nerve signal transmission in the  brain, and a calcium binding protein (calmodulin) that is  closely related to nerve cell metabolism.    Mr. Tsukada says, ``We cannot say definitively that the  proteins we identified are the substance of memory, but at least  we are certain that they are essential for the establishment of  long-term memory.''</p>

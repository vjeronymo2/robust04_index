			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / British Gas close to price formula deadline BRITISH GAS must announce details on Monday of its review of prices it charges 17m domestic customers for gas, or face another clash with the Office of Gas Supply, its regulator. Ofgas said yesterday it would make public its own proposals for the new tariff formula to cover gas prices for the next five years. Ofgas added, however, that Mr James McKinnon, its director-general, had not yet agreed a new formula with British Gas. British Gas has scheduled an announcement for midday on Monday when it must announce its response to Mr McKinnon's price proposals or face having the issue turned over to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full inquiry. Ofgas said it hoped agreement could be reached on Monday morning. The regulator previously set the end of the month as a deadline for British Gas to reply to Ofgas's suggestions for a new pricing formula - the result of an 11-month review. Under the present formula, British Gas raises gas prices to domestic consumers by the rate of inflation less an efficiency clawback of 2 percentage points. The company is also allowed to pass on the full cost of North Sea gas price rises to end-users. The regulator is likely to push for an increase in the efficiency factor to 3 or 4 percentage points. Many analysts believe that would give the company an incentive to cut staffing levels and trim costs. Ms Irene Himona, of London broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, believes that on the basis of British Gas's profit forecasts for the next five years, an increase in the efficiency factor to 4 percentage points would halve the company's earnings-per-share growth from a rate of 9.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. Mr McKinnon has also hinted that he would like to cut the level of costs that the company can pass to consumers. So in future, the amount of North Sea gas price rises that can be passed on may be cut from 100 per cent to 75 per cent. The new pricing formula may also include performance standards for British Gas. Since the company is a monopoly supplier to the domestic market, Ofgas believes it must force British Gas to set public standards of service.</p>

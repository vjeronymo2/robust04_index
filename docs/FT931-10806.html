			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Judges block Fabius trial JUDGES ruled yesterday that too much time had elapsed for former French prime minister Laurent Fabius to stand trial over the infection of haemophiliacs with the AIDS virus, Reuter reports from Paris. About 1,200 haemophiliacs contracted the AIDS virus from contaminated blood stocks before a heating process to eliminate AIDS was introduced in late 1985. About 300 victims have since died. Mr Fabius, leader of the ruling Socialist Party, and former health and social affairs ministers Mr Edmond Herve and Ms Georgina Dufoix wanted a trial to try to clear their names.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Fishing: A character-building Irish monsoon THERE ARE times when a man is compelled to become more aware than usual of his puniness in the face of the force of nature; such as when he finds a river which he has crossed a sea to fish transformed between one day and the next from a gentle stream into a scaled-down version of the Ganges at the height of the monsoon. In describing the events of my recent trip to Ireland, I shall endeavour to maintain a tone of ironic detachment, rather than give way to outrage and fist-shaking. I shall be philosophical, stoical, manly, for nothing is more tiresome than self-pity. At least I shall try - but it will be hard. The events took place this June, a month which the poets and other ill-informed authorities tell us sees the first flowering of summer. This year it saw instead the coming of tempest and deluge. And while I, my heart full of childish excitement, was crossing the Irish Sea, the black clouds were following fast. It was to have been a free-and-easy week. Having no money to spend, I would spend no money. I would follow my nose and my whim, helping myself here and there to a taste of the wonderful wealth of free (or virtually free) trout fishing with which Ireland is blessed. That first day, I heard something on the news about people being rescued by lifeboat from their bedroom windows in north Wales - and foolishly allowed myself a secret smile of satisfaction that Ireland seemed to be escaping the worst of it. I was intending to fish an little stream called the Deel, one of a cluster of rivers west of Dublin (others include the Boyne and the Blackwater) which offer demanding but first-rate trout fishing. My friend Niall proposed a post-dinner sortie to fish the sedge. As I stood outside his house getting my rod ready, there was a sprinkling of large drops of rain. By the time we neared the river, it was raining with serious intent. By the time we had legged it back to the house, it was beating down and we were soused. It stopped about 22 hours later. A podgy Irish weather forecaster appeared on television with that guilty look of excitement that weather forecaster have when the weather achieves unprecedented awfulness, and announced that it had probably been the wettest day since Irish records began. Unconsoled at the thought of witnessing the making of history, we splashed down to the little river and found that it was a big, angry cocoa-coloured river. There were no drowned sheep in it yet, but it seemed only a matter of time. We were not finished though. Reports from the west asserted that the rains had held off, and we were soon hurtling through the floods towards the green, wooded county of Clare and the neat little village of Corofin, through which winds the river Fergus. Sure enough, as we headed down from the Slieve Aughty mountains, the clouds lifted. The Fergus connects a famous and lovely trout lough, Inchiquin, with a string of lesser lakes, and is itself a remarkable and fascinating piece of water. Running entirely though limestone, it is clear, rich in weed and full of trout, some very big. It costs nothing to fish. I know there are very big fish in it, because we met one. It rose on the far side of a gorgeous pool upstream from Corofin. There was a terrific gurgling suck as a late mayfly disappeared, followed by waves. With an immense cast, I landed my fly somewhere near, and the fish dashed at it and missed.  There were more waves. These waves so impressed us that we went up to the bridge, and down the other side so that we could attack the monster properly. First cast it surged heart-stoppingly at the fly, but again did not take. It then retired to ponder the folly of its greed, and was seen no more. That evening the sun shone, and we had some very pleasing fishing for small trout which rose with gusto to a hatch of blue-winged olives. Mid-way through the following morning, after another vain assault on the leviathan of the pool, the rain reached Corofin. It was no fleeting downpoour, but had a settled long-term purpose, and it drove us away from the Fergus - vowing to return one day. I had planned that the triumphant coda to my trip should be the catching of some salmon from the Cork Blackwater. We telephoned Frank, who guards the fishing with a love bordering on obsession. He had had 17 fish that week, four that day. Conditions were perfect. Hardly had I said that I would be there next morning than it began to belt down. It continued until I got there, by which time the river was the colour of stout with a dash of milk. I flogged away for a day and a half without getting a touch, then carried out a strategic withdrawal back across the Irish Sea. Since then, I have analysed my misfortunes, in a cool and reasoned way, searching for the positive side. There can only be one, and it recalls what they used to say at school about cross-country runs, arbitrary beatings and the like: Good for the character.</p>

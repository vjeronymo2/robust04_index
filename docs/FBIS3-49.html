			<p>SUMMARY                             In a string of confrontational actions and pronouncements,  Pyongyang has raised the stakes further in its high-stakes  nuclear issues game by threatening to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  Although apparently unwilling to  publicly concede that its own recent actions have damaged the  chances for resumption of high-level U.S.-North Korea dialogue,  Pyongyang appears to be trying to somehow salvage bilateral talks  with Washington.                           END SUMMARY     Pyongyang Threatens NPT Withdrawal, Calls for U.S. Talks    Pyongyang's threat to withdraw from the NPT came in an  authoritative Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement issued on 21  March (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  In the statement Pyongyang  said it will "carry into practice" its declaration of NPT  withdrawal announced on 12 March 1993 under certain conditions:   + If the United States refuses bilateral talks with North Korea  and resumes Team Spirit, thereby "increasing its nuclear threat"  against the DPRK.   + If the IAEA "further expands it unfairness" by "distorting" the  results of its recent inspections in North Korea and resorts to  "forcible measures and pressures."   The 21 March statement, which for the first time acknowledged  that the DPRK-U.S. talks scheduled for the same day in Geneva did  not take place, also repeated familiar North Korean charges of  U.S. violations of previous agreements with North Korea and  declared that Pyongyang will "no longer" be duty-bound to ensure  continuity of NPT safeguards.   Hint of Moderation     Possibly seeking to soften its threat--and  thus somehow leave the door ajar for dialogue with Washington-  -the statement seemed to imply that as long as there is any hope  of resuming bilateral talks with Washington, Pyongyang may  refrain from taking the final step of NPT withdrawal.  North  Korean withdrawal from the NPT, the statement said, would occur  only if the United States "persists in avoiding" bilateral talks  "to the end."  Underscoring Pyongyang's reluctance to  definitively rule out future talks, the statement asserted that  the DPRK is "in no hurry at all"--presumably, to foreclose  avenues of dialogue with Washington--"even if the DPRK-U.S. talks  are not held."  In addition, in contrast to North Korean  pronouncements on the inter-Korean talks (see following article),  the statement, like previous pronouncements on Washington's  policy, refrained from extreme polemical attacks on Washington.   Pyongyang media also appeared to react with similar  circumspection to recent statements by high U.S. officials  criticizing the North.  For example, monitored North Korean media  so far have not reported or commented on CIA Director Woolsey's  charges that Pyongyang has been exporting weapons of mass  destruction, is supporting terrorism, and may already possess  nuclear weapons (Yonhap, 18 March).   Implications     Pyongyang clearly prefers to deal only with  Washington on the nuclear issue.  However, it seems unwilling or  unable to acknowledge that its own dilatory and confrontational  tactics are damaging the prospects for the dialogue it is  seeking.     Pyongyang Breaks Off Talks With Seoul, Threatens War                                SUMMARY   Accusing Seoul of engaging in pressure tactics, Pyongyang has  abruptly broken off bilateral talks and issued threats of war-  -threats that it subsequently appeared to moderate.  North Korea  apparently hopes to gain from what it sees as differences within  the ROK Government and between Seoul and Washington on the  nuclear issue.                               END SUMMARY   The North came to Panmunjom on 19 March clearly prepared to break  off the ongoing negotiations with the South on the exchange of  presidential envoys.  The North Korean chief delegate--identified  in Seoul media as Pak Yong-su--not only reinstated demands that  he had previously indicated would be retracted, but also insisted  that the ROK Government "apologize" to all Koreans--a formulation  Pyongyang had typically used in the past to signal its  noninterest in dialogue with Seoul and Tokyo--this time for  allegedly obstructing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks (Pyongyang  radio, 19 March).   The North's main complaint against the South focused on what Pak  described as Seoul's "sudden change of attitude" toward adoption  of "tough measures" against Pyongyang.  In particular, Pak said  that North Korea's pique was based on reports of the 17 March  "high-level strategic meeting" in Seoul, which had reportedly  discussed holding Team Spirit, the deployment of Patriot  missiles, and international sanctions.  Pak equated this alleged  change in the South's attitude to "a grave crime" and claimed  that it necessitated the reimposition of the four demands made  earlier by the North--demands that Pak had previously admitted  were "barriers" to envoy exchanges erected by Pyongyang itself.  (The North had demanded that the South refrain from 1) staging  large-scale nuclear exercises, 2) introducing new weapons,  including the Patriot missile, and 3) using threats of  international sanctions.  The North had also demanded previously  that 4) the South retract ROK President Kim Yong-nam's remarks  about not shaking hands with North Korean officials.)   Demand for Apology     Signaling that Pyongyang is no longer  interested in continuing dialogue with Seoul, Pak accused the  South of having used the envoy exchange talks "solely" for the  purpose of derailing DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.  He went on to  "strongly insist" that the South "frankly admit" this "dark  intention" and "apologize before the nation."  Attempting to  place the onus of any breakdown of dialogue on the South, Pak  further accused Seoul of having in effect adopted "a declaration  of abandonment of the special envoys exchange, a declaration of  an all-out confrontation with us, and a declaration of war."   Pyongyang radio on 19 March depicted Pak as making his most  provocative remarks only in response to remarks the South made at  the 19 March session.  According to the radio, the South side had  said that should the envoy exchange talks be discontinued, "there  is no knowing what danger would materialize."  To this Pak  reportedly replied, "Don't worry about it.  What do you think the  South is?  If the North suffers damage, do you think the South  will go unscathed?"  Pak went on to pledge unspecified "immediate  and decisive countermeasures of self-defense" in case "some  powers impose sanctions on us or otherwise provoke us."  The  radio said Pak coupled his pledge with a "stern warning" not to  take the North Korean threats lightly, quoting him as saying, "we  do not know how to engage in idle talk. "(SEE NOTE)   (NOTE: Seoul's government-run KBS-1 television on 19 March  broadcast video recording of even more inflammatory remarks by  Pak that were captured by closed-circuit television coverage of  the meeting.  In the video, Pak told his Southern counterpart,  Song Yong-tae, to "give a careful consideration to the  consequences of a war," and warned that "Seoul is not far from  here.  If war breaks out, it will turn into a sea of fire.  Mr.  Song, it will probably difficult for you, too, to survive."  Pyongyang media have not been observed to report on this portion  of Pak's remarks.)   Moderation of Threats     Pyongyang subsequently appeared to  backpedal a bit on its threats of war.  In a 21 March statement  issued in the name of the North Korean delegation to the inter-  Korean contacts, which again chastised the South for "suddenly"  assuming what it described as a hardline stance, the North made  only passing references to the possibility of war, implying  instead that the downfall of the ROK government will come from  revolt within the South (Pyongyang radio, 21 March).  The  statement warned the ROK to realize that "no dictators" in the  South had "survived committing the antinational act of betraying  fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces" and that  "these flunkeyist, nation-sellers have met a bitter end."  North Korean Motives     Pyongyang may calculate that its  brinksmanship will sufficiently split opinions within the South  Korean government to make a firm stand against the North  difficult.  For the past few months, Seoul media reporting on  relations with the North has indicated that there are serious  divisions within the Seoul government over how to deal with  Pyongyang.  The latest of these indications came shortly after a  12 March inter-Korean meeting.  The Seoul daily Hanguk Ilbo on 13  March cited an unnamed ROK "government official" as saying that  the South and the United States "believe" that by failing to  agree to the exchange of envoys with Seoul, Pyongyang had  "unilaterally invalidated" an agreement reached with Washington  on resuming high-level talks in Geneva later in the month.  Apparently alarmed by the possible effects such remarks could  have on the inter-Korean talks, other "government officials" were  cited the next day by the South Korean news agency Yonhap as  advocating a different approach (14 March).  One of them was  quoted as saying that Seoul should not consider it "a violation  of the North Korea-U.S. agreement" even if North Korea "refused"  the envoy exchange outright.  All that would happen, he  reportedly said, would be that "the date of the third round  [U.S.-North Korea] meeting would be delayed" until the envoy  exchange was realized.   In addition, there has been intermittent South Korean reporting  of a division of views between Seoul and Washington that could  have emboldened Pyongyang.  Most recently, for instance, Yonhap  on 16 March cited Kim Tae-chung, a "retired" opposition leader  and former presidential candidate, as "lashing out" at U.S.  "hardliners" for allegedly jeopardizing lives of Koreans in their  pursuit of confrontation with North Korea on the nuclear issue.  Similarly, in an article datelined Washington, the Seoul daily  Choson Ilbo on 13 March claimed that the U.S. Congress has  concluded that differences between Washington and Seoul over how  to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue are serving as a  "stumbling block" in the U.S. Government's formulation of its  policy toward Pyongyang--reporting that could have encouraged  Pyongyang to reinforce its constant attempt to drive a wedge  between Washington and Seoul.   Outlook     Pyongyang media treatment of the 19 March meeting  seems aimed at portraying the North Korean leadership as fully  prepared to face the worst case scenario.  By declaring  Pyongyang's willingness to destroy Seoul in a conflict, the North  Korean leadership may hope to frighten officials in the South  into advocating concessions and thus further aggravate a  perceived division between the United States and South Korea.

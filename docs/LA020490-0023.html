			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Congressman Dana Rohrabacher is having a hard time selling his proposal to  offer coastal communities a cut in future offshore oil royalties.  </P> <P> Last month city leaders of Palos Verdes Estates sent him a letter stating that,  royalties or no royalties, they would continue to oppose offshore oil drilling  under any circumstances. And on Tuesday, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council  decided unanimously to mail him a similar message.  </P> <P> "We don't think that money could compensate for the damage oil drilling could  do," Rancho Palos Verdes City Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said. "We didn't  want him to think there was a scheme that could buy us off."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) has asked the U.S. Department of the Interior to draft a  measure that would require the federal government to share its royalties from  new offshore oil and gas production with coastal cities affected by the  drilling.  </P> <P> He thinks the proposal could help Washington interest local communities in oil  and gas development in the federal waters off California and other coastal  states.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher wants to gauge support for the measure before deciding whether to  introduce it in Congress. Though he received a letter in opposition last month  from the city of Palos Verdes Estates -- and is about to receive another  negative review from Rancho Palos Verdes -- Rohrabacher remains unfazed.  </P> <P> Once voters realize that city budgets could be bolstered significantly by oil  royalties, he said Friday, they may support offshore drilling. Elected  officials, he added, should be open to debate on the issue.  </P> <P> "No one is talking about steamrolling local cities and forcing offshore oil  development on anybody," Rohrabacher said, promising he will oppose offshore  drilling in the Santa Monica Bay area if it is unacceptable to coastal  communities. "But there is no reason to shut off debate about what the citizens  of Southern California may or may not want to accept."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said his proposal needs more consideration.  </P> <P> "Right now we are in the initial exploration," he said. "It could be a dry hole  or it could be a gusher." George Hatch  </P></p>

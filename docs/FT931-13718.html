			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Treasury panel divided on extent of the gloom Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist, Goldman Sachs The European recession is starting to drag down the UK. Unless Britain has markedly lower interest rates soon, there may be no recovery. The chancellor should also act to combat long-term unemployment. Patrick Minford, professor of economics, Liverpool University Mr Lamont's view that an economic recovery is starting has been blown out of the water. We need an aggressive programme of lower interest rates to stimulate demand. Yesterday's figures confirm my worst fears. David Currie, head of economic forecasting, London Business School The signs about an upturn have become far more patchy. The chances of a cut in interest rates soon are now higher than they were. But these latest figures do not alter my view that we will see a recovery this year. Andrew Britton, director, Nat Institute of Economic and Social Research Yesterday's figures apply to the fourth quarter of last year. No one was expecting them to be very strong, though I would have liked them to be better. I still think there will be a significant recovery over the next 12 months. Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics, Cambridge University Hopes of any real recovery in demand are going to be continually disappointed in 1993. There may be some rise in economic activity but not enough to stop unemployment from increasing further and not enough to bring it down. Tim Congdon, managing director, Lombard Street Research A full recovery requires not just a return to growth but the achievement of several quarters of above-trend growth. The evidence is that this will not happen in the near future. Meanwhile, the European economy is deteriorating. Andrew Sentance, head of economics, Confederation of British Industry Mr Lamont would be fully justified in cutting 1 percentage point off base rates. We have to be very cautious about prospects for a recovery, with the economy in the first half of 1993 likely to be pretty flat.</p>

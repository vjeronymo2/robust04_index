			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESTON MANNING: PREACHING POPULISM IN THE HEARTLAND  </P> <P> The man who has channeled western Canadian disaffection into Canada's  fastest-growing political party is Preston Manning, 48, the son of a prairie  populist who governed the province of Alberta for a record 25 years.  </P> <P> Manning grew up on a 70-Holstein dairy farm, read the Bible assiduously,  studied economics at the University of Alberta and watched from the ringside as  his father, the famous Ernest Manning, governed.  </P> <P> The elder Manning had made a name for himself on western Canada's "Back to the  Bible Hour" radio show; his political organization, the Social Credit Party,  was a conservative, religious, populist movement originally formed around the  free-credit principles of an obscure English engineer.  </P> <P> As a young man, Preston Manning realized he shared much of his father's faith  and conservatism and felt tempted to follow him into Social Credit politics.  But by the time young Manning was old enough to make a difference, the  so-called SoCreds were on the ropes in Alberta. Rather than join the big-time  Liberals or Progressive Conservatives, he decided to wait until the time was  right to organize a new movement.  </P> <P> While he waited, Manning ran a business-consulting firm, serving up economic  advice to top Canadian companies with interests in Alberta. In the mid-1980s he  helped organize a Vancouver meeting of alienated western Canadians, which  eventually led to the creation of the Reform Party. He was elected party leader  at the Reformists' founding convention, in 1987. MARY WILLIAMS WALSH  </P></p>

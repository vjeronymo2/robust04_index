			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Tarmac offers free road in bid for toll motorway TARMAC, the construction group, is offering to construct free of charge a dual carriageway north of Birmingham for local traffic if it is allowed to build a privately-financed toll motorway alongside. The proposal is part of a bid by Tarmac and Transroute, a large French toll road operator, to build the first privately-financed toll motorway in Britain which would relieve the heavily-congested M6 motorway. The aim of the plan would be to encourage long-distance motorists to pay up to Pounds 3 to use a three-lane road, which would have only limited access for local traffic. This would be encouraged to travel at no expense along the 30-mile dual carriageway, to be constructed at Tarmac's cost. Tarmac estimates the cost of building the two roads at Pounds 300m. The non-toll road would be created by upgrading and joining the A38, A5 and A446 roads. Three-quarters of the route would be completely new road, the company says. Two other consortia have submitted tenders to build the Birmingham northern relief road, one of several road projects identified by the Transport Department as candidates for private investment. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, is expected to announce the winning bid within the next six weeks. The other bidders are: A joint venture between Trafalgar House, the British construction, property, shipping and hotels group and Italstat, Europe's biggest toll road operator which manages about 60 per cent of Italy's 4,000 miles of toll motorways. A consortium led by Manufacturers Hanover, the US bank, which includes Cofiroute, another large French toll road company. It contains four British contractors: Robert M. Douglas; Alfred McAlpine; A. Monk and A. F. Budge; and three French contractors: Sogea; Jean Lefebvre; and GTM International. Tarmac proposes a toll of about 10p a mile for cars. Vehicles travelling the full length of the motorway would pay about Pounds 3, thought to be about twice the level of tolls proposed by the Trafalgar House joint venture.</p>

The Romanian Foreign Ministry issued a communique in which  it  expresses the belief that the positive development registered in  the relations between the two countries represents an important  and encouraging moment which will make a substantial  contribution and provide an impetus to the peace process in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, reduce tension, and create conditions for a  new consensus on coexistence in the area of the former  Yugoslavia.    As a matter of fact, this moment is in line with the  constant  position promoted by Romania, which is to stimulate the process  of normalizing relations between all countries that have emerged  in the area of the former Yugoslavia and to hold talks between  them.    The Romanian Foreign Ministry, reads the communique,  expresses the hope that this process will continue and, thus,  contribute to the promotion of political stability in this area  and in the entire region.</p>

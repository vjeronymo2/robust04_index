			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpt" of speech given by Ukrainian President Leonid </F> Kravchuk at the KhimVolokno chemical fiber production  association in Kiev on 10 June--recorded]    [Text] The economic and political situation in Ukraine are  both developing with difficulty. However, this difficulty,  thank God, does not go beyond the framework of laws and the  Constitution. Within the framework of legislation and the  Constitution, we coordinate all of the issues connected with  interparty passions and with interparty struggle, as well as  regional issues--in particular, the Crimean issue, a very  complicated issue for us today. We work in a way so that Crimea  can understand that simple norm, recognized by the world  community, that it has no right to violate the territorial  integrity of the state and alter its borders. We enjoy the  support of the entire international community.    I hope that the Crimean leadership will assume  responsibility  in order to bring the processes within the framework of the  Constitution. I, as the president of Ukraine, and the government  act this way. We shall continue to act this way and tackle all  issues proceeding from law and the Constitution. However, I  emphasize again that the Crimean leadership has no right to step  over the red line, which I mention. This is a violation of our  state's territorial integrity. Well, I cannot say that we have a  full understanding with Crimea. The problems are very  complicated, but the information that is available to me, and I  would like to share it with you, proves that there is a growing  understanding among people--not at some level of power  structures, but among people--and that the policy conducted by  the Crimean leadership can lead to complications. Such  understanding does exist. People, seeing these problems, these  hotbeds, as we call them--both Karabakh and the Dniestr region,  where it also happened, and Yugoslavia today. Thank God, the  issue is being somehow tackled today. It can be solved step by  step in Abkhazia where blood is being shed, where innocent  people, women and children and those who have nothing to do with  these conflicts, die and become refugees. People see this, and  I think it will influence the Crimean leadership's policy and  the actions. For our part, our actions will be adequate for the  situation; however, we will by no means allow the territorial  integrity and inviolability of Ukraine's borders to be violated.  We say this openly and sincerely, and I am telling you this  while I am aware of the fact that the Crimean issue is a painful  issue for every person living today in Ukraine.    We have been able to follow the road of peace, tranquility,  and accord, although there is certain pressure exerted on us  from outside. We have internal problems as well. So far we  have been unable to achieve civil accord as far as building and  developing our economy, our political and power structures, and  power institutions are concerned.    The previous Supreme Council had been working for four  years.  It failed to solve issues that needed to be solved at the  constitutional level. It failed to adopt the Constitution.  Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former USSR which  has no constitution today. We are going to hold the elections  without a constitution. We are going to hold the elections  without relevant laws to regulate relations between the local  and central bodies of power. We are going to hold the elections  with no clear idea of the plenary powers of the bodies of power  to be elected and the structure of that power; no idea of what  will be its responsibility to the budget of Ukraine or the  responsibility of the lower-level bodies of power to the  higher-level bodies of power. We have no idea whether that  vertical subordination system exists or does not exist. Today,  we see that it can be destroyed. This will seriously endanger  the arrangement of power in the state, and power is the lever by  which all institutions in all areas of life are created: in  legal, economic, political, and diplomatic areas, and so on.  That is to say, we must have constitutional and legislative  norms to hold the elections, and we are going to hold them  without those norms. This is unique, and it is not by chance  that at the Supreme Council I appealed to the deputies and told  them that today they.... [Kravchuk pauses] because this is  exclusively within the competence of the Supreme Council to  create the structure and to pass the laws on both the power  structure and the elections.    The president has no such plenary powers. Therefore, the  Supreme Council of Ukraine will naturally have to assume all  responsibility for what we are doing today toward that end. I  believe that the deputies understand this, and there is no  exaggeration whatsoever at this point. Perhaps we shall  manage--I mean at the Supreme Council they will manage--before  the elections are held, to make some corrections and some  amendments to the laws that will regulate relations and create  the power structure.    As you know, there will be presidential elections, too.  Strictly speaking, these elections, if we had a new constitution  and laws.... [Kravchuk pauses] I was then speaking at the  Supreme Council and saying that it is true that new power  institutions had to be created to comply with the new  constitution. But if this is not done, I am convinced that  these elections will not bring better conditions or big changes  in the economy and in politics all of a sudden. On the  contrary, they distract people from fulfilling their [word  indistinct].    I will use my own activities to illustrate this. This is the  seventh election during the past four years that I have run in.  Just imagine, the seventh election over four years. This means  that I have been elected twice a year. Not appointed, but  elected by people. This is the situation, and effort and energy  are spared toward that end. [sentence as heard]    For example, I am a functioning president, and I cannot  abandon my office duties today. Who will perform them for me?  There is no vice president. The Constitution clearly  stipulates that I have no right to pass my powers to anyone  else. For example, if I go on a trip to some oblast, and the  levers of power.... [Kravchuk pauses] And it is necessary to  sign documents here, or to meet representatives of other states  who visit Ukraine.    For example, next Tuesday [14 June] I am to fly to  Luxembourg  to sign a document on partnership and cooperation between  Ukraine and the European Union. This will be done for the first  time ever, and by this I mean to say that those who claim that  Ukraine conducts a policy of isolation, self-isolation, well,  this is just untrue because Ukraine has been recognized by the  whole world. If we said earlier that it was recognized by 50,  60, or 70 states, then today I say that the whole world has  recognized Ukraine.    Ukraine joins the European community, the European Union  with  the rights of a partner. This is a fact, and this will be done  next Tuesday on 14 June.    We signed the most important political and economic  documents  with Russia and other CIS countries. We signed a treaty on  friendship and cooperation with Russia in 1990. A new,  full-scale treaty between our states is being prepared now, and  I hope that it will be signed after we solve yet another acute  problem for Russia and Ukraine: the division and the status of  the Black Sea Fleet. We have also made some progress here.    Therefore, the fact that Ukraine conducts some policy of  isolation or self-isolation is a pure invention, indeed, a  deliberate invention.    Ukraine is represented at international organizations.  Official representatives of other states, including high-level  representatives, visit Ukraine every day. You know, Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel recently visited Ukraine. I mention  the recent times. Is this self-isolation? Another thing is  that the problems are solved in an acute manner and with  difficulty. However, this is not our fault, or it would be more  correct to say, not only our fault. There are problems in other  states, and it is not easy to solve them, and everyone today is  engaged in solving acute issues. Sometimes we have to act as a  fire-fighting team instead of implementing a program step by  step and consistently, a program which neither internal nor  external factors influence seriously, but even if they do, these  factors can be easily averted.</p>

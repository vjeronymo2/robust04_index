			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lodz, 7 Mar--Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the  National Commission of the Independent Self-Governing Trade  Union Solidarity [NSZZ], declared today that the union was ready  for a strike "that could last weeks".    Zak refused to divulge details of Monday's debates by  Solidarity's national section for the metallurgical industry,  which were held in Lodz. He reported that there would a session  of the National Commission of NSZZ Solidarity in Lodz on 9 March.    "We have presented our areas of negotiation to the  government, and we intend to talk exclusively about specific  matters--for example, about how the profamily tax system is to  be introduced and about the price increases by energy carriers,"  Zak told a PAP journalist.    The National Commission spokesman said: "The union is  examining the possibility of making life difficult for those  governing the country." Solidarity wants social disruption  caused by the strike to be as limited as possible. It is for  that reason, for example, that Solidarity's national section for  the power industry plans first to cut electricity in public  offices and among those industrial customers who owe the  industry money.    Zak said that payments from the Solidarity strike fund would  also be received by those taking part in the Solidarity strike  who were not union members and who were members of other trade  union federations.</p>

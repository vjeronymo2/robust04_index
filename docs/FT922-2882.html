			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Management: Personality comes into fashion - What a woman wears to work speaks volumes about her position and prospects in the organisation / A guide to the distinctive wardrobe categories For most female managers Power Dressing is something of a joke, featuring more in 1980s sex and shopping novels than in the boardroom. Even so, the issue of appearance, and how women may use it to reinforce or undermine their credibility, is increasingly being taken seriously by organisations concerned with female potential at work. One of the 'style consultants' these businesses are seeking out is Carolyn Miller*, who has advised women on Cranfield School of Management courses and at British Airways, Barclays Bank and BT. A Miller session can be an unsettling experience and needs to be approached with an open mind. Never since the parental comments of teenage days are course members likely to have been subjected to such honest personal assessments. Miller's target number one is: THE VICTIM DRESSER By her appearance, the Victim is abdicating responsibility and saying to her colleagues and superiors: 'I am not really here and I can only half do things.' She could be destined to spend her working life behind the filing cabinet and is unlikely to be picked for promotion. This unfortunate specimen may be recognised, says Miller, by her 'poor-quality clothes, lack of make-up, little flat shoes and hair hanging down over her face or tied back with an elastic band'. THE TART She is easily spotted, says Miller, in her 'dingly-dangly earrings, scent, ultra high fashion clothes and electric blue mascara'. Like the Victim, she will not be given responsibility: 'A tart would never be counted on - she would leave you picking up the tab.' Both the Victim and the Tart will be discriminated against, ignored and patronised at work, Miller warns: 'They allow men to play their power games, rather than dressing as men's equals.' Anyone at a Miller session sitting in a neat navy suit, congratulating themselves on having escaped the two previous stereotypes, could find themselves the next target. THE TOLERANCE DRESSER She lives life as an obligation, bound in every direction by conformity. Miller reserves a special depth of feeling for The Tolerance Dresser. 'It's what gets out of the commuter trains and is the most insidious way of being.' Clean, polished but unadorned and boring, the Tolerance Dresser dresses out of a sense of obligation - for the tribe and not as an individual. Real power dressing is far from the jutting shoulder pads and drop-dead suits of the 1980s. It comes through what Miller calls dressing 'Active Participation'. This is achieved through a combination of quality, colour and style. The first is something that English women, according to Miller, are particular bad at: 'They fritter their money away buying too many cheap clothes.' They often fail, too, to dress their rank - Miller uses the military term deliberately, seeing, for example, earrings as 'badges of office' and necklaces as 'jugular protection'. Colour 'shows you are alive, your heart is beating and you're not afraid to be seen,' she says. Colour analysis is relatively familiar territory - a number of companies offer to tell you whether you are an autumn, spring, summer or winter person - and therefore which shades suit you best. Miller has had politicians as her clients: Sir David Steel has been told to wear longer trousers and cut down on the dark colours and large-striped shirts; thanks to her, Ken Livingstone 'looks less like a salesman now,' she says. More unusual is Miller's method of helping clients arrive at a sense of style. 'Dress who you are as well as what you are,' she instructs. To help you find out who you are, she uses a personality test based on the Chinese principles of Ying and Yang - the two supporting and opposing factors of the universe. Sceptics may balk, yet Miller has claimed great success in sorting women into a handful of wardrobe categories. Her basic types include: DRAMATICS 'Witches and Darth Vaders' who need to dress in slightly wicked, tailored clothes with strong, dark, contrasting colours, and bold patterns. CLASSICS Formal and territorial by nature, they are best suited to the polished, chic look, upswept hair and medium-scaled jewellery. NATURALS At the other extreme, these 'pirates, gypsies and ragamuffins' can wear long skirts, flowing scarves, blended and muted colours, looser hairstyles. GAMINES Miller describes these as fun, creative and very stubborn, who come into their own in neat, sharp clothes. They can wear primary colours, shorter skirts, coloured tights, pump shoes and boxy jackets. INGENUES 'Princesses and fair maidens, a very English look' - who suit feminine, small-scale patterns, pearls and mid-tone colours. ROMANTICS This last type are 'starlets, poets, entertainers and tarts with hearts of gold'. The Romantic should go for glamorous clothes and steer clear of checks, stripes and a masculine tailored look. This type can get away with diamonds before six, says Miller, noting that not many Romantics are to be found anywhere near the average office. To those women who remain unconvinced that any of this really matters - particularly not for work - Miller points out that work 'is what pays the mortgage and supports your lifestyle'. Work deserves the best, if only out of good manners, she says: 'If I'm paying to see a solicitor, I want her to look as if she's enjoying her job. I don't want her to look as though she'd rather be at home doing the gardening.' *Carolyn Miller Associates: Tel 081 444 6911.</p>

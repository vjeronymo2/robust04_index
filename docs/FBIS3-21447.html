Narasimha Rao, is in  Davos, Switzerland, to find takers for his economic reforms  package. In an increasingly competitive market for international  capital, restructuring an economy by itself is not enough. It  has to be marketed and sold. Davos' World Economic Reform  provides an excellent advertising platform to draw the West's  attention to the changed Indian economy.    India being a latecomer to the restructuring game, Mr Rao  faces an uphill task in selling his government's reforms.  Countries which started reforming earlier or have taken their  restructuring further are already capturing significant chunks  of global capital. Mr Rao will need to make a pretty strong  sales pitch to convince international investors India also  offers high and safe returns on their investments. But no amount  of hard sell can push an inferior product.    So what is Mr Rao pushing? The government has been  highlighting its success on three fronts--reducing the fiscal  and current account deficits and containing inflation. The  fiscal deficit has been brought down from 8.4 per cent of the  gross domestic product [GDP] in 1990-91 to 5.7 per cent in  1992-93. The current account deficit is currently $2.6 billion,  down from $7.7 billion in 1990-91. Inflation has been brought  down from 12 per cent in 1990 to around 8 per cent now.    Yet government profligacy, despite claims to the contrary,  has not been reined in. The 1993-94 fiscal deficit displays all  indications of settling at around 6.5 per cent of the projected  GDP. With industrial output stagnating in the first half of the  year, GDP growth projections of 5 per cent now seem optimistic.  The deficit ratio could be considerably higher.    This year's fiscal mismanagement has been touted as a  politically induced aberration. There are some aspects of  India's fiscal correction for which official explanations are  not so readily forthcoming. The revenue deficit is now about  half the fiscal deficit and growing. Fiscal correction has  largely been at the cost of capital formation. Capital  expenditure has declined from 6 per cent of the GDP in 1990-91  to 4.3 per cent in 1992-93. The government is now offering only  17 cent [as printed] budgetary support for infrastructure  projects.    The trade deficit contraction has come out of a reduction in  imports rather than significant export growth. Imports have been  controlled more by domestic demand recession than by any policy  change. Since 1991 import tariffs have been reduced. But the  average tariff cut has been less than the devaluation of the  rupee, thus giving imports an advantage. The government is  usurping credit for the largely exogenous growth of exports in  the latter part of 1993-94 although it has not achieved much by  the way of controlling inflation.    The spectacular decline in the current account deficit this  year is largely due to an exogenous jump in foreign portfolio  funds flowing into India. This inflow has more to do with the  state of recently opened Indian stock markets than with  macro-economic indices.    Inflation in India is driven mainly by agricultural  production, the fiscal deficit and monetary expension. Net bank  credit to the government is growing around 12 per cent over the  past couple of years. Money supply growth is averaging over 15  per cent, way above target. Fortunately for the government, the  monsoons have been generous for five years in a row.  Inflationery pressures have been dampened largely by good  harvests. Monetary and fiscal correction cannot claim credit for  this.    But the major weakness in the government's reforms programme  remains in the government's attitude towards the exercise. The  emphasis has been on making them look good on paper.    There is no economic logic in the government's including  divestment receipts in its revenue account. There are of course  International Monetary Fund loans whose dibursements depend on  the size of the deficit. What is surprising is the IMF has  accepted the government's accounting procedure which  incorporated divestment receipts to compress the fiscal deficit  by 0.5 per cent of the GDP over the past two years.    Similarly, the government's definition of the primary  deficit  subtracts gross rather than net interest payments from the  fiscal deficit. This does not make sense either but helps  present a better picture. The Reserve Bank of India, too, has  not sterilised burgeoning foreign exchange reserves,  disregarding its effect on the price line. Here again the  emphasis has been on advertising short term achievement at the  cost of future export efficiency.    In fact most of the restructuring so far has been done with  an eye on revenue generation. The government is yet to address  the really important issues, the high capital-output ratio and  labour market reforms.    That India remains a high cost economy is not seriously  debated. And the government roll back in capital expenditure is  not helping matters. Liberalisation is not laissez  faire. If the idea is for India to evolve into market  socialism, the government cannot overlook its role in  infrastructural development.    As long as infrastructure remains the bottleneck, hopes of  reducing the capital-output ratio could remain just hopes. More  alarmingly, there is a complementary nature between private  investment and infrastructure that the government can afford to  ignore at its own risk. Mr Rao would benefit from a closer  scrutiny of the Chinese experience where a minimum social  overhead capital was generated before foreign capital was  invited in.    Apart from infrastructure, the other major area where the  government has a major role to play in market socialism is in  social spending. But expenditure on health and education have  been declining in real terms since reforms began. The government  has not been able to resist cutting expenditure on these  accounts to keep its books in better shape.    Labour market reform has been on the cards since 1991. It is  still on the cards. The government has been on the verge of  taking tough decisions for the past one year. But somehow they  never seem to materialise. The attitude most discernable here  has been wait long enough and the problems will go away. The  idea is not replace retiring employees. Then by 2000, there will  be no overstaffing. The question is whether India can wait so  long.    Mr Rao has hidden behind politics to explain its lack of  enthusiasm on reforming the labour market. The government's lack  of majority, we have been told, has held it back.    Mr Rao has managed to cobble an absolute majority in  Parliament in his three years in power. Yet an exit policy is as  distant as it was when he assumed office. The present government  has a year and a half to go. Two Southern states go to the polls  later this year. With them, the runup to next year's general  elections begins. It is difficult to envisage the government  taking on the unions at this juncture.    Unless the government begins to take stock of the runaway  revenue deficit and monetary expansion, infrastructural and  human resource constraints and labour market reforms, the actual  investment climate will continue to remain inclement.    Taking hard decision is sadly not Mr Rao's forte. But if he  is to raise international confidence in the Indian economy, hard  decisions are what he will have to take. Posturing at  international fora is one thing, backing up claims is another.</p>

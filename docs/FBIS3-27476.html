The three tasks  set by the central authorities have been successfully carried  out to various extents. Negative and decadent phenomena have  been somewhat restrained; the masses have been initially aroused  to action; the number of corruption cases reported by the people  has increased sharply; and several activists daring to fight  corruption and good party members and good cadres serving the  people industriously and honestly performing their official  duties have come to the fore."    The meeting, which was called by the Yunnan Provincial CPC  Committee, was designed to sum up experiences to further carry  out the antigraft campaign successfully. The provincial  procuratorate and higher people's court briefed the meeting on  how cases had been investigated and dealt with.    According to the statistics, procuratorial organs across the  province last year placed on file for investigation and  prosecution 1,348 economic cases, including corruption and  bribery, of which 749 were serious and important cases. Of all  the cases placed on file, 13 involved 1 million yuan each, and  12 involved cadres at the county or section level and above. A  total of 1,285 cases involving 1,524 people have been closed.  Through trials, illicit money and stolen goods totally worth  39.07 million yuan have been recovered.    The anticorruption campaign has won the wholehearted support  of the broad masses of the people. Last year, the procuratorial  organs heard 3,248 cases reported by the masses, and the number  of cases reported in the August-December period was 2.4 times  that of the previous seven months. Of all the cases placed on  file for investigation by the procuratorial organs, 53 percent  were reported by the masses.    A number of serious and important cases were made public at  the meeting. The most spectacular cases were against the former  deputy chief of the provincial personnel department who took a  bribe of 200,000 yuan and a certain person called He, the former  chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, who  embezzled 2 million yuan in public funds. In commenting on the  successes, people here are saying that the provincial government  meant what it said this time.    Provincial Party Committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphasized:  "We must not overestimate the achievements made in the recent  anticorruption drive and must not be content with these initial  successes. We must be ready to carry out the struggle for a  long time. We must, in accordance with the law and discipline,  resolutely handle and promptly close those cases for which we  have conclusive evidence, regardless of who is involved and in  spite of any interference.</p>

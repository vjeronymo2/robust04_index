			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO HELP SCHOOLS RELIEVE  OVERCROWDING  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to help officials of the Los  Angeles Unified School District solve the district's growing overcrowding  problems.  </P> <P> The council agreed Tuesday to set up a joint committee with the district after  hearing Board of Education President Jackie Goldberg call for an end to the  "historic separation between our decision-making."  </P> <P> The committee will look into ways that the two governing bodies can work  together to find new school sites, replace housing lost to new schools, plan  for future enrollment and lobby in Sacramento. Goldberg said it is important  for the council to consider school needs when deciding zoning and planning  issues.  </P> <P> Several council members applauded Goldberg's efforts. Overcrowding in the  schools "is a critical, critical problem. . . . We have only seen the tip of  the iceberg on this problem," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said.  </P></p>

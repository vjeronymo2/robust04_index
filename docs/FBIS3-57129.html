"A Gerashchenko-Fedorov tandem is something that cannot  exist  in the Russian economy today," Chubays, who also heads the State  Property Committee, said at a conference in Moscow on Thursday.  But he said it was essential that Fedorov should stay in the  government, because "losing him would be a heavy blow to the  reforms and the Russian financial policy."    The government's composition will most likely be approved on  January 21, Chubays said.    He said that, as long as the government was headed by  Chernomyrdin, the basic privatization principles would not be  changed. "Too much has already been done in the field of  privatization, and the State Duma, even if anti-government  sentiments get the upper hand in it, will have to realize it.  If I remain in the government in my present capacity, no  alignment of forces will be able to stop privatization," he said.    To date between 45 and 50 percent of the state property has  been privatized, Chubays said. This includes 70 percent of  service industry enterprises with staffs of under 200. Of the  14,500 large industrial enterprises subject to  denationalization, 11,000 have already been privatized. Over  110 Mn Russians have already used their privatization checks,  half of which have been exchanged for shares in state  enterprises, Chubays said.</p>

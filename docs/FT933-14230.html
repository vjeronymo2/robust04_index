			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Observer: Chinese walls 'Nothing to worry about, there's always a bit of unrest at this time of the year,' Britain's Beijing embassy assured visiting members of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee in May 1989. What they'd inquired about was student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square - which left some of the visitors with what one of them, Conservative Michael Jopling, terms 'the view that the embassy was not in touch with what was going on'. With the committee planning to go to Beijing again, Jopling yesterday asked the subsequently appointed ambassador, Sir Robin McLaren, in London between talks with China about Hong Kong, if the embassy's eyes were sharper these days. Perhaps more used to silken diplomacy than direct confrontation, the envoy replied that he had read all the embassy's cables in 1989 and could assure the committee members that it had been 'by no means complacent or dismissive'. Nor was his snapshot of the present position likely to change Jopling's view. Communist countries were difficult to understand, it went, rather like a lake with black water and currents running beneath the surface. The present situation in China was 'very interesting' and the ambassador could not predict the future with confidence.</p>

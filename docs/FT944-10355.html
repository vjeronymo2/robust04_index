			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Germans flexible at last on credit cards The international credit card may finally have found a home in Germany despite the best efforts of the German banks to stop it happening. Credit cards have, for years, had doors slammed in their faces as Germany clung to its cash and cheque culture. In restaurants, waiters would take offence at the sight of a card. Shops cashiers would simply refuse to take them. Even now, despite having made some ponderous headway, there are still just 9m cardholders in Germany compared with an estimated 37m in the UK. Now Deutsche Bahn (DB), the state-owned railways, will turn its popular railcard into a joint venture with Citibank, the US bank which is one of the world's largest providers of credit cards, offering travellers all the advantages of a Visa card. The Bahncard or railcard, which offers half-price travel on the entire network, was introduced a couple of years ago and already has 3m customers. Both DB and Citibank forecast Bahncard sales will rise significantly with the new attractions. Foreign banks have accused the Germans of using every trick in the book to keep their cards out of the market. Citibank says it made DB an offer at the beginning of the year. The railways, one of the symbols of German efficiency and effective state stewardship, have been turned into a joint stock company as a first step towards privatisation and were having to look at new ways of making money, especially as administering the Bahncard was costing them about DM20m (Pounds 8m) annually. Other banks made alternative offers and a final decision was expected in September. But then, as Mr Volkert Mindermann, a spokesman for Citibank, put it, 'in the middle of the night' there was an offer from the Gesellschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS), a peculiarly German organisation set up by all the domestic banks to manage Eurocard, the leading credit card in Germany which has around two-thirds market share. GZS, representative of the collective nervousness of its owners at a large and emblematic foreign intrusion into the local credit card market, apparently offered to hand the entire annual revenues from the card - estimated at around DM150m - to DB if it were given the business. But they reckoned without the federal monopoly authorities in Berlin who began making enquiries to see whether GZS might be creating a cartel (being operated by too many banks), and before they could open a formal investigation, the Eurocard offer was withdrawn. 'The German banking community is still fighting against credit cards,' Mr Mindermann said. 'They think everything can be done with the Eurocheque card and they'll try anything to keep foreigners like Citibank out,' he said. Citibank also estimates it will have revenues of between DM100-DM150m a year which it will share with DB. 'But we need to keep some of the money to cover our costs,' Mr Mindermann said. But while Citibank has succeeded in ripping a large hole in the fenced off German market, it may be a while before other credit card companies will be able to slip through it. American Express, which has just 1.2m cardholders in Germany, is still locked in a court battle with the Zentrale zur Bekampfung unlauteren Wettbewerbs - a title which translates as the Centre for Combating Unfair Competition - an organisation which has been policing German competition law since early this century. This tight policing probably does not surprise American Express. 'It's a question of habit,' says a local Amex official. 'Germany is very much a cash society. 'It was also difficult when they first introduced cheques and it was even more difficult to persuade people to use cash machines' in the eighties, she said. The Zentrale hauled American Express in a year ago for offering another company's products (free flights) in an attempt to boost its own sales. That, said the Zentrale, was a breach of the Zugabeverordnung, a law which forbids the offer of free gifts with the sale of goods. American Express has since had to stop marketing the promotion. They are still 'optimistic' that they will win the court case but are wondering why the Zentrale has not, in the meantime, taken action against Lufthansa, the national carrier which offers a promotional package including car rental and hotel stays from companies which are not their own. American Express would not comment. But it may just be that the German national carrier is having a blind eye turned towards it, while outside competitors remain in the fixed gaze of the authorities.</p>

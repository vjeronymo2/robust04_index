			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA AS MUSIC AND AS THEATER  </P> <P> Times music critic Martin Bernheimer gave readers a perceptive and sensitive  review of the commendable musical achievements of the Music Center Opera's new  production of "Idomeneo" ("Meddling With Mozart," Sept. 27).  </P> <P> The conductor, orchestra and singers gave elegant, virtuoso performances, just  as Bernheimer reports.  </P> <P> However, Bernheimer's editors did us a disservice by not also assigning a  theater writer to review this magical new production designed by Maurice  Sendak. Bernheimer really misses the mark in his lengthy (70% of his review)  diatribe against the stage direction and design of the production.  </P> <P> The producers of this new "Idomeneo" remember that opera is theater as well as  music. And this production is very good theater.  </P> <P> JOHN H. WELBORNE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

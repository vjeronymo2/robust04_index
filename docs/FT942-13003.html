			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: The Vienna smiles for Muti Leipzig, Amsterdam, Vienna: three great orchestras of the world converged on London over the course of a long weekend. Baggage collection at Heathrow must have been interesting, as assorted violins and cellos, trombones and timpani fought for space going round on the carousel. For its European series the Vienna Philharmonic is visiting Berlin, Paris and London three times a year, each programme with a different conductor. The last of this season's trio was Riccardo Muti, on Monday at the Royal Festival Hall. In Salzburg Muti and the Vienna orchestra have become regular partners, especially in Mozart operas, where Muti demands a highly-strung intensity a long way from the laid-back playing most of his colleagues get. That did not come across so forcefully in London. In the outer movements of Beethoven's Eighth Symphony Muti was vigorous and emphatic, getting more attack out of the violins than they would have given Bohm, but the inner movements were featureless - not witty or pointed at all. The Vienna musicians play Stravinsky less often, which may account for an extra sharpness of concentration. The divertimento from the ballet Le Baiser de la fee is uncharacteristically romantic Stravinsky and Muti drew rich textures, lyrical phrasing wherever the opportunity presented itself. The wind playing was immaculate, as ever, and he teased out a delightfully Viennese lilt. For the main work they turned to Tchaikovsky proper, the Fifth Symphony. Like other Italian conductors, Muti is interested in Russian composers (not only Tchaikovsky, but also Scriabin and Prokofiev). He takes a red-blooded view of this symphony, wholeheartedly supported by the Vienna players in full cry, but the high drama of the performance teetered on the self-conscious. A Russian showman like Svetlanov is more likely to get to the heart of the matter. With the encore we perhaps came closer to Muti's heart: the Overture to Rossini's Il viaggio a Reims, played by bubbling wind soloists, brass now on a tight rein, and strings untidy but effervescent. Muti smiled and one sensed that the orchestra smiled too. Next season the Vienna Philharmonic returns for another European series, when the three conductors will be Giulini, Haitink and Ozawa.</p>

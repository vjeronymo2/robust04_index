			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Personal View: A losing proposition If the voters in the US presidential election had been UK businessmen, the outcome would have been very different. A recent Harris poll of European Community business leaders showed that 70 per cent of those in the UK supported Bush. Is it possible that this finding is connected with President-elect Clinton's plan to 'crack down on foreign companies that prosper here and manipulate tax laws to their advantage'? As UK shadow chancellor Denis Healey once promised to tax the wealthy until their pips squeak. Does the same fate now await foreign investors in the US? Who would be hurt by such a policy? Arguably the UK stands to lose the most as the largest investor in the US, accounting for 27 per cent of total foreign direct investment at the end of 1991, compared with 21 per cent by Japan and 15 per cent by the Dutch. Democratic Senator Al Gore, the Vice-President-elect, has warned that the Democrats plan to raise taxes on all companies in which the foreign ownership stake is at least 25 per cent; the figure of an additional Dollars 45bn tax from foreign-owned US corporations over the next four years has been quoted by Clinton. This is an enormous amount and it is impossible to predict exactly what the consequences would be for US business under foreign ownership. But there could be a withdrawal of foreign investment, closure of a number of foreign-owned concerns and an enormous disincentive to new foreign investment into the US. To put it in perspective, Dollars 45bn is almost twice the total amount of tax collected from foreign-owned US corporations over the entire six-year period of 1983-88. Clinton's current proposal is to raise this additional Dollars 45bn by stricter enforcement of existing law and not by introducing new legislation. His main target will be the manipulation of prices at which goods are sold from abroad to the US. He would also increase the numbers of lawyers working on these transfer pricing cases, which would add substantially to the already heavy compliance burden on foreign investors. However, if Clinton fails to raise the required extra revenue, as seems likely, will he feel obliged to bring in additional measures? An indication of possible action that might be taken against foreign investors can be found in a discussion bill introduced last year by Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the important House Ways and Means Committee. One proposal was to impute profits to a foreign-controlled corporation, based on an industry average. It is not difficult to imagine the effect of having to pay tax on this imputed profit for a loss-making US subsidiary of a UK parent company. At the time both US Treasury officials and a Clinton spokesman expressed their disapproval of this proposal, but if future tax revenues are below expectations, there could be pressure to resurrect it. There are a number of cogent reasons why the US should not take specific action against foreign-owned corporations: The US already has the most sophisticated anti-avoidance tax law in the world. It has detailed transfer pricing rules that can be used to ensure that imports into the US are not overpriced and thus US net income reduced. Furthermore there are 'anti-earnings stripping' provisions which prevent profits being taken out of the US by way of a tax-deductible interest charge. Any action would almost certainly be discriminatory and breach the US's double-tax treaties, although this has not proved a disincentive to Congress in the past. Fear of possible retaliation. The US itself is by far the largest overseas investor in the world; at the end of 1989 the US accounted for 28 per cent of all foreign investment worldwide. Many countries could be expected to consider counter-measures. The UK has made it clear that retaliatory action  -by denying tax refunds to US companies receiving dividends from UK subsidiaries - could be introduced almost immediately. This could cost US companies millions of dollars. As a practical matter the US legislative machinery is notoriously tortuous and there must be a fair chance that any proposals could either fall by the wayside or be so emasculated as to pose a threat to foreign investors no longer. Obtaining information is always a problems for tax authorities, but of all nations the US already has the most extensive, detailed and onerous reporting requirements placed on foreign investors which undertake transactions with their US subsidiaries. Probably the most persuasive pressure for not taking action will come from within the US itself. Many US states are currently doing their best to boost their flagging economies by encouraging foreign investment, while those states which already have such investment will not look kindly at measures which may drive foreign investment away. Foreign investors need to press their case immediately, but I believe they have right on their side. It is my hope that this issue will be another case of 'read my lips'.

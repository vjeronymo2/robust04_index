			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> A BRASH MIX OF BRASS TUNES AT THE BARCLAY  </P> <P> Friday night's concert by the Empire Brass was a study in contradictions, of  virtuosity with amateurism, of calculated effect with aggressive overstatement,  of variety with monotony. The concert -- the first presentation of the Orange  County Philharmonic Society in the new Irvine Barclay Theatre -- was nothing if  not frustrating.  </P> <P> The program itself turned out to be a miscalculation. It consisted of a  hodgepodge string of hit tunes, jazz, Broadway, classical, mostly short and  mostly upbeat. It was like eating dessert all evening. "Summertime," Polovstian  Dances, Peer Gynt . . .  </P> <P> The players -- Rolf Smedvig and Jeffrey Curnow, trumpets; Eric Ruske, horn;  Scott A. Hartman, trombone; J. Samuel Pilafian, tuba -- stand center stage  while performing, bells (even the French horn's) pointed directly at the  audience. Forget subtlety. They play the music aggressively, expertly, loudly.  They don't persuade, they slam home their points with gusto.  </P> <P> As intermission approached, one of the players announced that the group's  compact discs would be on sale in the lobby. When intermission arrived, there  were the players themselves selling them. At $15 a pop.  </P> <P> Smedvig announced that both his music and his tuxedo had been stolen from his  hotel room. He appeared in shirt-sleeves and played from memory. He also showed  fatigue as the concert progressed. The group's arrangements (the program  consisted of nothing but arrangements, all uncredited) reveal little variety of  timbre, all of the musicians playing most of the time. It becomes fatiguing to  the ear. And Smedvig, who played lead all evening, grew tired. Why not allow  Curnow a few numbers?  </P> <P> They play well, both individually and as a group. Hartman impressed with his  slippery smooth solo in "Caravan." Ruske had two extended features in a row,  revealing muscle and flexibility. Smedvig dashed up and down the trumpet all  night. Pilafian contributed some dazzling low-note comedy. But the whole was  definitely less than its parts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Laura Blumenfeld, a graduate student at Columbia's School of International and  Public Affairs, writes (Commentary, June 18) that American Jews "have got to  wake up" and begin to openly criticize Israel's policies on the West Bank and  Gaza, for only then can we begin to move towards a just and peaceful solution.  </P> <P> She is not the first American Jew to say so; many Jews, both here and in  Israel, have criticized Israel's policies on many issues.  </P> <P> But these same Jews do not seem upset that there are absolutely no Arab voices  raised in criticism of Arab policies (either past or present) regarding the  conflict between Israel and its neighbors.  </P> <P> Surely, there must be American Arabs who feel that "their side" is not always  the "good guy with the white hat." Where are their voices? When will they speak  out loudly and in public against the inconsistencies of Arafat, against the  terrorist plots of Abu Abbas, against the bellicose pronouncements of Iraq's  Suddam Hussein, against the increasing violence of Muslim fundamentalists, and  against the murders of moderate Palestinians by their own people? When will  they stop making excuses for atrocities committed in the name of "their" cause?  </P> <P> Only when both Jewish and Arab voices are heard will peace truly have a chance  to succeed.  </P> <P> GABRIELLE RABIN TSABAG  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

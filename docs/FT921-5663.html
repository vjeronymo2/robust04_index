			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkey to launch Dollars 150m issue THE APPETITE of international investors for high-yielding sovereign bonds will be tested again today, with Turkey expected to launch a Dollars 150m five-year issue. Lead-managed by Bankers Trust International, the bonds will be priced to yield 255 to 275 basis points more than US Treasury bonds, close to the yield of Turkey's outstanding bonds in the secondary market. Bankers were yesterday anticipating a yield spread at the tighter end of this indicated range. The deal, which will carry an investor put option after three years, will be Turkey's first public Eurobond issue since the Gulf crisis began in August 1990. The deal is the first part of a Dollars 1bn funding programme planned this year. Elsewhere, Uruguay is expected to tap the international bond market with a Dollars 75m three-year issue in three months, adding to the roster of Latin American states which have raised funding in the international bond market. Lead-managed by JP Morgan Securities, the deal will be Uruguay's first international debt issue since the debt crisis of the early 1980s. Last year, the country rescheduled debt with its bank creditors. The coup attempt last month has not damaged the appetite of international investors for Venezuelan bonds. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDV) recently raised Dollars 400m three-year and 10-year funding under its international medium-term note programme via Chase Investment Bank. They are the first such issues by a Latin American borrower. The three-year notes were priced to yield 235 basis points more than US Treasury bonds of a comparable maturity and the 10-year notes were priced to yield 297 basis points more than Treasuries. PDV is majority-owned by the government, which has a long-term debt rating of Ba1, one notch below investment grade. Turkey is currently being rated and anticipates a triple-B rating, two notches higher than Venezuela.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc prices fall sharply as closure plan collapses Zinc prices fell sharply yesterday after European producers admitted that their attempt to end over-capacity by the co-ordinated closure of one or two smelters had collapsed. The price had been in free-fall since Tuesday as rumours spread that the closure plan was to be abandoned, but it continued to retreat and touched Dollars 963 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange at one point yesterday, nearly 7 1/2 per cent below the Dollars 1,040 it reached last week when optimistic noises about the so-called smelter shut-down agreement were still emerging from the industry. In late trading zinc for delivery in three months regained some ground to close at Dollars 969.75 a tonne, down Dollars 13.25, or more than 1 per cent, from Wednesday's close. Analysts suggested there was strong technical support between Dollars 940 and Dollars 960 a tonne but even this level might be vulnerable if investment funds returned again as determined sellers. There was considerable disappointment among producers that a second attempt to deal with the structural overcapacity that had plagued the European zinc industry for 20 years had come to nothing. Only a week ago Mr Jacques Spaas, secretary-general of Eurometaux, the Brussels-based organisation that has provided a forum for the producer talks, said a formula had been worked out and producers now only had to agree to support it. The arrangement would have involved one or two European smelters being closed and the expense being shared by the industry as a whole - provided the European Commission gave its approval. Yesterday a short statement from Eurometaux said the talks had been suspended and no new meetings were foreseen but added: 'It is still believed that the overcapacity in Europe has to be addressed and that structural changes within the European zinc industry will have to occur. Developments over the last months are demonstrating that such changes are beginning to take place'. Producers refused to discuss the reasons for the collapse in negotiations. It is known that they were particularly concerned about anti-trust problems. Mr Wim de Graaf, general manager of the Budel smelter in the Netherlands, said on Tuesday that there were still 'quite a lot of legal issues involved'. Also, since discussions started in June, the industry's outlook has been transformed by the financial problems of two big European groups - Metallgesellschaft of Germany, which owns the Rhurzink smelter, and the Spanish banking combine, Banesto, which controls 58 per cent of Asturiana de Zinc. These are now under new management. Metaleurop, the French offshoot of Germany's Preussag, has also reported big losses recently. Zinc stocks on the LME have doubled in the past year and moved above 1m tonnes for the first time last week. Industry-wide stocks are over 1.5m tonnes and Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, suggests that annual output cuts of 500,000 tonnes are now required to bring the market back into balance.</p>

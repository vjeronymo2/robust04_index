			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Arts: The fine art of spoiling tactics - Radio Recently visiting Prague, I noted the logo of a black bow-tie on posters for the Classical Music radio station. While Radio 3 tries to popularise classics with blokey accessibility the Czechs' selling-point is glamour after dowdy egalitarianism. Our own Classic FM tends to the latter, with its prize 'romantic weekends in the East Midlands' and genteel commercials for Black Magic, investment advisers and Palmolive - whose products you may sample from reception at Classic FM itself. How can the BBC compete? I know from bitter experience that passers-by are refused even a bath-salt in the lobby of Broadcasting House. Spoiling tactics are part of market practice; Classic FM has this to a fine art. Last week it countered Radio 3's live Romeo et Juliette from Covent Garden with a recording of the same composer's Faust. This is hard on the Corporation whose current opera-drive includes non-musical dramatisations of well-known opera plots. Knee-jerk objections at the form's inanity overlook the fact that most successful operas were based on books or plays anyway. Sunday's Vie de Boheme, by John Clifford after Henri Murger, was quite jolly and as well acted and directed as most drama on Radio 4. Bracing to be reminded that Puccini's romantic garret-dwellers were con-men and trollopes. North British listeners can enjoy Radio Scotland's The Score. Such apparently esoteric themes as Xennakis' trombone concerto and music-publishing in 18-century Edinburgh are presented with unpatronising friendliness by Elaine Navickas who gets it just right. Perhaps Nick Kenyon of troubled Radio 3 should lend an ear. Radio Scotland also scooped the week's oddest news story: the MP for Monklands East battling with the Benedictine brothers of Buckfast Abbey over their 'medicinal wine' which has apparently turned North Lanark's youth into a race of drunks. Eighty per cent of the monastic output finds its way north from Devon (those monks know their market). 'I should have the healthiest constituents under the sun,' she said (apparently not). What would Radio 4's rebarbative Moral Maze make of it? The curiously composed team of ethical experts includes the historian David Starkie who sprang to media fame in a TV mock-trial of Richard III some years ago, when he flew into a tantrum, insulted a distinguished barrister and hurled schoolboy rudeness in all directions. He has now set up in garrulous pomposity on his own account. He is well partnered by Edward Pearce of The Guardian, notable for angrily shouting 'you fool]' at an elderly Jew expressing concern at the rise of Italian neo-fascism. I seek moral guidelines elsewhere. Not with pharisaic local authorities, however. Saturday saw the launch of Scapegoats (Radio 4), whose uncompromising title nails its accusing colours to the mast. Hugh Prysor-Jones began with single parents and a reminder of pregnant women driven over the parish boundary even in labour so as not to be a local financial burden. More to come, including travellers and homosexuals; and more that sounds uncomfortably familiar. On Remembrance Sunday Angela Rippon softened her schoolmarm persona to talk to a wide range of soldiers and civilians on Radio 2. Simple questions prompted profound responses, as with the nurse whose precise Scots tones faltered when she recalled Belsen survivors; or the Korean war amputee, military antecedents going back to Waterloo, wondering when it would all end (there are currently 17 wars involving British personnel). The absence of rancour, the lack of rage compared favourably in the sensitivity stakes with the average Guardian journalist.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by "brother leader of the revolution" Colonel </F> Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to preachers, teachers, and students of  Arabic and Islamic studies on 15 February; place not given --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We have told them that it was  impossible for someone to hand over his sons to his enemy.  However, there is a condition: should there be an Islamic  court, with an Islamic jury, before which Libyans could stand,  then, as far as I am concerned, whether this court is set up in  Britain, America, France, Egypt, or Malta, the venue would not  matter any longer. As long as we have put a condition that an  Islamic court would be better, whether it is in the center of  Britain or America, this would be better. If the judges are  Muslims, and prosecution is Muslim, and where the court opens  its session with Koran recitation, then we would accept it.  [cheers] Should there be a court like this which meets this  condition, then, I will consider it an historical action, and we  will not mind whether they [the suspects] be given a capital  punishment. This would not matter; what matters is that an  historical event, a historical turning point would have taken  place.    As Muslims, our condition, regardless of Scotland or Britain  because this is an international issue, is that the court is a  Muslim one. We do not mind the venue of the trial as long as  the judges are Muslim and as long as the court opens session  with Koran recitation. [passage omitted] Let us expose them and  confirm their hostility to Islam by letting them face this test  and this court. [passage omitted]    Libya is flying the flag of Islam and the flag of struggle  and the holy war. It is inconceivable that the position of  Libya should be similar to that of any submissive state, which  receives orders from Paris, Washington, London, and Tel Aviv.  No way.    I would like to set up a significant group that should bear  this burden and put up with this holy war in the month of  Ramadan. You should go and meet Shah Mas`ud, Rabbani, and  Hekmatyar. Libya should be the one to end this fighting between  Muslims. Anybody who refuses to halt the war, Libya should send  forces to fight him in accordance with the Koran. [passage  omitted]    We should implement this verse and announce that anybody who  disobeys, we should fight him in accordance to what God has  decreed. Either I select a group from you, or you choose one, to  go, with my permission, to meet those brothers of ours. Libya  should be the one responsible for finding a solution to the  issue of Afghanistan. These are Muslims who are killing one  another during this holy month of Ramadan; children and women  are killed; mosques are being destroyed and cities demolished,  torture is everywhere, it is Satan who now rules Afghanistan.    It is the Christians, nonbelievers, and Jews who are behind  this war. This situation is similar to the one when Iraq and  Iran declared war against one another. The United States used  to supply Iraq with arms, exactly as did Israel with Iran. You  have seen this; and this has been proven in full view of the  whole world. Can you imagine this? The United States and the  Israelis, who are two heads of the same spear, decided to arm  Iraq and Iran. What is important to them is that Muslims should  be annihilated. Even these days, they are plotting against  Afghanistan, and they are arming each side.    We should not arm each side; we should bring reconciliation  against them, and anybody who refuses to do so, we should send  forces to fight them. This is what the Koran decreed, and we  should implement what the Koran says; this has been tried before.    Even the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be left to  the Christians. There is a republic called Bosnia-Herzegovina  that should become independent. The talk about  Bosnia-Herzegovina is but a political issue, the real issue is  the annihilation of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which  represents a crusading war. We should expose this war. We are  friends of the Yugoslavs, the Serbs. The Orthodox doctrine of  Russia and Serbia is close in nature to Islam.    It is anti-Catholic and anti-protestant. However, now there  is an agreement and a plot in which the Orthodox doctrine finds  itself in opposition to Islam. There is an anti-Islamic plot  which, in addition to Bosnia-Herzegovina, will also affect  Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, and Turkey, and then the Arab world.  Consequently, a new crusading war will be declared.    We Libyans should also send delegations to Yugoslavia. We  should tell them that you Serbs have been our friends since  Tito's days, the Orthodox doctrine is similar to Islam; you  should not fall into the plot of the Catholics, the Protestants,  the Christians, and the Israelis. The issue of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is one thing, where as the annihilation of  Muslims in Bosnia is another thing. We are against the  annihilation of Muslims; we should stand by them in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. As for the political war, i.e the  independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, border demarcation, etc.,  this is another issue that relates to all republics of the  former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]    A delegation should go to Somalia to meet Aydid, Ali Mahdi,  and the president of the Somali land in the north. We must  reach a solution. We should implement on them what has been  implemented in Afghanistan. We should send forces, not America.  Libya should send forces which fight against the side which  rejects reconciliation. [passage omitted]    Britain and America are taking revenge against Egypt by  dividing it into two or more countries. Where do you think this  trend came from? Who told Iraq to invade Kuwait? It was  America. America told Iraq that because Iraq waged war against  Khomeyni, we [the United States] would give you Kuwait. He  [Saddam Husayn] believed this and invaded Kuwait. Once this was  done, they came and destroyed Iraq.    Who set fire to 100 oil wells? It was not Iraq. It was the  West and America, which for imperialist reasons, set fire to the  Kuwaiti wells. Because Iraq was defeated, it admitted it did  so. He [Saddam Husayn] did not do this. It was America which  burned the Kuwaiti oil.    We are saying that should the Kuwaiti and the Saudi  independence depend on the American forces, then this is a false  independence. They would be better off uniting with Iraq, which  they are fearing, or Yemen, rather than having their  independence dependent on the presence of foreign forces.  [passage omitted]    We hope that our brothers in Saudi Arabia recover their  senses and do not prevent the Libyan pilgrims to go by air to  Mecca. This would be a disaster. Last year, the Libyan  pilgrims defied them and went to Jerusalem as long as Mecca is  occupied. It would have been the same, Jerusalem is occupied  and so is Mecca. I am worried a delegation of Libyan pilgrims,  if prevented from going to Mecca, would go to the Vatican in  defiance of Saudi Arabia or the Arabs. This could happen.  [passage omitted]    We must announce our sympathy to the Kurdish nation. It has  got the right to unity and liberation. We want it to be a  sister nation which has got its position in the near east along  the other Islamic nations, the Arab, Turkish, and Persian ones.  [passage omitted]    How come the Christian interfere in the business of the Shia  and the sunnis? How can the U.S. ambassador reconcile between  Sanaa and Aden? Is it logical to see a Christian reconcile  among the Muslims, solve their problems, send their forces,  protect Muslims and their mosques. For us this is unacceptable.  This is our revolution, this is the true holy war for which we  were born and for which we are prepared to die. [passage omitted]    Libya defies the Christians and the Jews will which harm  Islamic sanctities, the dignity and honor of Islam. We defy  them even if we have to sacrifice millions of people; it will  not matter because this is a historic battle.</p>

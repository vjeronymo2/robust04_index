			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Positive Change"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. response to Jordan's request to suspend  the inspection at sea of ships bound for the Port of al-'Aqabah  is a victory from the Jordanian point of view. These inspection  operations are unjustified. They are an unacceptable  encroachment on the rights of Jordanian navigation and trade.    Although the U.S. decision does not fully respond to the  primary request to suspend the inspection operations, this  decision in itself is a very important step to remove the  political cover given to the multinational interception of ships  bound for al-'Aqabah. This task was assigned to an independent,  not-for-profit British company. This will not obstruct  navigation because inspections will take place in the Port of  al-'Aqabah, not at sea. Goods will be inspected after they  enter the port, not at sea. This will save companies and ship  owners from losses and delay.    Without doubt, this measure is an important retreat. It  restores the regional role and importance of and confidence in  the Port of al-'Aqabah. Persistent efforts to achieve this  objective were realized in the end. There is increasing and  renewed international satisfaction with Jordan's commitment to  international resolutions. There is also belief in this  country's need for compensation for the losses it suffered as a  result of the Gulf crisis and the sanctions imposed on it, and  that it does not need additional unjustified losses.    The U.S. response to the Jordanian request is a positive  change and a very important step in the right direction on the  road to ending all aspects of inspection. Jordan, along with  most of the international community, hopes the U.S. stand will  take the form of a more general and comprehensive stand to end  the various effects and repercussions of the Gulf crisis. This  is long overdue, now that the objectives and causes of the  crisis have ended. Jordan hopes this will be a chance to offer  compensation to the countries and peoples of the region that  have suffered serious losses and damages as a result of the  negative repercussions of the crisis, in order to open a new  chapter of security and stability.</p>

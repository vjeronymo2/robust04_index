			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DORNAN CREDITS THE PEOPLE WITH KILLING U.S. PAY RAISE  </P> <P> Members of Orange County's congressional delegation Monday applauded Speaker  Jim Wright's decision to let them vote on an unprecedented pay raise. And all  five said they intend to vote against the measure when it reaches the House  floor today.  </P> <P> "It was a great victory for representative government," proclaimed Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose 42nd District includes a portion of west Orange  County. Rohrabacher, like the other four members in the county delegation, all  Republicans, credited the public with forcing today's House vote on the pay  increase.  </P> <P> "The American people raised their voices to the point they could not be  ignored," he said in a telephone interview from Washington. "It's just too bad  that the American people have to scream until they are hoarse."  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox of Newport Beach said his staff in recent weeks has  received more than 1,000 phone calls and letters opposed to the pay raise.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for raising the annual salaries of members of Congress from  $89,500 to $135,000.  </P> <P> The pay raise proposal had stemmed from recommendations made by a presidential  commission. Besides the raise for members of Congress, it would increase the  pay for federal judges and top executive branch officials. Rep. Ron Packard of  Carlsbad, whose 43rd District covers much of south Orange County, said he would  have preferred that Congress allow the salary increase to take effect and then  rescind it so judges and top federal officials could have "gotten a pay boost  that's long overdue."  </P> <P> But now, "the whole thing is dead," he said.  </P> <P> Packard also contends that a defeat of the pay raise will "harden the resolve"  of congressional members to keep lucrative honorariums received from outside  speaking engagements and appearances. With no chance of improving their base  pay, Packard said, members will be reluctant to give up outside sources of  income.  </P> <P> "We didn't deserve the pay raise," said Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove).  "But don't limit our right to moonlighting. . . ."  </P> <P> Dornan defended honorariums as a legitimate way "to make ends meet." He  challenged the public and press to determine whether a lawmaker is abusing his  office by accepting too much outside money.  </P> <P> Cox was sharply critical of how the entire pay raise issue was handled. A  former White House attorney who won election in November to the 40th District,  Cox said he already had a "low opinion" of Congress when he took office in  January, and the attempt to push the pay raise through without a vote "knocked  that opinion down a few more notches."  </P> <P> "People were definitely exercised over this," Cox said. "I took one call from a  woman who complained that we have our mistresses and we have our bribes and now  we want more of the taxpayers' money."  </P> <P> Dornan said, "The boss simply wouldn't go for it."  </P> <P> In this case, the "boss" is the American people, who, Dornan said Monday,  became fed up with watching "the employees try to give themselves a raise" and  created a furor that has all but defeated the controversial pay package.  </P> <P> Though crediting the public's role in forcing the issue, Cox also praised the  efforts of Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton. Dannemeyer, using his  experience and understanding of House rules, introduced a resolution that  unexpectedly called for the vote on Monday, a move that caught Wright by  surprise. It forced the House Speaker to set the vote for today.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer could not be reached for comment Monday night, but a spokesman for  his office, Paul Mero, said the lawmaker had contemplated taking Monday's  action for several days.  </P> <P> "He just believed that someone has to take a stand and get this into the open,"  Mero said. "It's a sad commentary on Congress that this thing was sailing  through without a vote."  </P></p>

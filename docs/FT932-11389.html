			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Books etc offers full refunds to dissatisfied readers AT LAST, a solution for readers who get stuck at the second chapter of Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time, or find the latest over-hyped Booker Prize nominee heavy going. Books etc, a London bookstore chain, is offering to give a full refund on any book it sells. Its larger shops carry more than 100,000 titles. To get a refund, dissatisfied readers will only have to produce a valid receipt and return the books in saleable condition within 28 days of purchase. 'It really is a no quibble deal. You just get your money back. You are not asked why you didn't like it,' says Mr Richard Joseph, founder and managing director of Books etc, which has 10 shops in central London. Mr Joseph believes he is the world's first book retailer to offer and promote straight cash refunds on all titles. 'Some people will use us as a public library but I don't think many will. It's the chance I will have to take,' says Mr Joseph, who hopes the campaign will encourage readers to be more adventurous and buy books they may not have heard of or even fear they may not like. In a year which has seen one sales promotion backfire badly, as Hoover could testify, Mr Joseph is confident he is not setting a trap for himself. He hopes that extra sales will more than cover the returns. His record so far is good. A few years ago, Books etc agreed to swap Love In A Time Of Cholera by the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez if purchasers didn't like it. More than 3,000 were sold and only seven came back. The offer is the latest development in Britain's increasingly competitive book trade. So far much of the running has been made by Mr Terry Maher, chairman of Dillons, who has used selective discounts in his campaign against the net book agreement, which sets minimum prices for most books. Mr Maher said yesterday Dillons had always allowed disgruntled customers to swap books for a credit note. Managers also had the discretion to offer cash if that was what customers wanted. Mr Maher said he had not exactly shouted about the option. Mr Joseph, however, is making as much noise as possible with 4,000 advertisement cards on underground trains, 1,000 on underground escalators, 450 on the sides of London buses and in the Evening Standard newspaper. 'If it works, it will stay for good,' he said.</p>

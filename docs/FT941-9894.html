			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Regulator concern hits Recs Regulatory worries upset the power generators and regional electricity companies (Recs) yesterday, prompting sharp retreats across the board. The Recs were worst hit as NatWest Securities raised concern over their vulnerability to adverse news during the discussions with Offer, the industry regulator. The broker also believes selected stocks have been overbought, particularly in the light of what it considers 'overstated' values put on the National Grid, owned by the Recs and set for flotation, possibly next year. NatWest, which remains positive on the sector in the medium term, singled out Seeboard and Manweb as particularly vulnerable. Seeboard dropped 22 1/2 to 386p and Manweb 38 to 796p. The negative sentiment also saw Yorkshire down 29 to 682p, Midlands 36 to 702p and Northern 36 to 738p. In spite of the steep falls, the broker said it believed the shares are due for a further correction. However, others disagreed, among them Hoare Govett, which had the sector marked as a hold, and yesterday moved to a buy on selected stocks. PowerGen was another big casualty as the market fretted over today's decision from Offer on whether to refer the company and National Power to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the issue of pool electricity prices. 'It could go either way,' said one seasoned utility dealer. 'The shares are either going to rocket or fall out of bed.' Another said: 'A referral would mean a 10 per cent downside - minimum.' Yesterday's big fall in Powergen - down 17 to 525p - was said to be influenced by one leading house putting its money on just that outcome. National Power declined 12 to 461p.</p>

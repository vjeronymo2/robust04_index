			<p>940723 FT  23 JUL 94 / Cookery: Pep for puddings By this stage of summer, the first flush of excitement is over. No longer do many of us want to serve strawberries, raspberries and redcurrants simply with sugar and cream. This is the season for summer puddings, some variations on which are given below. Most of these recipes include a dash or more of citrus because nothing works faster than limes or lemons to bring out the best in scarlet fruits. Citrus will restore vibrant life to tired, woolly, over-ripe berries and currants and it is equally capable of rounding out the thin flavour of slightly under-ripe fruit. Limes are the lemons of the tropics. They exude more than a hint of the exotic with their scented acidity, which seems almost coconut-creamy. I use them more and more. My favourite lemons are sfusati, now sold by Safeway as Amalfi lemons at a hefty premium price. Very large, grown organically and exceptionally aromatic, their juice is refreshingly sharp, lacking bitterness. In Amalfi, the fruit is often peeled, sliced, dressed and served as a salad (just as oranges are sometimes served en salade with black olives in Morocco). It also makes fine lemonade, lemon curd, lemon souffle, and other sweet dishes - all with virtually no need for added sugar. Amalfi lemons are remarkably handsome, too, and growers prefer to export them with leaves still gracing their stalks. But Safeway is selling them stripped of the leaves and wrapped in cling film, which makes them seem rather charmless to buyers unaware of their special qualities. SUMMER SOUFFLE SURPRISE Based on a Constance Spry recipe, this takes very few minutes to prepare and will serve four in style. Success lies in good organisation. The oven must be pre-heated thoroughly to 425`F/220`C (gas mark 7) while the freezer should contain plenty of crushed ice and 1pt of the creamiest vanilla ice cream. Individual souffle dishes and  1/2 lb or so of ripe raspberries should be chilled in the refrigerator; the souffle ingredients should be measured out on the work-top and left ready. Beat two egg yolks with the finely-grated zest of a lemon and a generous tablespoon of lemon juice. Sit the souffle dishes firmly on crushed ice in a roasting pan. Spoon the ice cream into them and scatter the raspberries on top. Whisk the whites of the two eggs to snowy peaks, incorporating one dessertspoon of sugar gradually. Fold the yolk and lemon mixture into the egg whites and spoon the amalgam over the fruit. Slide the pan into the oven and bake for six minutes until the souffle mixture is softly set and golden, the fruit is no longer chilly and the ice cream is just beginning to soften. LIME TART WITH STRAWBERRIES Here is a delicious and pretty dessert for six (or eight if appetites are modest). Wild strawberries are sold by smart greengrocers and can sometimes be found in supermarkets. Alternatively use  1/4 lb- 1/2 lb ordinary strawberries, sliced. How much juice a lime will yield varies greatly: play safe and buy four. Make some pate sucre with 6oz plain, white household flour, 3oz butter, 3 egg yolks and 2 1/2 oz sugar. Wrap it and chill for at least 30 minutes before using it to line a 20cm (8in) cake tin with spring-clip sides. Chill again for an hour or longer. Meanwhile, prepare and chill the filling. First, beat 5 eggs. Reserve a spoonful or two to seal and glaze the pastry. Add 6oz sugar to the rest and beat until soft and foamy. Then beat in the finely-grated zest of 3 limes and just over 4 fl oz of lime juice. Stir  1/4 pt double cream until smooth and blend it into the lime mixture. Line the pastry case with grease-proof paper and beans, and blind-bake it on a hot baking sheet for 15 minutes at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6). Remove the beans and paper, brush the pastry with the reserved beaten egg, and bake for 5-8 minutes more until the pastry is set firmly. Ladle the filling into the pastry case. Reduce oven heat to 300`F/150`C (gas mark 3) and bake for 70 minutes. Let the tart cool completely in the tin: this will take about four hours. Then, cut the pastry level with the filling and un-mould the tart. Serve it on the day of baking, covering the lime custard with strawberries, whole or sliced, just before serving. WILTSHIRE JUNKET WITH RASPBERRY PUREE Junket is one of those old-fashioned foods you tend to forget about then re-discover with glee, for rich versions are every bit as good as coeur a la creme - and less fiddle to make. When cream is used, the texture of junket is delicate and rich, slipping down the throat silkily. If the mixture is meanly milky, the results may be perilously thin and bursting with whey. Look out for Burgess rennet essence in good grocers (my local Waitrose stocks it). Today's brew seems to produce a firmer set than it used to and, sensibly, bottles now are marked with the expiry date of the rennet's potency. For four people, mix  1/2 pt single cream with  1/2 pt creamy (gold top) milk. Warm gently to blood temperature (98`F) with 2 teaspoons vanilla or caster sugar. Away from the heat, quickly add 1 teaspoon rennet. Stir to mix well and divide between four small glasses or bowls. Leave undisturbed at room temperature for about three hours. Serve topped with raspberries for garnish, and a jug of raspberry puree ( 1/2 lb of raspberries sieved and sweetened with 1oz icing sugar, or to taste). Blackberries, loganberries or mulberries can replace the raspberries. LEMON CURD ICE CREAM I am quoting this from Leith's Cookery Bible (Ebury, Pounds 20). It is good served with crumbled amaretti biscuits and a handful of fresh berries (strawberries, raspberries or blackberries) with a matching berry puree to sauce it. I have also used it half and half with rich vanilla ice cream when making summer souffle surprise. To serve six people, put into a small saucepan 4 egg yolks; the finely-grated zest and juice of 2 lemons; 4 1/2 oz caster sugar; and 4oz unsalted butter at room temperature and cut into dice. Place over gentle heat and stir until the butter has melted and the curd coats the back of the spoon. Allow the curd to cool, then stir 1pt natural yoghurt into it. Cover closely and freeze. Put the ice cream in the refrigerator about an hour before serving.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a meeting on 7 February President Zhelyu Zhelev,  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, and Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov discussed current issues of Bulgarian foreign policy.  Presidential Spokesman Valentin Stoyanov supplies further  details:    [Begin Stoyanov recording] Basic attention was devoted to  the visit of Lord Owen and Stoltenberg to Bulgaria and the  forthcoming Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of countries  bordering on former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria's position is as  follows: It will participate in the meeting only if the foreign  ministers of all invited countries participate. The president  expressed his doubt whether this meeting could contribute  anything to achieving peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially  against the background of Saturday's [5 February] massacre in  Sarajevo.    It was again pointed out that Bulgaria's position on the  situation in former Yugoslavia remains unchanged. Bulgaria  opposes any armed involvement in the conflict of Balkan or other  countries bordering on former Yugoslavia. In the past other  countries joined this position, and recently Greece repeated  that it adheres to the same position. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> NEW CURRICULUM TO BLEND BASIC COURSES WITH THEMES  </P> <P> The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District Board of Education has allocated  $165,000 toward a plan to improve the quality of education at four elementary  schools and one high school.  </P> <P> A new curriculum is being introduced at Foster Road, Johnston, Gardenhill and  Walnut elementary schools and La Mirada High School.  </P> <P> All of the schools will integrate basic courses such as math and English with  different educational themes, said Marie Plakos, assistant to Supt. Robert  Aguilar. As an example, at Foster Road, students will study the environment,  and Walnut students will study the performing and visual arts.  </P> <P> The entire community, including parents and civic and business leaders, will be  invited to participate in the project, Plakos said. "We feel this is really a  key to motivate students to learn," she said.  </P> <P> Funds will come from the district's lottery allocation and will be used to hire  four employees who specialize in the various disciplines.  </P></p>

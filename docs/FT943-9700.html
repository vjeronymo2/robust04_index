			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Russian private employment up More than half Russia's workers are now employed in the private sector as the country continues to develop a market economy, the government said yesterday. The latest report from the state statistics committee did not say exactly what share of the economy is now in private hands, but it said Russia now has nearly 1m small businesses employing 9m people. A majority of workers are now employed in the private sector and 70 per cent of state-controlled industry has been turned over to private owners since market reforms began in 1992, it said. Two-thirds of these privatised enterprises are profitable, it is claimed.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Fiscal neutrality rules - The Budget / The aim is to tax employees equally THE BUDGET headlines were stolen by the chancellor's switch of the tax burden from the community charge to VAT. But budgets also offer the Treasury and the Inland Revenue the chance to close old tax loopholes, and to offer new tax incentives. There was no new product to rival last year's Tessa, but there was plenty to keep the financial adviser busy. One prominent area was the continuing crackdown on employee perks. The tax advantages offered by company cars have been steadily under assault during the 1980s, and there was a further attack, including the imposition of employers' national insurance charges, this time. Mobile phones, if available for personal use, also became a taxable benefit. The idea is that employees should, in the long run, be taxed equally, whether they are paid in kind or in cash. This principle of fiscal neutrality also showed itself when the chancellor abolished higher-rate tax relief on mortgage interest payments. That change had been expected for some time, and was softened by the simultaneous increase in the higher-rate tax threshold. Another area where action had been widely anticipated was offshore trusts. By rolling up their investments offshore in a trust, some well-off individuals had been able to postpone, in some cases virtually indefinitely, the payment of capital gains tax. Although it will still be possible to delay tax on an offshore trust's gains until a capital payment is made to a UK resident beneficiary, a supplemental charge will be added. This will be, in effect, a charge on the deferred tax which 'should' previously have been paid on the gains rolling up in the trust. The charge will be levied at 10 per cent of the deferred tax for every year, up to a maximum of six, that the gain is held in the trust before being paid out. The change will remove many of the apparent advantages of having an offshore trust; but Caroline Garnham, tax partner with solicitors Taylor Joynson Garrett, feels that the supplemental charge may be so complicated to administer that it will be abolished before it reaches the statute book. The Revenue also produced a consultative document about onshore trusts, which represented an attempt to simplify the rules on trust taxation. The general intention is to bring the taxation of trusts in line with that of individuals. On this page, we highlight some of the other changes in the Budget. And articles throughout the Review also include details of Budget announcements, where relevant.</p>

Support to the demand was issued in the name of the European  Union [EU] by Greece, in its capacity as the current presiding  member of the EU, as well as by Iceland, Canada, Denmark and  Poland, said Toivo Klaar, head of the political department at  the Estonian Foreign Ministry.    All speakers at the meeting also said the issue of the troop  withdrawal must not be linked to any other topic. They  expressed hope that negotiations between Estonia and Russia will  go on.    A representative of Poland in his speech said concentration  of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad region was causing worries  and leading to a destabilization of the situation in the region.    Russia at the meeting repeated its earlier position,  speaking  about the need to resolve the issues "in complex." The Russian  representative also said 90 percent of the troops his country  used to have in the Baltics had been pulled out.    The Latvian delegation at the meeting was more optimistic,  saying Russia and Latvia were closer than ever to concluding an  agreement, a representative at the Estonian Foreign Ministry  added.    The head of the ministry's political department said all  senior officials at the Prague meeting represented their  countries' foreign ministers.    Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Mari-Ann Rikken also announced  that the ministry had received a statement by Germany's  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in reaction to the recent statements by  Russia. Kohl in the message says that the Baltic Sea is no less  an European sea than the Mediterranean, and, therefore,  countries situated on the coasts of the Baltic Sea must belong  to the EU.</p>

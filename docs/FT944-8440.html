			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): How to choose the right fund - Scheherazade Daneshkhu has some suggestions Anyone who wants to invest in a broad spread of equities through a unit trust faces the basic choice of investing for 'income' or 'capital growth'. Unit trusts are divided into different sectors by the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds - the industry's trade body - which makes it easier for investors to find their way around the 1,500-odd unit trusts on offer. The UK equity income sector might seem a natural place for anyone wanting an income to place their money. But funds within the sector are very different and the type you choose depends on your income needs and tax position. Q. If the funds are all in one sector, presumably they pay out similar levels of income? A. No. There is a good deal of variety. Some funds lay the emphasis on 'total return' to provide income and capital growth; they tend to have a lower yield - or payout - than others which aim to deliver the highest possible yield. Yields ranged from 1 to 9.9 per cent at the beginning of November. Q. I have heard that unit trust managers can charge their annual management fees to capital instead of income. What effect does this have? A. Until recently, these charges had to come off the 'profit' or income of the fund and could not be deducted from the capital base, but new rules introduced earlier this year allow income trusts to do so. (Capital growth funds are still not allowed to charge to capital.) Some unit trust companies including M&amp;G, the largest, are opposed to charging to capital but others, such as Save &amp; Prosper, HSBC, Invesco, Schroder and Credit Suisse, are already doing so on some of their funds. The main effect is to increase the yield and, therefore, income available to the customer. Annual management charges tend to be in the region of 1.5 per cent, so a unit trust with a yield of 5 per cent can, as a result of the change, post one of 6.5 per cent without altering the composition of the fund. In practice, unit trust companies which have bought lower-quality stocks for their high yield, may pass on only part of this increased yield to the customer and use the rest to buy higher-quality stocks with better capital growth prospects. Q. That sounds like good news, so why the opposition? A. It is good for those seeking as much income as possible, but they should also be aware that charging to capital can reduce the size of their capital or constrain its future growth. The danger is that by receiving an increased payout, investors may think they are getting something for nothing. M&amp;G's Rachel Medill says: 'No one will be better off in total return terms by charging to capital. You are not taking charges out of the profit but out of the base capital, and that is what is providing the income growth.' Taxpayers, particularly at the higher-rate, should also be careful because they will be taxed on the 'extra' income. Q. Can't you pay less tax by choosing to take less income? A. This is one of the most common investor misunderstandings, according to Ian Chimes, managing director of Credit Suisse investment funds (UK). 'They think that if they do not take the income, they will not be taxed on it.' In fact, it makes no difference if you take the income or choose to have it re-invested - it will be paid to you (or re-invested) net of basic-rate tax. Higher-rate taxpayers must pay the difference. The exception is when the unit trust is bought within a tax-free personal equity plan. 'The Pep allows an investor to re-invest income gross until it is needed when distributions can be paid, again, gross,' says Mike Webb, sales and marketing director of Prolific Unit Trust Managers. 'Many income unit trust Peps are sold on the basis of pre-retirement planning precisely because for this reason.' Q. How do I re-invest income if I do not want to take it? A. If you want to re-invest income, it is best to choose an income fund offering accumulation as well as income units. Accumulation units automatically invest the income generated by the fund to buy more assets, which pushes up the price of the units. Income units, as the name implies, pay out income at set dates. If you try to re-invest it, the fund buys more units, so the number you hold will increase. But Clive Boothman, managing director of Schroder Unit Trusts, says there is a disadvantage: 'If a fund has only income units, re-investing is perfectly possible but may incur front-end charges which are absent when re-investment takes place in accumulation units.' Some funds will waive the front-end charge but you might still end up paying a bit more this way because of the spread - the difference between the purchase and selling price - of the underlying assets. You can tell if an income fund has accumulation units by looking at the FT's managed funds pages. Q. I am a higher-rate taxpayer - is there a more tax-efficient way for me to take income from unit trusts? A. Yes. Less than 0.5 per cent of the population pays capital gains tax while most pays income tax. Yet, you can make up to Pounds 5,800 of gains tax-free, thanks to the annual capital gains tax allowance. So it is a good idea to try to take income in the form of capital gain. You cannot take returns solely as capital gain in an income unit trust because (as described above) the pay-out is treated as income for tax purposes. The alternative is to invest in a capital growth unit trust and to sell units periodically to provide yourself with an income. The gains will be tax-free, as long as you do not exceed the CGT allowance. Some capital growth trusts have a yield. Try to avoid these because the income will be taxed at 40 per cent (as a higher rate taxpayer), regardless of whether it is taken or re-invested. Chimes says many higher-rate taxpayers prefer Far East or US trusts which pay no income, for this reason. But take care with this method - if you withdraw too much capital, the chance for future growth will be damaged.</p>

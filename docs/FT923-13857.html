			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Hydro ahead 35% to Pounds 125m A SHARP increase in sales south of the border enabled Scottish Hydro-Electric to achieve a strong increase in profits in its first year since flotation. For the 12 months to March 31 profits at the pre-tax level rose 35 per cent to Pounds 125.3m on a pro forma basis. A proposed final dividend of 6.91p makes a 10.16p total - a level covered 2.5 times by earnings of 25.3p. Total sales of electricity and related services rose 18 per cent to Pounds 638m. But within this, sales to England and Wales were up 58 per cent at Pounds 116.8m reflecting the group's strategy of targeting the non-Scottish market for its fastest growth. A portion of the rise in profits also came from lower than expected fuel costs. High rainfall enabled the group to draw more heavily on its hydro resources, while oil costs fell slightly. Against this there were higher coal and nuclear costs. The retail business saw turnover rise 9.3 per cent to Pounds 29.4m, where it yielded a profit of Pounds 1.2m - a small rise on the previous year. Sir Michael Joughin, chairman, said the reported level of profits was necessary to improve the group's power stations and distribution network. Mr Roger Young, chief executive, said there were a number of projects in the pipeline that would add to profits in the years ahead. These included the start-up of the flow of low-cost gas from the Miller field to the group's plant at Peterhead later this year, improvements in the electrical connections with England over the next two years and the start-up in early 1995 of its joint venture power station with Norweb at Keadby in south Humberside. Mr Young said the group's aim was to raise its dividend by 6 to 8 per cent in real terms at least until the regulatory review of electricity pricing in 1995. COMMENT The result was slightly better than market expectations but the shares closed 5p lower at 199p. One reason was that Scottish companies have always commanded a premium in the market because of their stronger image and the tighter terms on which they were launched. But the result also contained hints of possible limits on future growth. Analysts felt that the profit 'kickers' that management has talked about in the past - like Miller gas - could be less powerful than once thought. Emission controls will also define the expansion of output. Next year's profit growth will be much more modest, possibly only in single figures, emphasising that the first flush of privatisation is over. The prospective multiple is about 10.5.</p>

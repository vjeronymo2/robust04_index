			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Attack on 'misleading' holiday brochures BRITAIN'S biggest holiday companies are producing misleading brochures two years after the Association of British Travel Agents introduced a code of practice on the subject, according to a study by Holiday Which? magazine. Thomson, the UK's biggest tour operator, described Faliraki on Rhodes as a former fishing village which had retained its traditional atmosphere. Holiday Which? said it was 'really a sprawling, Costa-style resort with high-rise hotels, masses of souvenir shops, fast-food joints and loud music blaring from bars.' Enterprise, part of Owners Abroad, the second biggest holiday company, told potential visitors to some apartments that shops, tavernas and nightspots were within easy reach. In fact it was half a mile's walk to the nearest, solitary bar. Airtours, the third biggest operator, published a brochure with a picture of a beach on the same page as a description of a hotel. Holiday Which? found that the beach was 12 miles from the hotel. The magazine found examples of brochures issued by other operators which contained photographs taken in such a way as to hide unsightly features including incomplete building work. Under a European Community directive on package holidays which takes effect at the beginning of next year it will be an offence for tour organisers or travel agents to supply misleading or incomplete brochures. Abta said its 1990 code had resulted in a 60 per cent decrease in complaints about misleading brochures. Mr John Dunscombe, Abta's president, said: 'Travel brochures should be totally transparent. Whilst holidays are made of dreams, we must ensure that these dreams are actually attainable.' The quality of holiday ferries ranges from filthy facilities and poor service to elegant comfort, Holiday Which? said. Ferries operated by P&amp;O and by Sealink Stena featured among those praised as well as among those condemned.</p>

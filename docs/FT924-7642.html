			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Records: Jazz with fire, faith and soul IT IS 20 years since pianist Keith Jarrett teamed up with ECM producer/proprietor Manfred Eicher for the first in a series of intense solo explorations which included The Koln Concert, reputedly the best selling solo piano record ever. The Vienna Concert (ECM 1481 513 437) is the latest in this distinguished line of improvised solo recordings from Jarrett. With characteristic passion, he says: 'I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself.' Certainly, 'Vienna' is a spark-free zone whose appeal lies instead in drawing the listener nearer to a warm fire of gentle melody which is given space in which to wax. His playing on this live recording, beautifully reproduced by Eicher, and his temperament are sublime. Coming in between his recording of Shostakovich's 24 Preludes and Fugues and a tour with the Standards Trio in memory of Miles, gentle Vienna sounds almost an antidote to the two. Slow burning throughout its 68 minutes of intensity, Jarrett's tone is evenly burnished, the right hand fanning the melody, the left independently but darkly stoking the rhythm. In the background and thankfully at a safe distance Jarrett moans and emits the anguished utterances which have become a controversial feature of his concerts. If, as its accompanying notes claim, the solo series is a diary that mirrors Jarrett's progress as an improvisor, The Vienna Concert is a sign that the enfant terrible of the concert hall is beginning to mellow. Every home should have a copy for the cold winter nights to come. A new album you will not find lying around the Jarrett household is Pontius Pilate's Decision (RCA Novus PD90669) from Delfeayo Marsalis. Jarrett has gone on the record as saying he reviles the Marsalis clan, which comprises tenorman Branford, trumpet playing Wynton, trombonist Delfeayo and drummer Jason in order of seniority. All of them appear in this saga, which charts Christ's progress to the cross, at one time and another contributing to a seriously swinging piece of work. That 26-year-old Delfeayo should already have three Billboard No 1 albums under his belt as producer as well as film soundtrack credits (Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, Mo Better Blues and Jungle Fever) suggests hot-housed precocity. But Marsalis's handling of a potentially cheerless theme like this is far from naive and features some inspired writing in its 70 minutes. Although, like so many Marsalis family projects, Pontius Pilate's Decision is a well wrought and highly organised affair both Wynton and Delfeayo's mercurial horns compensates for any intermittent longueurs. British tenorist Courtney Pine, like Delfeayo Marsalis, found a following early in his career and, against the odds, has grown older gracefully (he is 28). Like Marsalis, he is also a spiritual young man who makes vivacious and open music. To The Eyes of Creation, (Island 514044) his latest album, is a rich celebration of all that has gone towards moulding his peculiarly English jazz sound - from John Coltrane to Bob Marley; from psalms to soul singing via knees-up ska rhythms. Not only does the material give vent to Pine's alternately abandoned and melodious improvisation on tenor and soprano, it also showcases many of his talented British peers: pianist Julian Joseph, drummer Mark Mondesir and bassist Gary Crosby among others.</p>

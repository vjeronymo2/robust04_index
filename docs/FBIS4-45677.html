			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 18 (CTK) -- In his talks with his  Austrian counterpart, Thomas Klestil, last Friday [15 April],  Czech President Vaclav Havel interpreted the Czech Government's  stance towards the nuclear power plant now under construction in  Temelin, South Bohemia, a spokesman of the Czech Industry and  Trade Ministry told CTK today.    The two presidents met at the two-day Central European  summit  in Litomysl, East Bohemia.    In Litomysl, Havel told Klestil that according to all  analyses, the Temelin project was the only chance for the Czech  energy industry, and its level would be equal to that of Western  facilities of its kind. Havel said he was sure that it was  necessary to complete the power plant so that brown coal mining  and burning could be cut down. Havel also promised Klestil  Prague would provide Vienna with every necessary information on  possible emergencies.    The Austrian Press Agency APA has reported that Havel said  that no more nuclear power plants would be built in the Czech  Republic after the completion of Temelin. APA quoted Klestil as  saying that Havel thought the Czech Republic would shift to  other forms of energy production within 10-15 years.    Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy estimates  the minimum operation-life of the Temelin power plant at 25-30  years, his spokesman told CTK.</p>

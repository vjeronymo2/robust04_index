			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / People: Doctors' champion moves to the BBC Pamela Taylor, the BBC's new director of corporate affairs, was not one of the widely tipped favourites for the job. There had been rumours that Liz Forgan, number two in the Channel Four hierarchy, or Edward Bickham, Douglas Hurd's special adviser at the Foreign Office, would take over from Howell James who is off to join his old mentor, Lord Young at Cable &amp; Wireless. As the BBC limbers up for protracted negotiations with the government over renewal of its Royal Charter in 1996 it was widely thought that someone with Bickham's calibre of political contacts was just what was required to follow in Howell James' footsteps. Before joining the BBC, James had been with Capital Radio, TV-am and worked with Lord Young in government. Bickham was a former director of communications at the late British Satellite Broadcasting. However, the BBC has recruited a skilled public relations professional in the 43-year-old Taylor. She did not go to university and started at the bottom of an advertising agency. After a spell with BUPA, the private health care group, she joined the British Medical Association press office in 1977. She arrived at the BMA at a low point in its fortunes. It was widely regarded as a trade union whose prime purpose was to protect the interests of well-paid doctors, rather than a professional body serving consumers. Its nick-name at the time was the British Money Association. Taylor set up the BMA's parliamentary lobbying effort in 1980 and took over as head of public affairs in 1985. During her time at the BMA there has been a considerable improvement in the public perception of the organisation and it has become a much more effective parliamentary lobbying group. She will probably be best remembered for the BMA's high-profile advertising campaign against the government's plans for the national health service. However, she herself is more proud of the parliamentary lobbying work the BMA has done in areas such as seat-belt legislation, curbs on tobacco advertising and drinking and driving.</p>

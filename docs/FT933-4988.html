			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Cadbury fails to sweeten up Dr Pepper DR PEPPER/Seven-Up and Cadbury Schweppes have often eyed each other longingly but seem unable to agree who should wear the trousers. Whether the US company is determined to stay independent - or merely playing hard to get  -is as uncertain as the ultimate intentions of the UK group. Cadbury, which raised its holding in Dr Pepper to 25.9 per cent last month by buying a 20 per cent stake from the Prudential insurance company, has not ruled out further share purchases eventually. But its immediate aim is further co-operation. That suggestion has been coolly received by Dr Pepper, which has indicated that its idea of closer links would involve taking control of Cadbury's north American beverages business. Dr Pepper makes most of the UK company's soft drinks concentrates in the US and distributes some of its brands there. What is beyond dispute is the industrial logic favouring a link-up. Added to Dr Pepper's 10.6 per cent of the US soft drinks market, Cadbury's 3.4 per cent would create a force better able to stand up to Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the industry leaders. A deal would provide much needed sales channels and distribution power for Cadbury's US soft drink sales, which rely on a fragmented network of small bottlers. In return, Dr Pepper's portfolio would gain from the addition of Cadbury's profitable range of niche brands, including Schweppes, Sunkist and Canada Dry. Elsewhere, the two companies' strengths are reversed. Cadbury's operations in Europe, Australia, Africa and Latin America would benefit Dr Pepper, which is weakly represented in international markets, where Seven-Up in any case belongs to PepsiCo. Though Dr Pepper is highly profitable, its expansion is constrained by heavy debt, the legacy of a 1986 leveraged buy-out in which Cadbury participated. The UK company, by contrast, would bring to any deal a robust balance sheet and strong cash flow. Nonetheless, many analysts think Cadbury would be pressed to pay the Pounds 1.5bn or more needed to buy the rest of Dr Pepper. Some think a better option would be to trade control of its American drinks business for a bigger stake in the US company. But any such outcome would require the pair's mutual attractions to prevail over suspicion of each other's motives. As Mr David Lang, of stockbrokers Henderson and Crosthwaite, says: 'They are natural bedfellows, but neither wants to be date-raped.'</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): EC works councils find approval MANAGEMENT and employee representatives involved in prototype European works councils are satisfied with their operation, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions said yesterday. Its report looks at the experience of the dozen European works councils, most of which have been established by French multinationals. It concludes that more will spring up voluntarily even if the European Community directive on making works councils compulsory fails. The British government is strongly opposed to compulsory works councils, but the issue could be pressed by the 11 other EC states through the social policy 'protocol' established at the Maastricht summit. The authors of the report, Mr Michael Gold of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Mr Mark Hall of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at Warwick University, say existing councils share many features. Most meet only once a year to provide group-wide information, discussion of national issues is not allowed, consultation is unusual and 'negotiation entirely non-existent'. The authors say managements find them useful to explain company strategy, especially in relation to restructuring, although some managements fear they might become a platform for Europe-wide collective bargaining. Employee representatives find them helpful for information-gathering and establishing closer links between unions.

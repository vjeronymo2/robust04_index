			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Menzies 'a step more than satisfactory' with Pounds 30m RESULTS of John Menzies for the year to May 1 were 'just that step more than satisfactory', Mr Ranald Noel-Paton, group managing director of the retail and wholesale group, said yesterday. Pre-tax profits under FRS 3 jumped 85 per cent from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 16.6m, reflecting heavy restructuring costs a year earlier. Mr Noel-Paton said pre-tax profits from continuing operations under previous accounting standards grew at a more modest 17 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 25.7m). Turnover was Pounds 1.17bn (Pounds 1.1bn). Distribution services drove the profits advance with a rise from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 20.9m at the operating level on turnover ahead at Pounds 768.1m (Pounds 705.5m). Mr Noel-Paton expected the MMC investigation into news wholesaling to be published about September. Sales volumes and profits fell at TBD largely because of poor demand for music. Total Book Distribution, now folded into TBD, saw book sales rise 10 per cent. On a like-for-like basis Universal Office Supplies lifted sales 12 per cent, though including the acquired RMG they rose 22-23 per cent. Operating profits on the retailing side slid to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.3m) on increased turnover of Pounds 375.7m (Pounds 356.2m). Here progress at Early Learning Centre, where sales were up 12 per cent and profits 'almost in proportion to sales', was offset by a 'slight' profits fall and 3.5 per cent sales growth at John Menzies Retail. Mr Noel-Paton said the 156 non-confectionery/tobacco/newspapers and non-station bookstall outlets in the 274-strong chain were to be revamped away from a generalist to a multi-specialist approach. Cash flow was a bright point, enabling borrowings to be reduced by Pounds 16m to about Pounds 8m, said Mr Noel-Paton. Consequently interest charges tumbled to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 4.1m). FRS 3 earnings leaped to 35.3p (15.5p) and continuing earnings to 34.6p (28.4p) per share. The annual dividend is lifted to 10.8p (10p) with a 7p final. COMMENT Thought of as solid, rather than adventurous, Menzies' management has at last grasped the nettle at JM Retail, installing a new managing director with a brief to give it an identity on the high street. To help with this, capital expenditure is expected to rise from Pounds 15.5m this time to Pounds 20m. However, the chain operates in a dull market - especially newspapers and music - and the scope for improvement may be narrow. The wholesale side remains impressive, illustrated by the - admittedly acquisition-driven - 20 per cent sales growth at UOS in a tricky market. The unknown quantity is the outcome and fall-out of the MMC report, though it's likely to be neutral or worse. Assuming about Pounds 32m pre-tax pencilled in for the current year, the group is on a prospective p/e of 13.9. The shares are near the sector rating and perhaps have run ahead of themselves.</p>

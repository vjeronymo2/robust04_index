			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carmen Parra: "Government Increases Minimum Wage </F> by 3.5 Percent and Completes Labor Reform Measures"]    [Text] Madrid -- The cabinet yesterday completed the  package of labor reform measures. It approved six measures,  only one of which -- the new trade union election regulations --  has been agreed to by the trade unions. The measures concerning  reforming dismissal, collective bargaining, and regulations  governing apprenticeship contracts, and increasing 1994 pensions  by 3.5 percent are rejected by the trade unions and are the  catalyst for the 27 January general strike. Agreement als has  not been reached concerning the increase in the  interprofessional minimum wage, which is scheduled to rise 3.5  percent -- the figure proposed by the government.    Yesterday's cabinet meeting was of a markedly economic  nature. The government approved the outstanding labor reform  measures, including a draft bill reforming the Workers' Statute  in the sections concerning dismissal and collective bargaining.  It includes a measure on trade union elections, to which the  main trade unions agreed, and is the only agreement reached in  the dialogue process, which has been taking place since August.    A second draft bill legalizes temporary employment agencies.  The government approved regulations which finally pave the way  for introducing apprenticeship contracts and amending the terms  of part-time work and practical training, and gave the go-ahead  for the measure on establishing a schedule for various 1994  social-security pension brackets.  <H5>  Pensions Increase </H5>   The increase in all pensions from 1 January, as envisaged by  the overall state budgets, will be 3.5 percent, and it is  accompanied by a review clause which will be applied if real  inflation is higher than forecast -- 3.5 percent. This  guarantee clause embodies the formula proposed by the trade  unions, although full agreement was not reached in the  negotiations with the government because of some loose ends.  Total 1994 expenditure on pensions will be 5.8 trillion pesetas  -- 8.6 percent higher than this year. The maximum state pension  will be 254,140 pesetas per month, equivalent to 3,557,960  pesetas per year.    The 1994 interprofessional minimum wage (SMI) will increase  by 3.5 percent, in contrast to the 6.5 percent proposed by the  trade unions, which were demanding the recovery of the lost  purchasing power. The SMI for workers over the age of 18 is set  at 60,570 pesetas per month and 847,980 pesetas per year. For  those under the age of 18, it will be 40,020 pesetas per month  and 560,280 pesetas per year. Temporary workers over the age of  18 will be paid 2,870 pesetas per day, and those under the age  of 18, 1,896 pesetas.    Labor Minister Jose Antonio Grinan said after the cabinet  meeting that the aim of the labor reform package is for "every  possible job to become a reality." The government hopes that  the measures approved yesterday will enjoy as much support in  parliament as the reform of personnel recruitment achieved  Tuesday -- over 90 percent. If any kind of agreement can be  reached with the employers' organization or with the trade  unions, it will be embodied in the texts submitted to the  Congress [of Deputies].    Yesterday, Grinan stressed once again the government's  desire  to reach an agreement on incomes for the next few years,  although it will undertake no initiative beyond what the  employers' organization and the trade unions decide, because  "the responsibility" for negotiating the agreements rests with  them.    In order to complete the package of measures approved  yesterday, only regulations concerning the implementation of  personnel recruitment reform remain. This reform involves  introducing subsidies for enterprises -- mainly small  enterprises -- that hire unemployed people receiving  unemployment benefits.    Jose Antonio Grinan specified yesterday that the government  wants these initiatives to enjoy the greatest possible agreement  among the political parties, and that the government is  considering to which groups this assistance should be allocated  and what kind of measure to introduce in order to ensure that  the resources devoted to unemployment help establish active  employment policies.</p>

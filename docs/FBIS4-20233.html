			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- The EU [European Union]  was considering Wednesday [27 April] contributing to the  construction of two new nuclear reactors in Ukraine if Kiev shut  down completely the Chernobyl plant, the European Commission  said.    A Commission spokesman said the 12-member European Union was  considering the move as one of a series of aid options for  Ukraine proposed by the EU's executive.    The building of the two new reactors would take years, the  Commission said, adding that the proposal envisaged financing to  ensure the gradual decommissioning of the two reactors still  operating at Chernobyl, the scene of the world's worst peacetime  nuclear catastrophe in April 1986.    The remaining reactors are responsible for around 7 percent  of Ukraine's energy production.    The Commission wants the two reactors to be phased out,  along  with an assurance that a third reactor at Chernobyl, shut down  last year after a major fire, will not be reopened.    On Monday in Moscow Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  warned that only foreign aid and alternative energy sources  could secure the closure of Chernobyl nuclear plant.    The same day French Environment Minister Michel Barnier had  pleaded for the partially crippled power station to be shut down.    Barnier said Chernobyl's number four reactor -- which  exploded eight years ago -- urgently needed to be topped off  with a second protective bunker.    But Kravchuk said that Ukraine alone was incapable of  funding  the closure of the complex.    "The West only provides helpful slogans and has yet to give  us the financing it has promised," he said, adding that, unless  the security of the whole complex could be guaranteed, "Europe  will find itself under threat of another misfortune."    In 1992 and 1993, the EU accorded Ukraine a total of 61  million dollars to fund staff training programmes and additional  security measures in the country's nuclear power sector.    Wednesday's Chernobyl offer was one of a package of  proposals  to shore up Ukraine's battered economy covering the agricultural  and nuclear energy sectors.    Funding for the programme could be cleared rapidly if it is  approved at an EU meeting May 16 and 17, the Commission  spokesman said.</p>

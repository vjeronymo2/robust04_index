			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Takis Dhiamandis from Tirana] </F>   [Text] Greek-Albanian relations, which appear to be hanging  by a thread as the Albanian leadership still follows a policy of  continuously stirring up tension that already exists between the  two countries, are being led to boundary points.    According to evaluations from Tirana, some U.S.  organizations  are possibly behind this tension. A simultaneous action from  Turkey, which if not a part of this crisis is surely exploiting  it, is not ruled out.    Some observers go even further by saying that the explosion  that has been expected in Kosovo or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] may happen at the Greek-Albanian  borders. The Albanian leadership has every reason to pursue  this alternative out of its political deadlock.    Apart from the domestic situation, which goes from bad to  worse, the leadership of the Democratic Party and Albanian  President Sali Berisha have failed in their foreign policy.  Specifically, the situation in Kosovo appears to be easing up  as the leader of the Albanian minority, Ibrahim Rougova, seems  to accept the solution of autonomy. In Skopje, the smart moves  of Gligorov's government have temporarily minimized the dangers  of a clash in the region.    So, the only region that is open for President Berisha is  Greece, in which he says--in an arbitrary addition of Arvanites,  Tsamidhes, and illegal Albanian immigrants--there are 3 million  Albanians.</p>

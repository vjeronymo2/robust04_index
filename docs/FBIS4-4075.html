In terms of [words indistinct], although city dwellers  in the province had an average per capita net income of 4,240  yuan or so this year, ranking first among the nine provinces and  cities, they spent a very large portion of their income, with  average per capita spending 71 percent higher than the average  level among the nine provinces and cities. Overall, the living  expenditure level of the province's urban population belongs to  an intermediate one in the nine provinces and cities.

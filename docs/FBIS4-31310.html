			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agnieszka Kublik and Wojciech Zaluska: </F> "Presidential Campaign; Loneliness of a Long-Distance Runner"]    [Text] Lech Walesa has announced that he will run in  next year's presidential election. Why did he do it so soon?    It could be just an accident. The journalists asked, so he  replied. The president is an impulsive man; he likes fast  responses.... But he is also capable of waiting. He has proved  that many times, like in the 1980's, for instance. So one could  assume that his statement to PAP was made deliberately.  <H5>  Candidates' Worries </H5>   Walesa has to start off his campaign very early. An enormous  amount of work is ahead of him. A year and a half before the  elections, he has neither political backing nor popularity.  Without appropriate structures, he will not be able to collect  money or organize rallies or put up posters.... He will not win  without the electorate's support. He needs time to bounce off  the bottom.    Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is leading in presidential  popularity polls, has a completely different worry on his mind:  His problem is to maintain the popularity and not to allow the  voters to get bored with him. That is why he is dragging his  feet, and he does not want to begin the campaign yet.  <H5>  Stocktaking of Supporters </H5>   By announcing his decision, Walesa is trying to force  Kwasniewski and other competitors to disclose their  intentions...and to make mistakes. After all, the candidates  will be under the particularly watchful eye of the mass media  and the voters. Currently, it is the president's blunders that  get the biggest publicity.    Walesa also most probably wants to conduct a "stocktaking"  of  his supporters. He wants to check whether he can count on the  support of someone else apart from the Non-Party Bloc in Support  of Reforms.    True, it is known widely that he has supporters in different  parties (for instance, the Christian-National Union, the Peasant  Accord, and Solidarity), but it is also known that these  supporters are few and far between. Perhaps by submitting his  candidacy the president wants to force them to be more active.  He is probably thinking: "Even if they fail to win their  parties for me, they could at least prevent them from coming up  with countercandidates."  <H5>  He Abuses People and Then He Dumps Them </H5>   Do such tactics have a chance of being successful? For the  moment, rather not. Unfriendly feelings toward Walesa within  the post-Solidarity camp are just too high. He is regarded as a  high-risk investment, as a politician who "abuses people and  then dumps them." A right-wing leader recently compared the  president to a coachman who, while fleeing to escape wolves, is  giving more and more of his passengers to the prey of the  wolves, one by one. Is it any wonder that nobody wants to ride  Walesa's coach?    The style of his presidency--that is, the policy of constant  "wars at the top"--also arouses enormous reservations. If  Walesa wants to dream of a big political camp, he must change  his style. And perhaps he also must change the composition of  his chancellery. But will he agree to sacrifice [presidential  aide] Mieczyslaw Wachowski in return for his reelection? And  will that be enough?  <H5>  Directly to Voters </H5>   If the parties turn their backs on Walesa, he will address  the electorate directly. He will tour Poland, he will organize  rallies. He feels best as a people's tribune. Nobody talks to  crowds better than he.    He will definitely not give up on television, either. He  will be launching attacks on the National Radio and Television  Council and [Television Chairman] Wieslaw Walendziak. He will  try to replace them or to force them to be obedient.    The campaign of a lonely Walesa will be more populist. It  will definitely be anticommunist. But will it also be  antimarket? So far, two slogans have been hanging above the  president's bed: First of all Walesa, and second of  all--capitalism.</p>

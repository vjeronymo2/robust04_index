			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE STUDY FINDS NO LINK OF CANCER TO FARM AREAS  </P> <P> A state investigation into whether children in California's agricultural  heartland are more likely than others to develop childhood cancers has found no  evidence that the mysteriously high cancer rates in towns like McFarland,  Earlimart and Rosamond afflict the entire region.  </P> <P> The Department of Health Services study released here Friday found that the  overall cancer rate among children under 15 in the southern San Joaquin Valley  was no different from that reported in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco  Bay Area and in other regions of the United States.  </P> <P> The two-year study also found that children in the valley's urban areas had  higher cancer rates than those in its rural, agricultural areas -- a finding  that seems to challenge the widespread suspicion that the McFarland cancer  cluster is related to agricultural chemicals.  </P> <P> "Throughout the region as a whole, we don't see rates like McFarland," said Dr.  Lynn R. Goldman of the state health department. The childhood cancer rate in  the tiny farming town has been found to be three times as high as for a town  its size.  </P> <P> The new findings may offer some reassurance to residents of the region, some of  whom have feared an epidemic of pesticide-induced cancers. In recent years,  McFarland had become a symbol of public fears about pesticide use, and an  assortment of celebrities, politicians and others flocked there to express  those fears.  </P> <P> But the absence of a region-wide pattern of high cancer rates underscores the  difficulty of ever identifying the causes of specific clusters.  </P> <P> "This type of an assessment can only go so far," said Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer,  director of the health department, at a public hearing Friday in McFarland.  "It's just the nature of the tools. They may not be able to tell us the answer  to the question that the community wants to know."  </P> <P> Unusually high rates of childhood cancer have turned up over the past few years  in McFarland, Rosamond and Earlimart. McFarland and Earlimart are farm towns in  Kern County and Tulare County, respectively; Rosamond is a desert community in  southern Kern County long popular with smelters and junkmen dumping industrial  waste.  </P> <P> Two years ago, after investigations of water, soil and household chemicals in  McFarland failed to turn up any obvious local cause of the cancers, the state  health department decided to study a broader, four-county region to see whether  the problem might be endemic to the region.  </P> <P> The department found 402 cases of childhood cancers diagnosed between 1980 and  1988 in Fresno, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties. About one-third of those were  leukemia cases. Nearly one-fifth were brain cancers. The others included  kidney, soft-tissue, bone and eye cancers.  </P> <P> The overall rate was 12 to 13 new cases per 100,000 children each year,  according to the draft report released Friday, which is typical of rates in  other regions of the country. According to Kern County figures, McFarland has a  childhood cancer rate of 36.7 cases per 100,000, while in Rosamond the rate is  72 per 100,000. In Earlimart, the state has said there is an "excess" of  childhood cancers.  </P> <P> The state found no significant differences between the rates among Anglos and  Latinos, and no significant differences among the four counties.  </P> <P> They did, however, find slightly higher cancer rates among children in the  cities of Fresno and Bakersfield. They found slightly lower rates in rural  areas not used for farming. State officials said the rates in rural  agricultural areas were about average.  </P> <P> Goldman, the pediatrician and toxicologist who headed the study, said the  higher urban rates are typical of the country at large. The reason for the  urban-rural difference is not known; some researchers suspect environmental  influences, while others wonder whether urban cases are simply more often  reported.  </P> <P> State health officials warned, however, that there are limitations to their  study: They had no information on the children's exposure to possible  carcinogens, nor did they know the parents' occupations, whether children had  lived elsewhere before diagnosis and whether other children became ill after  moving away.  </P></p>

"No one else is named," Borrelli added, as he confirmed the  reports that Giuseppe Turani of LA REPUBBLICA, Osvaldo de  Paolini IL SOLE-24 ORE, and Ugo Bertone of LA STAMPA were named  by Sama.    Sama presented himself to magistrates last week to discuss  payments made to journalists in order to ensure favourable press  coverage for the Ferruzzi empire, after financier Sergio Cusani,  on trial in Milan, confirmed that large sums had been put aside  by Ferruzzi for this purpose, but refused to name the  journalists involved.    The chief prosecutor said he will now be consulting his  assistants to gauge whether the journalists' case is a criminal  or disciplinary one. If it is disciplinary, "we would simply  pass on the documentation...and the three journalists would not  even be called in for questioning." At that point, the order of  journalists, which oversees the profession, would step in and  could strike the three off its list of members.    In statements issued this morning, the three journalists  named by Sama strongly denied the press reports, which at the  time had not received confirmation from Borrelli. Claiming  always to have worked "in complete honesty, and correctly,"  Turani said "I categorically exclude ever having received sums  of money from Carlo Sama."    Turani, an economic journalist who said he would be stepping  down as editorialist of the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA until his  name is cleared, said that his journalism is proof "of total  independence and intransigence with regard to all industrial  groups, including Ferruzzi."    Ugo Bertone, head of the Milan bureau of the Turin daily LA  STAMPA stated "I have never taken, either directly or  indirectly, a lire from him (Sama), from the Ferruzzi group or  from Montedison." In a comment to the press, Bertone added "I  think I have written one article about Sama in the last two  years. According to him I receive 100 million lire (60,000  dollars) for this. That's the kind of money a Pulitzer prize  winner gets, and I am not one of those."    De Paolini also denied having received money "from Carlo  Sama  or anyone acting for him, either in relation to the family  project nor to any other project linked to the image of the  Ferruzzis or Montedison."    Sama alleged that sums were paid out to journalists to  enhance the image of the Ferruzzi family after its acrimonious  split with brother-in-law Raul Gardini, who ran the Ferruzzi  empire and its Montedison division until 1991.    De Paolini, who has appealed against a journalists' order  decision to expel him for alleged insider trading, challenged  Sama to come up with proof of the under-the-counter payments.    Later in the day, Bertone, in charge of LA STAMPA's Milan  bureau, said he was taking leave as the newspaper's union  representatives issued a communique in which the editorial staff  voiced "full confidence in the work of the judiciary and  confidence that full clarity will be quickly brought to the  `clean pens' case."</p>

Gromov, arrived here today on a  first-ever visit by a Russian naval chief.    The issue of ensuring regular supply of spares for the  Indian  navy figures prominently during discussions between the Indian  and the Russian naval chiefs, at which, matters relating to  mutual interest and cooperation also figured.    As is also true in the case of the Indian air force and the  army, the Indian navy too has been facing problems in receiving  regular supply of spare parts. The bulk of the Indian navy,  about 70 per cent, comprises ships, submarines and other  equipment from the erstwhile Soviet Union. This includes 16  submarines and missile boats each, and four destroyers and  corvettes each.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Economy: How European slowdown is blocking exports / A look at why devaluation has failed to deliver the hoped-for competitive edge to manufacturers THE EXPERIENCE of the west Midlands suggests that the competitive advantage given by sterling's devaluation is being blunted by the slowdown in other European economies, especially that of Germany. The slowdown in these economies is diminishing opportunities for a sustained increase in manufactured exports. Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the West Midlands Engineering Employers' Federation, said: 'On balance, those companies that have established export positions are finding it (the devaluation) favourable and a counter to any diminution in these markets. For those with less established positions its not clear whether increased inquiry is translating itself into orders.' Market pressures in the larger European economies are increasing. Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman of Frederick Cooper which exports specialist metal coatings and rubber products to Germany, said devaluation would change nothing overnight, but German companies were 'more ready to take price cuts to hold on to their market share' because home demand for German manufacturers was falling. Devaluation poses problems for pricing policy. Sterling has been trading at about DM2.40 until this week, compared with its previous ERM floor of DM2.778. Mr Kirk doubted the wisdom of pricing at present exchange rates. The calculation at Frederick Cooper is that, in the medium term, sterling will recover against the D-Mark as German interest rates come down. For Mr Kirk, pricing at DM2.70 is a realistic rate. But it eliminates some of the competitive advantage. Mr Stephen Hayes, finance director of Bromsgrove Industries, explained that with automotive component exports, devaluation has 'enabled us to secure the larger share of contracts which are overseas-based, where we're on a dual source'. Bromsgrove is finding its share of a supply schedule raised while that of, say, an Austrian company is diminished. Yet overseas customers are not prepared to allow companies the full margin of improvement implicit in the devaluation. They see that devaluation has given companies the potential to make greater sterling profits at the same selling price and so push for price reductions. Mr Stephen Birch, export sales manager of Kenrick &amp; Jefferson, the security printer, said that in price negotiations long-standing customers are telling the company that the effect of devaluation should be taken into account in the agreed selling price. On the other hand prices of imported materials are rising. Hampson Industries reported that the sudden change in foam and fabric import prices for its furniture division forced it to offer its customers a choice of higher delivery prices or delayed deliveries while it re-sourced its materials.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Arts: Ariadne auf Naxos - Opera in Zurich Some singers fancy themselves as conductors, others try their hand at stage direction. Producers such as Ruth Berghaus and Johannes Schaaf have played roles in their own stagings. But what about the opera administrator who, not content with a planning and enabling role, fancies himself as an artist and casts himself in a performance in his own theatre? Step forward Alexander Pereira, intendant of the Zurich Opera House, who has just appeared in the company's new Ariadne auf Naxos, one of the few repertoire operas with a speaking role. This isn't the first time Pereira has let enthusiasm get the better of himself. He once joined Orlofsky's party in Die Fledermaus. And who hasn't wondered, at one point or other, what it would be like to be up there sharing the glamour of the stars? But Pereira's performance as the Major-Domo in Ariadne should be a warning to any amateur who wants to play with the professionals. A tall, limp figure, he lacked the snobby imperiousness essential to the part, delivering his lines with the gauche self-consciousness one expects when the Count delivers his recitation in Capriccio. At the interval, Pereira reverted to his role as administrator, mingling in costume with guests in the foyer. Pereira came to Zurich two years ago without any previous experience of running a theatre. What Zurich fell for were his marketing skills and the cachet of his Viennese background. In his first season he increased sponsorship, promoted some young talent and raised box-office takings by engaging star singers. Now doubts are setting in. Zurich has become a haven for singers who made their name 20 or 30 years ago but are long past their best - such as Hermann Prey, whose Music Master in Ariadne looked and sounded as if he had lost sight of the purpose of being on stage. Productions veer between the trendy and the still-born. There is more show than substance. Some performances have been redeemed by the conducting - but not Ariadne. Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, an experienced Straussian in the concert hall, failed to draw the disparate strands of this elusive score into a convincing whole. At least he prevented the music from sounding overblown or artificial. No such defence could be made for Cesare Lievi's production. The setting was updated to the time of composition - well, what production isn't nowadays? - and ended up in a nowhere-land between the realistic and the metaphysical. Luigi Perego's decor placed the action in a bare, white oblong room, occasionally partitioned into identical halves sporting a phallic palm tree  -apparently designed to show that the heavenly (Ariadne) and human (Zerbinetta) are mirror-opposites with the same view of paradise. The Comedians' japes were neither funny nor charming. With a false proscenium at the front and back of the stage, the location of the court audience was never clear. Strauss' and Hofmannsthal's marriage of opera seria and opera buffa was made to look improbable and incongruous. The cast deserved better. Edita Gruberova is still a show-stealing Zerbinetta - on this occasion resembling a plump Sally Bowles with alluring black fringe. Cornelia Kallisch's Composer, in stuffy grey suit and wide-rimmed hat, showed spirit without charisma. Gabriela Benackova gave a strong, static performance in the title role. Bacchus was Norbert Orth, a Pedrillo-turned-Heldentenor. The supporting cast was good, particularly Peter Keller's Dancing Master and Oliver Widmer's Harlequin. But - Gruberova apart - the performance left me cold.</p>

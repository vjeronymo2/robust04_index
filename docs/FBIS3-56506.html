			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Nazaryan from the news conference held by </F> presidential press secretary Aram Abrahamyan in Yerevan on 17  January--recorded]    [Text] In opening the news conference, presidential press  secretary Aram Abrahamyan said: Azerbaijan has been pressing  ahead with military operations against Nagorno-Karabakh and the  Armenian Republic. Its air attack was not directed against  military objects but peaceful settlements. This clearly reveals  Azerbaijan's real intentions in its war against Nagorno-Karabakh.    Despite that, Armenia is not deviating from its policy to  strive for the peaceful settlement of the problem.    In recent days the press reported on a high-level  quadripartite meeting between Azerbaijan, Karabakh, Armenia, and  Russia. At present, there is no clear agreement on holding such  a meeting, although, in principle Armenia favors the idea. This  is the context in which the meeting was held between the  Armenian and Azerbaijani defense ministers in Tbilisi on  Saturday when they examined the military-technical aspects of a  cease-fire. The press secretary noted that no concrete  agreement was reached.    As already reported, the Armenian president issued a decree  on 15 January on the restructuring of the State Directorate for  National Security. In referring to that matter, Mr. Abrahamyan  said: It is a requirement to revamp our structures to place  them at the service of national statehood. One of such state  structures is this directorate, whose specific purpose should be  exclusively intelligence and counterintelligence work. To  successfully fulfill these important functions, the directorate  should undergo structural changes. The former structure was set  up during the Soviet Union and was serving other purposes,  primarily surveillance of dissidents. Naturally, such problems  no longer exist in a democratic country. The Armenian citizens  can worship and express any opinion freely and without  restraint, and join any legal political organization.    The press secretary added: I consider it important to note  that the president highly appreciates Eduard Simonyants [the  former head of the State Directorate for National Security], and  the planned restructuring has nothing to do with him. No matter  who headed that directorate, its existing structure was beyond  reform without any serious structural changes. I can assure  that Mr. Simonyants' abilities will be properly used in another  state job.    The adoption of the privatization bill by the parliament is  one of last week's important developments. Mr. Abrahamyan also  touched on this matter. The implementation of the plan requires  hard work from the government, and he thinks that the government  will place that process under its strict control. He said: The  state's aim is to harmonize and bring in tandem the  privatization process with two other processes: The first is  the creation of a system for social protection so that the  socially unprotected strata can obtain financial assistance and  goods from various sources, and therefore be able to meet their  minimum requirements. The second is the creation of the market  substructures serving the economy. In this, the banking system  plays the leading role. The Armenian Central Bank should act  like an orchestra conductor in the system, and here the need was  also felt to introduce changes. These changes were made last  week with the efforts of the president and the parliament.    He drew the reporters' attention to the president's decree  on  15 December and on the course of its implementation. As you  remember, that decree was designed to create favorable  conditions for the import and sale of foodstuff. This decree  gave concrete instructions to the Central Bank and government,  and some of these instructions have already been implemented.  The issue here involved introducing changes in the  decisionmaking process inside the government aimed at  eliminating bureaucratic infighting and the possibility of  corruption. An operational staff has been set up under Shahen  Petrosyan to establish law and order at the airports. The  president's supervisory service has accomplished enormous work.  This service set up an operative alarm team and established  round-the-clock posts in Zvartnots, Yerepuni, and Shirak  Airports. Despite all these measures, Mr. Abrahamyan said that  the president's supervisory service and law enforcement organs  revealed a number of cases of pilferage of money and goods and  the misuse of official positions. A criminal investigation has  been opened. The operative alarm teams of the supervisory  service have resumed their work as of 14 January, not only in  the airports but also along the highways north and south of  Armenia. In case of any violation of the law, our businessmen  could immediately inform the employees at the posts set up by  the service.    Mr. Abrahamyan also replied to reporters' questions.</p>

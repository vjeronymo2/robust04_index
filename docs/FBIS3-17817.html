In particular, 120,000 left Kazakhstan, 106,000 --  Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan], 90,000 -- Uzbekistan. Russian Minister  of Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray gave these  figures during his meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with CSCE  Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel.    After the meeting Shakhray told Interfax that he had  informed  the guest about the reasons for the migration of ethnic Russians  from Central Asian countries. Thus, statistical data show that  28 percent explained the return to their historical homeland  with "the real threat of violence or persecution," and 19  percent with "insult and humililation of national dignity."    In the minister's opinion, if the situation for ethnic  Russians does not impove in this region, within the next two or  three years the migration of 3 million people can be expected  from the Central Asian republics to the Russian Federation.    The situation with 11 million ethnic Russians living in  Ukraine is also complicated. According to Shakhray, the main  problems there are "the exclusion of the Russian language from  the daily life and business, "the Ukrainization" of education in  high schools, the obligatory knowledge of the Ukrainian language  for getting a profession." Shakhray noted that in Ukraine, like  in other republics of the former Soviet Union, the share of  unemployed ethnic Russians is "inadmissibly large."    Regarding the situation of the Russian-speaking population  in  the Baltic states, Shakhray said that after the parliaments of  these states adopted corresponding laws, 300,000 ethnic Russians  living in Estonia were deprived of citizenship. In Latvia  700,000 Russians lost citizenship, of them 160,000 have no legal  status at all, including the right to work.    Shakhray stated that Russia as a legal successor of the  Soviet Union has taken all responsibility for those people who  "hold only the USSR passport."    The minister believes that a multilateral convention within  the framework of the CIS should be signed to assure the rights  of ethnic minorities and that on the basis of this document  bilateral treaties must be concluded. In his opinion, apart  from that it would also be necessary to establish efficient  control over the observance of these documents.    Shakhray said that at the meeting with Max van der Stoel it  was agreed to expand cooperation in the protection of interests  of ethnic minorities and in the more efficient use of  international mechanisms on this issue.</p>

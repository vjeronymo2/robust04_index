Sooner or later it would have become  public property. We decided that sooner was better than later.    We know that, under a government edict [ukaz],  recommissioning work has been under way at Metsamor AES [Nuclear  Electric Power Station] for over a year now. Moreover, despite  the recommendations of international organizations (the  International Atomic Energy Agency, Framatome, and so on) it is  envisaged that demothballing will be carried out within a  compressed time scale. This was a forced decision, because  Armenia has been facing an energy disaster for several years  now, and the shipment of energy sources across Azerbaijani and  Georgian territory has been made extremely difficult because of  terrorist acts and the general unstable situation in the region.  But the blood in our veins runs cold from the risk factors  listed in the document.    The reactors at the Metsamor AES (of the water-cooled,  water-moderated 440/230 type) are known for their imperfection  and unreliability in operation. Furthermore, in the event of an  accident there are no protection measures in the form of a  containment vessel or underground drop-down mechanisms  [mekhanizmy podzemnogo obrusheniya]. The problem of burying the  radioactive waste remains an open one. Under the station there  is a multilevel artesian well from which water is distributed  throughout the region. Bearing in mind the current military  situation in the region, the danger of terrorist acts is quite  real.    The document, signed by S. Shaginyan, chairman of the  Armenian commission for the protection of the environment and  natural resources, says the following: "Total economic blockade  has put Armenia under the threat of extinction.... Sensible  warnings about the danger of starting up the AES receive no  response. The situation has now gotten out of control, and the  threat of an ecological explosion has become real."    In the light of all the aforementioned risk factors it  becomes clear that starting up the AES cannot be considered  Armenia's internal affair. Georgian ecologists are ready to  sound the alarm. We possess another document, signed by  Professor Tamaz Chelidze, director of the Georgian Academy of  Sciences Geophysics Institute. It says that, according to a  seismic zoning map in existence since 1989, the site of the  Armenian AES falls into the category of a zone with a 9-point  seismic risk. This figure speaks for itself. We can add to it  that the AES is capable of meeting only 25 percent of Armenia's  needs -- and then only for electricity; other energy sources  will still have to be imported. So it is not too clear whether  starting it up is economically advantageous.    But something else is clear: When a baby dies from the cold  in front of your eyes (and this has happened many times in both  Armenia and Georgia), you will not only start up the AES but you  will also open up a Pandora's box. But maybe there is still a  chance to take safety measures?</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The saga of the alleged Tire-Chalk-Erasers of Palos Verdes Estates is slowly  rolling forward.  </P> <P> You may recall that in April, two motorists in the busy Malaga Cove shopping  plaza were arrested, handcuffed, frisked and jailed for allegedly trying to  circumvent the one-hour parking limit by wiping off a meter maid's chalk marks.  The harsh enforcement drew criticism from the Malaga Cove Business and  Professional Assn., among others.  </P> <P> One defendant, Anne Bisco, a receptionist, paid an $89.50 fine this week. But  Rosina Baur, manager of a real estate office, pleaded not guilty and will go to  trial July 11.  </P> <P> Bisco admitted that when her time ran out, she rolled her car forward and  "rubbed it (the chalk mark) lightly." But Baur maintains that she moved her car  into a new parking place, which would comply with regulations.  </P> <P> "I could have paid the fine," Baur said. "But you can only preserve democracy  if you fight for your rights."  </P> <P> The great-grandson of Jesse James will ride into Pasadena next week for a date  at high noon -- to deliver a lecture.  </P> <P> Like the legendary train and bank robber, James R. Ross is also involved with  lawbreakers, but on the other side. He's an Orange County Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> Ross, 63, who was a lawyer for three decades in Los Angeles, hopes his new  book, "I, Jesse James," will clear up some myths about Great-Granddad. But he  doesn't paint him as a complete innocent.  </P> <P> "As an attorney I'd hate to argue that it's self-defense when you're running  from a bank robbery and you shoot a guy who was shooting at you," Ross said.  "He did kill some people."  </P> <P> But Ross believes that Jesse, who was fatally shot in the back in 1882 by  gang-member Bob ("The Dirty Little Coward") Ford, might have been a preacher  like his father. But he was reportedly enraged as a youngster when he was  beaten by federal troops and later when authorities broke his mother's arm.  </P> <P> Ross, who will speak before the Huntington Westerners, a literary group, next  Saturday, takes after his grandfather, Jesse James Jr., who was also a lawyer.  </P> <P> "He always said he had a built-in clientele as a defense attorney," Ross said.  "What criminal wouldn't trust Jesse James Jr.?"  </P> <P> In recent years, innovative Southern Californians have formed such  dual-interest social organizations as the Atheist Dating Service, Southern  California Freeway Singles, Vege-Gay (gay vegetarians), Lesbian Back-packers  and the Millionaire Singles Club.  </P> <P> Now come two more entries:  </P> <P> A pro-marijuana organization in Van Nuys advertises that its meetings offer the  chance for "networking" and for making "new friends" (stoned singles?).  </P> <P> And, in La Verne, a John Birch Society Summer Camp is being organized to give  "young Americans a concentrated, six-day course in American values."  </P> <P> So you think the pressure is on the Lakers in their bid for a third straight  title? What about the vendors on local street corners selling those Laker  T-shirts that say, "Three-peat"?  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley Wolseley's addiction to equity shows no sign of abating. Yesterday's placing of shares to fund a US acquisition is its third in little over a year. The company has raised around Pounds 220m - equivalent to more than a tenth of its market capitalisation - in that time by selling shares to institutional investors or the vendors of businesses it bought. Since Wolseley is one of the most tightly-held stocks in the FT-SE 100 index, the market is hardly awash with paper as a result. Even so, one might question whether Wolseley's aversion to debt is really necessary. With the proceeds of the latest placing tucked away, the company will have around Pounds 80m net debt against shareholders' funds of Pounds 560m at the last count. While borrowings could rise in line with working capital as organic growth comes through, gearing of around 30-40 per cent would not look irresponsible at this point in the business cycle. The stronger argument is that equity is a perfect match for the kind of risks being assumed through acquisitions. But it takes a leap of logic to conclude that all acquisitions should be immediately funded by a matching issue of shares. True, Wolseley's sequence of placings has saved it the bother and expense of a rights issue. But shareholders not on the list of privileged institutions have seen their stake in the business diluted over time. Given its relatively small circle of institutional investors  - and exemplary record of growth - there is no question of shareholder revolt. As Wolseley matures and increases its international reach, though, old habits may have to change.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISUSING LOTTERY MONEY  </P> <P> California's schoolchildren, billed as the big winners when the state lottery  was on the ballot, are being cheated. The money pouring into the lottery as  Californians try to win pots like Saturday's $44.3 million is supposed to  enrich school programs just as it enriched four winners last weekend. Instead,  too many school districts are using the money for salaries and other day-to-day  operations. That is exactly what the lottery's opponents feared, and the  situation creates an unwise dependency on gambling and an unfortunate  distortion of the schools' financial picture.  </P> <P> Even as Lotto fever swept the state, Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig  threw cold water on the misguided notion that the proceeds are adding valuable  programs to the public schools. State law earmarks one-third of the lottery  revenues for public education. Lottery advocates assured voters during the 1984  campaign that created the game that the money would be a bonus for the schools  rather than supplanting existing support.  </P> <P> It hasn't happened that way. Financially hard-pressed school districts are  using the money not for extras like library books and computers but rather for  basics like salaries and textbooks. In a recent report to the Legislature,  Honig said a survey of 841 of the state's approximately 1,000 school districts  showed that they spend more than half their lottery money on salaries and  benefits. Another 14% is spent on maintenance and equipment and 13% on books  and supplies.  </P> <P> That's certainly true in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which last  year received $83.4 million in lottery money and spent nearly 85% of it on  basic operating costs, mainly teachers' salaries. The district is also counting  on lottery money to help provide salary increases under whatever contract  agreement it reaches with the United Teachers of Los Angeles union. Today  people appear hooked on the lottery so that may seem a winning proposition. But  it's a bad gamble -- and a bad example for children -- in the long run.  </P> <P> As lottery earnings have increased, Honig says, the amount the state spends on  each student has decreased. Adjusted for inflation, the amount dropped by $46  during the last school year and may do so again this year. This, at a time when  the demands on public schools have never been higher: Teachers deserve higher  pay, half the students who enroll at some high schools drop out before  graduation and more teachers are needed to instruct the 140,000 additional  students who are flooding California schools each year. Neither local school  administrators nor state officials should be allowed to substitute lottery  earnings for basic support from the state's general fund.  </P> <P> The lottery is a game of chance. It's time it was used to give schools the true  chance to enrich their students, not just struggle to pay basic bills. At least  someone -- Bill Honig -- has finally pointed a finger at a growing problem.  </P></p>

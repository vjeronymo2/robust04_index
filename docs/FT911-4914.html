			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Diversity helps GE to 5% improvement GENERAL ELECTRIC's diverse mix of businesses enabled it to overcome much of the impact of the recession in the first quarter. The Connecticut-based conglomerate posted a 5 per cent advance in net earnings and showed improved margins. GE, whose interests range from power turbines to broadcasting, posted net income of Dollars 999m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, up from Dollars 950m, or Dollars 1.06 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 6 per cent to Dollars 13.3bn. Operating margins widened to 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent, the highest ever for a first quarter. The company said its productivity improved at an annualised rate of more than 5 per cent. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said that while the company might continue to be cushioned by its diversity, it saw no evidence that the surge in consumer confidence following the end of the Gulf war was being followed by any 'meaningful' pick-up in business activity. The strongest growth in earnings came from what GE calls its 'long-cycle' capital goods businesses, chiefly aircraft engines, power station equipment and medical systems. Earnings at GE Financial Services, which includes GE Capital and the brokerage firm Kidder Peabody, advanced by 15 per cent. GE said that only NBC, its wholly-owned television network, suffered a significant drop in income in the quarter.</p>

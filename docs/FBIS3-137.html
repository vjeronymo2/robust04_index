Bloody clashes are  continuing. This was revealed by Antonio Augusto Torcato, deputy  governor of Cuanza Sul for military issues. Speaking at a  ceremony marking the 18th founding anniversary of the national  police today, he said government forces stationed in the  province are ready to neutralize any UNITA attempt. It will be  recalled that over the weekend Cuanza Sul Provincial Governor  Francisco Jose Ramos da Cruz condemned the infiltration of UNITA  armed men in (Ambuiva), Seles District, as well as in the  capitals of Porto Amboim and Sumbe districts, with the aim of  raiding Sumbe and preventing free movement along the Porto  Amboim-Luanda national road.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC fisheries ministers fail to agree on conservation EC FISHERIES ministers yesterday deferred until July getting to grips with the measures the European Commission believes are needed to conserve fast-dwindling stocks of white fish in the North Sea. They did, however, agree to set up a community-wide statistical register to monitor the quantities of fish landed by each member state. It was the third failure to reach a compromise on increasing net mesh sizes, in order to allow immature cod and haddock, in particular, to escape, since last November. Last November, the commission presented independent scientific evidence to support its claim that more than 90 per cent of fish stocks in the North Atlantic were being over-fished. It also presented a paper claiming that there was 40 per cent over-capacity in the EC fleet and called for conservation measures. Mr David Curry, UK fisheries minister, confirmed that Britain was going ahead with its own conservation measures. From July all boats over 400 horsepower will be obliged to have a 90mm square mesh panel in their nets. Mr Curry argued that 'these unilateral measures need to be communitised'. More than a third of the UK's North Sea and west of Scotland fleet have opted to use 110mm/100mm square mesh nets. This is in exchange for a waiver on the measure ministers agreed last December, requiring vessels in those areas of the North Sea with a concentration of immature cod to tie up in port for eight consecutive days each month. Part of the Danish fleet has also opted for this trade-off. Commission officials, ministers and fishermen's organisations all agree that considerable cheating has gone on. If, at the end of the year, catches are little affected by the supposedly wider nets, fishermen's main objection to the measure - that their incomes would be slashed - will carry little weight and the commission's hand could be strengthened. Fishermen's leaders lobbying yesterday's meeting expressed frustration at the piecemeal introduction of measures consequent on ministers' failure to reach agreement. Mr Willie Hay, president of the Scottish Fishermen's federation, said: 'We all agree there is a need for conservation measures, and we should agree them and apply them to the whole community fleet.' The commission has suspended negotiations with Namibia to reach an agreement on fishing rights. Mr Manuel Marin, EC fisheries commissioner, blamed the south-west African country's seizure of five Spanish vessels for illegally fishing in its waters. The talks were at a low ebb because of what one commission official said was Namibia's failure to come up with 'a reasonable offer' on rights. Spanish officials at yesterday's meeting said their authorities had opened proceedings against 12 vessels from Spain for illegal fishing in the South Atlantic.</p>

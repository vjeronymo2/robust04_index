			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> COURT ALLOWS STREET PROJECTS TO CONTINUE  </P> <P> The city may proceed with its plans to widen a one-mile stretch of Bastanchury  Road and improve a section of Euclid Street, a Superior Court judge ruled  Friday.  </P> <P> Judge Eileen C. Moore said Fullerton resident Mary B. Homme did not prove that  city residents would be irreparably harmed if Fullerton goes ahead with the  widening while a group of residents works to stop the projects with a ballot  initiative.  </P> <P> Fullerton is in the final stages of securing county funds for the Euclid  project and in the middle of purchasing rights of way for the Bastanchury  project. Together, the improvements will cost about $6.2 million.  </P> <P> Homme had sued the city in March to stop work on the projects until after the  November election, when she and other members of the Save Our Bastanchury group  hope to have a measure on the ballot.  </P> <P> The measure would ask voters whether streets should be improved if resulting  traffic would create more noise than allowed under the city's General Plan,  Fullerton's blueprint for commercial and residential development.

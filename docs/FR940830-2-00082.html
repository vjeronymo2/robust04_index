Statistics published by the National Cancer Institute indicate that cigarette smoking and chewing of tobacco are responsible for as many as 1,500 deaths per day in the United States. Recent studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency indicate that prolonged exposure to second-hand smoke significantly increases the probability of developing heart and lung disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with its mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people, it is the policy of PHS to strongly encourage all recipients of the PHS grants to provide a smoke-free work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products. It is also the policy of PHS to encourage those recipients which already have a smoke-free work place and promote the nonuse of tobacco products to continue such practices. Particular attention should be given to avoiding exposure to secondary smoke by pregnant women and children. Additionally, CMHS strongly encourages all cooperative agreement applicants to implement policies and activities that promote the nonuse of tobacco products by clients/patients as a goal of treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application Procedures: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Completely separate applications must be submitted for Demonstration Sites and for the Coordinating Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All applicants must use application form PHS 5161&hyph;1 (Rev. 7/92), which contains Standard Form 424 (face page).

Notification of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the initial review. In addition, the IRG recommendations on technical merit of applications will undergo a second level of review by the appropriate advisory council whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical merit. Applications may be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation for approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review Criteria for Demonstration Site Applications: The points noted in the parentheses for each criterion indicate the maximum number of points the reviewers may assign to that criterion.

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Travel: Warmed by the glories of the frozen continent - Antarctica fires Nicholas Woodsworth's imagination 0748 hrs: arrive Cuverville Is. Position: Latitude 64 degs 41 mins South / Longitude 62 degs. 37 mins West. Weather: Cloudy, 985 millibars. Temp: 2.50 air, - 0.50 sea. Wind: SW 4-5, sea calm. Vessel drifting off NE of Cuverville Is. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales. There is no getting around it - Peter Skog, chief officer and keeper of the Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the 1990s? Or is there simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another, Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic. Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded, ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No 38 bus on to the Edgware Road. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me. One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just do the trick. Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log two days ago as we crossed the notorious Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the Antarctic Peninsula. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace  -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my cabin bathroom. Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise Drake, Magellan and Darwin, all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise Alex, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without spilling a drop. But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that Alex is one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, Alex stands somewhere near the top. Sea temperature -0.50 Skog has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I, who knew the secret of volcanic Pendulum Cove and its sand beach, geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing? Skog might not be impressed, but I was. Pendulum Cove gave me a better bath than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in London. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes Skog, as if compiling a shopping list for Sainsbury's supermarket. But I can tell you that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying pesto sauce or coffee beans. In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards. Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French waiters, but are far more approachable. Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200 yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative, testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in my favourite local on a busy Saturday night. But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for the whales. Skog can write 3 humpback whales and let it go at that if he likes. When you are in a Zodiac inflatable dingy and close enough to be drenched in the fine spray from a whale's blow-hole it is rather a different matter. There is nothing quite like the company of these vast animals as they lazily dive and spout and roll and wave their flippers and raise their flukes. Melville wrote hundreds of pages about the great drama between men and whales; you would think the miserable Skog might manage more than three words. But no. 1145 hrs: arrive Neumeyer Channel. Position: a spectacular channel, narrow and high sided, grander than any northern fjord. Weather: marvellous - crystal clear air, gloriously sunny, fresh and bracing - the kind of weather that makes you feel happy to be alive. Sea: full of blue curacao-coloured icebergs. Vessel crunching through jig-saw puzzle pack ice, surrounded by snow-covered mountains plunging steeply to the sea. Could Skog be be responsible for such a loose and fanciful entry? Of course not. Skog wrote nothing at this point. I have written it for him. The chief officer, apparently, does not believe breathtaking beauty worthy of recording. But while he enjoys measuring millibars, the rest of us enjoyed gazing out from the upper deck at some of the most astounding scenery we have ever seen - great ice cliffs, impossibly tall and pointed peaks, glaciers flowing at infinitesimal speed into the sea, weirdly sculpted icebergs, seals basking on sun-washed ice-floes. We were all impressed, and this is saying something, for the passengers aboards the Explorer - wealthy, well-travelled, and for the most part American - have high expectations. For my own part, I had no idea that such a continent existed - in my mind Antarctica was a bleak, desolate and lifeless place of little interest. On the contrary, it is now for me a place of the greatest interest. 1500 hrs: arrive Port Lockroy. Position: Lat: 64 degs 52 mins S / Long: 6252 W. Weather: partly cloudy, 982 millibars. Temp. 50 air, 00 sea. Sea calm. Vessel drifting off Port Lockroy. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals. Back to dull Skog's ditch-water delivery again. Does he never tire? Has he never stood on the rocks, surrounded by hundreds of clamorsome, roosting shags, and looked down into the waters of Port Lockroy as I did? How striking it is to watch penguins, slapstick, waddling, inept birds on land, transform themselves into marvels of dynamic design in the water. With just one hop from a rock they become agile, graceful creatures, as fast as torpedoes as they flash about in search of the fish and shrimp-like krill that is their prey. One moment of marine game-watching in Port Lockroy remains with me: that instant when, on a drifting ice-floe not five yards distant, a snoozing leopard seal awoke and yawned, showing me a great mouthful of needle-sharp teeth, then slipped silently into the water. There is nothing furry or cute about leopard seals - they can flay a penguin right out of its skin with a few tosses of their powerful heads. The moment that seal slid below the surface, the hunters became the hunted. But does Skog appreciate the thrill of the wild, the vitality of life, the inevitability of sudden death? Gentoo penguins, leopard seals is all he can find to write. But then Swedes have always been a squeamish lot when it comes to high drama. In their country I have seen dairy cows with rubber bulbs fitted to their horns in order that they cause no undue harm or excitement. Poor Skog, perhaps he should not be blamed. 2000 hrs: arrive Paradise Bay. Position: Lat: 65 degs 42 mins S / Long: 6252 W. Weather: overcast, 984 millibars. Temp: 0.50 air, 00 water. Vessel drifting off Paradise Bay. BBQ, then Zodiac tours, landing on the Antarctic continent. All is forgiven] In that last sentence taken from the log today I detect a tiny soupcon, the merest hint of understanding, of what it is to be Man the Explorer. But it is enough. Until now, the fourth of 10 days of cruising, we have only visited islands lying off the coast of Antarctica. This evening we land on the continent itself, and Skog has recognised the heroic symbolism of that act. A literary milestone. If there is any doubt as to the significance of the event, there is, as the chief officer notes, to be a magnificent outdoor meal served on the rear deck, with a penguin - even now being chiselled in ice by a skilled Filipino chef - as the centrepiece to our blithe, mulled-wine-swilling company. And if that is not enough, the captain is up on the bridge at this moment preparing a Certificate of Antarctic Exploration for each of us. We have 'joined the ranks of Scott and Shackleton', it informs us, 'and ventured to set foot on Antarctica, the biggest, coldest, driest, windiest, loneliest, most remote and least-known continent on earth'. Not only that, but we are now dedicated to 'honour the brave pioneer Antarctic explorers who sailed these frozen seas before us, and to protect the Antarctic Continent for those who will follow'. That is certainly quite a big mouthful for one small step, even if it is on to Antarctica. No matter how much the chief officer has loosened up, I am sure he would not approve of the tone of such a document - could that be why he has left the captain alone on the bridge and is down here with us munching BBQ? It is simply not his style. Nicholas Woodsworth sailed to Antarctica with Abercrombie and Kent, Sloane Square House, Holbein Place, London SW1, tel 071-730 9600. A+K's 10-12 day Antarctic cruises, combining visits to the Falklands and / or South Georgia, begin at Pounds 3,996, inclusive of return air fare from London. He flew to Santiago, originating point of the expedition, with British Airways.</p>

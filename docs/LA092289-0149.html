			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE AGENCY NAMED DEFENDANT IN SUIT INVOLVING LINCOLN S&amp;L  </P> <P> The state Department of Corporations was added Thursday as a defendant in a  lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of about 22,000 investors who stand  to lose nearly $200 million from the collapse of American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> The amended complaint alleges that the agency acted "in reckless disregard of  its own internal findings" in approving the public sale of American  Continental's debt securities, which were sold mostly through the 29 branches  of its Irvine subsidiary, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The filing marks the first time that a government agency has been named as a  defendant in the various lawsuits pending against the operators of American  Continental, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Lincoln, which was  seized by regulators and declared insolvent.  </P> <P> And it comes after the Resolution Trust Corp. last week filed a civil suit in  Phoenix against American Continental's Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. and most  of the development company's officers and directors, claiming that they engaged  in a conspiracy to siphon $1.1 billion in federally insured funds from Lincoln  for their personal use.  </P> <P> The investors' complaint, originally filed April 27 in Orange County Superior  Court, was amended to include the agency after the state rejected a  $250-million claim made by the bondholders. The complaint alleges that the  Department of Corporations gave approval to sell the bonds even though it had  sufficient evidence to show that Phoenix-based American Continental could not  repay the debt it would accumulate through the sale of the securities.  </P> <P> "The Department of Corporations staff made its own analysis that the offering  didn't make any sense," said Ronald Rus of Orange, one of the plaintiffs'  lawyers. "Notwithstanding that, the agency found that a Big 8 accounting firm  said it's OK and then approved it.  </P> <P> "So whose fault is it?" he said. "I say they both are at fault."  </P> <P> The suit claims that Lincoln's former operators, its outside accountants and  its lawyers were engaged in "a massive fraud" to pump up Lincoln's earnings and  net worth artificially and improve the company's stock price for their own  benefit.  </P> <P> It also claims that Keating and other American Continental executives used  politicians, whose campaigns they had contributed to, and other public  officials to intervene in Lincoln's fight with regulators and to buy "extra  time" to continue the scheme.  </P> <P> Christine Bender, commissioner of the department, said the agency "acted  appropriately" in approving the bonds.  </P> <P> "We did what was required under the law and, in fact, more than what was  required by law," she said. "When a court looks at this, I'm convinced it will  find that we did nothing wrong." Agency officials previously said they  contacted numerous state and federal agencies investigating the company and the  S&amp;L but could get no concrete evidence to warrant a denial of American  Continental's application to sell the debt securities. Bender said her agency  had authority to bar the offering only if the public sale was found to be  "unfair, unjust or inequitable."  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Allegations  </P> <P> The amended complaint weaves a now-familiar web of political clout with a few  bits of new allegations.  </P> <P> Bender and her predecessor, Franklin Tom, had worked at the same Los Angeles  law firm before joining the department. Tom, who quit in early 1987, returned  to the firm and, within a month, began representing American Continental on its  debenture application. A senior partner in the firm is Karl T. Samuelian, who  had been Gov. Deukmejian's chief fund-raiser.  </P> <P> One of Tom's first acts, the suit claims, was to ask the agency to move the  file on American Continental from its San Francisco office to its Los Angeles  office. The request came shortly after a staff lawyer in San Francisco warned  Tom that the agency might take action against the company "if earnings  continued to decline and the quality of earnings deteriorate," according to an  agency report filed with the amended complaint.  </P> <P> In the firm's Los Angeles office, the suit states, the file was put under the  supervision of Robert L. Rifkin, a former law school classmate of Samuelian.  Tom and the law firm, Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, were  named as defendants in the original suit.  </P> <P> Rifkin and Samuelian could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 people, mostly Southern California depositors, purchased  American Continetal's debentures at Lincoln's branches. About three-quarters of  them were elderly.  </P></p>

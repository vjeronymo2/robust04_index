Tests conducted on  840 samples of 11 farm products including rice, apples,  strawberries, cucumbers and pears from 1990 to 1992 revealed  that 55 percent of the samples contained farm chemicals in  amounts below the permissible levels, the institute announced on  Thursday. No organic chlorine-series chemicals causing chronic  poisoning were found in the rice samples produced in 1990, while  organic phosphorus- and carbamate-series chemicals, which are  easily digested by the human body, were detected in amounts  below the permissible levels.    In 1992, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration detected, in  tests of 5,816 samples of grain, fruit and vegetables produced  in the United States, chemicals in 36.8 percent of the samples,  with the chemicals in 1.2 percent being in amounts above  permissible levels.    The institute's director, Yi Kun-chong, said Korean  agricultural products were healthy because of farmers'  observance of standards for safe use of pesticides established  in 1980. In Korea, no pesticides are applied to farm products  after they are harvested, while some foreign countries use  chemicals on their farm products after the harvest to prevent  decomposition or keep them pest-free during storage or shipment  for export. Yi said his institute would strive to develop safer  agricultural chemicals for safer farm products.</p>

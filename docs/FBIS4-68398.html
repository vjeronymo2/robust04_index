			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bar[surname partially illegible]: "Agency </F> for Supporting Investments Established"]    [Text] In accordance with a government decree "On the  Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on Consulting  and Technical Assistance," which was received yesterday for  official distribution, a federal project financing center is  being established under the Ministry of Economics. Thus, there  is now a federal agency that will assume the functions of  translating Russian projects for attracting foreign investments  into a language understandable to Western financiers.    Foreign investments are not enjoying good fortune in Russia.  First of all, they entail very considerable political risk:  events last September and October, the results of the 12  December elections, and the reversals associated with the recent  amnesty act are all things that do not dispose people to invest  money in a "base" that has a "superstructure" of that sort.  Second, Russian inflation and taxes are ardently competing with  one another in rendering any investment activity altogether  meaningless. Third, the country is not following any purposeful  policy for attracting foreign investments, the lack of which is  reflected in the absence of any economically backed priorities  for attracting them, and of an appropriate organizational basis  for doing so. It is no surprise that, according to data on the  Russian balance of payments, the amount of direct foreign  investments dropped from $800 million in 1992 to $600 million in  1993.    For all practical purposes, the new federal center has been  established in place of the Russian Agency for International  Cooperation and Development (RAMSIR). For all the importance of  pre-investment research and the expert review of proposed  financing arrangements, the replacement is plainly not an equal  one. Technically, RAMSIR has not been abolished, and no one has  removed Aleksandr Shokhin, who has again become a vice-premier,  from the office of the agency's chairman. In essence, the  division of RAMSIR between the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and the Ministry of Economics has been completed: the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations has formed a chief  administration that is concerned with investment cooperation,  i.e., with the construction of facilities in Russia (and that  has no direct relation to foreign investments), while the  Ministry of Economics has formed the federal center. And the  investors themselves, while acquiring an agency for the  "provision of expert consulting support for investment  projects," have lost an official defender of their interests in  the Russian government.    The establishment of the center also indicates that, under  conditions in which the attraction of direct foreign investments  has not been crowned with success, reliance can be placed on  investment credits. If that is the case, the center possesses  certain weaknesses, since it acts only as a state middleman in  bringing investment projects up to the stage of implementation.  But those same functions, in principle, should be performed by  banks that undertake the financing of projects. In this  connection, one may recall the postponed project for  establishing a specialized project financing bank with a network  of branches throughout Russia.    [Begin box]  <H8>  Government Agencies Specializing in Foreign Investments: </H8>   End of 1992--Russian Agency for International Cooperation  and  Development (RAMSIR), as an agency for the development and  implementation of a policy for attracting foreign investments,  headed by Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin (the statute on it was  confirmed by a 12 December 1992 government decree).    January 1994--RAMSIR, with the clearly reduced but  little-understood status of a "state institution," is  transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations (the 10 January 1994 presidential edict "On  the Structure of Federal Agencies").    March--the functions of attracting foreign investments,  including pre-project studies, are assigned to the  Ministry of Economics (a 28 March 1994 government  decree).    April--the Project Financing Center is established  under the Ministry of Economics (4 April 1994 government decree  "On the Organization of Work With Foreign Investments and on  Consulting and Technical Assistance").

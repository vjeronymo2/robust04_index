He was reacting to the fact that the leadership of  the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the  government coalition, confirmed at a meeting today its intention  to push for Senate elections in 81 one-mandate constituencies.  Asked about the ODA's further approach at talks on the system of  Senate elections Kalvoda said he would consider it tragic for  the coalition if it was unable to agree on a government bill on  senatorial elections to be submitted to parliament.    Meanwhile, Josef Lux, chairman of another coalition party --  the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL) -- told CTK that both variants for Senate elections --  the ODS's and that of other coalition parties which prefer  Senate elections being held in 27 three-mandate constituencies  -- conform with the constitution and the majority election  system. What is essential is that the system is clear and  transparent, Lux said, adding it was not any fundamental dispute  between the coalition parties. These questions will be further  discussed and if no agreement is reached it is up to Parliament  to decide, he said. "We are prepared to discuss any variant," he  added.</p>

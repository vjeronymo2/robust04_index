			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Private View: Still watching with mother - Lady Elspeth Howe, chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, talks about sex and violence on television VIOLENCE is a problem. How much it is a problem of the real world and how much a problem of exaggerated media attention our rulers find difficult to decide. But the British public is said to be worried by violence on television. Five years ago Margaret Thatcher's government created a quango called the Broadcasting Standards Council to prove it was doing something about it - 'it' being the depiction of violence not only in the sense of mutilation, injury or rape but also gladiatorial sex and swearing. The appointment of William Rees-Mogg, former editor of The Times (now the Don Quixote of Maastricht), as its first chairman was greeted with the sort of derision that accompanied Lord Longford's inspection of strip clubs 20 years ago. The council was seen as the consummation of the Nanny State. Last month the poisoned chalice of its chairmanship passed to Elspeth Howe, the 61-year-old wife of the former Tory chancellor and foreign secretary whose resignation speech was the proximate cause of Mrs Thatcher's downfall. Lady Howe may have a nannyish air. But in right-wing Conservative demonology she is portrayed as something far uglier. According to Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the rent-a-quote MP, her haircut is the giveaway. She is, he once said, the 'typical intellectual', the type who would have espoused Communism in the the 1930s, the Lady Macbeth who handed the knife to her irresolute thane of a husband, Geoffrey. Not quite. Elspeth Howe may have enjoyed playing billiards and sitting up with the gentlemen over port and cigars at the foreign secretary's country house but she is not the self-confident, ambitious schemer her detractors suppose. Nor is she an intellectual. She was a secretary who became a dutiful Tory wife and sat on women's committees, became a juvenile court magistrate and sat on many more committees. At the age of 53 she took a degree in social administration at the London School of Economics. She is an energetic, amateur member of that club known as the Great and Good: she is not very fluent when she talks, but is sincere, approachable, feminine, occasionally even coquettish. No, Lady Howe's real crime is that she is a feminist. She was deputy chairman of that socialist cabal known as the Equal Opportunities Commission and her reputations has followed her into the new job. It is not, one might think, the function of a Broadcasting Standards Council to push the cause of women. Or is it? Having answered, rather imprecisely, some questions about the link between television and street violence, Lady Howe went on to say that women as viewers and listeners were badly served because there were too few women in top broadcasting jobs. Even if that were true, I asked, was it any business of the council's? 'We come back to what's shown on television' she replied. 'If there is too much violence - I'm not saying every woman programme maker would say 'we've had enough of violence' - I think it is relevant that if we have more women coming up we will have much more of a balance.' Men like to show violence and women by and large do not? 'You put that into my mouth. It isn't what I'm saying. All my life I've tried to get women and men working together on every level. The women's groups would feel comfortable if there were more of their own sex.' You think women should be promoted because they are women? 'Never] No, no, of course I don't. You know that. I don't think women should be promoted other than on their ability. I have never been in favour of what in America is called positive discrimination - but positive action, to see they get to the right places where they can be promoted. That includes giving a lot of attention to flexibility of working arrangements and to the attitudes of both men and women. I'm not saying that's going to solve all the problems of what people want to see on television.' The council is revising its code of practice which broadcasters are required by law to reflect in their own guidelines. Among the additions is a paragraph on 'political correctness'. The Council, it says, 'respects the underlying arguments' and suggests broadcasters should avoid words which may confirm a stereotype, unless that leads to clumsy circumlocution. I asked Lady Howe if this would make the council a hostage to various PC lobbies. 'There are certain words we or our children may have used, like 'spastic', as a not very complimentary comment. Now it's not acceptable because those who are spastic find it deeply offensive. For broadcasters to be aware of that I would have thought is common sense, common courtesy. On any view of it, 'political correctness' changes over time.' Surely, I said, it's the job of people who make programmes to be aware of these things. Do they need you to tell them? 'Ah, well I would hope that self-regulation, self-discipline is the major part of all this. That's absolutely as it should be.' So you are a finger-wagging body? 'No, I don't think we are.' You are admonitory? 'We are advisory.' Mocked though it may have been, the council's code is a well-written document with which sensible people would find it hard to disagree. The trouble seems to be not so much what the council says, but what it is. Powerless to help the customer or frighten the producer, it is reduced to the status of political lightning-conductor. The council has little bite beyond requiring its findings to be published and, occasionally, broadcast. It adjudicates on complaints from the public under three headings: violence, sex and taste-and-decency. (There is a separate Broadcasting Complaints Commission to deal with matters such as invasion of privacy. The two bodies may be merged.) The number of complaints about violence received by the council more than trebled last year, to 230. Yet this was less than the figure for complaints about sex (273) and far less than that for taste and decency (587). The figures bely the perception that violence on television is a big public preoccupation. Statistics are not the council's only ammunition. Its members travel round the country talking to various groups, and research is commissioned on topics such as the portrayal of women, of ethnic minorities and of the mentally ill, violence on the news, or children's viewing habits. Lady Howe claimed the council had become a credible body. 'I want to stress  -because I do believe it - that if it was maybe regarded with suspicion both by broadcasters and some politicians without doubt it has established itself, certainly with a number of broadcasters, and they do take its findings seriously. 'I think it is interesting that in quite a number of cases where we have made findings the programme makers have acknowledged they have gone too far. That may be a justification for having a body outside to nudge.' Her job, she said, was to persuade. Lady Howe is careful. Her replies were qualified to the point of blandness. Perhaps it is because she is new to the job. Do children watch too much television? 'I don't think it's a question of watching too much or too little. It's what they watch.' Do you see television as a cultural scourge? 'No, no. Quite the opposite. I am a tremendous enthusiast. The wildlife programmes . . . I know everyone says this is boring, but if those had been around when I was young I would have been interested . . . I think it can have a wonderful influence, broaden minds . . . things people have never seen before, wonderful drama, 'Yes, Minister', news, documentaries . . .' Were standards falling as a result of Thatcher's Broadcasting Act? 'There is a concern about competitiveness and so on. No doubt all of that is an influence. But within whatever context, it is very, very important that one regards it as a wonderful opportunity. But it can be dangerous too.' Do you enjoy watching sex on television? Do you find it boring? 'Up to a point. Yes I do, after a while, find it boring if it goes on and on and on. It depends if it is relevant.' Context, she said, was what mattered. And who will disagree with her? Lady Howe may not be the sharpest exponent of her mission but she probably expresses the sentiments of many people. She represents the values of an older generation - which is not to say they are outdated - not the easy moral certitudes of the New Right. There is, she said, a convention of parliamentary politesse. 'I don't really see why on radio or television, before a certain hour, we should have bad language. Language should be appropriate to who you are with.' She might have added that there are still places in Britain where it is considered gross rudeness for men to swear in the company of women. Perhaps the majority of us feel threatened and frightened by television's relentless reflection of the ugly side of our humanity. But are broadcasters merely holding a mirror up to Nature? Or are they cynically resorting to shock tactics to win the widening war for ratings? If the former, there is not much more that Elspeth Howe and her councillors can do but grieve. If the latter, they may bark a little - politely, of course.</p>

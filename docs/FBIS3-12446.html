			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In a commentary headlined "Denunciation Alone  Insufficient," AL-BA'TH says: It is indeed strange that Israel  should be talking about the enemies of peace, when, in reality,  it is its enemy number one, if not the only one.    In a bid to explain away the savagery perpetrated at the  Ibrahimi Mosque, Rabin contends that it is the enemies of peace  who stand to benefit from the massacre. He chooses to forget  that those with Arab blood on their hands are the ones who have  been hampering every effort to advance the peace process since  the Madrid conference.    Rabin, who is shedding tears over peace, himself leads the  opposition to disarming the settlers. This means that he  condones their atrocities and even wants them to continue. The  massacre that has sent shockwaves throughout the world has  prompted the Arabs to suspend their participation in the  bilateral talks. Not that they are thus terminating the peace  efforts; they are, in effect, telling the sponsors of the peace  process to wake up to their responsibilities. The first of  these is to curb Zionist terror in the occupied Arab territories  and south Lebanon, and then to persuade the Rabin government to  relinquish its intransigent posture and embark on serious  negotiations based on a real and clear commitment to vacating  the entire occupied Arab territories in compliance with UN  resolutions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 24 June (MTI) -- As MTI reported earlier,  President Arpad Goncz has returned to Budapest, having received  the Grand Award of the Institute of East-West Studies (IEWS) for  his contribution to tolerance and inter-nation reconciliation in  Eastern Europe, along with Slovak President Michal Kovac.    At a press conference held at Ferihegy Airport, Goncz said  he  informed his American negotiating partners, including President  Clinton, on the results of Hungary's general elections. "I  assured the American politicians of the constancy of priorities  in Hungarian foreign policy, and encouraged them to increase  their investments in Hungary," Goncz said.    At U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with the Hungarian  and Slovak presidents, Goncz assured him that democratic trends  are certain to continue in Hungary, and the two main priorities  of the country's foreign policy will remain the same in the  future: maintenance of peace and advancing reform processes in  the region. Hungary intends to improve its relations with  neighboring countries, Goncz told Clinton, who -- in Goncz's  words -- "gave his blessing" to this.    At the Office of Overseas Private Investments, established  to  promote U.S. investments abroad, Goncz suggested that the  officials send a delegation to Hungary to survey investment  options, particularly in the energy, environmental,  infrastructure, food, and information technology sectors.    Goncz was very optimistic about his talks with Michal Kovac.  He voiced his hope that Hungary may be able to sign a basic  treaty with Slovakia before the next Slovak general elections.  Once the basic treaty has been signed, links between the two  states can take a pronounced turn towards a tight and friendly  relationship, the Hungarian president said.    Goncz also told the press that he accepted Kovac's  invitation  to the anniversary celebrations of the Slovak Banska Bysrtica  uprising, and the Slovak president might visit Hungary during  the summer.</p>

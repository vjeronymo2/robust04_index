			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Resort and 3i settle dispute Resort Hotels and 3i, the venture capital group, have reached an out of court settlement of a dispute about whether 3i had an option or an obligation to subscribe for 800,000 new shares in the leisure company at 50p each. Resort's shares have fallen sharply over the last 12 months from a peak of a little less than 90p to about 30p recently. The two companies said the dispute 'arose out of a misunderstanding' during negotiations last year. Resort has withdrawn its litigation against 3i, and 3i has given an undertaking to subscribe for the 800,000 shares as soon as Resort's share price reaches 57p for a period of five consecutive days.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short rates squeeze up WORRYING statistics on inflation failed to whip the UK money markets into a frenzy of rate cut enthusiasm yesterday, possibly because the data were offset by tight money squeezing short term rates higher, writes Peter John. The latest figures for retail price inflation suggested that the UK might have tilted from a trend of low growth with no inflation to inflation with no growth. That would be the worst possible situation for the pound and could make the need for lower interest rates even more pressing. However, short sterling futures which signal the market's view of where interbank rates will be at a fixed date - and consequently, the direction of base rates - failed to respond to the news. The contract for December delivery closed only two basis points higher on the day at 94.46 although turnover was very high at more than 55,000 contracts, suggesting very active two-way business. Many traders believe that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut base rates on or around the November 30 budget. Bank of England operations were hampered by an apparent unwillingness from the main clearing banks to borrow money. An early forecast of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage was later revised down to Pounds 1.2bn and left outstanding for much of the day. One dealer said: 'The daily miracle (the ability to always balance the national books acceptably by the end of the day's dealing's) almost didn't happen.' The central bank did not provide assistance during the early round and bought only Pounds 53m of bills at the next available opportunity. In the early afternoon the Bank provided a further Pounds 494 and the overnight lending rate was pushed to 7 per cent - it has been below 4 per cent recently. The Bank provided final assistance of Pounds 350m. Other European short-currency futures contracts were also firmer as the market's desire for lower rates increased. The French franc contract traded on Liffe was higher as French call money was quoted at 7 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent. Call money usually commands a rate between the low level intervention rate, and the upper level rate of 7.75 per cent. Analysts said that if the call rate was quoted below 7 per cent today it would be a strong signal that the intervention rate would fall.</p>

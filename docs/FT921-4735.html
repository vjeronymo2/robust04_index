			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Bass - still ale and hearty: The roots of a brewing giant HOW THE image of British beer has changed in just one generation. Take the monster brewer Bass Charrington. Today, its empire is built on lagers such as Carling Black Label and Tennents: bright beers swilled with such relish up and down the land that Bass makes over an annual cheque to the Excise in excess of Pounds 695m. Touring the ultra-modern brewery in Burton-on-Trent, cheerful executives shower you with record-beating statistics: gigantic profits, heroic consumption, epic production rates. It takes a certain sort of mind to take it all in. For me, it meant only an awful lot of beer. But there is more than one face to Bass, and not all the traditions of my childhood and adolescence have been laid to rest. On the northern edge of the great sprawl of Birmingham, I visited the Highgate Brewery in Walsall. In the summer of 1939, redundancy notices were drawn-up for the dozen-odd staff in what was, and is, a less-than-economic proposition. Then, there was that business over in Poland. Now, more than 50 years later, the men are still there. Highgate is famed for mild beer and, every now and then, an autumn strong ale called Highgate Old. Good Midland mild like Highgate is virtually unknown in the south, although the White Horse pub on Parson's Green, in west London, takes a regular delivery. The deep colour and strong 'chocolatey' flavour derive from the black malt which is added to the more usual pale and crystal malt. Munched in the raw, black malt tastes of coffee and burnt toast. Another factor is the famous 'soft' well water. The brewery manager compared the taste to blood, which led me to speculate on his movements at full moon. For those less accustomed to blood, the taste is reminiscent of iron. Fuggles hops complete the package. There are no pellets here: Highgate Mild is the purest 'real' ale. The pretty little brewery was built in the closing years of last century and forms a stark contrast to Bass's largest plant in the beer city of Burton-on-Trent. The need for efficiency has meant that the place has been knocked-about a bit but, underneath the 30-acre site, Bass brewing began: a comparatively modest venture founded in 1777. It was the well water that drew Bass to Burton although, in the high Middle Ages, the monks of Burton Abbey had known the secret of the gypsum deposits in the soil and their suitability for brewing a distinctive, reddish-brown ale. In the second half of the 18th century, the need for Baltic timber made the fortune of the port of Kingston-upon-Hull. Beer from Burton was shipped out as ballast on fleets bound for Konigsberg, Riga and St Petersburg. By the time the French Revolution broke out, the beer had grown so famous that there was a tavern in Paris's Palais Royal dispensing Burton ale to the budding politicians of the National Assembly. War with France and the continental blockade put a temporary end to this lucrative trade. Bass looked east along the Trent and Mersey Canal to Liverpool and, from there, to India: thus, India Pale Ale was born. Its success drew others to Burton and, by the end of last century, several dozen breweries were exploiting the wells, inhabiting gaunt Victorian buildings arranged around the railway sidings and ready to ship their brews right round the world. With the mergers and closures of this century, just three remain. Cask-conditioned draught Bass is brewed only in Burton. It is the descendant of that original beer which made the Bass fortunes. The water has changed, though: intensive farming and nitrate fertlizers have meant that it needs to be purified and the minerals added back. The brewery boffins concede that it is now possible to make Burton beer just about anywhere. The draught ale is still the brewer's favourite and great care is taken to ensure that each cask leaving Burton is up to scratch when it reaches the pub. At the end of my tour, I was treated to a delicately hoppy glass of it. As I sipped, I noticed another old friend on the shelf behind the bar: Worthington White Shield. a familiar face I had all but forgotten. With its addition of yeasts in the bottle, White Shield must virtually be unique in Britain, although the style lives on in Belgium and Germany. White Shield is made in the Burton style, but this last bottled beer is now produced elsewhere. As a relic of our beer-drinking past, it deserves to be known better. The Bass Museum can be visited in Horninglow Street, Burton-on-Trent (tel. 0283-42031). Open daily except Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day. Last admission 4 pm.</p>

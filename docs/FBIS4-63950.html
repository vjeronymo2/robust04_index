			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 25 May -- Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister  Andriy Vasylyshyn has delivered an address to the leadership and  all personnel of internal affairs agencies in Crimea.    The address reads, in particular: "The non-performance by  the  Crimean autonomy's authorities of the Ukrainian presidential  directives and their deliberate disregard for Ukraine's  Constitution and legislation are causing tension in the  situation on the peninsula. All this is increasing pressure on  the personnel of internal affairs agencies".    The Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry's collegium regrets  that Crimean militiamen have to work "under difficult conditions  which were artificially created," the minister points out. "We  hope that the necessary decisions will be taken in the very near  future, with the help of people's deputies of Ukraine and the  Republic of Crimea, to stabilize the situation in Crimea."    The minister's appeal makes the following requests:    "To convey to members of staff our certainty that the bodies  of internal affairs in Crimea will further remain within the  single structure of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine;    "To remain calm, confident, and loyal to their oath, to  prevent the illegal use of arms, to treat citizens with respect,  to strictly abide by laws when detaining citizens and making  them answerable, and to prevent violations of the administrative  legislation;    "To step up the struggle against crime and its most  organized  forms, to restore order in the streets and in public places, and  in so doing to pay special attention to instructing special duty  squads at a high professional level;    "To establish efficient interaction with the Main  Directorate  of the Security Service of Ukraine in Crimea, the procurator's  office, the subunits of the National Guard and military units,  and with other departments with the aim of improving adherence  to law and order and legality in Crimea.    "Today peace and accord and citizens' security in Crimea are  in your hands. Do not let yourselves get involved in political  games."</p>

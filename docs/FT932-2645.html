			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Ticino (8): Business-oriented - A visitor's guide to Lugano LUGANO, like all Swiss cities, exudes a feeling of wealth and luxury and is clearly a business-oriented town: lively during the day and quiet at night. It is built around an alluring lakeside with a long, palm-shaded promenade. The old town centre features a large pedestrian precinct with shops galore and a visual feast of Italianate arcaded buildings. Getting there Agno airport is typically efficient and only 10km from the centre of Lugano. But there is no rail connection and taxis cost about SFr60. For those coming from the north, the rail journey from Zurich, winding through the Alps, is well worth the three hours it takes. For departures from Agno, look carefully at your booking. Lugano is one of the places from which a 'direct' flight is seldom a non-stop one. Most northward flights make a stop in Zurich or Geneva. Getting around Lugano makes life difficult for the motorist. Unless a car is absolutely essential, it is always better to get around in taxis, buses and on foot. On the other hand, if you have to travel outside of Lugano, a car is essential. Roads are excellent and directions clearly signposted. Rush hours are between 7:30 and 8:30 in the morning and between 5:00 and 6:30 in the afternoon and are particularly fierce near borders because of the heavy traffic of day workers from Italy. Hotels The Grand Hotel Eden in Lugano's Paradiso section is popular with businessmen. It is divided into two sections and the one on the lakefront is quieter and offers a better view. The hotel is modern, with all facilities, but has no memorable personality. (Tel 091-55-01-21) The Splendide Royal sits splendidly above the lakeside road looking over the lake and is a little closer to the centre of town than the Eden. An aristocratic villa transformed into a hotel in 1888, its salons are furnished with antiques and 19th century paintings. Lake view rooms are a bit noisy during the summer. Otherwise, this is a fine hotel that has had the same manager for 15 years. (Tel 091-54-20-01) The Principe Leopoldo is a beautifully-restored neo-classical villa with 24 suites, a garden around the pool, a winter garden and conference space. Its disadvantage is that it is somewhat inconveniently located on the outskirts of the city, making it necessary to drive or take a taxi. It is part of the Relais &amp; Chateaux chain. (Tel 091-55-88-55) The Villa Castagnola au Lac is in a restored 19th century villa slightly outside the centre of town and has a beautiful park, swimming pool and tennis courts. It is set well set back from the busy main road and is on a well-served bus route to the centre. (Tel 091-51-22-13) Among four-star hotels, the Lugano Dante (Tel 091-22-95-61) and the Admiral (Tel 091-54-23-24) appeal to a business clientele and are conveniently located. Restaurants Most of the better restaurants are a little bit outside of Lugano. Ristorante Bianchi, founded in 1803 and newly restored is close to the Lugano Dante Hotel. International-nouvelle cuisine. Good wine list. Al Portone is a refined, city-style restaurant with international cuisine, large choice of cheeses and desserts. Parco Saroli is in the Banc del Gottardo building created by architect Mario Botta. At noon, it is very crowded but is a pleasant place to meet for business lunches. The cuisine is local northern Italian-international. Motto del Gallo is in the Taverne-Toricella. You need a car or must take a taxi to get there but it is well worth it. High class restaurant in a rustic setting. Local and northern Italian cuisine. Garden seating in the summer. The restaurant in the Principe Leopoldo hotel is very chic for the occasion when someone has to be impressed. Lovely setting and international cuisine. Tips for time off Take a boat ride round the lake. There are stops in Paradiso and in the centre of Lugano, and boats leave frequently for Ponte Tresa (about 1 1/2 hours), Campione (20 minutes) and Gandria (half an hour) on the Italian border. Play the tables at Campione, an exclave of Italy on the east side of the Lake of Lugano, or just soak up the real Italian night life atmosphere there after Lugano goes to sleep. Visit various museums, among which the Museo Cantonale in central Lugano, the Villa Malpensata on the way to Paradiso and the Villa Favorita (which now houses Baron Thyssen Bornemisza's 19th and 20th century collection of European and American art) in Castagnola, are the most notable. The Villa Favorita has just been reopened after extensive renovation. It is open from 10am to 5pm, Tuesdays to Sundays. Rent a car and take a modern architecture tour of the region. The Ticino Tourist office publishes a brochure outlining such tours. Local architects Mario Botta, Aurelio Galfetti, Luigi Snozzi and others have made big contributions to modern architecture. Visit the medieval castles in Bellinzona where members of the Sforza and Visconti families once ruled. Castelgrande, the largest of the three, was recently restored by Aurelio Galfetti. The restaurant Castelgrande within the castle is worth a visit too. Visitors in August can take in the Locarno Film Festival. Its emphasis is on films from the Third World and by new directors. Outdoor screenings are held in Locarno's main square. Go by train. Traffic jams on the main road to the city, bad at the best of times, become monumental during the festival. Go hiking. There are dozens of hilly trails within easy reach of the city, and the Lugano tourist office publishes an excellent 1:50,000 map illustrating them. For more leisurely walks and spectacular views over southern Ticino, take a funicular from Paradiso to the top of San Salvatore (900 metres) or another one from Cassarate to Monte Bre. For music lovers, the highlight is the spring concert season, with orchestral concerts in the Palazzo dei Congressi conference centre from late March until early June. In July and August, the city offers frequent baroque concerts in parks, churches and historical buildings. There is a brief opera season from July 6-10 and an international festival of organ music in Magadino throughout July. The New Orleans Music Festival runs from June 25 to July 4 in Ascona and modern jazz is highlighted in Lugano's Estival Jazz 1993 from July 1-3. How to spend it Luxury goods are available in profusion in Lugano. A more original purchase would be a local Merlot wine at the Bottega del Vino Gabbani in Via Pessina. Among the best labels are Tenuta Montalbano, Merlot Tre Terre, La Brenta Riserva Speciale and Merlot dei Castelli di Bellinzona.</p>

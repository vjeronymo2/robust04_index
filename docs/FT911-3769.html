			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Electronics giants seek protection PRESSURE TO protect the European Community's troubled electronics industry intensified over the weekend at a crisis meeting between key members of the European Commission and the EC's five main electronics companies. The industrialists pressed their case for specific support measures going beyond the general plan presented by Brussels last month to channel more EC research money into demand-creating infrastructure projects. The commissioners apparently expressed sympathy for the companies' increasing difficulty with Japanese competition, but in no way committed the EC executive, officials said yesterday. The secret meeting was called last Friday and Saturday in a small town in Burgundy by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, with Bull and Thomson, France's state-controlled electronics companies, Siemens of Germany, Olivetti of Italy and Philips of the Netherlands. Also present were Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the research commissioner, and their two directors-general. The attempted secrecy of the meeting, news of which leaked into the French press over the weekend, reflects the sensitivity of the issue, as much within the Community as in relations with Japan. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner who had succeeded in pruning dirigiste elements out of the Commission's March paper on the electronics sector, was a notable absentee from the Burgundy meeting, though he was assured in advance that it would not compromise his policy of controlling state aids. Sir Leon is examining the complaint by ICL of Britain, which is majority-owned by Fujitsu of Japan, against the French government's recent decision to inject FFr6bn (Pounds 590m) of fresh capital into Bull and Thomson. Mr Alain Gomez, the chairman of Thomson, recently called for the establishment of high EC customs duties on Japanese electronic goods for an adjustment period of five years. 'That will be enough for us to catch up the unwarranted advantage acquired by the Japanese thanks to 30 years of unfair competition,' he told Le Monde newspaper. An EC official said yesterday that Mr Gomez's ideas could not be considered close to Commission thinking. Tomorrow, EC research ministers will discuss, at France's insistence, the issue of whether foreign-owned companies should participate in EC research programmes. ICL was recently barred from a couple of Esprit information technology programmes in which it had been marginally involved. But UK officials said yesterday Mr Pandolfi had assured them that ICL would not be excluded from any important research on grounds of its ownership. Siemens results, Page 25</p>

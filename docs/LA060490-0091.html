			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> GREASE BUILDUP CAUSES SEWAGE SPILLS  </P> <P> Household grease clogged two eight-inch sewage pipes and caused two raw sewage  spills in Oxnard last month, officials said.  </P> <P> In the first of the two spills, about 2,000 gallons of sewage seeped onto city  streets May 21 at Santa Lucia Avenue and Balsam Street, said Robert Montgomery,  environmental control supervisor for the Oxnard sewage treatment plant on  Perkins Road at Ormond Beach.  </P> <P> That spill washed into a storm drain that eventually empties into the ocean at  Ormond Beach, but was treated with chlorine and probably dried up before  reaching the ocean, Montgomery said.  </P> <P> On May 22, about 1,000 gallons of raw sewage seeped out of a manhole and onto  the street in the 3000 block of Via Marina Avenue.  </P> <P> The sewage was treated with chlorine and washed into a storm drain that empties  into Mandalay Bay. Tests of the water revealed bacteria counts 160 times the  state's standard for safe water for swimming, but no warning notices were  posted, Montgomery said.  </P> <P> Montgomery said he believed that the spill did not pose a health hazard because  that area of Mandalay Bay is not used for swimming. He said he contacted the  county Environmental Health Department, which decides whether to post beaches,  and "this time they didn't."  </P> <P> The bacteria dissipated within 24 hours, he said.

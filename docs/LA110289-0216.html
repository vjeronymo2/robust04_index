			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHRYSLER WORKERS REJECT OFFER  </P> <P> Workers at Chrysler's No. 2 plant have rejected a contract proposal that would  have set up a four-day workweek and allowed the hiring of up to 1,000 new  employees, a union spokeswoman said today.  </P> <P> The results of the voting Wednesday by members of United Auto Workers Local 110  were 2,340 against and 300 in favor of the proposed pact, the spokeswoman said.  She said local officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> Union officials had said they expected workers at the mini-van plant to approve  the proposal, which called for employees to work 10 hours a day during the  four-day week.  </P> <P> Company executives had said the move would boost output of the nation's most  popular mini-van to 50,000 vehicles a year without having to construct a new  plant. The mini-van is Chrysler's most popular vehicle.  </P></p>

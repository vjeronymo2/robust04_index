The official said in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that a  lieutenant in the army opened fire on the Iraqi leader in  Baghdad earlier this month. The officer appeared to be acting  alone, he said. The official, who did not wish to be named, also  confirmed reports which emerged from Baghdad three weeks ago  about a bomb attack against the presidential convoy.    The explosive device had been left in a tractor abandoned by  the roadside and was detonated as the convoy passed on Dec 28.    Last summer between 60 and 300 people were arrested and put  to death, accused of being involved in an aborted coup attempt.  Many of those rounded up were senior and trusted figures in the  regime and came from Saddam's home city of Takrit.    According to Iraqi opposition sources, the latest attempt on  the president's life may have been carried out by an officer who  was seeking revenge for the death of a member of his family in  the purge.</p>

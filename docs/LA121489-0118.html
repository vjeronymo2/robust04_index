			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CALLS FOR BALLOT MEASURE ON POLICE SURTAX  </P> <P> The City Council, which has frequently discussed the need for more police, is  taking steps to draw up a ballot proposal that asks Long Beach voters to  approve a property tax surcharge to pay for an additional 75 police officers.  </P> <P> Although a task force studying ways of paying for more police officers has not  yet made any recommendations to the council, the council this week asked city  staff members to prepare the ballot measure. It would come before the council  within the next month for a vote, and if approved, would be placed on the  ballot sometime next year.  </P> <P> The 650-member Police Department has long complained that it is seriously  understaffed, although a private consultant's report last summer concluded that  the department could solve many of its staffing problems without hiring more  officers if it changed some of its personnel policies. Those personnel changes  are now the subject of negotiations with the police union.  </P></p>

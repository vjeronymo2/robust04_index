			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PLAYER'S FATHER FELLED AT BALLGAME  </P> <P> The father of New York Yankees designated hitter Ken Phelps is in serious  condition today following a heart attack he suffered during a Yankees game  against the Seattle Mariners.  </P> <P> Len Phelps, 82, was behind home plate at the Kingdome when he collapsed Sunday  afternoon. A man sitting next to Phelps pulled him into the aisle and  administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  </P> <P> "I noticed his face was turning red and his tongue was purple so I knew he was  having a heart attack," said Sean Alderman, a ski patrolman in Mammoth  Mountain, Calif. "I've done CPR before with the ski patrol, and it took four  sessions of pumping on his chest. Then he coughed and I knew he was ready to  breath." Medics revived Phelps and took him to Harborview Medical Center.  </P></p>

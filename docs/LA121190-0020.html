			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREE THE 'KEATING FIVE'?;  </P> <P> INOUYE HAD A POINT -- AND WHY THE ANSWER IS PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING  </P> <P> The Senate Ethics Committee may or may not conclude that California's Alan  Cranston and others among the so-called "Keating Five" violated their chamber's  standards of conduct when they intervened with federal regulators on behalf of  Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan's former owner. But whatever the committee's  decision, the testimony it has taken paints an intolerably squalid picture of  business-as-usual in "the world's greatest deliberative body."  </P> <P> It is, moreover, a squalor that will persist and deepen until the United States  comes to grips not only with the acts alleged in this instance, but also with  the way in which money is raised and spent in political campaigns.  </P> <P> Cranston's case most clearly illustrates the point: Charles H. Keating Jr., the  former thrift executive who now is an accused swindler, gave Cranston $60,000  in direct campaign contributions, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party  and $850,000 to support the activities of a voter registration group run by the  senator's son, Kim. According to memorandums written by Cranston fund-raiser  Joy Jacobson, some of that money was solicited during conversations in which  the senator also promised to press Keating's cause with regulators  investigating his spectacular mismanagement of Lincoln Savings. Failure to  bring that 3-year probe to a timely conclusion ultimately saddled the American  people with $2 billion in utterly unrecoverable costs from the thrift's  failure.  </P> <P> Cranston's critics charge that his conduct breached a 38-year-old Senate  standard requiring that campaign contributions not be solicited at the same  time a favor is being done for the prospective donor. "Furthermore," wrote the  standard's author, then-Sen. Paul Douglas, "a decent interval of time should be  allowed to lapse so that neither party will feel that there is a close  connection between the two acts."  </P> <P> Neither, presumably, will the people -- which is why the Douglas standard  better describes a public relations campaign than it does a code of ethics.  </P> <P> During the course of this whole bleak affair, there has been no more melancholy  sight than that of the distinguished senior senator from Hawaii, Daniel K.  Inouye, testifying as a character witness for the five accused lawmakers. They  had, Inouye said, done nothing that other senators do not routinely do. "I  believe that what is on trial here are not the five colleagues of mine, but the  United States Senate and, for that matter, the Congress of the United States,"  Inouye said.  </P> <P> That was an honest, if not particularly edifying, admission. It describes a  situation that will continue until the United States enacts a system of  campaign spending limits and public campaign financing of the sort already  adopted by progressive cities like Los Angeles.  </P></p>

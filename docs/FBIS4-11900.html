			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] A spokesman of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] in an interview described Israel's refusal to sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as the main obstacle  in the way of the Middle Eastern countries' cooperation with  that international organization. [passage omitted]    The refusal of countries such as Israel to join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty makes countries who have signed the  treaty feel that their cooperation with the IAEA does not  provide them with any kind of guarantee against a threat posed  by the countries who are not members of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. That matter has not only created an  obstacle in the way of cooperation between the Middle Eastern  countries and the IAEA, it has also created a problem for  international cooperation in that context.    The acknowledgement of the IAEA spokesman of that problem  reveals the fact that if this situation is not addressed, it is  not possible to pin much hope on the nuclear nonproliferation  programs.    At a time when America, together with other countries and in  cooperation with the IAEA, is exerting pressure on countries  such as North Korea in order to facilitate the inspection of its  installations suspected of prohibited nuclear activity, the  signatories of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty expect that  pressure is also exerted on countries such as Israel who have  not signed the treaty and have not accepted any nonproliferation  commitment, so that they accept nuclear nonproliferation.    Undoubtedly, that measure would serve international peace  and  stability as it can reduce obstacles in the way of nuclear  nonproliferation.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEYENNE BRANDO NOT COMPETENT, COURT RULES;  </P> <P> MURDER CASE: TAHITI DECISION DIMS PROSECUTION'S HOPES FOR HER TESTIMONY ABOUT  BROTHER'S ROLE IN THE DEATH OF HER LOVER.  </P> <P> Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, has been declared mentally incompetent by a  French court in Tahiti, dimming prosecutors' hopes of calling her as their star  witness in the upcoming murder trial of her brother, Christian.  </P> <P> Although the trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 14, this latest development  increases the likelihood of a plea-bargain agreement. Defense attorney Robert  Shapiro has said from the outset that a guilty plea to a reduced charge of  manslaughter would be appropriate, but sources close to the case say that  Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Barshop wants to exhaust all efforts to bring the  young woman back to Los Angeles before deciding whether to take the case to  trial.  </P> <P> "We've taken the position all along that our trial will go forward with or  without Cheyenne . . . (but) both sides know she is a very material witness,"  Barshop said.  </P> <P> Cheyenne Brando's mother, Tarita, was appointed as her guardian Thursday, after  a judge reviewed a psychiatrist's report as well as evaluations by doctors who  treated Cheyenne during five recent hospitalizations and two suicide attempts.  She remains hospitalized after attempting to hang herself from a tree last  month.  </P> <P> "She was placed yesterday under conservatorship," her attorney, Michael  Nasatir, told Santa Monica Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof Friday. "She has  been declared incompetent to handle her own affairs" or to care for her newborn  son.  </P> <P> Rudof issued a tentative ruling that he will sign a letter asking French  authorities to cooperate in returning her to California. Armed with the letter,  prosecutors say they could then serve her with a federal subpoena and, if she  did not appear as ordered, seize up to $100,000 in her U.S. assets.  </P> <P> Even if the legal obstacles are cleared and she wants to testify, the final  decision would rest with her mother, as her guardian.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said they are still awaiting the results of a psychiatric  examination ordered by a French magistrate in connection with charges against  her in Tahiti for being an accessory to the murder of her lover, Dag Drollet.  </P> <P> "There's a difference between a civil conservatorship and a competent witness  to testify in a court -- a lot of legal distinctions," said Barshop, explaining  why he is pressing on in light of her being declared incompetent.  </P> <P> Drollet was shot to death by her half-brother, Christian Brando, last May 16 at  the Brando family's hilltop estate in Bel-Air. Christian Brando maintains that  the shooting was an accident; Cheyenne Brando, who had gone to dinner with him  the night of the shooting, told police it was murder.  </P></p>

In it,  the Duma is proclaimed a political successor the Supreme Soviet.  If adopted, this declaration will become the State Duma's first  serious challenge to the president.    So far this is merely a declaration -- a document whose  adoption does not entail any legal effects. In a conversation  with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent, Mr. Isakov stated that  since the deputies' attitude to this document is controversial,  it should be executed precisely in the form of a declaration and  submitted to the Duma only after being carefully studied in the  committees. Apparently Vladimir Isakov sees the declaration as  a feeler of the deputies' attitude to this sensitive issue.  Apart from the declaration, the legislation committee is  preparing a number of other draft laws that can give rise to  serious friction with the president. Laws based on concepts  differing from the president's are also ripening in other  committees.    The constitution, however, substantially limits the  possibility of adopting laws not suiting the president. The  Duma can approve such a law: to do so, the majority of deputies  need to vote for it. Further, the law is submitted to the  Federation Council: the president uses all levers on its  members to influence them either to adopt the law or reject it.  If the president's efforts are unproductive, he can use his  veto power. To override his veto requires two-thirds of the  vote in both houses of parliament, which is very difficult to  get. Thus, in making the first attempt to pass a law which is  absolutely unamenable to the president, the Duma has been  confronted with the problem of its own legislative powerlessness.    To overcome it, the Duma should probably seek the  president's  opinion at the early stages of work on draft laws.  (Incidentally, a proposal has come from the presidential  administration whereby not only adopted laws but also their  drafts should be sent to the Kremlin). This opinion is  apparently also shared by Mr. Isakov. According to him, each law  adopted by the Duma must be the result of a compromise,  combining provisions both attractive and not very attractive to  the president: this should make the draft law veto- proof.    Not only the Duma but also the president and the government  are interested in such a compromise formula: If the latter fail  to find a common language with the house and block the laws  adopted by it, the lower chamber of parliament will very soon  become a politically embittered and aggressive state body, a  powerful center attracting all those unhappy with the president,  including those who have invested heavily in electing "their"  deputies in the hope for future profits resulting from the  passage of beneficial laws.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OPPOSES EXPANSION OF BASE;  </P> <P> PROJECT: MEMBERS VOTE AGAINST THE NAVY'S PROPOSAL TO ADD TO PORT FACILITIES AT  THE SEAL BEACH NAVAL WEAPONS STATION.  </P> <P> The City Council Monday added its voice to the growing opposition to a Navy  proposal to build a $200-million expansion of its port facilities at the Seal  Beach Naval Weapons Station.  </P> <P> Council members voted 4 to 0, with Mayor Edna Wilson abstaining, to formally  oppose the expansion project that would change the configuration of Anaheim  Bay.  </P> <P> The council decision came despite a plea by Capt. Stephen T. Holl, commanding  officer of the weapons station, that they delay any vote until an environmental  study is completed in about a year.  </P> <P> But the council member who represents the coastal area near the weapons station  urged them to avoid any delays.  </P> <P> "We don't want your facility to be expanded in a residential neighborhood,"  Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings said. "We feel it poses a lot of hazards  and potential danger to the environment."  </P> <P> The Navy's proposal has already come under fire from nearly every quarter in  the local community.  </P> <P> Last week an unlikely coalition of environmentalists, peace activists, wealthy  homeowners, surfers, local merchants, and realtors formed a new group, Stop the  Breakwater, to coordinate their opposition. They plan to begin collecting  signatures door-to-door for a petition they will send to the secretary of the  Navy, urging him not to seek funding for the project.  </P> <P> A local congressman predicted that unless the Navy substantially alters the  project, it will never receive any funding. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long  Beach), who represents the area, said he would vote against the project in its  current form.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher's opponent in November's elections, Democrat Guy Kimbrough, said he  has "serious reservations" about the proposal but would like to see the results  of environmental studies from both the Navy and independent environmental  groups before he makes a final judgment.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher said "the chances are virtually nil that a military construction  can go through over the objections of the local congressman."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher echoed the concerns of local residents over the proposal, which  includes a 4,000-foot extension of the east jetty of Anaheim Bay, the waterway  between Seal Beach and Huntington Harbor.  </P> <P> Large warships, which now must anchor three miles away and be serviced by small  barges, could by 1997 tie up to the new jetty and load or unload ammunition  directly onto a new wharf.  </P> <P> Many residents worry that the huge L-shaped structure would all but eliminate  the surf on Surfside and Sunset beaches, worsen beach erosion by shifting the  sand into new patterns and drive down property values by turning the scenic  oceanfront into something resembling a naval shipyard.  </P> <P> Some also worry that since the project would enable the weapons station to  service three times as many ships as is currently possible, increased ship  traffic could add to pollution offshore and increased handling of weapons could  add to the danger of an accident.  </P> <P> Holl said increased ship-handling capacity would not necessarily mean more  ships would use the base. Nor would abandoning the project prevent more ships  from using the base if demand for its services increased, he said.  </P> <P> "If we didn't expand the port, we might have to do other things to get people  through here faster," he said. "We might have to work weekends or during the  night."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" article by Henrik Qvortrup: "A Defeat With </F> Its Bright Sides"]    [Text] Poul Nyrup Rasmssuen probably was pretty  disappointed yesterday.    Not even a Social Democrat of the superoptimistic variety  can  interpret the voters' searing blow in the European Union [EU]  election as a victory for the prime minister, his party, or his  government.    The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen was nevertheless not in full  mourning is due first and foremost to the fact that the election  result -- no matter how demoralizing it may be for the Social  Democratic Party [SDP] -- nevertheless contains some encouraging  elements for the prime minister. Or it does so at least if he  performs the experiment of shifting the voters' judgment over to  the Folketing election, which lies only a few months into the  future.    Prior to this election the major unknown is: Will the  Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress  Party achieve an absolute majority? -- a question that the prime  minister in particular can be expected to be much concerned with  in the months ahead.    In the light of this it is probably not incorrect to assume  that Nyrup Rasmussen and his advisers yesterday did some sums of  their own. Like adding together the percentage support for the  Liberal Party, the Conservative People's Party, and the Progress  Party in the EU election.    The answer to this sum is 44.4 percent -- that is, a good  way  below 50 percent of votes.    So even if it is humiliating for the Social  Democrats to be overtaken by their archrivals, the Liberals and  Conservatives, in the European Parliament, there is hope for  Nyrup Rasmussen.    In this context he can take pleasure in the fact that a  large  number of the lost Social Democratic votes went to parties and  movements that either will not run in the Folketing elections or  are to be considered "friends."    The Social Democrats have, therefore, every justification to  expect that some of the Social Democrats who chose to vote for  the June Movement or the People's Movement [Against the EC] will  return "home" in the Folketing elections.    At the same time the EU election has acted as a sort of  safety valve for Social Democrats frustrated by the EU: Now  their dissatisfaction has been demonstrated and  beginning with the Folketing elections it will again be domestic  political issues that determine where they place their crosses.    Or this is what Nyrup Rasmussen hopes at least.    Nevertheless the election must give the prime minister one  or  two things to think about -- also from the domestic viewpoint.  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen must think not least about what is wrong  with the Social Democratic election machine.    Before the EU election it was the general assumption that  the  Social Democrats' enormous machine would through an effective  election campaign be able to win some of the doubters over into  the fold. As we now know, the maneuver did not succeed very  well. And this despite the fact that in the last weeks of the  election campaign Nyrup Rasmussen invested all his authority as  prime minister in it. Not even his confrontations on television  with [Liberal Party leader] Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were much help.    This depressing fact must result in some wrinkling of the  foreheads among the Social Democrats. For even if their list of  candidates was not dominated by the great personalities, the  inescapable question thrusts itself on party activists -- and  partners in government:    If Nyrup could not give us a good election this time -- who  says that he will be able to do so next time? And the fact that  the Social Democratic Party's coffers are not exactly full on  the eve of the Folketing elections must further contribute to  the nervousness.    But the biggest worry for the Social Democrats is of course  the gulf between the party's official European stance and its  core voters' more than skeptical view of the EU.    And given the emphatic demonstration of the Social  Democratic  opposition to the EU Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will now be forced to  adjust his policy in the European sphere.    Where the prime minister would have preferred much great  freedom of action in the run-up to the decisive  intergovernmental conference in 1996, his hands are in reality  now firmly tied by the blow he received from the voters  yesterday. To put it briefly: He has no option other than a  particularly defensive European strategy. The voters' judgment  on this point cannot be misunderstood.    Now the prime minister needs time to digest the signal. And  then strategy must be adjusted accordingly.    In the light of this at least the Folketing election -- the  date of which is still not known -- has not come any closer.  And in addition, the prime minister has his own psychological  reasons for wanting a very late election:    The odor of defeat that the EU election has inflicted on the  Social Democrats must be gone before Poul Nyrup Rasmussen goes  out to meet the voters in what will probably be the most open  and decisive Folketing elections for many years.</p>

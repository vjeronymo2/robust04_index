			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Confidence on lease plans THE government's plans to give some 750,000 long leaseholders greater rights would receive parliamentary approval in spite of some disquiet among Tories, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, insisted yesterday. The proposals give many long leaseholders in flats the right to buy the freehold of their flats collectively if two thirds of the tenants in the block agree. Where such leaseholders live in buildings that do not qualify under the proposal, they will have the option of buying 90-year extensions to their leases. That is intended to enable them to keep their flats saleable, and ministers expect the option to have a beneficial effect on the property market. The new rights, with changes to public-sector housing management and new rights for council tenants, are set out in the Housing and Urban Development Bill, published yesterday. The bill, which also deals with the setting up of the Urban Regeneration Agency to help develop derelict land in inner cities, is due to be debated by MPs next month. Mr Howard admitted that some people, including Conservatives, had expressed reservations about the leasehold proposals, but said he hoped that they would disappear once the context had been fully understood. He added that there was no question of landlords facing 'confiscation'. The government's confidence that the plans will get through is based partly on the fact that Labour broadly welcomes this aspect of the bill.</p>

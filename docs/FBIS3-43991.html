			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ghana has appealed to the international community to  make the Togolese authorities realize the dangers of reckless  conduct and irresponsible accusations. Speaking to newsmen and  members of the diplomatic corps in Accra today, the minister of  foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Assamoah, said henceforth any  deliberate and unprovoked aggression will be met with  commensurate response.    Tina Tehuda has the story:    [Begin recording] [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah expressed the  government's concern about the recent events in Togo as well the  tension on the Ghana-Togo border and used the occasion to refute  the allegations against Ghana by the Togolese authorities. He  referred to the accusations by the Togolese foreign minister,  who said Togo had the right retaliate. Dr. Assamoah said Ghana  is in no way interested in subverting Togo, with which it is  bound by so many historical and ethnic links. He pointed out  that the country is at present too preoccupied with her internal  problems to get involved in what he called pointless foreign  adventures.    [Assamoah] Each time there is violence in Togo, refugees  streamed across the border in such numbers as to place an almost  intolerable burden on our economy and create social and  political problems. It would be foolish on our part, to  instigate actions that are not in best interest of the country.  It is rather illogical to state that Ghana is seeking to  prevent the holding of parliament elections in Togo when it has  itself embarked upon constitutional rule and has consistently  stated its readiness to support the forces of genuine  democratization in Togo.    [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Ghana still demands an apology  and compensation from the Togolese authorities. He explained  that if Ghana has so far refrained from responding in kind to  the extreme Togolese provocations, it is out of anxiety to save  the life of innocent civilians and to maintain international  peace and security.    [Assamoah] There is, however, a limit to what Ghana can  tolerate -- and Togo must take heed. Any deliberate and  unprovoked aggression will be met commensurate response. We  appeal to the international community to make the Togolese  appreciate the dangers of reckless conduct and irresponsible  accusations. May I conclude by stating clearly that Ghana has  no interest in interfering in the internal affairs of Togo, and  it is regrettable that the Togolese authorities should  constantly seek to divert attention from the trouble at home by  desperately trying to involve Ghana in their internal conflicts.  I must emphasize that Ghana ensures that those Togolese who  have been granted political asylum and refugee status in Ghana  under international conventions abide strictly by the laws of  the land.    We will deal firmly with anyone who abuses our hospitality.  Ghana pledges to continue to maintain firm control over the  border areas, to ensure that peace and tranquility prevail.    [Tehuda] Dr. Assamoah said Togo's refusal to reopen her  border with Ghana is causing hardship and tremendous economic  loss to many ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States]  citizens. He advised the Togolese Government to seek solutions  to its problems internally otherwise it unduly threatens the  peace of the subregion and also saps energies which should go  into nation building.

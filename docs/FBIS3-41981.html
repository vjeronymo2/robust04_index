A blast rocked the eastern coast of  the Sea of Japan. North Korea had launched the first test flight  of its secret Nodung missile. It sailed 500 kilometers toward  Japan and fell into the sea.    In Tokyo, the Japanese were in a panic. They knew well that  the Nodung could have easily flown its maximum range of 1,000  kilometers and crashed into Japan.    In Washington, U.S. strategists upgraded the missile threat  from Pyongyang from potential to real and decided that the  communist country required high-level attention.    Within hours, the news was relying to Jerusalem, Yitzhaq  Rabin and his military aides agreed that a turning point had  been reached. North Korea was a friend of Syria and Iran. The  Arabs now had a missile that could strike the Jewish state from  launchers out of the effective range of the Israel Air Force  [IAF].    To Rabin, it was the realization of a frightening thought he  had been expressing for at least a year. Israel could eventually  face thousands of medium-range missiles deployed by radical Arab  leaders swept into the euphoria of jihad, holy war.  Should Israel make a preemptive strike, hundreds of missiles  could rain down on it. If not, Israel would be forced to submit  to a dangerous and humiliating surrender.    Rabin's conclusion was that Israel must step up the  development of what could be its most ambitious and, perhaps,  most expensive project ever: the Arrow (Hetz) anti-missile  defense system. To its supporters, the Arrow can be Israel's  answer to the growing Arab missile threat and a card to play in  future Middle East diplomacy. To its opponents, the Arrow is a  wasteful project that will bankrupt the government and never  work.    These days, both proponents and opponents are nervous. In  the  coming days, the Arrow will undergo the first of three tests to  determine whether it can actually intercept and destroy the  warhead of an incoming enemy missile. If the tests fail,  opponents could succeed in reducing the scope of the project. If  the tests succeed, Israeli officials will decide to prepare for  the production and deployment of a system which no other nation  has.    "The next three tests will be crucial, not only for the  technological hurdles but also psychologically," says former  defense minister Moshe Arens, an Arrow supporter. "If they fail,  then they [in the government] won't want to continue."    Both sides agree that Israel faces a growing Arab missile  threat. Syria is acquiring Scud C missiles from North Korea.  Egypt is investing heavily in missile production as well.  Military sources acknowledge the eventual threat of 2,000 Arab  enemy missiles being aimed at Israel.    "The danger of missiles is a real threat," says Deputy  Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur. "I don't know who doesn't  appreciate this great danger."    Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yisrael Tal, one of the top military  strategists in Israel, says the Arabs have reached a strategic  balance with Israel through their acquisition of  ground-to-ground missiles. "We have lost the monopoly of  strategic deterrence, and there is a threat that it will pass  over to the Arabs," Tal is quoted in Arye Shalev's Peace  and Security in the Golan, published this year. Tal, a  senior Defense Ministry official, has not repeated these views  in public.    The argument is over the Israeli response. Until the Gulf  war, Israel and the U.S. shared the same approach. A missile  attack could be dealt with by the Air Force, which would search  and destroy missile batteries. "I was hearing the same story,"  says James Hackett, an executive with Titan Systems and one of  the leading missile experts in the U.S. "They said, `We don't  need [anti-missile] missiles. Just give us more airplanes.'"    The Pentagon changed that attitude after the war, in which  29  soldiers were killed by an Iraqi Scud attack on Saudi Arabia.  The Israeli military's view has remained the same: absorb a  first blow, locate the enemy's offenses and then attack hard.    "The entire effort is how to reduce the early damage [from a  missile attack] so the missile launchers can be found," says  Me'ir Kohen, a missile expert close to the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] leadership. "If we have good intelligence, we can find  them."    The subject has pitted uniformed commanders against defense  technocrats. It has been a controversy fueled by a wholesale  disinformation, personal enmities and a bureaucratic battle  between the IDF and the Defense Ministry. Israel Aircraft  Industries [IAI], the chief Israeli contractor for the Arrow,  originally set 1995 for the completion of the Arrow's  development. Military experts say it will be a miracle if any  sort of system can be installed by the end of the decade.    "It [Arrow] is not practical in the short term," says former  Air Force commander Avihu Bin-Nun. "The resources are limited.  If we invest in the offensive answer, then we have versatility."    "The missile threat is very small," he adds. "It has been  blown out of proportion by us. One plane can do more against us  than all 40 missiles that fell on us [during the Gulf war]."    Bin-Nun's view is widely held throughout the military,  particularly among the commanders who draft budgets. For years,  the Air Force had little to do with the project. Today, IDF  strategists, set to review its multi-year program, are planning  to demand a cut in the Arrow program.    In many ways, its a rerun of previous army battles with the  civilian defense establishment over budgeting huge research and  development programs. "The army works from a mindset," says  Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yirmeyahu Olmert, a former secretary to Arens.  "The army always wants to work tactically and doesn't want to  look at the long term."    The shooting in this battle has been largely behind closed  doors. Spokesmen for the army and Defense Ministry refused to  allow interviews on the subject. Few Israeli officials would  talk, particularly among those with firsthand knowledge. Most,  like the chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defense  committee, Ori Orr, would not.    One of the reasons is that the stakes are high. The end of  the Arrow would be a severe blow to a financially ailing Israel  Aircraft Industries, the prime Israeli contractor. The Arrow is  the biggest project involving U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation.  An expansion of the Arrow program would certainly mean less  money for other military development projects.    The Arrow aims to protect Israel from short-range and  medium-range ballistic missiles, regardless of whether their  warheads are conventional, biological, chemical or nuclear. A  long-range early warning radar would detect the launching of an  enemy missile hundreds of kilometers away. Another kind of  radar, called fire-control radar, would track the enemy missile  as it made its way toward Israel.    An Arrow would be fired to intercept and destroy the missile  before it reached Israel. If the Arrow failed to destroy the  enemy missile, another Arrow would be launched.    The Arrow travels at a speed of Mach-9, nine times the speed  of sound.    For defense of specific points, the U.S. is providing $13.9  million for a hypervelocity gun, in which plasma is injected  into the gun barrel behind the shell, thereby doubling the  shell's speed. The Patriot PAC-3, a planned improvement on the  missile Israel received during the Gulf war, would also  intercept short-range tactical missiles.    Like most huge projects, the Arrow missile began as a  political indulgence. It was 1985 and the Reagan administration  was looking for support for its controversial Strategic Defense  Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars. The U.S. offered to fund any  project by any country that would develop an anti-missile  defense system.    The response was lukewarm. IAI, however, came up with a plan  to develop a missile that could shoot an incoming enemy missile  out of the sky. The Arrow would be used against ballistic  missiles with ranges of 1,000 kilometers and intercept them  about 100 kilometers from target. This would make the Arrow  ideal protection against unconventional weapons, such as  chemical or nuclear warheads.    U.S. officials were quickly convinced and, by May 1986,  Israel and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding to  facilitate formal Israeli participation. Two years later, the  two countries agreed on funding and the beginning of the first  stage of the arrow experiments. The stage would include four  tests and cost $158m. The U.S. would pay 80 percent, with Israel  picking up the rest.    In May 1991, the U.S. and Israel announced the second stage  of the Arrow. It now had a new name, Arrow Continuation  Experiments (ACES), and a lot more money. The second stage would  comprise 11 launches, and Washington agreed to pay 72 percent of  the $322m, with Israel paying the rest. Israel also agreed to  absolute U.S. control and accepted the condition that it could  not sell Arrow technology or even use it for other Israeli  projects.    Meanwhile, the debate over the Arrow intensified as the IDF  poured in more money. Sources in the General Staff pointed out  that the IDF's pre-Gulf war forecast of Scud damage had been  overestimated, and grumbled that Israel didn't need a missile  defense system. Others said Arab missiles were too weak to make  a difference in war. The Air Force was upset that it did not  lead a project that it might eventually be asked to purchase and  deploy.    "In the beginning, the IAF was not in the picture," Bin-Nun  says. "The IAF didn't sign anything. They haven't allowed the  IAF to lead this. It is a mistake for the IAF to stand on the  side, to give advice but not have direct responsibility."    The biggest question was whether the Arrow was making real  progress. There was no ready answer. What qualifies as success  when the project is huge, the technology novel and the exact  price hard to pin down?    "For the IDF, it makes sense not to put all of its money  into  one thing it can't back out of," says Ze'ev Eytan, a senior  researcher and an editor of the annual military survey released  by the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies.    The early launches of the Arrow were difficult. Sources  close  to the project say the first, in August 1990, lasted only five  seconds; news reports said it lasted six seconds. The tracking  radar failed to operate and the safety officer feared that the  missile might go off course. The officer aborted the mission and  instructed the missile to self-destruct. Arrow sources say the  Pentagon determined that the flight did not constitute a test.    The project slipped further. The second Arrow test was on  March 25, 1991, four months behind schedule. Arrow sources say  that flight lasted 16 seconds. The central computer of the  missile overheated from external heat and malfunctioned.    The Israelis tried to present the launches in the best  light.  They said the first flight was designed to test only the Arrow's  launching mechanism, engine and computer. As for the second  test, IAI officials reported that six of the 11 objectives of  the flight were achieved.    The Americans were more blunt. "We didn't get a lot of the  test objectives done," Col. Harold Richardson of the U.S.  Strategic Defense Initiative Office told the U.S. magazine  Defense News.    The third test was also delayed as engineers tried to figure  out what was wrong. That launch, on October 30, 1991, also  failed, U.S. and Israeli sources say the test started well, but  the interceptor developed a malfunction and deviated from its  planned course.    The Israelis and Americans decided it was time to regroup,  U.S. officials in charge of the project determined that the  Arrow had to take a step back. The American style has always  been cautious, step-by-step, with advancement only predicated on  the success of the previous test. However, in the early stage of  the program, the Israelis would embark on several tasks and see  which one was progressing.    The Israelis involved in the Arrow acknowledged that the  joint project entailed heightened media exposure, adaptation to  U.S. R&amp;D standards, as well as a constant reassessment of the  project. In all, it led to an atmosphere of what some of them  termed "do or die" before each launch. "I agree that if this was  an Israeli project we could have taken more chances and be less  exposed to the public eye," a defense source says.    Some of the Americans involved in the Arrow, like most of  the  Israelis, saw the silver lining in its failures. They argued  that the project was still flexible and changes could easily be  made. "If I had three straight successes, I would be dead  scared," a U.S. Arrow source says. "My fear would be when my  failure was going to come."    The Americans decided that the Arrow missile first needed to  be test-fired without a flaw. As a result, the fourth test was  downgraded. The mission was just to ensure an Arrow flight and  to maintain contact between the missile and ground control. The  Arrow would not be tested for its ability to intercept an enemy  missile.    The Israelis involved in the Arrow reviewed many of its  components. Sources close to the project say IAI engineers made  up to 70 changes in the Arrow between the third and fourth  launches.    The approach worked. On September 23, 1992, the Arrow was  fired from a boat and was airborne for 42 seconds. Ground  control maintained contact with the Arrow and the missile  performed well. The planners were pleased.    Arrow engineers said this was a turning point for the  project. On February 28, the missile underwent its fifth flight.  This time, the mission focused on the missile's sensor. An Arrow  simulating an attacking missile was fired. This was followed by  a second Arrow, containing an electro-optic sensor. The Arrow's  sensors found the incoming missile and followed it. The Arrow  interceptor passed within several meters of the incoming enemy  missile. The Arrow was not equipped with a live warhead and did  not destroy the incoming missile.    But for the Arrow's planners, this was a bull's eye. They  said the Arrow had proven that it could -- under optimal  conditions -- locate and intercept an enemy missile. They said  had the Arrow been equipped with a warhead, it could have  destroyed the missile.    The sixth and most recent test was in July. The launch was  aborted when the target missile veered off course. The Pentagon  and Defense Ministry took more than 30 hours to pass verdict on  the test. The U.S. ruled the launch did not constitute a test.    Israeli and American planners agree that plenty of work  remains to be done. As Michael Holtcamp, the manager of the  project, based in Huntsville, Alabama, put it, one slip of the  Arrow's sensor or radar and the mission is unsuccessful.    The Arrow will have three chances to prove this. "The next  three tests are called lethality tests," Holtcamp says. "That is  to ensure that the target is killed. We hope to have proven the  principle in the next three shots."    Americans working on the Arrow insist that the mission is  difficult but possible. They point to the precision-guided  missiles, particularly the Tomahawks, used by the U.S. during  the Gulf war. Those missiles were programmed to hit specific  targets, albeit stationary, and were largely successful.    "There are imaging systems out there," says a U.S. source  close to the Arrow project. "The technology is there. The  problem is that the application has never been done exactly the  way it's being planned for the Arrow."    Gerald Steinberg, an expert on missiles at Bar-Ilan  University, agrees that the problem is daunting. "It has never  been done before."    At the same time, project managers are planning significant  changes to the Arrow. A new missile, called Arrow II, will be  smaller and lighter; Arrow II will be considered for production,  while the first Arrow, which is experimental, will not. The new  version will have two stages as does the current Arrow but it  will have a longer range. The sensors on the missile will also  be improved. The new missile is scheduled to undergo seven  tests, starting in the next few months and continuing until 1996.    So far, opponents of the Arrow are not impressed by its  technological achievements. They say the Arrow is far from even  proving that it can destroy an enemy missile under optimal  conditions, let alone under battle conditions. They also doubt  that the Arrow can effectively protect against nuclear warheads.  By firing plenty of Scud missiles, an enemy can quickly ensure  that Israel will use up its supply of valuable Arrows.    "IAI engineers are trying to enter completely new fields  where unknowns dominate," says Reuven Pedatzur, a defense  researcher who last month released a report on the Arrow for the  Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies. "In much of the Arrow  technology, these engineers have no prior professional  experience. Major breakthroughs will be needed to complete the  project."    Pedatzur says the snags in technological advancement will  mean more delays in the project and increased costs. The costs  will include the huge investment in the Arrow's components, such  as the fire-control radar and early warning systems, which he  says are not being financed by the U.S. Already, the government  has budgeted about $120m for the radar system and at least $100m  more might be needed. Israel wants Washington to finance the  development of the radar but has not received a commitment.    So far, the Defense Ministry has acquired two estimates of  the Arrow's costs -- that of IAI and the Israeli WALES  consulting firm. In 1989, IAI estimated the cost of developing  Arrow missiles and launchers at $1.3 billion. This includes the  development and purchase of early warning radar, fire-control  radar and a command-and-control system. A U.S.-developed model  radar, which operates at a different frequency and is being  promoted by the Pentagon, would cost about 10 times that much.    Defense sources warn against committing anybody to this  estimate. "I don't think that today IAI can give the right  numbers," says a defense source. "But it is a lot less than what  Pedatzur is saying."    Pedatzur says the early-warning radar will cost $100m per  unit and the cost of developing two systems will cost between  $400m and $500m. Development of the fire-control radar, which  tracks the incoming enemy missile, is estimated at $200m with  the price of each unit at between $30m and $50m. The command and  control system is estimated by Tadiran, which wants the  contract, at between $40m and $50m.    Pedatzur says the cost of the entire Arrow system to the IDF  could top $6.75b. This would include research, development and  procurement of 100 launchers and 400 missiles. It would not  include the costs of a nationwide communications system,  manpower and training.    "This is still not the whole story," Pedatzur says in his  report. "Other components still in the concept stage will have  to be developed in the wake of the lessons of the Gulf war. It  is difficult to gauge these costs, but they will probably run  into billions of dollars."    Brig.-Gen. (res.) Aharon Levran, who has researched the  Arrow  for Bar-Ilan University's Center for Strategic Studies, calls  Pedatzur's estimate baseless and misleading. He dismisses the  argument by the Arrow's IDF critics who assert that the project  is not cost-effective; one of their arguments is that it makes  no sense that a $1m Arrow be used to destroy a $200,000 Scud  missile.    "You can't talk in sterile terms about cost-effectiveness,"  Levran says. "You have to look at the matter as to what damage  they [incoming missiles] will do and what they do to the  strategic balance. If this is the central strategic challenge,  you have to find an answer to this and not hide behind clever  answers."    Still, Pedatzur has plenty of supporters. He has been  invited  to discuss his report with the IDF General Staff. In Washington,  the General Accounting Office [GAO], the congressional watchdog  of government spending, says in a report released last August  that Israel might be underestimating the costs of producing and  deploying the Arrow system.    The report says Washington is already providing funding not  only for the development of the Arrow but for other programs  related to the completion of the project. The reference is to  $54.4 million budgeted for the entire Arrow system, including  its radar system.    "The U.S. may be drawn into funding most of the elements  needed to deploy and support a complete Israeli Arrow missile  defense system in response to piecemeal Israeli requests," the  GAO report says.    The study raises another question: Will the U.S. allow the  Arrow to be completed? The GAO cast doubts on whether the Arrow  is even suitable for Israel's needs, as opposed to another  missile defense system being developed in the U.S. Precisely  that argument was expressed when Israel was developing the  U.S.-financed Lavi fighter-jet a decade ago. At the time, U.S.  defense contractors demanded that their government stop spending  taxpayers' money to build a foreign airplane that would  eventually compete with American products.    The IDF, particularly the Air Force, pushed for the end of  the Lavi, saying it was unworkable and unaffordable. In 1987,  Israel decided to cancel the billion-dollar Lavi project. Today,  Lavi supporters assert that Israel cannot afford to buy the  top-quality U.S. airplanes that will do the job originally  envisioned for the Lavi.    U.S. involvement in the Arrow is on a much smaller scale  than  it was on the Lavi. The problem is, what if the Arrow works? Who  will own and sell it? Under the agreement, the U.S. will own  all of the Arrow technology developed. But disputes have erupted  over Israel's claims that it contributed most of the technology.    Pentagon officials say the feud is not unusual. The U.S. and  Japan have argued for years over technology ownership in their  joint projects. "This is the great lurking problem in all  technology transfers," says Steven Bryen, a former Pentagon  official responsible for U.S. technology transfers.    Opponents and proponents of the Arrow are looking to  Washington. They have quietly lobbied Congress and the Pentagon  for support. Pedatzur has tried to relay his fears on the Arrow  to U.S. officials. At one point, he says he tried and failed to  interview Bin-Nun on the Arrow and present this in a hearing in  Congress.    "What's my goal?" asks Pedatzur, who now works for the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I want a public debate."    On the other side is Marvin Klemow. A tough-talking former  Associated Press reporter now representing IAI in Washington,  Klemow protects the Arrow as if it were his own child. He and  other Israelis connected with the arrow have done their best to  stop Pedatzur--a former military correspondent who still writes  for Ha'aretz--and others from speaking to Pentagon  officials and congressional aides.    "He was telling people that he was doing an objective study  for the Jaffee Institute," Klemow says. "We said he was a  reporter. He never told them that he was also a reporter. So,  they denied [Pedatzur the chance to meet them]. One  congressional aide he did see said that every question he did  ask was meant to elicit negative responses."    Throughout, Rabin has maintained a stony silence. Publicly,  the prime minister and defense minister has never commented on  the Arrow, leading some military sources to assert that the  prime minister's heart is not in the project.    "I doubt if Rabin has had five minutes to even seriously  consider the Arrow and its future," a source close to Rabin says.    But quietly, the Rabin government has expanded the  commitment  to the Arrow. Lt.-Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, the head of the  Ballistic Missile Development Organization, the U.S. agency  involved in the Arrow, told Congress last May that Israel is  committed to completing the development of the Arrow, regardless  of U.S. aid. Sources close to Rabin say he changed from being an  opponent to a lukewarm supporter of the project during the Gulf  war. He became a strong advocate of a missile defense system  after the May 29 Nodung launch by North Korea.    "His position is very supportive [of the Arrow]," says Oded  Ben-Ami, Rabin's spokesman at the Defense Ministry. "Israel has  every interest in developing the Arrow and bringing it to  completion."    Later, Rabin gave approval to fund the production of several  Arrow missiles and a launcher even before the end of the  U.S.-Israel research-and-development project to find out if the  system works. Defense sources say money has been budgeted for  the current fiscal year to prepare for the eventual deployment  of the Arrow as part of a five-year Israeli plan that ends in  1997. Defense sources estimate that the deployment is dependent  on the development of the Arrow radar and it will not be  achieved before 1995.    Moreover, the IDF is now said to be fully cooperating with  the project. The IAF has recently completed a feasibility study  and operational assessment of the Arrow. In August, military  representatives participated in a series of tests to determine  how the Arrow could defend against an enemy warhead containing  multiple chemical bombs, each the size of a soft-drink can.    "Rabin supports it 100 percent and wants them to prove that  the Arrow can, or cannot, shoot down an incoming missile," a  senior defense source says.    However, there are doubts regarding the number of missiles  to  be produced. That will depend on U.S. aid. "If the Americans  leave the project, there will be a serious debate," says Gur,  Rabin's deputy.    So far, the Americans have been cautious not to be drawn  into  the debate. "U.S. decision-makers should understand that the  signals they send today will have major ramifications for the  Israeli approach to the Arrow program," says Marvin Feuerwerger  in a 1991 study for the Washington Institute for Near East  Policy.    Still, the debate is already being felt in Washington and  the  result is that many in Congress and the Pentagon are beginning  to wonder whether Israel wants the Arrow. Senator Daniel Inouye  (Democrat-Hawaii) was confused as he made the rounds in Israel  in July to warn officials that the project was in danger.    As a Capitol Hill source put it: "From a purely political  standpoint, for the U.S. to withdraw support for the Arrow now  will send a very terrible signal now with regard to support for  Israel's security and the peace process."    Israeli sources said Inouye told Rabin that cancellation of  Arrow would send the wrong signal to the Arabs. He said he  didn't understand why so many military men were against the  Arrow when the lion's share of the costs were paid by Washington.    "If you don't know what you want, then I don't know how to  help you," an Israeli source quoted Inouye as saying.    Arens put it another way: "It's really a very daring  assumption that the U.S. would continue to fund the missile if  we are not definite about it."    Bryen, the former Pentagon official, agrees. "The more the  Israelis debate it, the more the U.S. will say, `Well, it's too  controversial.' It's a self-fulfilling prophecy."</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Deutsche Aerospace blames defence review for job cuts DEUTSCHE Aerospace (Dasa), Germany's principal civil and defence aviation contractor, yesterday blamed uncertainty over defence spending and the downturn in the civil aviation market for its decision to cut 7,500 jobs by the end of 1994. 'The main reason is that the role of the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, is completely unclear,' a spokesman said yesterday. 'We don't know what role it will have in the future. In the meantime, we do not expect there to be any significant large defence contracts in the next two years, which could help us through this period.' The company, which is part of Daimler-Benz, was at pains not to blame the German defence ministry for its extended reassessment of the role and requirements of the armed forces, while saying pointedly that 'it all depends on our democratic process'. However, it is clear that the cuts, amounting to more than 10 per cent of the company's 70,000 workforce, may not be the final decision, because they do not make any allowance for a possible German pull-out from the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) programme, or any replacement. 'The EFA is still included in our calculations,' the spokesman said. 'These redundancies or job cuts are not a consequence of that uncertainty. If Germany finally were to pull out of any programme, they would be much worse.' A breakdown of the job cuts shows that 3,300 will come from the civil and military aircraft division of Dasa - two thirds from military aircraft, one third from the civilian side. Of those, 800 must be borne by Deutsche Airbus, where the works council yesterday expressed its surprise and hostility towards the company decision. Another 2,750 job losses will fall on the defence systems division, including weapons manufacture, missiles, radar and communications. Some 1,000 losses must come from the propulsion division making engines, and 500 from the space systems division. The company's space division could suffer further from a review next month by the European Space Agency at a meeting in Granada, Spain. The gathering is expected to agree a Franco-German proposal to reduce the Hermes space shuttle programme to no more than a 'technology programme', and to axe the 'free flyer' which was to service the Columbus space station. While Dasa said that the job cuts would be carried out wherever possible without harsh social consequences, there might have to be some dismissals, in addition to early retirement and non-replacement of departing workers. Although the company was at pains to stress its confidence in defence contracting as a pillar of its future activities, the decision to cut so many jobs because of the uncertainty will call into question again the wisdom of Daimler-Benz creating such a giant subsidiary as Dasa, so heavily reliant on government contracts.</p>

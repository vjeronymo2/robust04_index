			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kang Tae-ho] </F>   [Text] North Korean-Japanese negotiations on establishing  diplomatic relations that have been suspended since the eighth  round of their negotiations in November 1992, are likely to  resume, and this is attracting public attention.    It was reported that "Japanese Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa  asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher during talks on  23 June, to urge North Korea to resume negotiations with Japan  for establishing North Korean-Japanese diplomatic ties, and  ordered the Foreign Ministry's working-level offices to begin  preparations for negotiations with North Korea." This report  seems to indicate that North Korea has not responded in any  particular way to Japan's proposal for negotiations on  establishing diplomatic ties, and that Japan is now asking the  United States to take the role of a mediator. However, it is a  more convincing analysis that North Korea and Japan are holding  behind-the-scene contacts for resuming negotiations on  establishing diplomatic ties under the situation in which  South-North summit talks are being held while the third round of  North Korean-U.S. talks are being promoted, and that the United  States and Japan have discussed this issue. In particular, we  need to take note of the fact that working-level offices of the  Japanese Foreign Ministry's have set out preparatory work for  negotiations with North Korea.    In early January, when North Korea and the United States  announced their agreement on the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks and the nuclear inspection issue after a  series of working-level contacts in New York, Japan announced  that it had sounded out North Korea's intention to resume  negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties between the two.  Last year, the Japanese Government had decided to exclude the  nuclear issue from the list of preconditions for resuming North  Korean-Japanese talks. It seems that Japan sounded out the  possibility of resuming negotiations for diplomatic ties with  North Korea by sending the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] delegation, including Hajime Fukada of the House of  Councillors, to Pyongyang late last year, right before making  the above decision. Then, on 9 January, then-Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata officially expressed Japan's will to resume  negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties with North Korea.    North Korea, however, reacted coldly to Japan's initiative.  Noting Japan's ambition to become a "military power" and a  "nuclear power," North Korea denounced Japan's "maneuver to  isolate and ruin the Republic [konghwaguk korip malsal  chaektong]" under the pretext of the nuclear issue. It  continuously denounced remarks made by Hata, the Japanese  Foreign Minister at the time, which pointed out the North Korean  nuclear issue as a cause for misgivings in the entire Asian  region, thus pouring cold water upon Japan's active attitude.  Eventually, the Japanese proposal for resuming negotiations on  diplomatic ties with North Korea could not be realized as the  nuclear issue underwent vicissitudes at the brink of a worsened  phase of sanctions.    At that time, insisting that North Korea ruptured the eighth  round of negotiations, Japan voiced its policy that it would not  hold negotiations on diplomatic ties unless North Korea first  proposed a meeting. It is well worth recalling Japan's  explanation about the background to the change in original  policy that resulted in the proposal for negotiations to North  Korea. A Japanese Foreign Ministry official explained that the  Japanese proposal is "aimed at giving indirect aid to U.S.-North  Korean negotiations over the nuclear issue." The following,  however, cannot be disregarded: With the possibility of rapid  improvement in South-North and North Korean-U.S. relations  bringing Japan's isolation to the fore, Japan wants to secure  the right to speak about issues on the Korean peninsula and  nuclear issue.    From this viewpoint, a series of recent visits to North  Korea by delegations of the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic  Party of Japan [LDPJ] lend support to the resumption of dialogue  between North Korea and Japan. Their visits have been made on  the basis of the background and logic similar to that seen in  last January. In particular, the SDPJ delegation's visit to  North Korea is noteworthy. The SDPJ played the role of a  coordinator behind the scene in adopting a joint declaration by  three Japanese political parties in September 1990 in which they  agreed to the principle of an early establishment of diplomatic  relations with North Korea. Furthermore, there have been  negotiations regarding the SDPJ's participation in a new  coalition cabinet since the Hata minority coalition cabinet  resigned. This shows the high possibility that the SDPJ's ideas  will be reflected in Japan's policy on North Korea.    According to the NAEWOE NEWS AGENCY, the SDPJ delegation  headed by Director of the General Affairs Bureau Kazo Watanabe  held talks with the Workers Party of Korea on 12 June and  discussed the North Korean nuclear issue, Japan's policy toward  North Korea, and ways to develop relations between the two  countries. It is learned that in the talks, North Korea  insisted that the Japanese authorities abandon its hostile  policy against North Korea and cooperate in resolving pending  issues in conformity with the spirit of the joint declaration  issued in September 1990 by the three Japanese political  parties. In particular, the SDPJ delegation met Kim Yong-sun,  party secretary of North Korea who is known to be the person  actually in charge of negotiations on diplomatic relations with  Japan. An LDPJ delegation headed by Vice Secretary-General Taku  Masaki visited North Korea on 14 June, although what was  discussed in their talks has not been learned. Musuko Miki,  wife of former Japanese Prime Minister Miki, also visited North  Korea on the same day and held talks with President Kim Il-song.    Whether Japan officially proposed the resumption of  negotiations on establishing diplomatic ties and how North Korea  reacted to Japan's proposal, if it was made, will soon be  learned. It is clear, however, that North Korea and Japan are  headed for the thawing age.    It is proved by the confirmed fact, even if it was a minor  move, that North Korea began to resume issuing visas to Japanese  tourists on 21 June. North Korea suspended issuing visas to  Japanese tourists in June 1993. The Chungoe Travel Agency, the  general agent of the state-run Korea International Tourist  Company of North Korea in Japan, said that it began to gather  tourists in mid-May upon the notification on resuming visa  issuance by North Korea. Prior to this, in early June, it was  reported that Japan expressed its willingness to give economic  aid to North Korea through international organizations even  before the establishment of diplomatic relations under the  precondition of a solution of the nuclear problem in a  diplomatic way. Japan mentioned assistance in development of a  light-water reactor, participation in the Tumen River  development project, and emergency food aid as concrete methods  of its economic aid to North Korea. Since it is hard for the  Japanese Government to give direct aid to North Korea before  establishing diplomatic ties with it, the Japanese Government is  reportedly considering methods to support it by forming a  consultation body for supporting North Korea with international  organizations, such as the UN Development Plan and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], or related countries  or organizations, such as Japan, the United States, the ROK, and  the World Bank.    Experts say that while promoting sanctions on North Korea,  the United States has certainly understood that sanctions cannot  be imposed without active participation by China and Japan.  This means that Japan plays a great role as North Korea's  economic cooperation partner. They note Japan is now required  to participate in efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through  negotiations. They view that the discussions between Japanese  Prime Minister Koji Kakizawa and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher on resuming North Korean-Japanese dialogue under  this situation were very significant.</p>

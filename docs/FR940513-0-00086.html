The former regulation contains the interest assumptions that the PBGC uses to value benefits under terminating single-employer plans. The latter regulation contains the interest assumptions for valuations of multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal. The amendments set out in this final rule adopt the interest assumptions applicable to single-employer plans with termination dates in June 1994, and to multiemployer plans with valuation dates in June 1994. The effect of these amendments is to advise the public of the adoption of these assumptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> June 1, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Harold J. Ashner, Assistant General Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD).

Under ERISA section 4041(c), all single-employer plans wishing to terminate in a distress termination must value guaranteed benefits and ``benefit liabilities,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , all benefits provided under the plan as of the plan termination date, using the formulas set forth in part 2619, subpart C. (Plans terminating in a standard termination may, for purposes of the Standard Termination Notice filed with PBGC, use these formulas to value benefit liabilities, although this is not required.) In addition, when the PBGC terminates an underfunded plan involuntarily pursuant to ERISA section 4042(a), it uses the subpart C formulas to determine the amount of the plan's underfunding. Part 2676 prescribes rules for valuing benefits and certain assets of multiemployer plans under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281(b) of ERISA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix B to part 2619 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the single-employer regulation. Appendix B to part 2676 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the multiemployer regulation. Because these rates and factors are intended to reflect current conditions in the financial and annuity markets, it is necessary to update the rates and factors periodically. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBGC issues two sets of interest rates and factors, one set to be used for the valuation of benefits to be paid as annuities and one set for the valuation of benefits to be paid as lump sums. The same assumptions apply to terminating single-employer plans and to multiemployer plans that have undergone a mass withdrawal. This amendment adds to appendix B to parts 2619 and 2676 sets of interest rates and factors for valuing benefits in a single-employer plans that have termination dates during June 1994 and multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation dates during June 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For annuity benefits, the interest rates will be 6.70% for the first 25 years following the valuation date and 5.25% thereafter. For benefits to be paid as lump sums, the interest assumptions to be used by the PBGC will be 5.25% for the period during which benefits are in pay status, 4.5% during the seven years directly preceding the benefit's placement in pay status, and 4.0% during any other years preceding the benefit's placement in pay status. (ERISA section 205(g) and Internal Revenue Code section 417(e) provide that private sector plans valuing lump sums not in excess of $25,000 must use interest assumptions at least as generous as those used by the PBGC for valuing lump sums (and for lump sums exceeding $25,000 must use interest assumptions at least as generous as 120% of the PBGC interest assumptions).) The above annuity interest assumptions represent an increase (from those in effect for May 1994) of .20 percent for the first 25 years following the valuation date and are otherwise unchanged. The lump sum interest assumptions are unchanged from those in effect for May 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the interest rates and factors under these regulations are in effect for at least one month. However, the PBGC publishes its interest assumptions each month regardless of whether they represent a change from the previous month's assumptions. The assumptions normally will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by the 15th of the preceding month or as close to that date as circumstances permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PBGC has determined that notice and public comment on these amendments are impracticable and contrary to the public interest. This finding is based on the need to determine and issue new interest rates and factors promptly so that the rates and factors can reflect, as accurately as possible, current market conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

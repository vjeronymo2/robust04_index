			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER OUTAGE CUTS OFF 2 RADIO STATIONS  </P> <P> Two Los Angeles radio stations -- KKGO-FM (105.1) and KPFK-FM (90.7) -- went  off the air for much of Friday after an electrical transformer blew up in  remote Mt. Wilson, cutting power to the stations' mountaintop transmitters.  </P> <P> The outage occurred shortly before 5 a.m., said Melanie Savage, a Southern  California Edison spokeswoman. Both stations were reduced to static as Edison  crews worked to replace the transformer.  </P> <P> Edison was hoping to restore power by midafternoon, Savage said. The cause of  the outage was not immediately known, and fewer than a dozen homes, if any,  were affected.  </P> <P> Each hour of dead air cost KKGO thousands of dollars, because paid commercials  were not broadcast, said Saul Levine, the station's general manager. Levine  said KKGO will soon install an emergency generator to prevent future outages.  KPFK, a noncommercial broadcaster, did not suffer any losses.  </P> <P> KKGO is one of Los Angeles' few classical FM stations, having switched from 30  years of broadcasting jazz in a controversial move last January. KPFK is known  for its eclectic, if sometimes ragged, programming that ranges from New Age to  Indian music to a program called "Communist Party U.S.A."  </P></p>

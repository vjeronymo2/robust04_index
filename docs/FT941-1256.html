			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ploughing up profits in Pakistan - A look at the financial shenanigans of the 'tractor Mafia' Mr Saeed Ahmed, a tractor dealer, points to a brand new Massey Ferguson tractor parked in his showroom, just outside Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, and offers to sell it for 10 per cent less than the factory price. The only catch is that the tractor cannot be legally transferred to its new owner for another 8 years. We are at Shadab Tractors, where a consignment has just been released from the factories after payment of loan money. Many buyers, however, have no intention of taking delivery. They prefer to sell on at a discount, knowing they can repay the loans at interest rates up to 10 per cent below commercial bank rates, or even default without worrying too much about banks calling in collateral. Farmers who own at least five hectares of land are eligible for Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan loans. But banks in general have few successes in recovering bad debts, largely because of a lax legal system which sometimes allows civil cases to drag on for several years. Almost 30 per cent of the USDollars 100m Pakistani farmers spend each year on tractors comes from loans that eventually turn bad, senior ADBP officials acknowledge. 'There is almost a tractor Mafia out there,' says a senior executive at Al-Ghazi, the Pakistani affiliate of Fiat. Mr SA Khan, general manager of Fecto, which assembles Belarus tractors, imported from Russia, explains: 'Certain people buy the tractors and sell them in the open market to make money. Recovery (of loans) is a difficult exercise'. Such concerns have been getting wider attention since last summer, when the government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, began a campaign to recover loans. That campaign began because the credit system, set up initially to help poor and middle income farmers to mechanise their farms and increase productivity, was in danger of collapsing. But the five-month-old government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has shown little enthusiasm for following up Mr Qureshi's initiative. Some ADBP officials warn against aggressive measures to recover loans. 'We know that we are only able to recover up to 70 per cent loans. But then, taking tough action against farmers is also politically sensitive. There would eventually be an uproar in the parliament,' says one. Others complain that the tractor business has increasingly become a form of patronage by politicians in successive Pakistani governments, who have tried to appease constituents through supporting the sanction of such loans. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, who stepped down in July, announced a 'yellow tractor scheme', designed to charge a 10 per cent down-payment in advance, recovering the rest in easy installments from farmers. The scheme, which could have created another financial nightmare, was abandoned by the new government, when officials argued that it was only meant to attract voters during the election campaign rather than becoming the basis for improving crop output. Some other businessmen acknowledge that the procedures involving the disbursement and recovery of tractor loans ought to be tightened, but also argue that farmers must be encouraged to use their tractors more efficiently as a step towards improving agricultural output. 'People who have got tractors are not fully utilising them. They are not using the right kinds of implements,' says Mr Sikandar Khan, chairman of Millat Tractors, referring to the argument by many experts that Pakistani farmers have yet fully to appreciate the possibilities of tractors, rather than using them only for tillage and towing trolleys. 'The yield per acre in Pakistan is one of the lowest in the world. It is farm mechanisation that is going to pick us out of that.' Tractor loans could well be central to political concerns in rural constituencies, but it remains unclear whether the government can continue to subsidise sales through this discredited system.</p>

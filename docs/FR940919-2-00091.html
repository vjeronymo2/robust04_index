			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to comprehensive program information, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packets will describe the types of information that a claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will need to have readily available when the individual files a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim. It will also contain two basic forms: The first, designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for completion by the claimant, will include general identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information and will serve as the claimant's starter application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for benefits; the second, designed for completion by the treating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source(s), will request specific medical information about a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant's alleged impairments. SSA will encourage claimants who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are able to do so to review the information in the packet and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the basic forms completed prior to telephoning or visiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an SSA office to apply for disability benefits. Claimants will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraged to immediately submit starter applications to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the filing dates for benefits. The starter application will serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a claim for both programs, but it will include a disclaimer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should the claimant want to preclude filing for benefits based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SSI).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Claimants Will Choose Mode of Entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The disability claim entry process will be multi-faceted,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing claimants and third parties and representatives who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist them the maximum flexibility in deciding how they will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the process. Claimants may choose to enter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim process by telephoning the SSA toll-free number,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically, by mail, or by telephoning or visiting a local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office. Claimants may also rely on third parties to provide them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance in dealing with SSA. Finally, claimants may formally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appoint representatives to act on their behalf in dealing with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA. SSA field managers will also have the flexibility to tailor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the various service options to their local conditions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the needs of client populations, individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants, and the availability of third parties who are capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of contributing to the application process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an individual submits a starter application by mail or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically, SSA will contact the claimant to schedule an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appointment for a claim intake interview or, at the claimant's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option, conduct an immediate intake interview by telephone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an individual telephones SSA to inquire about disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits, the SSA contact will explain the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability program, including the SSA definition of disability,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and provide a general explanation of evidence requirements. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA contact will determine whether the individual has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability information packet, and mail it or advise the claimant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding possible means of electronic access. If an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicates a desire to file a claim at that time, the SSA contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will complete the starter application available on-line as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the automated claim processing system to protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant's filing date and schedule an appointment for a claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intake interview. The interview may be in person or by telephone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the claimant's option. If the individual has no medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating sources, the SSA contact will annotate this information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the on-line claim record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a claimant visits an SSA office, the SSA contact will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer the claimant for an immediate claim intake interview or, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claimant's option, complete the starter application and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule a future appointment for an intake interview.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In all cases, appointments for claim intake interviews will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made available within a reasonable time period, generally 3 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 working days, but no later than two weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local management will determine how to best accommodate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants' needs in learning about the disability process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completing a claim intake interview. Depending on an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, such accommodation may involve: Referral to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearest location for obtaining a disability information packet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which can then be mailed in; an immediate telephone or in-person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview; arranging for an on-site visit from an SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative; or referral to appropriate third parties who can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide assistance. Additionally, depending on the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual's disability, SSA may encourage the individual to file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in person when it appears that a face-to-face interview will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist in the proper claim intake and development; however, face-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to-face interviews will not be required in every claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Face-to-face interviews, when considered necessary by either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant or SSA, can also be accomplished via videoconferencing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, SSA will make every reasonable effort to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of the claimant in completing the application process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Every effort will be made to provide services to members of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public who have limited knowledge of English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, local managers will modify the claim entry and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intake process to provide maximum flexibility for representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who act on behalf of claimants or third parties who can assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants in completing the application process. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodations may include, but are not limited to: (1) Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated means to interact with SSA to protect a claimant's date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of filing (e.g., telephone, fax, or E-mail); (2) providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appointment slots for third parties to accompany claimants to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interviews or to provide assistance during telephone claims on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant's behalf; (3) out-stationing SSA personnel at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party location to obtain applications and/or medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence, when appropriate; and (4) providing ``open appointment''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduling to permit claimants to contact SSA within a flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> band of time. Interested third parties will be encouraged to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the development of claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Local managers will also conduct outreach efforts that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to meet the needs of hard-to-reach populations or assist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those individuals unable to access the SSA claim process without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable intervention. As appropriate, outreach efforts may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be facilitated through videoconferencing, teleconferencing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other electronic methods of obtaining and processing claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to provide timely service despite claimants'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic or social isolation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disability Claim Manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A disability claim manager will have responsibility for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete processing of an initial disability claim. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager will be a highly-trained individual who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is well-versed in both the medical and nonmedical aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability programs and has the necessary knowledge, skills, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abilities to conduct personal interviews, develop evidentiary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records, and adjudicate disability claims to payment. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim manager will also be able to call on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA resources, including medical and technical support personnel,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide advice and assistance in the claim process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disability claim managers will rely on an automated claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing system that will permit them to: Gather and store  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim information; develop both medical and nonmedical evidence;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share necessary facts in a claim with medical consultants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specialists in nonmedical or technical issues; analyze evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and prepare well-rationalized decisions on both medical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmedical issues; and produce clear and understandable notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that accurately convey all necessary information to claimants. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making decisions, disability claim managers will use a simplified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision methodology that effectively streamlines evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection, and will rely on standards for decisionmaking that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are used at all levels of the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disability claim manager will be the focal point for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant contacts throughout the claim intake and adjudication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. The disability claim manager will explain the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs to the claimant, including the definition of disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and how SSA determines if a claimant meets disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The disability claim manager will also convey what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claimant will be asked to do throughout the process; what the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant may expect from SSA during this process, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipated timeframes for decision; and how the claimant can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interact with the disability claim manager to obtain more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information or assistance. The disability claim manager will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advise the claimant regarding the right to representation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide the appropriate referral sources for representation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager will also advise the claimant regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community resources, including the names of organizations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could help the claimant pursue the claim. The goal will be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give the claimant access to the decisionmaker and allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ongoing, meaningful dialogue between the claimant and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE KITCHEN: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> DOG BISCUITS  </P> <P> WHAT ARE MADE of wheat flour, rye flour, cornmeal, nine grains, milk, safflower  oil, molasses, eggs, yeast and salt, come in a pretty little bag with a picture  on the front and look like adorable bones? If you don't know the answer, your  dog wants to know the reason why.  </P> <P> Buster's Biscuits are the very latest in doggy food. They are hand-made at the  brand-new The Bakery on Melrose, which also makes a large line of foods fit for  human consumption. These include rather delicious cookies, croissants, quiches,  scones and elaborate cakes and tortes. They also bake a line of sugarless  goodies. Does your dog care? Probably not.  </P> <P> What he undoubtedly will want to know, however, is that humans have been known  to fall for this particular brand of dog biscuit. Why not? Everything in them  is good, they have a slightly salty, vaguely nutty flavor with deep molasses  undertones, and they are delightfully chewy. And they are so distinctive  looking that when put out with the crackers and the cheese on a cocktail tray,  they make an unbeatable conversation piece.  </P> <P> And if the conversation goes like this -- "Eat these things? Are you crazy?"  you needn't despair. Buster's Biscuits can always go to the dogs -- who really  love them.  </P> <P>  Buster's Biscuits are $2.95 at The Bakery on Melrose, located at 7261 Melrose  Ave., Los Angeles (213) 934-4493.  </P></p>

The commander of Nigerian troops in the disputed Bakassi  peninsula, General Wotomi Diriyai, said the Cameroonian  gendarmes have killed or injured many Nigerians and seized their  fishing boats and nets, the official NAN news agency reported  Tuesday [22 February].    But defence spokesman General Fred Chijuka on Tuesday  stressed that "Nigeria is not in a state of war, neither is the  country for now thinking of a war, with Cameroon."    Diriyai told journalists in Calabar, capital of the  southeastern Cross River state, that property estimated at  hundreds of millions of naira belonging to fishermen and  traders, in an address on Monday.    Chijuka said that diplomatic discussions were under way at  highest level between the two countries over the disputed  peninsula, which is rich in fish and oil, making plans for a war  "unnecessary." He also denied that Nigeria has placed its  soldiers stationed in the area "on a state of alert for war" and  expressed the hope that the differences could still be resolved  peacefully. Nigeria has no "expansionist ambition," but if  negotiations failed, the government "may have to study other  alternatives," Chijuka said, refusing to disclose what these  were.    The Nigerian troops in the area would remain there "until  the  intentions of Cameroonians are properly put in place", Chijuka  said. He denied reports that Nigerian troops were the first to  attack Cameroonian security forces last weekend. "Nigerian  soldiers were on routine patrol before they were attacked by  Camerounian gendarmes who shot at our patrol boats", he said.  The Nigerian soldiers, who have been instructed not to attack,  merely turned back and reported the incident to their  headquarters, he said.    Cameroon last Sunday stated that Nigerian soldiers attacked  its forces, and that its troops immediately repulsed the attack.    Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Baba Gana Kingibe said  late  Monday in the federal capital Abuja that "if there were any  skirmishes, these must have been on provocation from the  Cameroonian side and our troops must have responded in  self-defence".    Diriyai's statements were the first time since 1981 that  official Nigerian comment has been made on reported human and  material losses sustained as a result of raids by Cameroonian  security forces.    Seven Nigerians died in 1981 following an attack by  Cameroonian gendarmes on Nigerians living in fishing villages in  the disputed area, an incident which angered public opinion.    For the first time since the dispute began, the military  authorities gave journalists a map they said delineated the  border between the two nations. The demarcation, drawn above  Rio-del-River in the south, ceded the disputed peninsula to the  Nigerian side.    Since late December, when the Nigerian authorities sent 500  soldiers to the disputed area, the government has kept largely  quiet about its handling of the matter.    The editor of a local newspaper who reported last Wednesday  that Nigeria sent about 1,000 additional troops to the disputed  area was called in by the army and "warned seriously" against  publishing such news in future because of its security  implications, a top military officer told AFP.</p>

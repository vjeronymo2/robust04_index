			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Olives Property hit by write-off Olives Property is to write off its investment in Continental Paper as an extraordinary loss at December 31 1992, following Continental going into receivership. Olives has a total investment of Pounds 1.35m, represented by 7.5 per cent cumulative preference shares of Pounds 1, in Continental and its UK subsidiaries. The effect of that, and eliminating capital reserves resulting from the sale of ordinary shares in Continental in March 1992 when it ceased to be an associate, is to reduce Olives' net assets from 71p at end-1991 to 50p per share.</p>

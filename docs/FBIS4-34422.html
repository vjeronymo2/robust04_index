			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 18 Jun (AFP) -- The controversy regarding  possible coup attempts in Venezuela heightened this weekend with  new charges that implicate Defense Minister Rafael Montero  Revette, despite denials by President Rafael Caldera.    Retired Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the thwarted  February 1992 military coup, charged in a communique to the  media that Minister Montero Revette conspired last year against  the then Defense Minister Radames Munoz in an alleged coup that  did not materialize.    "Current Defense Minister Gen. Montero Revette was involved  up to his neck in the military coup that Vice Admiral Radames  Munoz was going to carry out last December," Chavez states in  his communique. The retired military officer also maintains that  "there is plenty of evidence. The (provisional) government of  Dr. (Ramon) Velasquez (1993) had the evidence, and his interior  minister was fully aware of that conspiracy."    According to Chavez, the former minister was "protected" on  that occasion by the ruling political parties, because "a coup  of that sort would maintain the status quo, corruption, and the  privileges of ruling political and economic groups and would  quell the struggle of the people to improve their welfare."    Chavez was imprisoned after the coup attempt until his  release two months ago, when he benefited from a presidential  amnesty granted by President Caldera, within the framework of  the Armed Forces' peace process. This amnesty led to the release  of virtually all those implicated in the February and November  1992 coup attempts.    A few days before taking office last February, Caldera asked  Vice Admiral Munoz and the ranking military command accompanying  him to resign. He appointed Montero Revette, who until that  time was Army commander, the new defense minister. Although,  with the change in the military high command and release of the  coupist officers, Caldera managed to maintain a period of calm  in the military sector for several months, charges of new  conspiracies surfaced this week.    Alberto Muller, retired general and current senator, charged  that Munoz is preparing a new coup, while Montero Revette said  that "rightist and leftist" groups are conspiring. Montero  Revette mentioned Chavez and the "Red Flag" organization, among  other leftist groups.    This wave of rumors was denied this week by Caldera, who  said  that "the most prosperous industry in Venezuela is spreading  rumors." Caldera said: "I am convinced that the democratic  system in my country is a firm and stable reality." Venezuela,  which has been a representative democracy for 36 years,  experienced two thwarted coups in 1992, and since then coup  rumors have surfaced periodically in the country.</p>

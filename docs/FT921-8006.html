			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (8): Such tempting destinations - Weekend Breaks: exotic Asian locations such as Bali and Kota Kinabalu are just a few hours' flying time from Hong Kong, says Angus Foster. equal to the time needed for a Friday night drive from London out into the country  - you can be anywhere from Bangkok to Manila, Ho Chi Minh City or Shanghai. Hong Kong's position at the fulcrum of Asia means getting away for a couple of days is deliciously tempting. Whether your goal is lying on a beach on a remote tropical island, trekking among hill tribes or jostling through a Chinese city, Hong Kong offers the launch pad, base station and, on your return, recovery centre. Hong Kong's myriad of travel agents arrange flights and package tours to most of the following locations. Ask your hotel or a local friend for advice on which agents to try. Cathay Pacific and Dragonair, Hong Kong's two airlines, also offer package deals which, although sometimes cheaper, usually limit your options on when and where to travel. Getting flights at short notice can sometimes be a problem, especially around Christmas, Chinese New Year and bank holidays. Asia's best hotels also fill up quickly, so unless you have booked early, expect to lower your sights. BALI: Some old Asia hands turn up their noses at this Indonesian island, believing its charms have been soured by coachloads of backpacking World Travellers and plane-loads of tourists. But Bali is still one of the most beautiful places on earth. Away from the tourist stronghold of Kuta the island's charms are untarnished. The town of Ubud, with a long artistic tradition, is a good place from which the explore Bali's scattered villages and winding tracks in a rented jeep. For those with more time and an urge to get away from the crowd, Bali can act as the stepping stone to the islands of Lombok and Flores to the east. Lombok is a 30-minute flight away and offers a more relaxed pace of life as well as some excellent beaches. Flores, another domestic flight away, is sometimes compared to Bali 20 years ago. Cathay Pacific offers a three night package in Bali, including flights and hotels, departing Hong Kong each Saturday for about USDollars 770 per person. Flights alone, which are cheaper on the Indonesian carrier Garuda, cost between Dollars 350 to Dollars 450, economy class. THAILAND: The favourite destination for Hong Kongers, attracted by the country's climate and low costs, who pack Kai Tak airport for the morning flights to Bangkok. Thailand's success as a tourist destination in the 1980s has left some parts, notably around Pattaya, ruined by over-zealous development and poor planning, so check carefully. Most short-term visitors either head for Bangkok, to explore the city's tourist sites and night life, or the beaches in the south. Phuket is a favourite beach destination, while those looking for a slightly more peaceful location could try the nearby Pipi islands or Krabi. Hua Hin, a three and a half hour drive from Bangkok, has become very popular and boasts the colonial splendour of the Station Hotel. Another option is to go trekking in the north from Chiang Mai or, preferably, Chiang Rai. Two or three day treks can be organised locally or in Hong Kong and combine leisurely walks with mountain tribes, elephants and river rafting. Flights between Hong Kong and Thailand are plentiful and cost about Dollars 250. A three night Cathay Pacific package in Phuket costs around Dollars 700. KOTA KINABALU: Located in Sabah, eastern Malaysia, Kota Kinabalu is a three-hour flight from Hong Kong. Designed for those who only want to relax away from it all, you could lie on the beach or by the pool, play some golf or visit the surrounding islands. With a bit more time, you could explore the local countryside or climb Mount Kinabalu for a 4,000 metre high perch from which to watch the sunrise over the jungle. Both Cathay Pacific and Malysian Airlines offer three night packages to Kota Kinabalu for about Dollars 640. BORACAY: Reknowned as one of the most idyllic of the many paradise islands in the Philippines, Boracay is about two hours from Manila by domestic flight, then boat. The island has no electricity; visitors stay in huts but it is a favourite spot for expatriates and Hong Kong Chinese wanting a relaxing few days of sun, sea and sand. The scuba diving and snorkelling is good, but wear plenty of sun protection. Between June and October typhoons regularly hit the Philippines and either wreck the weather or your travel plans. The one-hour flight to Manila costs about Dollars 250 while Philippine Air offers a two night package in Boracay, including domestic flights and accommodation, for a further Dollars 103. A three night package to Boracay with Cathay Pacific costs about Dollars 560. CHINA: China offers many alternatives for short visits and in the last ten years travel options, standards of service and spoken English have all improved dramatically. However, China remains a difficult and often frustrating country in which to travel. You may find that a trip to China will leave you needing a real holiday. Because of China's huge size and travel times between cities, it is unrealistic to try and combine any of the following options within a short visit. For a taste of China, the southern city of Guangzhou, or Canton, is only a two hour train journey from Hong Kong. Often overlooked by tourists because of its dowdy appearance and aggressive Cantonese lifestyle, Guangzhou in fact has much to offer for a weekend break. Colonial architecture on Shamian island, a stomach-turning animal market and some worthwhile parks and temples keep a visitor busy during the day, while, in the evening, Guangzhou's nightlife of restaurants, bars and cinemas is the most lively in southern China. A walk along the Pearl River is interesting at any time, and throws up surprises like bird markets and outdoor dentists. See the article on gateway to China. Guilin, a one and a quarter hour flight from Hong Kong, is one of China's most famous tourist spots and is especially popular with honeymooning locals. They come to gaze at the distinctive limestone peaks, which rise sharply out of paddy fields. In fact, although the tourist hotels are all in the city, Guilin is an ugly town and the downriver village of Yangshuo has a more enchanting atmosphere for those not demanding a smart room. Dragonair offers a two night package to Guilin at prices starting at Dollars 282 with daily departures. CAAC, China's national airline and to be avoided unless desperate, runs a similar package, which it describes as first class, for Dollars 495. Shanghai, China's largest city, has retained a flavour of its former opulence despite 40 years of Communist rule. Short-term visitors can savour past glories by strolling along the Bund among colonial architecture, then dinner and the jazz band at the Peace Hotel. Shanghai also acts as a staging post for visits to Suzhou, about two hours away by train, a relaxed town famous for its gardens, and Hangzhou, eulogised by poets for the West Lake. A three-night Dragonair package to Shanghai costs upwards from Dollars 407 with four departures a week. The airline also offers longer breaks including stops in Hangzhou, which is about five hours by train from Shanghai. Many first-time visitors to China instinctively head for the capital, Beijing. The city abounds in tourist sites, but its proximity to communism's nerve centre, and memories of the 1989 killings, lend an uneasy atmosphere. It is also where China's internal political and economic contradictions come most sharply into focus. Beijing is a fascinating city, but may leave you with a less-than-favourable view of the Chinese. There is so much to see in Beijing  - Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Great Wall to the north, the Temple of Heaven, countless parks and museums  - that some visitors find they overstretch themselves on a short visit. Try to reserve an afternoon for walking or cycling through the back streets, away from the icons of centralised power but closer to real life. A three night package from Dragonair costs from Dollars 566, or Dollars 665 first class, with four departures a week. The same package on CAAC, again first class, costs Dollars 935 with daily departures.</p>

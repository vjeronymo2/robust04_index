			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Shareholders lose in Portugal ruling A Portuguese court has made a landmark ruling against a group of shareholders seeking Es20bn (Pounds 76m) in government compensation for the nationalisation of their holdings following the country's 1974 revolution. The precedent set by the court in the first compensation case to reach a conclusion represents a victory for the centre-right government, which is facing at least three other important claims in the courts. After a bitter legal battle that began in 1987, a Lisbon civil court ruled against the claim by five former shareholders in 10 companies, including eight banks, that were nationalised by a communist-led government in 1975. The group sought Es20bn in compensation based on the market value of their shares at the time of the nationalisation and additional compensation to make up for monetary depreciation. But the court ruled in favour of a government proposal to pay them only Es1bn.</p>

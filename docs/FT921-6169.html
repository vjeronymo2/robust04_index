			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A right Royal disaster FT-SE Index: 2,562.0 (-3.0) The main question for investors after yesterday's bloodbath from Royal is how to value UK insurance companies. Royal's drastic decision to pass the final dividend finally removes what was already a faltering yield prop for its shares. The focus will no doubt switch to net asset values, but judging by yesterday's panicky market reaction, this is hardly a reliable guide either. One need only recall what has happened over the last year in the housebuilding and construction sector - initially drawing comfort from asset values subsequently undermined by land bank write downs - to understand why. The ignominy of Royal's situation is rubbed in by the fact that at last night's closing price the market considers its once proud non-life business to be virtually worthless. The company's capitalisation of Pounds 920m is equivalent to what Royal Life might fetch in a float. To be fair, new management appears to be doing what it can - even purchasing a put option to protect its frail balance sheet from a collapse in UK equities. But the grim fact is that there is no way it can shore up all the risks. Nervousness about Royal's toxic waste exposure in the US may be overdone; the mortgage guarantee liabilities in the UK, however, remain frighteningly difficult to predict. It is sobering that Guardian Royal Exchange - with a mere 2-3 per cent of the market against Royal's 20 per cent share - has already lost more from mortgage guarantees than it did from the October 1987 storms. Takeover speculation for both companies will doubtless intensify - but investors would be foolish to bank on it. It will be a brave purchaser to take out Royal even at the current depressed price, and there is no evidence anyway of hostile predators in the wings. The sector's recovery will be slow and painful; Royal's figures yesterday demonstrate that the ills can be blamed as much on underpricing and overdistribution at a time of surging claims inflation, as on the short term consequences of recession.</p>

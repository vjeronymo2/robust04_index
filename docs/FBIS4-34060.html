			<p>BFN     [Text] Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, 9 Jun (AE) -- Navy Ministry  civilian employees who work at the Aramar Experimental Center  [Centro Experimental Aramar] in Ipero, 130 km from Sao Paulo,  are being evicted from the houses that were built by the Navy in  the 1980's for nuclear scientists and engineers who worked at  the center. Aramar is where the Navy developed the uranium  enrichment technology used in the construction of the first  Brazilian nuclear submarine. Some of the civilian employees  threatened with eviction are among Brazil's top nuclear experts.    The eviction order was given by Admiral Domingos Alfredo da  Silva, director general of the Navy material department. He is  one rank above Admiral Othon Luis Pinheiro da Silva, president  of the Coordinating Center for Special Projects (Copesp), the  agency that administers the Aramar center. The scientists have  been given until 29 June to leave the Navy houses.    The civilian employees, who did not want to be identified to  avoid being dismissed, said the measure affects dozens of  experts from Sao Paulo and other states who moved to the area  when they were hired by the Navy. One of them said: "The houses  were offered as compensation for moving our residences, given  that Navy salaries have always been below market salaries."  Nearly 1,000 civilian and military employees live in Aramar.  They say the 650 civilians are being discriminated against.    One consequence of this move will be the flight of experts  in  ultra centrifuge techniques and in other subjects that the Navy  Ministry considers strategic. The Aramar nuclear program has so  far cost the Brazilian Government nearly $700 million.    The material department director and the Copesp president  were sought by journalists yesterday to explain the eviction of  civilian employees. Advisers reported that Navy officers can  only speak to journalists with the authorization of the office  of Navy Minister Ivan Andrade Serpa. Although his office was  contacted by fax, there has been no answer so far.</p>

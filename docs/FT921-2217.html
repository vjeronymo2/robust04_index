			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Arts: Jumping on a circus roundabout - Susan Moore visits the 'Automata' exhibition on the South Bank By happy coincidence the film of Alexander Calder operating his wire circus plays in two London exhibitions. At the Royal Academy, amid his mobiles, wire sculpture, jewellery and drawings, Ringmaster Calder is filmed bringing to life his extraordinary miniature troupe. Trapeze artists somersault and fly from bar to bar, fall off into the safety net and, with Calder's assistance, make their way to the edge and swing to the floor. A horse, cranked into action by the turn of a handle, revolves around the ring and an acrobat flips into the air to land on its back. An exotic dancer, the victim of an incompetent knife-thrower, is removed from the scene by stretcher. There is no attempt at illusion or deception. The lumbering, bear-like impresario is only too apparent. He simulates the lion's roar, blows the whistle between acts and introduces each performer in gutteral musical hall French. His stubby fingers unfurl and roll up the different coloured mats used for each act, and help the improvised and only partially automated performers and animals on their way. The performance is pure delight. His audience is transfixed by the way these tiny perfunctory people - confected out of wire, cork and fabric scraps - are able to replicate human movement by the most economical of means. We ooh at the trundling gait of the stretcher bearers, and the gyrations of the belly dancer's hips, and ahh as the strong man Rigoulot, clad in a scrap of leopard skin, raises his great weight in a sequence of authentic jerks. The Circus, begun in Paris in 1926, proved the precursor of the mobile and of a new kind of automaton or man-made man, far removed in spirit and appearance from the slick clockwork parlour toys of the 18th and 19th century, Imperial Easter eggs and Laughing Policemen. Its progeny currently fill the foyer of the Royal Festival Hall, their grindings, honkings and rattlings drowning Calder's recorded roars and whistles. Modern automata defy classification. The motley wood and metal constructions of the 25 makers here inhabit very different planes of a strange, whimsical world born of folk art, toy-making and the kinetic sculpture of Tinguely and Calder. What they have in common - and what distinguishes them from the likes of chess-playing mechanical boffins and writing boys - is both a deliberate lack of technical sophistication and a self-consciously ironical wit. These automatists make no attempt to conceal the enchantingly simple mechanisms of their creations. They simply invite the spectator to share the joke. Sam Smith is perhaps the real father of the new generation of British automatists - and it is essentially a British and a narrative genre. Tableaux such as 'Custer or a second groom being rowed across the lake by his third bride' combine folk art with Absurdist humour. His brightly coloured and minimally articulated carved figures leapt out of the fairground and into the gallery. There modern automata have sat, albeit uncomfortably, ever since. Absurdity runs rife. All we see of Peter Ellis's 'Injuns' is two tiny feathers hopping up and down behind a massive block of wood. Likewise his 'Hoe-down' is reduced to a pair of miniature dancing cowboy boots at the end of very long poles. As a yacht bobs up and down in the distant waves in Tom Wilkinson's 'The Crustacean Keep-Fit', a crab on a treadmill daintily hops over its course of beached shells and starfish to the balmy strains of an Hawaiian band. Wit and subversion often go hand in hand. Ron Fuller's version of sheep shearing has the woolly one wielding the giant sheers and every now and then chopping off the head of the farmer presented for crew cut. John White's grinding 'Cycling to Work' offers satirical social comment. His 'But soft, what lout thro' yonder window breaks' is what else but a winged, bald fat-bellied lager lout blowing a horn? Jon Mills's metal Punk steadily bashes a nail into his head. Some automata are made simply to amuse the person who pushes the button, turns the handle, pedals the bicycle wheel or slots in the 10p. Others are intent on unsettling their audience. Human behaviour is horribly well observed and aped with uncomfortable accuracy. Paul Spooner sets his six blank-faced sailors around a table eagerly awaiting their share of the substantial roast the captain is carving. Turn the handle and the sailors impatiently bang the table with their knives and forks. It is 1618, and in their ignorance they are clamouring to devour the last Dodo. In contrast to colourful end-of-pier complexity come the likes of Benedict Whybrow's life-size metal party guest - complete with moving wire-mesh waistcoat - and calligraphic woman with a poodle, achieved with a caricaturist's telling economy of line. Tim Hunkin's fairly crude papier mache busts are again extraordinarily expressive, registering a variety of all too convincing reactions to abstract art; wide-eyed incomprehension from the builder who scratches his head, a shrug from his wife nicely pasted up in pink floral wallpaper. Salvaged materials are ever imaginatively recycled. Jan Zalud's highly polished mask-like heads are more disturbing. With poking tongues, pointed teeth and waggling hair they are grotesque but sadly not unhuman. His brilliant Heckler is animated by convincingly loutish and ugly lunges and jeers. One of the automatist's greatest assets is our underlying unease about technological progress. Can it be a coincidence that Calder's faux-naive moving figures date from the first days of the robot? We are surrounded and confounded by technology which we cannot begin to comprehend. Adrian Moakes's Heath Robinson contraption to hail a bus is really no more ridiculous than the over-complicated gadgets we use daily. A first hint of the machine's manic wilfulness comes with Lucy Casson and Andy Hazell's tin trouve juddering and clattering washing machines and refrigerators. Oliver Langham goes further and harnesses animal aggression to exploit our subliminal fear of not being able to hold our mechanical monsters in check. He offers giant spiders and enmeshed flies, and menacing propeller bees with legs like mechanical grabbers that whirr and flap all around us. 'Automata' continues at the Royal Festival Hall until April 12; and at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton, April 28-May 30.</p>

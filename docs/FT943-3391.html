			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Blagden 74% down at Pounds 780,000 Blagden Industries, the steel drum maker, yesterday announced a restructuring programme as well as pre-tax profits down 74 per cent at the interim stage. In the 25 weeks to June 26, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.04m to Pounds 780,000. Last year's figure included Pounds 617,000 from a property sale. Group restructuring and re-organisation costs rose from Pounds 330,000 to Pounds 1.5m Mr Richard Searle, chief executive, said the changes underway as well as the latest results showed the company 'had halted the slide'. Mr David Kendall, chairman, said 'a modest improvement' was evident this year compared with the second six months of 1993 when the group incurred a loss of Pounds 106,000 after interest. But underlying demand for steel drums remained weak, while profit margins had been eroded due to pressure on selling prices and rises in raw material costs. Demand for speciality chemicals remained at a 'reasonable level'. However, it had not been possible to recoup raw material cost rises in the UK manufactured resins division. Turnover dipped from Pounds 116.9m to Pounds 113.6m, which included a Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 8.5m) contribution from discontinued operations. The chemicals division contributed Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 25.2m) while the UK packaging operations contributed Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m). As part of its 'strategic review,' Blagden sold its main plastics packaging operations for Pounds 6.9m in July. A loss of about Pounds 3.8m, provided for in the 1993 accounts, will fall in the second half. Changes to management include the appointment of Mr David Roache, previously finance director of Massey Ferguson, as finance director to replace Mr Lance Levine. As announced earlier, Mr Dick Searle has taken over from Mr Kendall as chief executive. The chemicals business was split into two divisions, manufacturing and trading, to 'provide more focus,' Mr Kendall said. Following the rights issue in June which raised Pounds 26m and the sale of the plastics packaging businesses, gearing stands at 20 per cent compared with 82 per cent last time. Earnings per share were nil against 2.7p last time.</p>

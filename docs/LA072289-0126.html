			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REGENTS SUPPORT UCI'S PROPOSAL TO CANCEL MEDI-CAL CONTRACT  </P> <P> The UC Board of Regents on Friday approved a resolution supporting UCI Medical  Center's proposal to cancel its Medi-Cal contract if the state refuses to  increase reimbursement rates for Orange County hospitals, a hospital  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason told the regents he wants Medi-Cal officials to  rebuild the network of Orange County hospitals willing to accept indigent  patients to ease the burden on UCI Medical Center, said Susan Meister, a public  affairs representative for UCI's Health Science Division.  </P> <P> Meister said the Board of Regents' approval in San Francisco on Friday  authorizes UCI Medical Center officials to proceed with the cancellation of the  Medi-Cal contract should hospital officials decide to do so. But she emphasized  that negotiations are continuing with the state over the medical care contract.  </P> <P> Officials at the school-run hospital in Orange want Medi-Cal officials to  increase the amount of reimbursement given annually for treatment of poor  patients.  </P> <P> Meister noted that the medical center maintains 6% of the hospital beds in  Orange County but treats half the county's Medi-Cal patients.  </P> <P> "There has to be a truly equitable distribution of indigent patients before we  will consider that the (Medi-Cal) network has been reconstructed" in Orange  County, she said.  </P> <P> There are 24 acute-care hospitals in the county, and only three accept Medi-Cal  patients. Most of those declining to accept Medi-Cal patients terminated their  contracts with the health group within the last year, Meister said.  </P> <P> "We will continue to take more than our fair share, but not half of the  (Medi-Cal) patients (in the county)," she said.  </P> <P> Other hospitals that currently have Medi-Cal contracts have indicated that they  may drop out of the program if UCI Medical Center does so.  </P> <P> UCI Medical Center is the only UC hospital that operated in the red last year,  losing $11.2 million, and hospital officials said they are being reimbursed for  less than half the cost of caring for Medi-Cal patients.  </P> <P> Medi-Cal officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> County health workers have warned that if UCI drops its Medi-Cal patients, it  could create a domino effect in the county and the remaining hospitals that  accept the state-supported patients would drop out of the program.  </P></p>

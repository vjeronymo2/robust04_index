			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: EX-PREP CAGER SHINES IN LONE STAR STATE  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount's Hank Gathers isn't the only basketball player with South Bay  ties vying for an NCAA statistical title.  </P> <P> Former Banning High star Eric Cooper, in his senior season at the University of  Texas-San Antonio, is waging a hot battle for the free-throw championship.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-4 guard, a one-time South Bay Player of the Year, has led the nation  for most of the season but slipped in the last week, missing two foul shots to  fall below 90% for the first time. After going 0 for 1 Tuesday night, Cooper  has hit 34 of 38 attempts, 89.4%.  </P> <P> Going into a conference game Saturday against Hardin-Simmons, Cooper is San  Antonio's top player, averaging 17.2 points and shooting 41% from 3-point  range.  </P> <P> As a junior, Cooper averaged 13.8 points and set school records for 3-point  baskets and attempts. He helped the Roadrunners win the Trans-America  Conference postseason tournament to qualify for the NCAA playoffs, where he  scored 17 points in a close loss to powerful Illinois. He was named to the  Trans-America all-tournament team.  </P> <P> Cooper, considered the top high school guard in Los Angeles when he teamed with  Joey Johnson to lead Banning to the City 4-A semifinals four years ago, took a  circuitous route to the Texas school, which is not widely known outside the  Trans-America Conference, which is not widely known outside Trans-America.  </P> <P> The road to San Antone went through Tucson, where he originally signed to play  for Lute Olson at the University of Arizona. Cooper found himself doing more  sitting than playing in Olson's high-powered program. When Olson's assistant,  Ken Burmeister -- who had recruited Cooper -- was hired as head coach at San  Antonio two years ago, Cooper tagged along.  </P> <P> Deep in the heart of Texas, Cooper has emerged as a legitimate pro prospect,  and he's taking his best (foul) shot.  </P> <P> Loyola's Gathers continues to lead the NCAA in scoring (33.6) and rebounding  (14.5) in the latest national statistics. After Wednesday's 104-79 loss to  Pepperdine, the Lions may have relinquished their national lead in team  scoring, dipping to 110.4 points per game. Oklahoma, the only other team  averaging triple figures, scored 122 Wednesday to improve to 110.5. At the  other end of the spectrum in the West Coast Athletic Conference is St. Mary's,  which has forged a 16-1 record by allowing only 55.5 points per game, second  best defensive average in the nation.  </P> <P> In winning its seventh straight game, St. Mary's held Santa Clara to 48 points  last weekend in a 28-point victory. Santa Clara shot only 27.7% on its home  court against the Gaels' tough defense, which is holding opponents below 40%  for the season. The Gaels are shooting 53%. Loyola is shooting 47.5% while  opponents are hitting 54% from the field. However, the Lions lead the nation in  3-point goals per game (9) and have made more 3-pointers (155) than all but two  other WCAC teams have even attempted.  </P> <P> In a computer rating system that ranks all 294 Division I schools for USA  Today, St. Mary's is ranked eighth, with Pepperdine No. 66, Santa Clara No. 67  and Loyola No. 69.  </P> <P> The Candidate: In making a bid for Division II All-American honors, Anthony  Blackmon continues to add new aspects to his game at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  The senior center leads the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in scoring  (19.7) and rebounding (9.6) and lately has been building up his assist totals.  Blackmon entered the week averaging four assists in his last six games. Over  the last nine games, Blackmon is averaging 20.5 points, 9.6 rebounds and three  assists, capped by a near triple-double against Cal Poly Pomona Saturday as he  recorded 18 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high seven assists. The 6-foot-7  Blackmon has also blocked a shot in 14 straight games.  </P> <P> Mapping Strategy: The Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn., whose teams  have won every NCAA men's title since the inception of a postseason tournament  in 1970, is recruiting far and wide to stay on top. Though the 10-team  conference -- in full swing this week -- is dominated by players from  California and Hawaii, there are several recruits from New York (West Islip and  Orchard Park) and Pennsylvania (York and Pittsburgh) as well as from a handful  of foreign countries: West Germany, Brazil, Israel, Australia and U.S. trust  territories Puerto Rico and Guam.  </P> <P> College Notes  </P> <P> Saturday's Dominguez Hills basketball game against Cal State Northridge matches  the coaches with the longest tenures in the CCAA. The Toros' Dave Yanai is  176-133 in his 12th season. Northridge's Pete Cassidy is 267-202 in his 18th  season. Both have winning percentages of .569. The two also have been at their  schools longer than any other Division I or Division II coaches in the  Southland. . . . The Toros have made 38 of their last 76 3-point shots, a 50%  rate. Sophomore guard Bryan Dell'Amico has made nine of his last 16 and has  made 22 of 44 for the season. . . . Northridge's starting lineup will include  forward Derrick Gathers, brother of Loyola star Hank Gathers and one of  Blackmon's contenders for CCAA scoring honors at 17.8, and former Redondo Union  High guard Karl Becker, averaging 7.6 points. . . . Punter Trent Morgan of  Northridge was named first-team All-American by the National Weekly Football  Gazette. The Serra High graduate punted 59 times for a 43.5-yard average. . . .  Loyola's Gathers, named WCAC Player of the Week for the second time this  season, could go scoreless the next 10 games and would still be averaging  nearly 21 points. . . . Loyola guard Bo Kimble, recovering from knee surgery,  has returned to a limited practice schedule but is not expected to suit up  Sunday against Pepperdine. He may see action Tuesday in a non-conference game  against U.S. International. Kimble scored 92 points in three games against  Pepperdine last season.  </P></p>

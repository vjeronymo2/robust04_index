This  regional organization originally included Iran, Turkey, and  Pakistan, but in 1992 Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan joined it.    According to the president, the United States and Europe are  not interested in the settlement of conflicts that are taking  place in the young states of the region and might even foment  them. He said: "Unfortunately, the colonial powers do not pay  attention to those ruinous conflicts in the `Third World' that  do not involve their interests. In some cases they even fan the  flames of these conflicts in order to reach their diabolic  objectives and ensure their illegal interests."    Hashemi-Rafsanjani indicated the urgent necessity of close  cooperation of the ECO member-countries that are rich in natural  and labor resources. "It is absolutely evident that this  cooperation will reduce our economic dependence on the developed  countries" and will decrease the political tension in the  region, the president stressed.</p>

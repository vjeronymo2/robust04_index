			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Czechs plan private toll motorway THE Czech Republic looks set to become one of the first countries in the former eastern bloc to open a privately financed toll motorway. It has invited 22 international groups to submit preliminary bids for building and operating an 83km stretch of the planned east-west motorway between Prague, the Czech capital, and Nuremberg in Germany. The 22 were chosen from more than 70 expressing an interest in the project. Kleinwort Benson, the British merchant bank advising the Czech Republic, said the list read 'like a who's who of the international contracting industry'. Construction of the motorway is expected to cost more than Ecu350m (Pounds 247m). In addition, the winning bidder will be required to fund the project, so incurring finance costs. The Czech Republic is only the second former eastern bloc country to plan a privately-financed toll road. The first was Hungary, which last year announced plans for two sections of toll road costing an estimated Pounds 100m to build. Hungary, however, has not yet selected a bidder for the contract. Like other former eastern bloc countries, Hungary and the Czech Republic face heavy demands on their road systems because of rising levels of car ownership and growing east-west trade. Lacking sufficient funds to build the necessary motorways themselves, they are turning to the private sector to finance, build and operate them instead. The Czech toll motorway will consist of an upgrading of the existing D5 road between Rozvadov on the Czech-German border and Plzen, roughly half-way between the border and Prague. The rest of the D5, which is being upgraded by the state, will remain toll-free. Construction of the motorway is due to start next year, with completion in 1996. The private sector will be given a concession to operate the toll road for a pre-determined period, after which it will revert to the state. The Czechs planned to offer concessions for a further 400km of private toll motorway if the initial project succeeds.</p>

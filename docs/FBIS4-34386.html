			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Attention: The polling stations just  closed throughout the country. In a moment, the Caracol  Network, which is number one in the elections, will begin to  report figures so you can make your own additions with paper and  pencil in hand.    Caracol listeners, it is now 1600. An honest, democratic  event just ended in Colombia; an process that began at 0800 to  elect the president of the Republic in runoff elections, to  choose between Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper Pizano. The  voting process just ended and the vote counting starts now. The  Caracol network will now begin an information marathon to report  figures from all cities and regions to allow you to make your  own additions and learn in a matter of minutes who is the new  president of the Republic. The authorities reported absolute  normalcy. Here are the first results from Colferias fair  grounds:    [Reporter] We have the results from table No. 434. Seven  votes were cast; two blank, three for Andres Pastrana, and two  for Ernesto Samper.    [Announcer] That was the result from the table at Colferias,  table 434.

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IF IT'S RAINING, THIS MUST BE CRASH DAY, SAYS AN OVERBURDENED HIGHWAY PATROL  </P> <P> Dozens of weather-related traffic accidents, most of the "fender-bender  variety," occurred throughout San Diego County Tuesday, causing massive  headaches for the California Highway Patrol, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "This happens every time it rains," Lt. Joe Garrison said. "We get a little  shower, and all of this weather-related traffic piles up.  </P> <P> "People don't understand that when the pavement gets wet, they need to slow  their speed, expand their space cushion and pay particular attention to what  they're doing. A little bit of water and an oily surface make for an extremely  slippery area.  </P> <P> "It got so bad this morning that, at 6 a.m., we suspended all non-injury  traffic accidents, meaning there were so many of them, we didn't bother to  attend to them. There were dozens, all brought on by the rain."  </P> <P> The Oceanside office of the CHP reported eight weather-related accidents, one  resulting in minor neck and back injuries that sent a man to Tri-City Hospital.  </P> <P> "He was going too fast for the conditions and ran into the center divider on  northbound Interstate 5," spokesman Tom Kerns said. "His car overturned near  the under-crossing just north of Camp Pendleton."  </P> <P> The steady drizzle was brought by a storm that "trickled" down the coast from  the Pacific Northwest, said Richard Stitt, a National Weather Service  forecaster. The storm is expected to leave this morning, Stitt said, although a  20% chance of rain remains.  </P> <P> It started raining at Lindbergh Field about 2 a.m. Tuesday, and by 4:30 in the  afternoon, 0.37 of an inch had fallen, Stitt said, adding that Del Mar  registered 0.75 of an inch, followed by Escondido with 0.66 and Rancho  Penasquitos with 0.39.  </P> <P> Tuesday's high and low temperature readings for the county were: Lindbergh  Field, 66 and 57 degrees; El Cajon, 67 and 57; Mt. Laguna, 52 and 34, and  Borrego Springs, 67 and 57.  </P> <P> Stitt said showers are not rare for the county at this time of year, and the  county is below its average rainfall for the season.  </P> <P> He said a threat of isolated thundershowers is expected in the mountains and  deserts throughout today, with warmer and less-windy conditions forecast  Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Fowler favours spending cuts over tax rises RIGHTWING hopes of heading off tax increases in the November budget were boosted yesterday by a declaration of support from Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman. In his first public comment on the party's increasingly divisive internal debate, Sir Norman called for public spending cuts - the alternative strategy privately favoured by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Speaking on the eve of a morale-boosting tour of Conservative constituency associations, Sir Norman said the party would want Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to take 'whatever action was necessary' to reduce the Pounds 50bn budget deficit. But he said grass roots members would expect public spending to be 'the first area which is looked at and which is reduced'. Public spending 'must be the first port of call before one goes to taxation. We have been and are committed to being a low taxation party', he told BBC radio. Sir Norman's intervention adds weight to a campaign against tax increases being run by rightwing backbenchers, with the apparent backing of cabinet ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. The right's case will also be strengthened by the launch of an autumn campaign against government economic policy by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor. Mr Brown moved to exploit the government's difficulties by claiming that the Conservatives were now the party of high taxation. Deliberately echoing the Conservatives' general election attacks on Labour, he said taxpayers already faced a 'tax bombshell' which would raise average taxes by Pounds 1,000 a year by 1995. The right's objective is to revive proposals put forward by Mr Portillo earlier this year to reduce the deficit by cutting the budgets of spending departments by between 2.5 and 5 per cent. The proposal was dropped after strong opposition from spending ministers, raising the prospect of tax increases if the government is to achieve its objective of holding spending steady in real terms at Pounds 253.6bn next year. The debate was given a fresh twist by Mr Redwood, who suggested that the government's budget problems would probably be solved by faster than expected economic recovery. His comments were underlined by Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, who told Securities and Investment Review magazine that the impact of economic activity on the deficit could be 'larger than people allow'.

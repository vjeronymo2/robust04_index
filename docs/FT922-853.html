			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / The Faltering Recovery: Debts ruin buy-out's high hopes - Recession has hit the Midlands hard but it is not all gloom. Two companies illustrate the contrasts MIDLAND Joinery, with gross liabilities of Pounds 3m, gave up the fight against recession in April. For more than two years it had been struggling to keep its balance on a skid pan of falling sales and high debts. Now Mr Michael McLoughlin, the receiver, of KPMG Peat Marwick in Nottingham, is looking for a buyer. 'It's easy being a financial pundit retrospectively,' Mr McLoughlin said. Nevertheless, the management of Midland Joinery, a Burton-on-Trent window frame manufacturer, was hopelessly unlucky with its timing. The company was founded in 1922, and in 1988 Mr John Young and Mr Frank Leyland led a management buy-out from Hunter Timber, part of Wickes Group, at a cost of Pounds 3m. Lazard Venture Fund Managers put together a package of Pounds 1.2m of equity; directors and some employees put money in. Bank of Scotland provided debt finance of Pounds 1.5m and Lazards lent a further Pounds 300,000. Four years ago it looked sound enough, even if expensive. 'When we first went in,' said Mr Leyland, 'we thought the funds were more than adequate; although the gearing was high, we could ride out a short-term recession.' By that he meant up to two years, noting that the timber trade was used to that sort of downturn every 10 years or so. But four years ago even the most pessimistic were not forecasting the severity of the recession. Things started to go wrong within a year. 'The marketplace began to shrink,' Mr Leyland said. As Mr McLoughlin noted, 'The value of the assets goes down but the borrowing doesn't go away - and there were two or three years of very high interest rates.' As the marketplace shrank, competition grew fiercer. The response of Midland Joinery was to try 'to increase throughput', Mr Leyland said. It hired more sales representatives and sought to make a bigger business of a stair manufacture sideline, but found that market overcrowded. It went into high-specification window-making in an attempt to target the architects' market as well as the traditional builders' market. It increased staff to service a potentially lucrative but not immediately profitable contract with a DIY chain. Turnover grew - Pounds 3.4m in 1989, Pounds 4.1m in 1990, Pounds 4.56m in 1991. But there were no profits. Midland Joinery was losing money even before it attempted to pay its debt charges; operating losses in 1990 were Pounds 352,000 and last year they were Pounds 330,000. Although debt had already been restructured once, by the end of last year Midland Joinery was desperate. The search started for a merger, for a new injection of equity, for the sale of the company: in short, for a rescue. The search foundered. The directors asked for the appointment of a receiver. Of the original executive directors, only Mr Leyland remains. So far eight of the company's 143 employees have been made redundant. Mr Leyland awaits what Mr McLoughlin can provide, but as the months go by and customers drift away to other suppliers, the chances of selling Midland Joinery as a going concern diminish.</p>

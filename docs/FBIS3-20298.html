This was reported by the Environment Ministry  of the land in Wiesbaden on Monday [28 March]. The pipe in  question in Block A, where contaminated water had leaked out  from a pipe for the taking of samples, was checked. First  results of a metallographical expert report of the  Krafwerksunion (KWU) Company showed that the major number of  cracks had probably been caused by chlorine, it was stated.    The nuclear supervisory board in Hesse took out a one-meter  long section of the defective pipe of the pressure-keeping  system. Part of it will be further checked in a Finnish  material-testing laboratory. According to its own information,  the Environment Ministry will only agree to repairs when the  cause of the damage has been clarified without any doubt.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues Independent British Healthcare, which has 17 hospitals spread between Stirling in Scotland and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, has deferred its plans to float this month, writes Christopher Price. Chief executive Keith Chadwick said the group, which was hoping for a market capitalisation of Pounds 45m, was 'not prepared to sell cheaply - it's that simple'. Two other casualties of adverse market sentiment are Martin Retail Group, a Pounds 100m float, and shellfish producer Seaperfect, a Pounds 20m placing. BrightReasons, owner of the Pizzaland chain and due to float later this month, was denying reports of its postponement, although it said it reserved the right to do so. A board meeting soon will decide the issue. Gardner Merchant, the catering group which had been expected to float at some stage soon, disappointed some observers at its results meeting this week when the company, a Pounds 402m mbo from Forte in 1992, distanced itself from early action. Undaunted, Eurovein, a Sheffield-based engineering group, announced plans to raise Pounds 14m when it comes to the market. TLG, the holding company of Thorn Lighting Group, unveiled operating profits of Pounds 6.06m (Pounds 2.63m) for the five months to the end of August with its pathfinder prospectus. It is due to float next month.</p>

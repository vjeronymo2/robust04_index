			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Music for the Bard The Everybody's Shakespeare International Festival shared by the Royal Shakespeare Company and its host the Barbican Centre managed to run two versions of Romeo and Juliet simultaneously on Wednesday and Thursday. While the Dusseldorfer Schauspielhaus actors swinging on their swings were presenting their German-speaking Romeo und Julia at Barbican Theatre, the members of the London Symphony Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich in Barbican Hall were playing a selection of Prokofiev's famous music for a (1939) ballet of the play, with spoken commentaries interpolated between the ten numbers by the actor Michael Feast. Who selected the music from Prokofiev's own two suites and who the text  - which melded prosaic summaries of the action with Shakepeare's glittering poetry - we were not informed, but the result was a reasonably satisfying dramatic whole, albeit marred by Feast's sometimes over-obvious actorly pauses and by moments of brutal bathos. After the axe-like orchestral blows of 'The Death of Tybalt' we did not need to be told that Tybalt had died. The music is better left unglossed, especially as it was bringing out the golden best of the orchestra. The beautifully soaring cellos, the melting celesta, the guest leader Yuri Torchinsky's fetching solo contribution to an altogether wonderfully realised balcony nocturne, the unprecedentedly blood-curdling tuttis - all was sonorous magic in Rostropovich's carefully measured account. Earlier we had had Balakirev's rarely heard King Lear overture - an example of the blunt Russification of Shakespeare to add to Tchaikovsky's powerfully simplifying overtures - and Shostakovich's suite, Op. 32a, from his incidental music to what apparently was a highly facetious (1932) production of a Russian-speaking Hamlet by Nikolai Pavlovich Akimov. These 13 wittily serviceable numbers are not much more interesting as pure music than Shostakovich's 1959 musical Cheryomushki, recently revived at the Hammersmith Lyric; but they deliver the authentic smart smack of early Shostakovich, and are doubtless worth an occasional outing, certainly when done with the LSO's verve.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER SENTENCED FOR ROLE AT CLINICS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer on disability leave has been sentenced to three  years' probation, fined $1,000 and ordered to do 600 hours of community service  work for his role in the operation of unlicensed medical clinics, officials  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge Veronica Simmons McBeth sentenced Kelly Klatt, 37,  who was convicted Monday of paying employees below minimum wage, failing to  withhold state and federal taxes and failing to pay employees for overtime  work.  </P> <P> He also was found guilty of knowingly working for clinics that were staffed by  unlicensed medical personnel.  </P> <P> Unlicensed staffers at the clinics -- two in Los Angeles' Westlake District and  one each in Boyle Heights and Wilmington -- routinely conducted blood and  pregnancy tests, prescribed and dispensed drugs, set broken bones, took X-rays  and supervised physical therapy for accident victims, said Deputy City Atty.  Ellen Pais, who prosecuted Klatt.  </P> <P> The State Board of Medical Quality Assurance began investigating the case in  May, 1988, after receiving an anonymous tip.  </P> <P> "This was a difficult case to prove," said Pais. "Individuals who worked at the  clinics had no employment records. Often, they signed checks at the clinic and  were then given cash."  </P></p>

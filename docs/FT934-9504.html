			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Motorola and Nextel in Dollars 1.8bn mobile radio deal NEXTEL, a rapidly expanding US mobile data communications services company, plans to construct a nationwide advanced digital communications network that will compete with existing cellular telephone services. Nextel is buying licences to operate mobile communications services in several of the largest metropolitan areas in the US from Motorola, the makers of semiconductors and communications systems, in a deal worth about Dollars 1.8bn. Nextel has purchased licences from Motorola covering the use of more than 2,500 radio frequencies in 21 states. These specialised mobile radio services are used for dispatch of taxis and other vehicle fleets. In exchange for its radio frequency licenses, Motorola will receive a 20 per cent stake in Nextel and is providing Dollars 260m in new financing. These arrangements will result in more than Dollars 500m in financing being provided by Motorola, Nextel said. Nextel announced that it had reached a technology alliance with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan. NTT has taken an equity stake in Nextel, purchasing 1.5m shares for Dollars 75m. NTT will assist Nextel in developing its digital wireless network. When fully constructed in 1995, Nextel's networks would be capable of reaching 180m people across the US, the company said. Services will include mobile telephone, dispatch, alpha-numeric paging and data transmission from a single mobile telephone handset. 'We view this transaction with Motorola as the capstone of our acquisition campaign,' said Mr Morgan O'Brien, chairman of Nextel. In recent weeks Nextel, formerly called Fleet Call, has spent more than Dollars 1bn to acquire dispatch service licenses in various parts of the US. Nextel's goal is to upgrade these systems with digital technology developed by Motorola, which will provide the company with equipment and technical assistance. 'In the six years of our existence, we have completed 125 transactions, acquired thousands of frequencies in hundreds of markets and raised more than Dollars 1.2bn in financing. Now we can turn our full attention to deploying the nation's first network of all-digital, integrated wireless communications,' said Mr O'Brien. Nextel has started offering its integrated digital services in southern California. The company said its services would cover most of the state within the first quarter of 1994. New services will be available in New York and Chicago by mid-1994. For Motorola, the biggest operator of dispatch services in the US, the sale reflects its decision to offer technology and equipment rather than provide services. Motorola recently sold 42 per cent of its dispatch service licences to CenCall and Dial Page, both dispatch service providers, in exchange for stock valued at about Dollars 1.2bn.</p>

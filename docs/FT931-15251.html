			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Morocco sets sights on EC: Hassan seeks to tie country to rich north KING Hassan of Morocco's intention, declared five and a half years ago, of applying for his country to join the European Community was greeted among many officials in Brussels with a mixture of incredulity and scorn. On Christmas eve the EC Council of Ministers gave senior officials permission to negotiate with Morocco a treaty of partnership modelled on those with central Europe. But unlike the agreements with Poland, Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia which may lead to eventual membership, any accord with Morocco will only lead to a closer, but as yet undefined, partnership. The disarray in the Maghreb Arab Union - Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia - is the key factor behind this change. The EC would have preferred to develop relations with all five members, but Libya is in international quarantine, while the deep crisis in Algeria does not allow for any new policy initiatives. Morocco conducts more than half its foreign trade with EC countries and is attracting an ever-increasing flow of foreign investment, notably from Spain and France. Its senior officials say they are prepared to bring down tariffs on industrial products but the quid pro quo would be free access for Moroccan fruit and vegetables, notably citrus fruit. Morocco's comparative advantage, the high quality of what it produces and the labour-intensive nature of such activity, which provides jobs for Moroccans at home and helps curtail emmigration, all plead in favour of a bold European move. King Hassan's strategic aim is to try to tie his country to a rich and stable north rather than a fragmented Maghreb. Such links will be complemented by a pipeline planned to carry Algerian gas to Spain via Morocco.</p>

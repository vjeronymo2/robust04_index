			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICARE MAKES SURPRISE OFFER TO BUY MAXICARE  </P> <P> In a move to boost its already large membership in Southern California,  PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., a Cypress-based health maintenance  organization, said Thursday that it will make a bid to acquire bankrupt  Maxicare Health Plans.  </P> <P> Details of the proposed acquisition were not disclosed. The offer comes five  days before Maxicare was to present a disclosure statement to the federal  bankruptcy court in Santa Ana. The statement's approval is a crucial step for  reorganization and emergence from bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Officials of Los Angeles-based Maxicare expressed surprise at the offer, which  they said was unsolicited.  </P> <P> "We have made it clear for more than a year that Maxicare is not for sale so we  are, quite frankly, puzzled by the timing of this announcement, which comes  just two business days before a crucial public hearing on our reorganization  efforts," Peter J. Ratican, chairman and chief executive of Maxicare, said in a  prepared statement.  </P> <P> Wayne Lowell, PacifiCare's chief financial officer, said the company had  informed Ratican of the forthcoming buyout proposal, which was to be presented  this morning. He said the offer was expected to be a starting point for  extended negotiations.  </P> <P> "We believe Maxicare would make an excellent strategic addition for  PacifiCare," Terry Hartshorn, PacifiCare's president and chief executive, said  in a statement. "Maxicare's largest single membership component is in  California, which also represents our largest geographic concentration of  membership."  </P> <P> PacifiCare officials said 130,000 of Maxicare's 320,000 members are in  California, where about 450,000 of PacifiCare's 638,000 members also are  located. The acquisition would boost PacifiCare's total membership by more than  50%.  </P> <P> Ratican said in an interview that he expects Maxicare to emerge from bankruptcy  later this year. While he has an obligation to creditors, stockholders and  clients to consider any offer, Ratican said he still expects Maxicare "to be an  aggressive competitor of theirs (PacifiCare) in the 1990s."  </P> <P> PacifiCare's interest in Maxicare, he said, "is an indication that they think  this management has turned the company around."  </P> <P> Ratican said he had previous discussions with PacifiCare about the possible  sale of a few Maxicare operations. But those discussions, which ended in March,  1989, were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> While no financial details were released, Ratican noted that Cigna, a  diversified insurance company based in Philadelphia, recently announced it  would pay $777 million to buy Nashville-based Equicor, which has 450,000  members in 19 HMO plans.  </P> <P> Alan Hoops, PacifiCare's chief operating officer, would say only that  PacifiCare would expect to offer Maxicare's creditors as much as they have been  promised in Maxicare's plan of reorganization.  </P> <P> That plan calls for creditors and shareholders to receive about $102 million in  cash, $67 million in notes and common stock and warrants.  </P> <P> PacifiCare's bold bid surprised some industry analysts who noted PacifiCare has  a conservative reputation for consistent profitability and for building  membership and profits from internal growth.  </P> <P> "PacifiCare is a very consistent player that usually hits singles and doubles.  Although they have very good and capable management, they usually don't go for  home runs," said Larry Selwitz, health-care analyst for Cruttenden &amp; Co.,  an investment banking firm in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Unlike many other HMOs -- including Maxicare -- that experienced losses during  an industry depression several years ago, PacifiCare has shown consistent  profits since it went public in 1985, in part because it has done well  investing its surplus cash.  </P> <P> In its last fiscal year, ended Sept. 30, PacifiCare posted revenue of $650  million, up 52% from revenue of $428 million from fiscal 1988 and earnings of  $10.9 million, up 71% from the previous year. The company's strong growth has  continued into 1990, with first-quarter earnings hitting $2.9 million, up from  $1.1 million for the same quarter in fiscal 1989.  </P> <P> Maxicare, by contrast, in the first nine months of 1989 showed a net loss of  $22.3 million. However, company officials say they have managed to increase the  company's cash flow by trimming overhead and that they expect Maxicare to  become profitable in 1990.  </P> <P> Both Maxicare and PacifiCare operate similarly in that they contract for  independent physicians and hospitals to provide service to their members,  unlike other HMOs that own hospitals and clinics and hire their own medical  staffs.  </P></p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Clinton's best chance Nobody, not even the most sceptical of us, should rejoice at US President Bill Clinton's self-inflicted discomfiture. The spectacle of his proud wife, Hillary, being obliged to justify herself in magazine interviews may satisfy some, but it is not good news. When the White House is in trouble, everyone is. This proposition, which has informed western policy for the past 50 years, remains true in spite of the end of the cold war and the subsequent inability of President George Bush to establish a new world order. In President Clinton, we have a reluctant internationalist, but our ultimate dependence on the Americans remains the same. The US is no longer willing to intervene in every country that falls victim to invasion or civil war, but it is the only superpower we have. When its chief executive is distracted, it affects every national interest. You cannot get around this by saying that only the domestic programme now before Congress will be affected by the debilitating atmosphere of suspicion that has suddenly descended on the presidency. Mr Warren Christopher may fly to China and Russia in an effort to produce a coherent foreign policy, but that does not constitute evidence that the secretary of state's agenda has the full attention of the White House. President Clinton's healthcare and welfare bills are under greater immediate threat from Congress than his inchoate foreign relations, but that does not alter the case. A US president who is weak at home cannot be strong abroad. If he fails to get healthcare through, Congress will be that much more difficult to persuade when he tries to send US troops to keep an agreed peace in Bosnia. To the question, 'is the US government on hold?' I was given a simple one-word answer by White House officials last week. 'Yes.' The sudden explosion of media interest in the Whitewater affair has left Mr Clinton frustrated. Granted, he is not standing still. He is out and about, offering a new initiative every day. A few days ago he was in New York, talking about crime. Yesterday he was in Detroit, addressing the Group of Seven meeting on employment. He spoke with his customary mastery of his subject. This is an intelligent president, who is also a consummate practitioner of the political arts. He is, you feel while in the US, permanently on TV. The trouble is that, whenever he appears, he is asked about Whitewater. Last week Georgia's President Eduard Shevardnadze had to stand silently by Mr Clinton's side, squirming, while a press conference called to mark his visit was turned into a Whitewater inquisition. When the US president is with his staff at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, his quicksilver mind is similarly diverted. He must pay attention to this or that strategy meeting on how to get out of the mess. He has no overall chief to turn to, no top-down command structure. The Clinton White House is composed of loosely interlocking taskforces, ad hoc seminars, groups and committees. 'That's why I don't believe the wild accusations about bumping off Vince Foster,' one close observer said, speaking of the Clinton associate who committed suicide. 'This lot would still be debating how to do it, in a seminar.' New presidents often get into difficulties in their first year or so. In 1980-81, President Ronald Reagan's officials were similarly disorganised. On being told that messages from his staff conflicted with one another, Mr Reagan remarked with his actor's rueful smile that 'in this White House, the right hand sometimes doesn't know what the extreme right hand is doing'. Mr Clinton is not yet ready to joke his way into happier times. The origin of the Whitewater affair was a land deal in Arkansas some 15 years ago. Few White House officials at any level doubt that some evasions of the civil law occurred. Perhaps tax was tardily paid, or the influence of the then governor Clinton was improperly used to protect his friends or his wife Hillary, a partner in the state's most powerful law firm. As to the subsequent clumsy at-tempts to conceal the details, everyone at the White House agrees that this was a 'mistake'. Some even beg you to hear their confessions. So far, so unserious. The trouble comes with the next layer of speculation. Nobody I met will confidently affirm that Alabama-style petty corruption and an attempt to hide it is the limit of the matter, that the many harsher allegations, some involving criminal behaviour, will all prove to be false. No one is, or can be, certain. The consensus among experienced damage control advisers is that the best policy is to get the whole story, every embarrassing detail of it, out as quickly as possible. Let nothing be concealed. It is not clear that this has yet been done, not even now, not after all that has happened. Mr Clinton answers questions whenever he meets reporters, but at the weekend he was tetchy when one such session touched on his tax statements. Mrs Clinton has broken her silence by giving interviews, but it remains to be seen whether a decision to put her on TV with her husband, taken in the White House last Friday, is implemented. The administration has co-operated with the special prosecutor, Mr Robert Fiske. It has sent him the documents he asked for. The staff he has summoned to appear before a grand jury have turned up, personal lawyers at their sides. Against that, Democrats in Congress are resisting the idea of committee hearings while Mr Fiske proceeds. This is technically sound, but it looks odd from the very Democrats who harassed Mr Clinton's Republican predecessors with hearing after hearing. Yet Mr Clinton may not be permanently lamed by what has happened. He appears to be taking the advice of greyer heads than the team of inspired twentysomethings he brought in from his campaign. He could survive a quick and not too damning report by Mr Fiske and the sacrifice of a few minor officials, Mr Bernard Nussbaum and Mr Webster Hubbell being the first. The Republicans may conclude that being totally obstructive in Congress would rebound on them. Mrs Clinton could absorb most of the opprobrium. Mr Clinton could stop trying to do too much at once, and succeed in what he focuses upon. That is the best-case scenario I was offered last week. It might come true, absent further damaging disclosures. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Europe tops company shopping lists THE US ceded its position as the most favoured market for acquisitions by UK companies to continental Europe last year, according to a survey of UK companies' acquisitions and divestments in the US conducted by JP Mervis, the corporate finance advisers, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. UK companies spent Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.59bn) to buy 113 companies in the US in 1991, compared with a total of Dollars 3.5bn spent on 150 acquisitions in Europe. Almost as much - Dollars 2.7bn - was realised from US sales. The value of British acquisitions in the US last year was 74 per cent down on the near-Dollars 11bn spent in 1990 and 91 per cent lower than the 1988 peak of Dollars 33.5bn spent on 425 US companies. Most sectors experienced a waning of interest. A notable exception was the medical industry where the value of acquisitions increased from Dollars 25m to Dollars 238m and the number of companies bought remained at five. The food, beverages and agriculture sector was another exception, with the value of acquisitions more than doubled to Dollars 233.2m (Dollars 101.5m) despite a drop in the number of companies acquired from seven in 1990 to three. The natural resources exploration and services sector fell from the top position in 1990 with Dollars 2.52bn to Dollars 99m. The consumer products and services sector came top this year with Dollars 638m of acquisitions. See Lex</p>

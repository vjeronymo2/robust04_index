			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Kosolapov, an expert of the Belarusian </F> Cabinet of Ministers Department for Coordinating Activities of  Administrative Bodies, by A. Bezveselnyy; place and date not  given: "Modern Ostap Benders"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Bezveselnyy] You have  mentioned an important problem such as the destruction and  recycling of weapons and military equipment. How will Belarus  benefit from the successful resolution of this problem?    [Kosolapov] As a matter of fact, some of these weapons pose  a threat to the people and environment. Despite a limited  budget, the Defense Ministry has managed to find possibilities  for financing appropriate scientific-research and  experimental-design works in the interest of the Belarusian  Armed Forces. The first results of this work can now be  summarized.    According to specialists' estimates, the implementation of  the project for recycling rocket fuel Melanzh alone will make it  possible to develop a competitive technology, profit more than 1  billion Russian rubles, and resolve a whole range of ecological  and other problems.    At the 43d Defense Ministry repair-mechanical plant near  Dobrush, recycling of weapons useless for combat is being  launched. It is expected that more than 50,000 pieces of  dangerous weapons will be reprocessed by 1997, which will  significantly contribute to resolving the issues of  environmental security and the problems of explosive materials  in the republic, as well as turning a considerable profit.    There is another very interesting example. At Belarusian  aircraft-repair plants and other aviation industry facilities,  active work is currently being conducted to develop the aircraft  Belarus in cooperation with Russia and Kazakhstan.  Additionally, this is accompanied by considerable activity in  international cooperation regarding conversion. This, however,  is a topic for another conversation.    [Bezveselnyy] Yuriy Georgiyevich, apparently, the  situation with the conversion is not so bad, despite certain  skeptics' complaints.    [Kosolapov] Exactly. Officials from the Defense Ministry  and the Cabinet of Ministers understand very well that there are  many political, socioeconomic, and scientific problems hampering  the conversion of military facilities. Many of these problems  are of an interdepartmental nature. Therefore, the Cabinet of  Ministers believes that it is necessary to develop new  organizational forms and methods to improve this process, and to  implement the government conversion program more efficiently.</p>

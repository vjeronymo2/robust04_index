			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Global games war rageson the small screen: The fight for lucrative share of the video entertainment market Mario, the moustachioed plumber of Nintendo video games fame, weaves his way under shooting fireballs to escape the clutches of his formidable opponent, Sonic the Hedgehog. Will the fearless Mario outwit the pursuer let loose by Nintendo's main rival Sega? Or will there be a showdown culminating in the destruction of one or the other or both? The battle between Mario and Sonic is not available on any video game. It is being fought on shop shelves between the two companies which dominate the market - Nintendo, the Goliath of video games, and Sega, its main competitor. The games war promises to be particularly nasty this Christmas season as Sega, a relative latecomer, blasts ahead in its effort to break Nintendo's dominance over game addicts. At stake is the Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9.2bn) video games market, one of the few sectors that has seen double-digit growth amid the economic gloom in industrialised countries. Turnover in the UK is expected to nearly double from Pounds 550m this year to Pounds 1bn in 1993. 'For a whole generation of kids video games have superseded pop and rock music as a form of entertainment,' says Mr Chris Anderson, managing director of Future Publishing, which publishes specialist magazines on video games. Already 40 per cent of homes in Japan and 30 per cent in the US have some kind of games console, according to Mr Philip Ley, marketing director of Sega Europe. But Europe has been slower to catch the video games fever. At the beginning of the year France had the highest household penetration in Europe of 12 per cent, says Mr Stuart Dinsey, editor of Computer Trade Weekly. However, Nintendo and Sega are planning to take the European market by storm. For the Christmas selling season both are launching massive advertising campaigns in a no-holds-barred bid to claim what market share they can. In addition to sponsoring the European Football Championships on British television, Sega has launched an Dollars 11m campaign to coincide with its latest product launch in the US. Not to be outdone, Nintendo, which has several tie-ups with fast-food and other companies, is spending heavily in the UK in the last three months of the year. Market share is crucial in the video games market as an established base of hardware owners drives software sales. And software is where the profits will increasingly come from. Every hardware unit sold generates an average six software sales costing Pounds 30 each. Although Nintendo's pre-eminence in the global video games market is not yet in serious trouble, the contest is increasingly close. Nintendo is still well ahead of Sega in worldwide sales of its hand-held machines, Game Boy, and in static consoles that connect to the TV. However, by bringing state-of-the-art technology to the market ahead of its rival, Sega has managed, in spite of its later entry, to pose a formidable challenge to its competitor. 'The way Sega has come back against Nintendo is the biggest-ever corporate fight-back in history,' says Mr Greg Ingham, publisher of Future Publishing. Sega trumped Nintendo when it launched the Mega Drive (known as Genesis in the US), its games console which uses 16-bit technology and can therefore play faster games than the previous-generation 8-bit technology. The Mega Drive brought Sega neck and neck with Nintendo in the US and Nintendo's worldwide market share has slipped from more than 80 per cent a few years ago to about 70 per cent today. But Nintendo is fighting back with its own 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and is expected to claw back market share from Sega. 'The general feeling is that Nintendo will grind (Sega's share) down by Christmas,' Mr Dinsey says. Europe, where Nintendo has slipped behind Sega, is witnessing one of the fiercest offensives. Nintendo is catching up with Sega's installed base of 600,000 Mega Drives in the UK, (expected to rise to 965,000 by year-end) with a forecast 650,000 Super Nintendos sold by Christmas. Meanwhile, Sega has taken the battle into yet another state-of-the-art technology by announcing it will launch a CD-Rom attachment for the Mega Drive using compact discs to store games. CD-Rom, which will bring a leap in storage capacity, and improved speed and quality in the games, is seen as the format of the future. Nintendo, which is not launching a games system using CD-Rom until next summer, is once again finding itself a step behind Sega. Software support will be a factor in the outcome of the battle between the two, and the ability to develop hardware technologies fast enough to drive software innovations. Nintendo has greater software support but Sega has been ahead in bringing hardware developments to the market. 'The contest is too close to call,' is the verdict of Mr Anderson.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE WARRIORS LINE UP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NINTENDO                                SEGA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT                  MASTER SYSTEM II: 8-bit games SYSTEM  8-bit games console;            console; 130 game titles more than 100 games titles; sold more than 50m units worldwide  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUPER NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT            MEGA DRIVE: 16-bit games SYSTEM: 16-bit games console            console; 130 game titles features 3-D graphics and digital stereo sound; 30 game titles  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GAME BOY: hand-held portable            GAME GEAR: hand-held portable game with more than 80 game             game; full-colour LCD screen titles; comes with earphones;           adaptable to become a GameLink cable to connect               portable TV; more than other Game Boys for joint play          30 games  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

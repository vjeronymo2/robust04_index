			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Brittan attacked as Rover-BAe case is dismissed SIR Leon Brittan, the Tory-appointed EC competition commissioner, yesterday came under attack from the Labour party after the European Court of Justice dismissed the controversial Pounds 44.4m Rover 'sweetener' case on a technicality. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded an explanation from Sir Leon concerning the 'mistakes' made by his office. 'The taxpayer has lost Pounds 44m through a mixture of British government negligence and now EC incompetence,' he said. The court ruled that British Aerospace would not have to repay Pounds 44.4m worth of UK government 'sweeteners' which BAe received when it acquired the Rover car group in 1988, because the EC did not follow the correct legal procedures. The verdict overturns an EC decision in July 1990, which demanded that the UK government recover Pounds 44.4m of concessions it granted BAe to secure the Rover sale. The court dismissed the EC's case on procedural grounds without passing judgment on whether the payments breached rules on European competition and government subsidies. 'Nothing in the court decision contradicts the original analysis of the Commission, and the opinion of the Commission about the (illegal nature of the) aid has not changed,' a Commission official said in Brussels yesterday. Sir Leon, who is in charge of EC competition policy, now faces a quandary. He can let the matter drop. However, faced at present by several French state aid cases, he is also under pressure to appear even-handed in his treatment of EC states. In addition, his demand for the recovery of the 'sweetener' payments was seen at the time as a counter-balance to his decision not to question the Pounds 150m sale price of Rover. The court said the Commission could either start a full state aid procedure to recover the Pounds 44m, or it could take the UK government to the court for failing in its general EC state aid obligations, which include giving Brussels full information. The payments were hidden from Brussels. BAe said it was pleased to have won the judgment and the event helped lift its share price by 11p. Shares closed in London at 290p. Lord Young, the former trade and industry secretary who authorised the 'sweeteners', said he was delighted with the outcome.</p>

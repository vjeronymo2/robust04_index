			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS WON'T STAY, COLISEUM CHIEF PREDICTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan said Friday that he  no longer believes the Los Angeles Raiders will stay in the Coliseum, and if  Sacramento or Oakland can deliver on the $30 million to $50 million in cash  they are promising to give the team for moving, "I think they have the  Raiders."  </P> <P> Riordan made his remarks on the eve of a much-ballyhooed exhibition game to be  held tonight in Oakland between the Raiders and the Houston Oilers. It will be  the first time the Raiders have played in Oakland since leaving for Los Angeles  in 1982.  </P> <P> There has been speculation that team owner Al Davis might use the occasion to  announce a permanent move to Oakland. Davis, however, dismissed that in  interviews this week, saying he has not yet made up his mind where he will play  in the 1990s and will not announce a decision this weekend.  </P> <P> Davis did not show up Friday night at a black-tie dinner in Oakland honoring  six Raiders who made it into the Football Hall of Fame. George Vukasin,  chairman of the Oakland Coliseum Commission, said Davis had told him that he  wanted to spare himself the "emotion of the occasion," on the eve of tonight's  game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coliseum Commission Criticized  </P> <P> Although Davis strongly criticized the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, as he  has in the past, for allegedly breaking promises to him for Coliseum  renovation, he also made certain conciliatory remarks about continuing to play  in Los Angeles if the Coliseum were made into a more modern facility.  </P> <P> Riordan, however, said Friday that he has become personally convinced that Los  Angeles "is not a real alternative" in Davis' mind and that the Raiders owner  does not even want to meet to discuss the possibility of continuing to play  here after the initial term of his contract expires at the end of the 1991  season.  </P> <P> The Coliseum Commission president cited as proof Davis' persistent  unwillingness to sign a statement agreeing that whatever would be said in such  conversations could not be used later by either party in the commission's  pending $57-million breach-of-contract lawsuit against the Raiders for the  team's attempts to move to Irwindale before expiration of the lease in the  Coliseum.  </P> <P> The dispute over the proposed statement has been boiling for two months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Last-Ditch Call'  </P> <P> "We've now come down to offering him a one-sentence agreement we would both  sign," Riordan said. "I have a last-ditch call in now to his attorney, Jeff  Birren. It doesn't cost Davis a damn thing to sign it."  </P> <P> Riordan said he believes that Davis is using the dispute over the statement "as  an excuse for not meeting us."  </P> <P> "He doesn't want to meet," Riordan said. "If we were a viable alternative,  Davis would have signed that in a second because he doesn't lose anything. It  leads me to believe we are not an alternative."  </P> <P> Davis was not available for comment Friday. But in the interviews this week, he  put full blame on the Coliseum Commission for poor relations with the team.  </P> <P> Riordan said, "The only thing that could yet bring things around would be if we  decided on our own to go ahead with Coliseum renovations and Oakland and  Sacramento couldn't deliver on their promises" to the Raiders.  </P> <P> However, a different assessment came from Irving Azoff, chairman of MCA Inc.'s  Music Entertainment Group and a representative of the private business  partnership that is managing the Los Angeles Coliseum complex. Azoff has been  involved in sporadic contacts with Davis that were broken off Aug. 9 on  commission orders because Davis had not signed the requested statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Compromise Sought  </P> <P> Azoff said Friday that he is trying to work out through his and Davis'  attorneys a compromise on the proposed statement that could allow talks to  proceed among Davis, himself and other private managers representing the  Coliseum Commission.  </P> <P> "I'm not as pessimistic as Riordan," Azoff said.  </P> <P> Davis, in this week's interviews, said negotiators from MCA told him that they  considered the Coliseum "a toilet."  </P> <P> Azoff, asked about this Friday, replied: "I don't know it was me, but I assume  it was. I've said that 5,000 times."  </P> <P> What the remark is meant to convey, he said, is his belief that the 66-year-old  Coliseum is dilapidated and needs to be reconstructed. He has proposed a  $125-million reconstruction, mainly with private money.  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Bank funds are unfrozen POLLY PECK INTERNATIONAL LTD v NADIR &amp; OTHERS Court of Appeal: (Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Stocker and Lord Justice Scott): March 19 1992 THE FUNDS of a defendant bank against which the plaintiff has only a speculatively arguable case should not be frozen by Mareva injunction pending judgment if the effect would be to interfere with the normal course of its banking business. But where there is a likelihood that the bank may remove funds to avoid the effect of a possibly adverse judgment, the court may order it to earmark traceable sums and refrain from dealing with them than other than in the normal course of business when no other funds are available. The Court of Appeal so held when discharging a Mareva injunction granted by Mr Justice Millett against the Central Bank of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, as fourth defendant to an action by the administrators of Polly Peck International plc (PPI) against Mr Asil Nadir, Kibris Endustri Bankasi Ltd (IBK) and others. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said PPI was the holding company of more than 200 subsidiaries. Mr Nadir was its chief executive. IBK was a Northern Cyprus bank. It was controlled by Mr Nadir and provided services for the PPI group. It had few customers, if any, other than members of the group and Mr Nadir's family. Central Bank was incorporated in Northern Cyprus in 1983 and had supervisory and regulatory powers. Under Northern Cyprus law, every bank operating within the territory must be authorised by, and hold 20 per cent of its foreign currency reserves with, Central Bank. IBK maintained an account with Central Bank in Lefkosa. Both Central Bank and IBK maintained accounts at Midland Bank International's Cannon Street branch. In the action, PPI claimed against Mr Nadir and IBK respectively for misapplication of Pounds 378m and Pounds 142m of its funds. The claim against Central Bank related to Pounds 44.987m of the Pounds 142m. From September 1987 to October 1990, IBK transferred Pounds 44.987m from its own account at Midland to Central Bank's account at Midland, in exchange for a corresponding sum in Turkish lira or sterling credited to IBK's account with Central Bank in Lefkosa. It was common ground that Central Bank assisted in the scheme to the extent that it received the funds transferred to it by IBK in London, and made the funds available to IBK in Northern Cyprus. The administrators contended that Central Bank either had actual knowledge that the funds were being improperly diverted away from PPI, or that circumstances put it on inquiry that that was so. The pleaded case against it was one of constructive trust. The writ was issued on October 22 1991. Mr Justice Millett granted an ex parte Mareva injunction within the UK against Central Bank, limited to Pounds 38.9m. The order now under appeal was made inter partes. Mr Justice Millett concluded that PPI had shown an arguable case against Central Bank as constructive trustee in respect of the Pounds 44m; that there was a real risk it might remove its funds from the jurisdiction; and that a Mareva injunction ought to be granted. A Mareva injunction could never be justified unless a fair arguable case for liability could be shown. But the strength of the case sufficient to support the grant of a Mareva injunction was dependant to some extent on the consequences to the defendant if an injunction were granted, as well as the consequences to the plaintiff if an injunction were not granted. PPI's main case was one of constructive trust. It was said that if equitable tracing rules were applied to the Pounds 44m transferred from the IBK account to the Central Bank account with Midland, about Pounds 10.7m still stood to the credit of Central Bank. It was accepted for present purposes that (i) the transfers of the Pounds 44m were procured by Mr Nadir; (ii) they were not effected for PPI's proper purposes and represented breaches of Mr Nadir's fiduciary duty to PPI; and (iii) the breaches of fiduciary duty were dishonest. For the purposes of the appeal, the court asked itself whether a fair arguable case had been shown that Central Bank must have realised the funds were PPI's funds, and must have been suspicious that they were being misapplied. Although Central Bank must have known the Pounds 44m was group money or Nadir money there was no basis on which to infer that it knew or ought to have known it was PPI money. Mr Justice Millett thought the circumstances in which the transfers were made should have made Central Bank suspicious,because of 'the sheer scale of the payments'. At the relevant time, Mr Nadir was a man of unblemished commercial reputation and integrity. Why should Central Bank have suspected impropriety because of the scale of the transfers? The case shown by the evidence as it now stood was speculative and depended for its success upon something emerging that cast suspicion on Central Bank and its good faith. As to whether PPI's case ought to be protected by injunction, it was a general principle that a Mareva injunction ought not to interfere with the ordinary course of the defendant's business. That made the grant of a Mareva injunction against a bank very difficult. A Mareva injunction ought never to prevent a defendant from paying his creditors their due debts. A bank must repay depositors in accordance with the terms on which the deposits were held. Central Bank had no customers other than the authorised banks of Northern Cyprus. The purpose of requiring them to keep 20 per cent of their foreign currency holdings with Central Bank was to ensure their foreign currency liquidity. Roughly 60 per cent of Central Bank's total foreign currency deposits were held frozen in London. The injunction had already seriously affected its foreign currency liquidity and interfered with its normal manner of carrying on business. To maintain the injunction would be likely to inflict irreparable harm. The other side must also be taken into account. If the action against Central Bank succeeded to the extent of the full Pounds 44m claimed, it would be hopelessly insolvent. Well before judgment, if there was any likelihood of judgment being adverse, it was likely to have looked for a safer place for its foreign currency reserves. It did not follow, however, that the absence of funds in England would necessarily prevent PPI from enforcing judgment (if obtained). Funds kept in any of the Brussels Convention countries would be vulnerable to enforcement procedure. For two reasons the balance came down against continuance of the Mareva injunction. First, PPI's case against Central Bank was no more than speculative. Second, it was wrong in principle to grant a Mareva injunction so as to interfere with the normal course of the defendant's business. To impose a Mareva injunction that would have that effect in order to protect a cause of action that was no more than speculative was not simply wrong in principle, but positively unfair. Central Bank should be required first, to earmark the Pounds 10.7m in a separate account; and second, should be restrained from dealing with the earmarked fund otherwise than in the normal course of business and unless and to the extent that there were no other available funds in England. The appeal was allowed. Lord Justice Stocker agreed. LORD DONALDSON MR also agreeing, said the special problem in the case of a bank was rooted in the fact that its stock in trade was money borrowed from depositors. Any order which could produce a 'run on the bank' (withdrawals not replaced by deposits) would be inimical to the purposes for which the Mareva jurisdiction existed. It was not that a Mareva injunction could never be granted against a bank, but the circumstances would have to be unusual. For Central Bank: Philip Heslop QC and Richard Millett (Theodore Goddard). For the administrators: Robin Potts QC, Leslie Kosmin and Sandra Bristoll (Alsop Wilkinson).</p>

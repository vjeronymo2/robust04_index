			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Mexican rebels set peace conditions Rebels in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas have set out conditions for ending their armed struggle, proposing that any negotiations focus on the plight of the state's indigenous peoples. In a communique sent to Mexican newspapers, the rebels laid down their most conciliatory agenda for talks so far. They said they had neither the desire nor the ability to take their struggle to all Mexicans. They also agreed to free Mr Absalon Castellanos, the former Chiapas governor, held captive since the new year. The communique appears to be part of a campaign to win public sympathy in the self-styled Zapatista Army of National Liberation's war of public relations with the government. While the government has said all avenues of negotiation are open, part of its strategy has been to isolate the guerrilla leaders from their followers by promising money and social reform to the state's impoverished indigenous communities. The rebels' conciliatory proposals were immediately welcomed by Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy in Chiapas, who said the possibility of dialogue was coming closer. President Carlos Salinas, in his first trip to Chiapas since the new year uprising, yesterday said he would offer 'profound and structural' solutions to the problems in the state. The Zapatistas said talks would have to address the economic plight of indigenous peoples, discrimination, a ceasefire and an end to violence in the region. So far there has been no reported contact between either side. Mr Camacho has indicated a willingness to discuss all the rebel demands, but it is not clear how much support he enjoys from President Salinas. Mr Camacho said on Sunday that the search for peace had been hindered by 'a wave of interpretations' about the political consequences of his actions in Chiapas. He was referring to reports that members of the government were opposing his peace mission, fearful that Mr Camacho might launch himself as a candidate for the presidency, either from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party or an independent party. Mr Camacho then fuelled such speculation with veiled criticism of the government's political and social policy. He also declined several opportunities to say he would not be a candidate. Amnesty International yesterday accused Mexico's security forces of using torture and arbitrary arrests in its efforts to quell the revolt, Reuter reports. The organisation said a team that visited the state between January 18 and 22 received information about dozens of torture cases, at least nine extra-judicial executions, 15 other suspicious killings and scores of arbitrary detentions.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> O'CONNOR'S SONGS RAISE EXPECTATIONS  </P> <P> Call her 1990's Tracy Chapman . . . this decade's Chrissie Hynde . . . or even  a new generation's Patti Smith.  </P> <P> Too much praise for a 23-year-old Irish singer-songwriter with just two albums  to her credit?  </P> <P> Not if you've heard Sinead O'Connor's seductively tender version of Prince's  "Nothing Compares 2 U" or her hauntingly personal "I Do Not Want What I Haven't  Got" album -- or if you saw her concert Tuesday at San Diego State University's  Open Air Theatre.  </P> <P> In the unending parade of pop faces and styles, O'Connor offers traces on  record and on stage of being a trailblazer -- someone like Chapman, Hynde and  Smith -- who not only entertains and inspires but also lifts our expectations  of pop music.  </P> <P> O'Connor's songs of personal exorcism and spiritual transformation are so  intimate and unguarded that you feel at times you're eavesdropping in a  confessional -- or overhearing a stormy scene in a bedroom, or in one song  witnessing the final, bitter goodbys of a couple in an attorney's office.  </P> <P> O'Connor -- who continues her U.S. tour with sold-out shows Thursday and Friday  at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- writes about betrayal and misjudgments  with anger and fury but she emerges from it all with a sense of optimism and  faith.  </P> <P> Coupled with the introspective, philosophical nature of her music, this  head-spinning success could tempt O'Connor into presenting herself as some sort  of precious angel -- an image she called to mind (no doubt inadvertently) when  she walked on stage at one stop on her recent European tour in a hooded robe.  </P> <P> By looking like a member of some exotic monastic order, O'Connor focused  attention during that concert on the spiritual undercurrents in the album.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, O'Connor wore a leather jacket, jeans and cowboy boots,  emphasizing the frisky, down-to-earth side of her personality and music.  </P> <P> When O'Connor, an outspoken fan of rap music, took off the jacket, the  lettering on her T-shirt spotlighted the playfulness even more. In a tip of the  hat to the controversial Los Angeles rap group N.W.A, the front of the shirt  read "P.W.A." -- for, as the lettering on the back explained, "Paddies With  Attitude."  </P> <P> As the concert proceeded, O'Connor moved from the cathedral-like tone of the  opening number through the rock 'n' roll sass of "The Emperor's New Clothes," a  tale of confrontation, to the sensual heat of "I Want Your (Hands On Me)."  </P> <P> Her greatest talent at this early point in her career is her singing, which  moves between a whisper and a scream with the suddenness and authority of a  stunt-car driver swerving to avoid an accident.  </P> <P> But her most prized attribute may be her ability to infuse music with the most  profoundly personal feelings, yet leave enough room for the audience to find  their own emotional connection.  </P> <P> A full review runs in Thursday's Calendar section.  </P></p>

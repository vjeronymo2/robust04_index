			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor backed on EC sanctions PROPOSED US sanctions against EC companies represent 'a fair and measured response' to the EC utilities directive which gives EC companies a competitive edge in their government procurement bids, according to a majority of the public comments submitted by US companies and trade associations to the US trade representative. The sanctions, due to go into effect last Monday, have been delayed at least until after Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, meets EC officials in Brussels next week. Few of the public comments support a US withdrawal from the Gatt government procurement code, a step proposed by Mr Kantor to broaden the sanctions beyond a ban on EC sales of telecommunications, power generating equipment and other services. Typical of the comments was that of AT&amp;T, which expressed a hope that sanctions could be avoided, but promised to back retaliatory measures if Europe would not retreat. 'AT&amp;T believes US withdrawal from any of the Gatt codes would jeopardise the open and stable world trading system,' AT&amp;T Vice President Randolph Lumb said. Even though telecommunications companies do not benefit from the code because they are not covered by it, 'US withdrawal from the code would set a very dangerous precedent for Gatt more generally, and would send a highly negative signal regarding our view of the future of the world trading system and the US role within it.' The Telecommunications Industry Association disagreed and called on the administration to study the option of withdrawing from the code. General Electric, which manufactures steam turbines, out of the domain of the procurement code, advocated the cut-off of all US financing of joint US-EC research and development projects.

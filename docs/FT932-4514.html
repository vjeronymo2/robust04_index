			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Radio groups plan business news station TWO RIVAL consortia hoping to launch commercial business radio stations for the London area were among 48 applications submitted to the Radio Authority yesterday. The applications were for eight commercial licences for the capital, six of which are already held by existing broadcasters. The competition for a business station on an AM frequency pitches London Business Radio (LBR) - whose shareholders are the GWR radio group, Reuters and Associated Newspapers - against London City Talk Radio. City Talk has been put together by Mr Mike Bloomberg, the Wall Street entrepreneur who is a growing rival of Reuters in the financial information business. Mr Bloomberg's backers include the International Herald Tribune newspaper and Professor George Bain, principal of the London Business School. LBR would draw on the strength of Reuters correspondents around the world. City Talk would aim to be the radio equivalent of US-based television service Cable News Network, with 20-minute programme segments updated 24 hours a day. Among the other radio licence applications submitted yesterday there were two rivals for services aimed mainly at women listeners: Radio Viva and London AM. Five groups want to provide services on both AM and FM. Those applications came from the Chrysalis group, Allied Radio, London Broadcasting Company, London News Radio (backed by merchant bank Guinness Mahon), and LBR. Other offerings included two country music applications, two sports services, and an application from London Transport for a travel and travel-related service. Sixteen applications were submitted for ethnic services in the capital. The Radio Authority, the industry regulator, is expected to make its decisions on this round of licence applications in the next three months. In the past the authority has re-awarded the commercial licences but, this time, the heavy number of applicants for the London area could lead to casualties among the existing companies. Apart from LBC, which yesterday appointed broadcaster Mr David Dimbleby as a non-executive director, those defending existing licences are Jazz FM, Kiss FM, Melody Radio and Spectrum International Radio.</p>

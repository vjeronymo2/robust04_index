These rules were submitted to EPA by the California Air Resources Board on the following dates: May 13, 1991 (SCAQMD Rule 1174); January 28, 1992 (VCAPCD 74.17); September 14, 1992 (SCAQMD Rule 1179); November 12, 1992 (VCAPCD Rule 74.19 ``Graphic Arts''); April 6, 1993(SMAQMD Rule 450).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRMs cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 58 FR 65959 and 59 FR 16580 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office. These TSDs are dated: November 16, 1993 (SMAQMD Rule 450 and VCAPCD Rule 74.19) and February 7, 1994 (SCAQMD Rule 1174 and 1179, and VCAPCD Rule 74.17).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A 30-day public comment period was provided in both 58 FR 65959 and in 59 FR 16580.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] King Juan Carlos I, the Spanish monarch, and  Queen Sofia, his wife, continued the state visit they are paying  to our country. The two esteemed Spanish guests' activities  this evening included a visit to the National Assembly, where  Assembly President Shaykh Sid'Ahmed Ould Baba and Senate Speaker  Dieng Boubou Farba welcomed them.    During this visit, the Spanish royal delegation listened to  a  speech delivered by the president of the National Assembly on  behalf of the two chambers of the parliament, which convened on  this occasion. The Spanish monarch delivered a reply speech, in  which he lauded the Mauritanian democratic experience.    Colleague Mohamed Abdallah Ould Amin has a report on this  visit:    [Begin recording] [Ould Amin] [passage omitted] In a reply  speech, the Spanish monarch, King Juan Carlos I, said:    [Juan Carlos, in Spanish fading into Arabic translation]  When we crossed the gates of this wide and luminous Sahara, we  recalled Ibn Khaldun, who was of a Spanish Islamic origin and  was among those who founded sociology, the creed that reminds us  that Mauritania was the offspring of the great Sahara and that  it is a melting pot for various cultures, elements, and races.  According to Ibn Khaldun, the development of historic events,  despite its variation, could be summarized in a simplified  portrayal and centers on two different and integral elements:  bedouin and urbanite. [passage omitted]    As I address you today, I cannot but refer to these distant  sources of our common history because I find them fresh in the  memory and appropriate in status. This is because of the fact  that the Mauritanian parliament--which represents one of the  phenomena of national sovereignty and a legitimate  representation of the noble Mauritanian people--is the fruit of  a vital democratic process and is liable to result in a  Mauritania with more vitality, freedom, justice, and progress in  accordance with its traditions and appreciative of its past  generations.    The democratic vitality of your people is the best guarantee  to continue the enormous effort that you have made to arrive at  a balanced economic growth capable of integrating the people and  the cultures in your country, with the respect of human rights  according to the preamble of the Mauritanian Constitution.  [passage omitted]    Mr. President, honorable parliamentarians, because of your  geographical and historical position, you are eligible to become  the link between the Arab Maghreb and Africa south of the  Sahara. I am aware that it is a very difficult task. However,  it is, at the same time, an important incentive that depends on  dialogue with neighboring countries and on finding quiet  settlements to all differences and on the fruits of the efforts  exerted in this field.    On the regional level, Mauritania is considered an active  member within the Arab Maghreb Union, due to the energies it  employ in this field.    Spain values the actions and initiatives undertaken with the  aim of achieving economic integration in this region. [passage  omitted]    Spain will support every effort that will lead toward the  settlement of the problem of the Western Sahara according to the  UN secretary general's peace plan. This will enhance the  prospects of regional integration.    Within the EU, Spain will continue its policy, which aims at  making Mauritania benefit as much as possible from all the  allowances and activities on which the European-Maghreb  cooperation is based.    In the various international organizations, Spain will  continue its support for Mauritania's strong efforts at  modernization in the economic and social fields. [passage  omitted]    The foreign ministers of our two countries signed today a  joint declaration that consecrated a collection of political  principles aimed at consolidating bilateral cooperation in  numerous fields.    I am confident that everyone shares the belief in the  importance of fulfilling these aims because they include the  aspirations for a better future for our peoples as we approach  a new century.

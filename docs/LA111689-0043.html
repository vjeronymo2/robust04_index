			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLORADO;  </P> <P> ASSAULT WEAPONS REGISTRATION STARTS  </P> <P> Police in Denver began registering residents' semiautomatic assault weapons  under a new city ordinance, while opponents threatened to file a lawsuit  challenging its constitutionality. Only one gun owner, the city's former chief  district attorney, showed up during the first hour. The ordinance was  introduced in the wake of growing gang activity in the city. Some semiautomatic  owners were said to oppose registration because of fears that the City Council  will eventually ban their weapons. Failure to register a weapon with a magazine  of more than 20 rounds can bring fines of $100 to $999 and jail terms of 10  days to six months.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand [I-M-T] Growth  Triangle (IMT-GT) Business Council, formed by private sectors of  the three countries, has submitted its proposals to the second  ministerial meeting, which yesterday adopted them for further  consideration by their governments.    The proposals involve the economic development of northern  Sumatera, northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, as well as  intensifying private/public-sector cooperation.    The council's meeting was in five workshops where delegates  discussed opportunities for business collaboration, as well as  issues requiring government attention to help the movement of  goods, services, labour and capital into the three development  sub-regions. The five workshops were as follows:    1. Agriculture;    2. Infrastructure    3. Tourism    4. Trade, Industry and Investment; and    5. Human Resource Development.    Government Help    The meeting identified the following issues and constraints  relating to government administrative procedures and policies  that could affect the efficient conduct of business and required  immediate attention.    Trade, Industry and Investment    -- The current practice of 6 A.M.-6 P.M. opening hours of  the  Malaysia-Thailand border crossing could be restrictive. To help  trade between northern peninsular Malaysia and southern  Thailand, it was proposed that the opening hours of the border  crossing should be extended to 24.    -- Currently, there are only two open customs checkpoints  between Malaysia and Thailand. To help free flow of trade  between the two countries, it was proposed that all border  points be opened. In addition, it was proposed that a single  joint customs checkpoint between Malaysia and Thailand be  established in place of the existing separate checkpoints on  both sides. This would reduce waiting time and customs manpower  requirements.    -- To enable free movement of vehicles within the IMT-GT  region, it was proposed that a co-vehicle insurance policy  scheme be initiated.    -- In the context of setting up new businesses under the  IMT-GT collaborations and joint ventures, bureaucratic approval  procedures could pose a serious constraints to the business  sector. In this regard, it is proposed that these procedures,  such as licensing and rules, be simplified and streamlined and  that a one-stop agency be set up to serve as the reference point  and central approving body to facilitate the business community  in the IMT-GT.    -- Differences in equity conditions and investment  incentives  between the three countries need to be reviewed to make the  Growth Triangle more attractive to local and foreign investors.  It was, therefore, proposed that a special task force be formed  among the three private sectors of the IMT-GT to examine these  existing conditions.    The meeting hoped that the ministerial meeting would endorse  the formation of this task force and that the relevant  government agencies of the respective countries would extend the  necessary cooperation and assistance to the task force, and  ultimately give weight and consideration to the task force  recommendations.    Agriculture    -- Currently, the Malaysian Government requires the use of  only Malaysian-made plastic crates for transporting marine  products. It was proposed to allow the utilisation of plastic  crates made by other countries. It was also proposed that  Malaysia should reduce the service charge of five cents to one  cent per kg to help trade in marine products.    -- The meeting proposed greater liberalisation of rubber  trade within the region by eliminating current artificial  restrictions.    Infrastructure    -- The meeting proposed the immediate reduction of  international telephone charges within the IMT-GT region to  promote investment, trade and tourism, as well as foster closer  relationships between the three countries.    Proposed Projects To Be Implemented under the IMT-GT  Project    For immediate action:    -- Request for assistance from the governments of each of  the three countries to organise joint tourism promotion.    -- The use of Malaysia-Indonesia-Thailand Tourism  Association (MITTA) as a channel for complaints and help  tourists and tourism information in the region.    -- Developing and marketing of industrial estates and  southern Thailand to promote collaboration between the private  sectors of Malaysia and Thailand.    -- Promotion of manufacturing of wooden furniture,  especially from rubber wood and rattan, by the three countries.    -- Looking at the possibility of establishing an IMT  skills development centre.    -- Develop joint fishing in the three countries.    -- Looking for the possibility of establishing fruit and  vegetable common market in border areas.    -- Liberalise rubber trading within the region.    -- The development of a regional television broadcasting  station, a land bridge interconnecting system, linking the west  coast and east coast of the region and power generation  facilities, requires from the government approval in principle  and feasibility studies. These projects are to be  private-sector-driven.    -- Bandar Aceh-Penang-Thailand natural gas pipeline  towards the development of energy resources within the IMT-GT  region.    -- Ban Gabang (Yala)-Sik (Kedah) road to improve land  transport between the two areas. The distance could be reduced  from 141 km to 60 km.    -- Ban Bhuketa (Waeng, Narathiwat) Malay-Thai border  bridge to improve land transport between Narathiwat and the  three Malaysian states of Kedah, Perlis and Perak (East-West  Highway).    -- Satun-Perlis road to improve land transport. The  present road link does not allow passage of heavy trucks.    -- An air transport network project to accelerate  multilateral aviation arrangement within the region.    For long-term action:    -- To look into the possibility of establishing  cooperation and joint investment in electronics and electrical  components.    -- Satun-Penang-Medan-Bandar Aceh Sea Link to promote  inter-regional trading and encourage tourism.    Conclusion    The Business Council wants to record its support and  confidence in the IMT-GT project. It is pleased to make its  small initial contribution to the attainment of IMT-GT project  objectives by submitting the proceeding report of its inaugural  meeting to the official meeting.    The council believes that the proposals, issues and  observations can lead to a more conducive environment for the  pursuit of the objectives of the IMT-GT. Similarly, projects  identified represent infrastructural upgrades, as well as  business opportunities, for the private sector.</p>

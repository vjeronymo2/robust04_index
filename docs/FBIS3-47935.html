			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japan's vice trade minister  on Thursday [20 January] denied reports that U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor will visit Japan in an attempt to  push stalled bilateral "framework" trade talks before the  February Japan-U.S. summit.    Tokyo has not received such notification from the United  States, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry  minister, told a press conference.    Kumano said the reported visit by Kantor before the February  11 meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  U.S. President Bill Clinton would "not be realistic" in view of  a tight political schedule in Japan up to the summit.    Kumano dismissed reported U.S. accusations that Japanese  bureaucrats are helping foot-drag progress in bilateral trade  talks.    Tokyo has not received specific U.S. requests to improve the  situation, Kumano said, adding the government has responded  appropriately by holding talks with the trade minister when  necessary.</p>

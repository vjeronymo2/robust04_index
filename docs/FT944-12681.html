			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Athlete loses Dollars 27m damages bid US Olympic athlete Butch Reynolds yesterday lost his bid for Dollars 27m in damages from the International Amateur Athletics Federation for barring him from competition after he failed a controversial test for the use of anabolic steroids. Mr Reynolds, who ran 400m in a world record 43.29 seconds in 1988 but was barred from the 1992 Olympics by the IAAF, was awarded the Dollars 27m in damages by a federal judge two years ago. But an appeals court said in May that the US court did not have jurisdiction over the Monaco-based federation, and the US Supreme Court yesterday declined to review that decision. George Graham</p>

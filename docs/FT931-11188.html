			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Denmark to hold second referendum on Maastricht DENMARK will hold its second referendum on the EC Maastricht treaty on May 18, national radio reported, Our Foreign Staff writes. The date fits in with British government plans for the Maastricht bill's passage through the Commons. Ministers have reassured Euro-sceptics that the third reading would not take place until after the Danish referendum. If the referendum had been delayed beyond May this might have meant holding the final Commons vote before the Danes' decision was known.</p>

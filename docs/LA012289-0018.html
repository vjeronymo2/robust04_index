			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BRAT PACK'S MOSCOW MISSION;  </P> <P> A TALE OF THE POLITICS OF TWO DIFFERENT HOLLYWOODS  </P> <P> DOUGLAS ROSS AND Bruce Toms, two aspiring young film makers, have never met  Budd Schulberg. But you can't fully understand the story of their encounter  with the Soviet Union without understanding Schulberg's. So it's best to begin  there -- there being a Hollywood that's as long gone as silent movies.  </P> <P> More than half a century ago, Budd Schulberg grew up, in his own words, as a  "crown prince" in a Hollywood whose leading lights lived in a style royalty  could only envy. His father, B. P. Schulberg, had been one of the industry's  fathers, an early partner of Louis B. Mayer (who went on to found MGM) and  later head of production at Paramount. Young Schulberg's best friend was  Maurice Rapf, son of Harry Rapf, who stood third in line at giant MGM, behind  the imperious Mayer and his legendary production chief, Irving Thalberg.  </P> <P> Schulberg and Rapf were young, smart and idealistic, and, like many who fit  that description in the Hollywood of 1934, they were fascinated with the vast  exertions under way in Josef Stalin's Soviet Union. On their vacation from  Dartmouth that summer, they visited the U.S.S.R. and were awed by virtually  everything they saw. With its herculean construction projects and ambitious  five-year plans, the Soviet Union seemed to them to be marching briskly toward  the "better world" envisioned by progressives. They returned to Hollywood  radicalized, believing that only socialism could lead the United States out of  the Depression's bondage. Within a few years, both joined the embryonic  Hollywood branch of the Communist Party, which grew rapidly in the late 1930s  on the strength of the belief that, alone among nations, the Soviet Union was  building a better society.  </P> <P> Times change. In 1987, Ross and Toms toured the Soviet Union as part of an  idealistic delegation of young celebrities -- drawn from the cream of the film  world's "brat pack" -- that went to record a video, a sort of polemic MTV clip  designed to make U.S. teen-agers question their assumptions about the Cold War.  Along the way, they saw something Schulberg and his contemporaries didn't: a  system that, instead of pointing toward the future, seemed to be teetering on  the edge of collapse.  </P> <P> Shaped by his times, Budd Schulberg couldn't wait to bring what he learned in  the Soviet Union back to the United States; shaped by his times, Doug Ross just  plain couldn't wait to get back. By the end of the trip, Ross recalls, "every  single one of us was so anxious to get out of there that we would maim."  </P> <P> WHEN THE STARS COME OUT IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> THE TRIP GREW out of efforts by Tom Siegel, then the fund-raising chief for  SANE -- a liberal disarmament group that has since merged with another  arms-control lobby to form SANE / Freeze -- to raise money in Hollywood for  educational and lobbying programs. The more time Siegel spent plumbing  Hollywood's financial depths, the more he became intrigued with the industry's  cultural power. "I was trying to convince the group that the power of this  medium to push a message was too powerful to ignore," he says.  </P> <P> SANE officials developed the idea of taking a group to the Soviet Union, where  it could examine the "evil empire" up close -- and then deliver the group's  anti-arms-race gospel to young people more likely to listen to them than to the  penitent physicists and military planners that arms-control groups usually send  out on the road. Siegel began organizing the trip in fall, 1986. But his  efforts went off track almost instantly.  </P> <P> Siegel's problem was not attracting too few people; it was attracting too many.  Hollywood's youngest stars, and would-be stars, are probably its most  politically effervescent element; many have their names on more letterheads  than films. Among much of young Hollywood, the desire to bury the "brat pack"  label under good works beats almost as strongly as the urge to graduate from  John Hughes movies. Actress Mary Stuart Masterson ("Some Kind of Wonderful"),  for one, thought that the young actors' bratty image sent out exactly the wrong  message to their fans -- "that it was cool to be a bad boy, that it was cool to  have an attitude, to not take things seriously. But the big thing these kids  miss is taking themselves seriously and finding their own voice."  </P> <P> Soon, Siegel had 50 or 60 people turning up at meetings, "in effect auditioning  for the right to go on the trip." He found himself engulfed by clamorous  disputes over which young stars could attract the biggest audiences for the  trip and which were the most seriously committed to political action.  "Eventually," he says wearily, "all that little back-stabbing got out of hand."  The project collapsed.  </P> <P> Months later, Siegel warily revived it. This time, he invited only a handful of  mainstays from the original group. They brought in their friends: Masterson and  Tim Ransom (a New York stage actor) asked Craig Sheffer (best known for "Some  Kind of Wonderful"); Helen Slater ("Ruthless People") called Erica Gimpel (the  television series "Fame"). Judd Nelson ("The Breakfast Club"), Esai Morales  ("La Bamba"), Helen Hunt ("Project X") and several other entertainers and film  technicians also signed up. Among them were Ross and Toms, who were there to  direct the video.  </P> <P> On Oct. 10, 1987, a group of 17 -- armed with an Ikegami / Sony Beta Field  recorder, five 8-millimeter video cameras and a Super 8-millimeter camera --  took off from New York to Paris, where they boarded an Aeroflot flight to  Moscow.  </P> <P> The group went to the Soviet Union with the implicit purpose of learning that  its people aren't ogres but "just like us," and that's inevitably what they  discovered. They found the clubs where Soviet rock bands play. They met  alluring Soviets of the opposite sex. They toasted fellowship with vodka. They  displayed the requisite amount of righteous indignation about the foreign  policies of the Reagan Administration. (Bundled up and bubbling over with  studied outrage, Nelson explains on one piece of footage that he joined the  expedition because "I strongly felt I had been fed a load of crap by my  government.") They wondered, with airy earnestness, why people can get along  but nations can't.  </P> <P> All par for this particular course, and probably not much different from what  Schulberg and Rapf concluded more than 50 years ago. But the group that toured  the Soviet Union also reached conclusions that Schulberg couldn't have even  imagined half a century ago.  </P> <P> First, they discovered that nobody in the Soviet Union dressed the way they  did. People approached them in the street to see who they were. How could  people tell they weren't teen-age Muscovites? "We wore sunglasses and nobody  else did," says Ross, 27.  </P> <P> They discovered that in a nation where all lives are sublimated to the state,  they couldn't bear to sublimate themselves to a group for two weeks. Initially,  the group toured Moscow together, following a rigid schedule laid down by their  hosts, the Soviet Peace Committee. By the time they got to Leningrad, people  began going their separate ways -- a response both to the sterility of the  official schedule and the impossibility of confining so many egos to one bus  for two weeks.  </P> <P> On the way over, Masterson, 22, recalls, she had "sort of a romantic vision. .  . . They would all be comrades, they would all be workers." But the reality  that she faced there shook her. "People are still holding on for that perfect  society," she says. "But they were getting sick and tired of waiting around."  </P> <P> Nothing worked. Lines outside shops stretched toward oblivion. At the end of  the trip, the group was fogged in at the Leningrad airport but couldn't call  Moscow about their connecting flight because no phone line was available. "The  inefficiency was so frustrating: People don't give a damn about anything  because they get paid either way," says Ross, who came home a born-again  capitalist. "In some ways," Masterson concluded, "it is a Third World country  with bombs."  </P> <P> When Sheffer, 28, probably the most skeptical of the entourage, asked one group  of their Soviet counterparts about the treatment of Jews in the country, they  recoiled and changed the subject. Even with glasnost, "a lot of things just  weren't talked about," he says.Another eye-opener was the yearning to leave  that they discovered among the young actors and musicians they met. "They still  believe they can come to America and fulfill their dreams," says Gimpel, 24,  willowy and soft-spoken. "Especially the young actors want to come here so bad.  I would talk to young actors and they would say, 'Broadway, Broadway,  Broadway.' The goal for some of the actors was to get out -- and that made me  sad."  </P> <P> BACK HOME WITH EXTRA BAGGAGE  </P> <P> MORE THAN 50 years earlier, Schulberg and many more of Hollywood's best and  brightest had seen in the Soviet system a model for the world. It was only at  the end of the '30s, when the Communist Party tried to stop him from publishing  his lacerating Hollywood novel, "What Makes Sammy Run?" that Schulberg  questioned his faith. Repulsed by the banal cultural rigidity of the Communists  at home and Stalin's brutality in the Soviet Union -- sensing that if he had  tried to publish his novel in the Soviet Union he might have disappeared in  Stalin's obsessive purges, like some of the prominent writers he met in 1934 --  he quit the party in 1940. "It was," Schulberg recalled in an interview,  "extremely disillusioning." Eleven years later, he became a friendly witness  for the House Un-American Activities Committee, when it came to poke through  Hollywood for Communists.  </P> <P> It's difficult for this generation of Hollywood activists to imagine how their  contemporaries half a century ago believed that the Soviets had the answer. To  Ransom, a well-spoken 25-year-old actor who has organized his own small theater  company in New York, the notion that someone might prefer living under that  system to this one, even with its faults, seems almost inconceivable. "A better  world? It's not," he says. "No way. Between the two, if I have a choice between  this world and that world, this is a better world, no question about it." When  Sheffer returned to the United States, he "was ready to kiss the Tarmac."  </P> <P> Reared on trendy disenchantment, many of those in the SANE delegation "came  back with a more generous view of this country," as Toms, 27, put it. "We are  really unaware of how lucky we are as a country," Slater says. "It reaffirmed  my belief that I'm happy where I live, and in the freedom that I have," Sheffer  says. After a few days of listening to their Soviet counterparts condemn the  commercialism and shallowness of Hollywood, and mostly nodding sympathetically,  they even found themselves doing the unthinkable: defending the ability of  crass, bottom-line-driven Hollywood to produce art amid the slasher movies. "I  became somewhat indignant (about the criticism) even as I thought, 'I don't  like it all either; it's not all good,' " Masterson says.  </P> <P> Everyone took their own lessons from the trip; some seemed to never break  through the simplistic cliches they had packed with their parkas. But most  returned with respect but no envy, a heightened sense of the possibility of a  more peaceful coexistence and an intensified appreciation for American values.  </P> <P> That's not too different from the synthesis Ronald Reagan has arrived at as he  leaves office. That may seem an irrelevant comparison: These were, after all,  neophyte actors and activists, not political theoreticians. But their  conclusions, even if superficial, may be more representative of the subtle  changes in our prevailing assumptions about both countries. If a group of young  liberals unconsciously share such key assumptions with a septuagenarian  conservative President most of them loathe, it suggests that the urge to wind  down the Cold War has quietly penetrated American society, obscured by the  gales of partisan disagreement about how to do so.  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD CHANGES . . .AND IT DOESN'T  </P> <P> WHEN THEY got up after kissing the Tarmac, the group discovered that its  assumptions about activism and Hollywood were mistaken too.  </P> <P> The Hollywood that Schulberg and Rapf returned to in 1934 was a small town. It  was not long before their heresies reached the ears of the studio elders. "  'Send them to Thalberg' was the cry," Schulberg told an interviewer many years  later. "It was like 'Go to the Wizard.' Thalberg was sort of the high priest of  Hollywood and the producers, especially Mayer, felt he could straighten us  out."  </P> <P> Production chief Thalberg, only 35 himself, sat the young men down and spoke to  them gently. He was not alarmed. With wisdom beyond his years, he reminded them  of the old axiom: Anyone who is not a socialist at 21 is a fool; anyone who  remains a socialist after 21 is a bigger fool. He told them to forget their  youthful enthusiasms, to study hard and to come back and assume their rightful  places when they finished school. The studios, he said, took care of their own.  </P> <P> Unlike Schulberg, the brat-pack delegation was met not with outrage or bemused  paternalism but with indifference.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Union, the group shot piles of film; Ross and Toms figured that  to convert that mass into an accessible video would cost $75,000. They assumed  that SANE would pick up the cost. They were wrong; SANE had its own financial  problems and couldn't pay.  </P> <P> Last January, the group met at Helen Hunt's house and decided to assume control  of the fund raising. "People seemed to think they had enough contacts in the  industry so that if it was well divided they could raise the money," says Toms.  </P> <P> Wrong again.  </P> <P> The group assumed what liberal political candidates everywhere assume: that for  good progressive causes the well in Hollywood never runs dry. Or, as Ransom put  it, "I had this thing in my head, that there were all these producers with  money."  </P> <P> There are. But they don't part with it easily. After a few weeks, Ross and  Toms, who had assumed primary responsibility for the fund raising, learned what  most candidates eventually do: Hollywood is more fond of giving advice than  money. "We'd go to see an actor, and they would say, 'You should go to the  producers, they've got a lot of money,' " says Ross. "The producer would say,  'No, I don't know what you're talking about.' Everybody would say, 'This is a  really good project -- here's who should be helping you.' " In Schulberg's day,  power in Hollywood had been compressed and centralized; 50 years later, Ross  was learning that Hollywood had grown so large, so disconnected, that there was  no center.  </P> <P> Some Hollywood figures, including Robert Redford and director Roland Joffe, did  step up to help them, as did Varitel Video, a post-production facility. But  most of the industry leaders -- besieged by requests from other causes --  wouldn't even talk to them. They ended up depending on their contemporaries,  younger people just breaking into the business, and older, veteran activists  such as Norman Lear, Stanley K. Sheinbaum and Peg Yorkin.  </P> <P> The video, a combination history of the arms race, travelogue and plea for  peace, edited to a Sting and U2 back-beat, has now been virtually completed.  Ross and Toms expect to begin showing it to its target audience of high school  students shortly. A deal to syndicate it to local television stations is also  under discussion. But as the project has dragged on, some of the participants  -- so fired with enthusiasm when they got off the plane -- have drifted back to  their lives and careers.  </P> <P> "To a certain extent," says Siegel, who has left SANE and is now director of  development for a medical center, "the project was very enlightening and a  little discouraging, and people separated themselves out from it because . . .  they were disillusioned a bit by the process."  </P> <P> Ross and Toms, who have stuck with it, don't seem disillusioned, only  chastened. It has been, in every respect, immensely more difficult than they  expected to put the vision in their heads onto the screen. "We never  anticipated a two-year ordeal," Ross says. For someone embarking on a career in  Hollywood, getting used to that may be the most important lesson of all.  </P></p>

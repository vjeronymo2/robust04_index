			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Weak economy helps drop in French inflation to 1.9% SHARP falls in the price of food and crude oil and weak economic activity kept French consumer prices stable in June, Insee, the national statistics institute announced yesterday. The annual rate of inflation fell slightly from 2 per cent in May to 1.9 per cent, its lowest rate since last December. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, said the figures showed France had managed to maintain a favourable inflation rate compared with its principal trading partners. But economists in Paris said the figures also reflected the impact of recession. 'With the rise in unemployment, which is expected to exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year, and with gloomy economic statistics, consumers are preferring to save rather than spend,' said an economist at one French bank. 'The government may welcome low inflation, but it is also a sign of declining activity.' Food prices fell by 0.7 per cent in June compared with May, while oil prices were 0.4 per cent lower. Prices of manufactured products fell by 0.1 per cent compared with May. The stability in the consumer price index in June, which was unchanged to 0.1 per cent lower, occurred despite two increases in tobacco taxes during the spring. The increases raised tobacco prices by 4.6 in June, compared with May. Seasonally adjusted, Insee said that retail prices in June showed a slight increase of between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent. They said that the reduction in inflationary pressure also reflected a reduction in import prices following currency devaluations by several of France's trading partners. A spokesman for the institute said that consumer prices were likely to increase again over the next few months. He said that an increase of 5.3 per cent in petrol taxes, imposed from yesterday, and a 16 per cent increase in the duty on alcoholic drinks from July 1, would feed through into a higher inflation rate.</p>

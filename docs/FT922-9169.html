			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Tyco Toys set to acquire Matchbox UNIVERSAL Matchbox Group, the Hong Kong-based maker of Matchbox die-cast miniature cars and trucks, is to be acquired by US toy maker Tyco Toys in a deal valued at about Dollars 135m. Tyco has offered Matchbox common shareholders Dollars 10.75 a share, including Dollars 8 in cash and Tyco common stock. Matchbox, which last year had earnings of Dollars 1.62m on sales of Dollars 167.5m, is controlled by the company's chairman, Mr David Yeh, who holds more than 60 per cent of the company's shares. Mr Yeh, who has agreed in principle to the acquisition, is expected to join the Tyco board after the deal is completed. If the deal goes ahead, it will make Tyco the third biggest US toy company and will give the Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based company access to Matchbox's distribution chain in overseas markets such as the UK and Germany. Tyco had its eye on the international market in recent years. Only last week, it announced plans to establish a German subsidiary to handle the sale and marketing of Tyco products in Germany. Similar subsidiaries have been set up in the UK, Benelux, Luxembourg and France. Only about 13 per cent of the company's Dollars 548.7m annual sales come from overseas, against about 50 per cent of sales for Hasbro and Mattel, the two biggest US toy companies.</p>

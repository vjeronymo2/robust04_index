			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Adam may take legal action against KPMG Peat Marwick ADAM &amp; CO, the private Edinburgh-based bank which lost more than twice its capital in unauthorised foreign exchange dealing, is contemplating litigation against KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors who were replaced at the annual meeting yesterday by Ernst &amp; Young. Sir Charles Fraser, chairman, said the bank had been advised that there was a prima facie case against Peat Marwick in whom the board had lost confidence. 'I don't think anyone would be surprised that (litigation) is a possibility,' he said. In September Adam &amp; Co revealed that it had lost Pounds 21m in irregular operations on behalf of a client by two foreign exchange dealers in its London branch. Although the bank's Pounds 10m capital was wiped out, it was immediately rescued by Mrs Francoise Schlumberger Primat, a 75-year-old director and principal shareholder who injected Pounds 21m. Although two foreign exchange dealers have been sacked no one has left the board as a result of the affair and shareholders re-elected it at yesterday's relatively peaceful meeting. But Mr David Simpson, general manager (investment) of Standard Life which is a shareholder in Adam &amp; Co, questioned at the shareholders meeting whether it was right that the bank's senior management should remain in place after the loss. The annual report, he said, stated that 'the basis of the problem (leading to the loss) lay in the expansion into an area of business with which management was unfamiliar, as a result of which the correct controls for that particular business were not put in place at the time.' He also quoted a letter which Peat Marwick sent to shareholders in which it said 'it now appears that (Adam &amp; Co's) control mechanisms over foreign currency transactions were not properly operated by management.' In previous years they had recommended strengthening controls. 'These recommendations were accepted but not fully implemented,' Peat Marwick wrote. Sir Charles said the bank rejected what Peat Marwick was saying but did not elaborate on the dispute. He said those responsible for the running of the bank had to stay in office to help it and its shareholders in their predicament. He said that Mr James Laurenson, deputy chairman and managing director, and any other directors, would have resigned if the report into the affair which the bank commissioned from Price Waterhouse had so recommended.</p>

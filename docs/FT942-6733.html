			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Fine Foods back in black Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted biscuit and cake group, returned to the black for the year to end March, but is not resuming dividend payments. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 211,522 compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 5.66m. Turnover fell from Pounds 21m to Pounds 15.9m, although the comparative figure included Pounds 7.4m from Lees, the confectionery and chocolate maker sold at the beginning of last year. The 1992-93 deficit included Pounds 3.7m on the disposal of Lees and a loss of Pounds 584,193 on continuing activities. Last month NFF acquired Jesse Oldfield, a Manchester-based cake manufacturer, for a maximum Pounds 2.56m. The acquisition is expected to bring a further Pounds 8m of turnover this year. Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive, said the management had been able to focus its attention on biscuits and cakes since the disposal of Lees. He described the group's new structure as 'well balanced' with each of its three divisions producing about Pounds 8m of turnover. The Gateshead factory, which makes both own-label and branded biscuits for the supermarkets, returned to operating profits on the back of a 10 per cent sales increase. The group's own Dunkers biscuits, launched last summer, had achieved Pounds 1m of sales in the first year. Launch costs of Pounds 400,000 had been written off against profits. Sales of a chocolate version begin next month. The Huddersfield-based distribution arm, known as Biscuits for the Connoisseur, increased sales by 19 per cent and gave 'a very satisfactory performance in terms of profit and cash generation.' The balance sheet shows net current assets of Pounds 541,000 compared to previous net liabilities of Pounds 3.08m. The improvement follows last August's Pounds 785,000 rights issue and the conversion of Pounds 2.5m of borrowings to a term loan. Net interest paid fell from Pounds 660,847 to Pounds 302,659, giving gearing of 85 per cent. Earnings per share of 0.56p compared with previous losses of 14.41p.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): 'Going rate' still applies in pay THE 'GOING RATE' is alive and well in British pay setting, according to Mr Fred Bayliss, a former senior official in the Department of Employment. He said in a paper prepared for the lobby group Campaign for Work that in spite of continuing decentralisation of collective bargaining, control over pay was now in fewer, not more, hands than 15 years ago. Mr Bayliss took issue with the group's claim that to achieve a better trade-off between pay and employment, the bargaining process had to be synchronised around a couple of months every year. He said that already more than half of all employees in the private sector had their pay settlements between January and April and argued that co-ordination of the level of annual pay rise was the key rather than synchronisation. Mr Bayliss concluded, after examining pay determination in retailing, banks, building societies, the car industry and chemicals, that many of the preconditions for better co-ordination already existed. He found that companies had their place in a pay pecking order, that there was a great deal of informal consultation between companies and a strong desire not to be knowingly adrift of others on pay. There continued to be acknowledged pay 'leaders'. Mr Bayliss said in retailing Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and Tesco were the 'heavyweights'. In banks, Barclays now settled first but NatWest still carried 'about as much weight'. Among building societies, Abbey National was the leader and in chemicals everyone watched ICI. In vehicle manufacture, Ford 'is well established'. Mr Bayliss accepted that for co-ordinated pay to be successful, key companies would have to subordinate 'their separate company and sector goals'.</p>

Its new version was suggested by Russian  scientists.    Academician and Nobel prize winner Nikolay Basov, who heads  the development project, told ITAR-TASS that ``the new reactor  is a hybrid model, because it incorporates both nuclear and  thermonuclear sub-systems.'' ``Time has forced us to make use of  this `combination'. Russia has accumulated large stockpiles of  uranium and plutonium as a result of disarmament and curtailed  research in the sphere of nuclear energetics. They can be  successfully used in the new reactor,'' Basov stated.    A laser will play the role of a high-intensity neutron  source  in the new reactor.    The results of the already staged experiments speak in  favour  of this type of a hybrid nuclear-thermonuclear reactor.</p>

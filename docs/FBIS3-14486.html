			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordanian </F> minister of state for foreign affairs, in Cairo, by Hani  al-Badri, in the studio on 26 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Badri] Sir, we would like you to give us an  idea about the general atmosphere of the meetings of the 101st  session of the Arab League's Ministerial Council in Cairo.    [Al-Hasan] I delivered a speech at the beginning of the  meeting. I explained Jordan's position on the peace process. I  pointed to the efforts Jordan and His Majesty King Husayn made  concerning the massacre of worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi  Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan.    In the deliberations, I also pointed to the need to upgrade  coordination among the Arab parties that are directly concerned  with the negotiations, and the need to achieve Arab  reconciliation in a way that leads to good Arab solidarity.    [Al-Badri] Your Excellency: You met with the Egyptian prime  minister this afternoon. Please give us a brief idea about this  meeting.    [Al-Hasan] I indeed had the honor of meeting with his  excellency the Egyptian prime minister this afternoon. At the  beginning of the meeting, I conveyed to him the greetings of His  Excellency Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. During  the meeting, which the Jordanian ambassador in Cairo attended,  we discussed a host of bilateral issues, led by convening the  Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee, which, we hope, will  hold a meeting in Amman next month.    I also briefed his excellency the Egyptian prime minister on  several Jordanian positions and issues, led by Jordan's position  on, and adherence to, the peace process, as well as other issues  linked to the siege on the Gulf of Aqaba we are suffering from,  and the need to lift the siege on Jordan, which inflicts great  damage to the Jordanian economy. This damage totals $300  million a year.    Moreover, I briefed the prime minister on some other Arab,  regional, and international issues.    [Al-Badri] With regard to amending the Arab League's  charter, which is a top priority on the 101st session's agenda  in Cairo, would you please brief us on the general framework of  such an amendment?    [Al-Hasan] Before answering this question, I would also like  to note that I met with His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister  'Amr Musa yesterday as part of the continued bilateral  consultations and coordination.    With regard to amending the Arab League's charter, it has  been agreed to link this issue to pan-Arab security and to delay  discussing these two issues until there is a better Arab  situation and until Arab reconciliation is achieved. We hope  this reconciliation will be realized as soon as possible under  the best circumstances.</p>

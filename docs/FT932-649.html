			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Donations row bemuses Hong Kong tycoons THE MAIN reaction in Hong Kong to the news in Britain about business donations to the Conservative party has been one of bemusement. This stems from two factors. First, the sums involved are, by the colony's standards, trivial. The other factor stems from its status; Hong Kong is a British colony and most of its population are British subjects. Mr Li Ka-Shing's alleged Pounds 100,000 donation to the Tory party pales into insignificance when compared with the Pounds 17m he has donated to build a university in his home town of Shantou, on the south China coast. Many of Hong Kong's leading businessmen, including Mr Li, are British citizens, or, like Mr TT Tsui - who numbers Mr Michael Heseltine, Mr Norman Lamont and Mr David Mellor among his friends - holders of British Dependent Territories passports. The late YK Pao, who used to play bridge with Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, was an unquestioning fan of Lady Thatcher, and was given a knighthood. Being Chinese is not, even in these days, wholly synonymous with being anti-British, says Mr David Tang, an Anglophile businessman with impeccable mainland connections. 'There are many of us who have made a lot of money in Hong Kong and believe that this has not been unconnected with the stable government the UK has afforded us,' he explains. 'That's why I give money to the Conservative party.' Mr Tang also points out that most of the money flowing to the Tories from Hong Kong Chinese businessmen results from their observance of 'face'. If a friend asks for money the natural reaction is to give it, he says. 'My grandfather gave Pounds 100,000 to the RAF museum at Hendon. Now, he would not have known what a Spitfire looked like if he fell over one. But Sir Jack Cater (former Hong Kong chief secretary) asked him for a donation because he had a friend who ran the museum. So he gave.' What gives some piquancy to the issue is the extent to which many of the Tory party's former donors have deserted the cause. Even before Governor Chris Patten's arrival a year ago many of the colony's leading lights were moving closer to Beijing. This is no better illus-trated than by Mr Li and Mr Tsui. The former is assiduously cultivating top mainland connections and Mr Tsui has recently started an investment company which marries Hong Kong money with Beijing's leading government ministries.</p>

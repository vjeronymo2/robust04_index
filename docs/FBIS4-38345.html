			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [No video available] </F>   [Text] The signing of Ukrainian-Turkish interstate  agreements took place in the White Hall of the Mariyinskyy  palace. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel signed a joint statement that  confirms the two countries' mutual desire to develop friendly  relations, aim their political moves at strengthening stability  in the Black Sea region, and intensify cooperation for the good  of both nations.    Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his Turkish  counterpart signed a protocol on exchange of ratification  instruments to the treaty on friendship and cooperation between  Ukraine and Turkey, as well as an interstate agreement on  cooperation in the sphere of tourism. An intergovernmental  agreement on international road transport was signed by  Ukraine's Transport Minister Oprest Klympush.    After signing the Ukrainian-Turkish documents, Demirel and  Kravchuk answered questions from journalists.    [Begin Demirel recording in Turkish with superimposed  Russian  translation] Turkey and Ukraine are the region's two largest  countries, and they feel a responsibility for friendship and  peace in the region. Therefore, their cooperation benefits the  maintaining of peace in the region and in the world, benefits  their people. During Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Turkey in 1992 we  signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation in the trade  sphere. There are no political problems between Turkey and  Ukraine. Turkey is against any conquest of territories by  force, against interference in any country's internal affairs.  Like the rest of the countries, we support Ukraine in the  defense of its territorial integrity. Crimea is Ukraine's  internal affair. [end recording]    [Begin Kravchuk recording] Indeed, Crimea is Ukraine's  internal problem, but since it affects many problems in the  Black Sea region, we support the principle stipulated by the  Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly and the treaty that this region  is a region of peace and cooperation, and that it should be  strengthened by confidence-building among the states existing  and working in this region. It means that the problem of Crimea  here is a Ukrainian problem, but we would not like Crimea to  upset the balance, the cooperation, and the relations that have  been and will be established in the region. As far as our  Crimean problems are concerned, these can be discussed  separately, especially since the Supreme Council will address  the problem again the day after tomorrow [1 June], and everyone  interested can find out the details.

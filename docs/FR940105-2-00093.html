DPR&hyph;80 and DPR&hyph;82, issued to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operation of Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in San Luis Obispo, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would consist of revisions to the Technical Specifications in response to the revised 10 CFR part 20. The change would revise the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in gaseous effluents, and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the licensee's application for amendments dated July 7, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed revision, in regard to the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS) as a dose rate to the maximally exposed member of the public, will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that may be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant envirommental impacts associated with the proposed amendments to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement and Addendum related to the operation of Diablo Canyon Power Plant Units 1 and 2, dated May 1973 and May 1976, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 7, 1993, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the California Polytechnic State University, Robert E. Kennedy Library, Government Documents and Maps Department, San Luis Obispo, California 93407. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Theodore R.

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S POPULARITY  </P> <P> In Lee May's article "Blacks Look Back With Anger at Reagan Years" (Part I,  Jan. 20) one can understand why nearly 80% of blacks consider the Reagan  Administration oppressive. Reagan has been a scourge to the hopes of black  people.  </P> <P> He has not changed. Before Reagan became President, he always opposed anything  which aided the black people. He opposed the Montgomery bus boycott, open  housing, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, he continued along this same vein as President. During his  reign federal programs like affirmative action, welfare, and health assistance  were under constant attack. Under Reagan in 1986 blacks suffered an  unemployment rate of 15% as compared to 6% for whites. Under Reagan we had no  justice for the poor, but we did have bloated military budgets at the expense  of the poor.  </P> <P> Most blacks are overjoyed that this man left the White House. They have  suffered miserably under his heavy hand.  </P> <P> DON RADEMACHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

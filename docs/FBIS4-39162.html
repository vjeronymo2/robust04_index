			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 June Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk  visited open-type joint-stock society KievHuma [Kiev rubber].  The following report is presented by Yuriy Horban.    [Horban] Leonid Kravchuk acquainted himself with the  products  of this enterprise, which is one of the first joint-stock  societies in Ukraine, and also met the working collective and  representatives of the Union of Independent Entrepreneurs.  Therefore, not only the activity of a definite production unit  but the entrepreneurial movement as a whole was a subject of  discussion.    According to certain speakers, the wild process of  accumulating capital, which some of their colleagues in Ukraine  have abused before now, is almost over. The prestige of the  state, the firm and even trademark becomes ever more prevailing  in the activities of the new structures. It was emphasized that  private enterprises, like state ones, now require stability most  of all, first and foremost a stability of legislation. It is  not for the first time that issues of foreign economic  activities, taxation and exchange rate policies and currency  regulation were discussed. The unsatisfactory nature of the  relevant laws scares potential investors off Ukraine and leads  to a total collapse of the state's economy.    The participants in the meeting emphasized their support to  the economic movement on way of reforms and expressed their  belief that President Kravchuk is the main guarantor of their  implementation. As was pointed out, certain political forces  wish to blame the reforms, the market and entrepreneurs for all  the economic troubles, although they themselves torpedoed these  reforms and continue to torpedo them.    In his speech, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized his loyalty to the  course of economic transformations and also spoke out in favor  of the state sector where 90 percent of the economic capacities  are concentrated today. The president of Ukraine referred to  power engineering and agriculture as the industries which  require most of the state's support. Leonid Kravchuk analyzed  the causes of the crisis and referred to the contradiction  between market laws and anti-market ones and also failure of  public opinion to accept the high rate of a transition to a new  system as one of the causes. The president also expressed his  views concerning the current political situation.    [Begin Kravchuk recording] As far as the elections are  concerned, well, the Supreme Council took a decision that the  elections would take place and there would be no changes. In  other words, we are now entering a permanent process of  elections. On 26 June, [pauses] It is clear that this will not  be the end. I am not sure that all will be elected on 26 June.  If the president is not elected, on 10 July there will be a  repeat election. Then, in one month's time there will be  elections to local bodies. On 24 July they will again fail to  elect all the 112 deputies and again they will postpone the  elections. That is to say, we shall enter the new year on the  wave of elections.    I have honestly done everything possible to prove that these  elections today, even proceeding from the fact that they are  necessary, are dangerous and ineffective because they have no  legal basis. Nowhere in the world, [pauses] Ukraine will be a  unique state which is holding elections having neither  provisions in the Constitution nor the laws which would regulate  the power bodies. When I tell this, they say: You are telling  this just to retain your post. And the overwhelming majority of  people, let us say, [passage indistinct], can believe that this  is the only desire of the current president.    I was telling the Supreme Council that the Supreme Council  assumed huge political and historic responsibility. If no laws  regulating and determining the structure of power bodies at the  local level are adopted, we shall have the executive power  completely ruined. I underline this: completely ruined. We  shall have 25 Crimeas or even more, because today, as the  president, I can rescind a decree by the president of Crimea in  compliance with the Constitution, however no one, neither the  president nor the government, can rescind a decision by a  chairman of the oblast council.

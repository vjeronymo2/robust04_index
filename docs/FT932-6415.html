			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Studs - London Fringe Theatre All soccer is drama, but no play is a soccer match. English player Paul Gascoigne made a plausible 'Phantom of the Opera' with the protective face mask he wore during Lazio's 5-0 defeat of Ancona; there was a standing ovation for him. One nil to soccer. But now with Studs at the Tricycle Theatre, the Irish company Passion Machine puts the soccer back into drama. It makes unusual viewing. Studs presents eleven players on stage in a high energy - if overlong - soccer play. The locker-room dialogue is brawling and chaotic, but the on-pitch movement around the small Tricycle stage makes a study in agility and precision. The play tells of Emmet Rovers, a team so incompetent that its left wing, who never gets the ball, advertises for a manager. One candidate applies. He appears to have a footballing past. He licks the Rovers into shape, they topple the cup holders and breeze through to the final . . . which they lose. The manager turns out to be an alcoholic with the same name as the great footballer the Rovers took him for; and now a developer has started to build on their home pitch. The transformation of no-hopers into champs is a film and theatre staple: Studs does for soccer what Pygmalion does for elocution and Stepping Out for dancing. Nor is a play about soccer, alongside An Evening With Gary Lineker or The Boy's Own Story, an original idea. Paul Mercier's writing and direction runs the action on a kind of high-octane essence of locker-room: swearing, chanting, weeping, shouting and laughing. The strength of this play lies in the choreographed direction of the match scenes. Here, each player is spotlighted with the ball, and delivers a monologue of his thoughts as he tears down the pitch, while the other players provide the rest of the game's noise and tension. Tricycle Theatre (071 328 1000) until June 19</p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Xerox agrees to sell reinsurance subsidiary Xerox, the US document processing company, has agreed to sell a reinsurance subsidiary for Dollars 400m, the largest disposal to date in the planned break-up of its financial services businesses. The company, Constitution Re, has been bought by Exor, a Luxembourg-listed investment holding company controlled by the Italian Agnelli family. Xerox early last year announced plans to sell off its financial services businesses, with the exception of the financing operations which support sales of its office equipment products. The move echoes steps taken by several other big US non-financial companies to leave the financial services business, which they had once seen as a fast-growth industry in which to invest surplus profits. Since announcing its plans, Xerox has sold Van Kampen Merritt, a fund management firm, for Dollars 360m and Furman Selz, an investment bank, for Dollars 90m. Constitution Re is the eighth-largest US-based reinsurer, with net premiums last year of Dollars 454m, according to Xerox. It writes reinsurance for a number of small US property and casualty insurers, and takes on little catastrophe risk, according to Talegen, Xerox's property and casualty insurance subsidiary. The disposal, for cash, will leave Xerox a life insurance company and six specialist property/casualty insurance businesses, which had premiums last year of Dollars 2.4bn.</p>

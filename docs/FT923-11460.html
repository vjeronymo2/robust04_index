			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Gaviria attacked over escape by drug baron THE ESCAPE from jail by Mr Pablo Escobar, the Medelln cocaine cartel chief, on Wednesday morning has demolished the cornerstone of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's anti-drug policy. Mr Escobar's negotiated surrender, just over a year ago, was hailed as a government victory by most Colombians. Now a storm of criticism has broken out, with leading politicians calling for the president's resignation. Mr Escobar seems to have escaped amid a gun battle while the army's special forces were trying to recapture the jail, near the city of Medelln. He and his associates had seized the director of prisons and the deputy justice minister when they entered the jail on Tuesday evening to tell Mr Escobar that he and his men were to be transferred. The Gaviria government's policy of encouraging traffickers to surrender and confess their crimes, in exchange for lenient sentences and exemption from extradition to the US, was meant to stop drug terrorism. The car bombs, assassinations and kidnaps that punctuated the war on drugs in Colombia did stop after Mr Escobar had surrendered last year. Mr Escobar seems to have expected to serve a short sentence - perhaps three years - and go free. But his confession to a single trafficking crime, of which he had already been convicted in France, made a mockery of the justice system. His unwillingness to confess to other crimes, thus breaching the terms of his surrender agreement, meant he had effectively forfeited the right to leniency and might have to serve 20 or 30 years. Mr Gaviria said the government had decided Mr Escobar should be transferred, having received evidence that he was continuing criminal activities from jail. The president has now said that Mr Escobar's life will be respected if he gives himself up. The fugitive, in a statement last night from somewhere in the jungle, said he would return to jail if guaranteed a fair trial and if UN personnel controlled the prison entrance. Fearful of a revival of the Medelln cartel's drug terrorism, Colombian politicians are already talking of negotiating a new surrender. Congress, meanwhile, is set to investigate not only the bungling of the military operation during the escape but also the absurdity of the luxury in which Mr Escobar was held.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Record year for UK securities firms Last year was the most profitable for the UK securities industry since record keeping began in 1988, with revenues rising by 53 per cent, the London Stock Exchange said yesterday. Return on capital was also at its highest level, with an average return of 20 per cent recorded. In 1992, the average return was only 3 per cent. In an article in its Quarterly Report, the exchange said its member firms compared favourably with those of the New York Stock Exchange, where the average return on capital was 17 per cent. However, the data are not strictly comparable. But the survey of profitability notes some worrying trends, particularly the growth in costs. Overall, firms' expenses for the year rose by 15 per cent. However, the pace quickened in the second half of the year when new issue activity and turnover reached record levels. In the third quarter, expenses rose by 18 per cent and by 34 per cent in the fourth quarter. Salary costs showed the most marked increase, rising 95 per cent over 1992, partly reflecting the effects of profit-related bonuses. By the fourth quarter of 1993, these bonuses accounted on average for 29 per cent of salary costs, up from less than 10 per cent in the first quarter. The stock exchange said its research showed that the largest and the smallest firms were the most consistently successful. Of the smallest firms, with less than Pounds 5m in capital, 80-83 per cent were in profit in each of the four quarters of 1993. All the firms with capital of more than Pounds 150m were profitable during the first three quarters. The stock exchange concluded that '1993 proved to be a turning point in the performance of the securities industry'. Looking to 1994, it noted that volatility in securities markets in the first quarter meant that a drop in dealing profits would undermine overall performance in the industry this year, despite signs that commission revenue and corporate fees would remain high. Separately, the Quarterly Report carried the results of a stock exchange study into turnover statistics on continental European exchanges. It suggested that the growth of cross-border trading in London had not been at the expense of other domestic exchanges. 'Much of the trading on the International Equity Market (in London) is new business and the relationship with domestic markets has generally been complementary - business has grown rapidly on both,' the exchange said.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vosper advances 13% as orders top Pounds 600m Vosper Thornycroft Holdings, the Southampton-based warship builder and engineering group, increased pre-tax profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 10.3m in the six months to September 30. Sales grew by 12 per cent to Pounds 129m, with 82 per cent coming from exports. The group said more than 20 per cent of turnover now came from activities independent of warship contracts. The current order book is worth in excess of Pounds 600m, 70 per cent of which is for exp-ort. Mr Peter Usher, chairman, said it was particularly satisfying that the group had won the competition for Sandown Class minehunters for the Royal Navy in July, and that the Ministry of Defence had placed an order for seven ships. He said: 'This will provide a base load of about one ship per year until 2001, and will enhance our position in overseas markets.' Mr Usher said this was a turbulent period in the history of the defence industry, with the ongoing bids for VSEL, the Cumbrian-based submarine maker, the recent sale of assets at Swan Hunter and the forthcoming sale of Devonport and Rosyth dockyards. The chairman said that if either British Aerospace or GEC won control of VSEL, Vosper would be in a 'David and Goliath' situation, but insisted: 'We are sufficiently well managed to be sprightly on our feet, to take on the competition.' Vosper has net cash of Pounds 134m, compared with Pounds 116m at the year-end. The group said this gave it the financial capacity to bond large contracts - such as the next batch of Type 23 warships, which it will bid for. Earnings per share increased 10 per cent to 21.6p (19.6p) and the interim dividend is lifted by 15 per cent to 6.1p (5.3p). COMMENT Vosper is determined not to be written off as a small boatbuilder on the south coast, hence its emphasis yesterday on being able to build warships as big as the Type 23 at Southampton. For bigger vessels, such as new Royal Navy landing platform dock assault ship, the group says it could still act as prime contractor, but have the construction done elsewhere. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 24.3m put the shares, unchanged yesterday at 743p, on a prospective multiple of 14.6 - a small premium to the market. The shares are underpinned at this level by the solid order book, but could advance further on news of gaining further significant contracts.</p>

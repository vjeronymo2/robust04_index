			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "NATO Must Forge a New Role"] </F>   [Text] NATO has lost its old enemy but has failed to find  a new role since the end of the Cold War. The debate at  Monday's [8 January] Brussels summit will be dominated by who  should be allowed to join; but the most important question is  what the organisation should do.    Western governments are likely to adopt the disingenuously  titled document Partnership for Peace, which offers closer  co-operation with individual East European states but no  timetable for NATO membership.    The plan is inevitably a compromise. It had to contain  enough backing for East Europe to satisfy countries nearest to  NATO's front line, such as Germany. But NATO has had to avoid  any steps that would make Russia feel more isolated, an emotion  which extreme nationalists such as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy could  exploit. The policy has also to acknowledge that the U.S.  Congress would be reluctant to endorse any extension eastwards  of the defence umbrella.    Even if Partnership for Peace is more a political balancing  act than the result of detailed strategic analysis, it has got  the balance right. What NATO needs today is a policy which will  serve until the political shape of Europe is defined more  clearly. There are too many uncertainties in the old Soviet  bloc, particularly in Russia, for NATO to extend to East Europe  its central guarantee that an attack on one is an attack on all.  NATO could also be dragged into peripheral disputes, provoked  by the revival of nationalism, for which the organisation was  not intended. Equally, the document is the most that could be  gained while maintaining U.S. involvement in Europe.    While Partnership for Peace is the appropriate policy for  NATO, which is and should remain essentially a defensive  organisation, it is not, on its own, an adequate defence policy  for the West. More must be done by Western governments, acting  outside NATO, to reassure the fledgling democracies of East  Europe and ensure that communism does not regain ground in the  former Soviet Union. The fears of Western betrayal, expressed  so vividly by Polish President Lech Walesa, are understandable  in a part of Europe that has only just thrown off the yoke of 40  years of communism.    France, itself not a member of NATO's military structure,  proposes that the European Union offer specific guarantees to  East Europe. That would provide a clear message to the Russians  that they should abandon any aspirations to regain control of  East Europe.    But how can Europe offer anything when its foreign policy is  barely beyond the embryonic stage and there are few signs that  governments are prepared to surrender national interests to a  common European one? Would, for example, any guarantee put East  European countries under French and British nuclear protection?  Would these states accept joint decisionmaking on the use of  nuclear weapons?    The most effective way to preserve the gains of the past  four  years lies in preventing the revival of communism; that can be  best achieved by helping President Yeltsin develop Russia's  democracy and market economy. Russian reforms must be  underpinned by the offer of more technological aid and increased  investment. West Europe's markets must be opened up rather more  generously than at present and help given to reviving the  trading system in East Europe.    NATO's role can be reassessed if this policy succeeds. If it  fails, then NATO can retain its traditional role as guarantor of  Western security.</p>

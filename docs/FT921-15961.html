			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Bank lending for personal consumption falls sharply THE WEAKNESS of the UK economy pushed new bank lending for personal consumption down sharply in the three months to the end of November, according to figures from the British Bankers' Association. Borrowing from Britain's leading banking groups through credit cards was particularly slack, in line with depressed demand ahead of Christmas and the desire by consumers to repay credit card debts, which are perceived as the most expensive form of credit. The association said money borrowed on credit cards from the banks rose by Pounds 23m in the three months compared with an increase of Pounds 254m in the previous quarter and Pounds 271m a year earlier. As a result the increase in personal lending for consumption fell to Pounds 101m in the latest three months compared with an increase of Pounds 415m in the three months to August and Pounds 653m in the three months to the end of November 1990. In general, the figures in the association's quarterly analysis of sterling lending by the UK's nine biggest banking groups are not seasonally adjusted. But the association also published data showing that total lending grew by less than Pounds 2bn, seasonally adjusted, in the latest three months. This compares with Pounds 5.4bn growth in the three months to November 1990, in spite of the addition of Abbey National figures to association statistics in April 1991. Most of the increase in lending in the three months to November was to individuals - a rise of Pounds 1.58bn on an unadjusted basis. This was mainly accounted for by a Pounds 1.48bn rise in lending to house buyers. Borrowing by retailers, which would normally be high in the approach to Christmas, rose Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 555m in the same period in 1990. The association said this reflected the continuing succession of capital issues by big retailers used to repay bank lending. After six months of net repayments the company sector resumed borrowing in the latest three months. But the increase - of Pounds 500m - reflected activity by financial companies and was low compared with 1990 when borrowing by the company sector averaged more than Pounds 4bn a quarter.</p>

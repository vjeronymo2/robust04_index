			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMEDY REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAUGHING ON EMPTY  </P> <P> Jerry Seinfeld, who appeared Sunday night at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center,  bills himself with all due modesty as "America's most imitated comedian" as  well as "the king of observational comedy" -- news to us.  </P> <P> In one respect he's right; he is at least one of the creators of the tone that  informs the burgeoning sump of stand-up comedians nationwide whose acts and  attitudes have become so interchangeable that they can now work under the label  generic comedy.  </P> <P> The tone works in lieu of content, and it's borrowed largely from the  mock-earnest swell and bogus sincerity of TV commercials. ("Have a headache?  Take Anacin.") It's ironic, authoritative, snide, rhetorical, presumptive and  inescapably banal, a knowing tone, as in "If you want to lose weight fast, try  Dexadril" or "Inquiring minds want to know."  </P> <P> In a way, Seinfeld (who is 34) and his contemporaries -- second-generation TV  kids -- may be powerless to realize that they've unconsciously picked up one of  the few areas of American address that ring with confidence and uncontested  certainty. The irony comes from their instinct that the pitch is hollow and  mostly deceptive. But it's also relentless, like propaganda. After a while, one  begins to believe -- or at least share a reference.  </P> <P> The tone, then, is one of complicity. But it's amazing how little else there  is. Seinfeld came on to talk about driving the 405 Freeway; airports and  airline travel (it seems every comedian must feel naked without a bit on this  topic); life as a Cub Scout; going out on Halloween in a Superman outfit (a  large part of his act recalls being a kid); gym class; going to the movies ("I  wanna see the guy who buys that horse-bucket-sized popcorn"); the Olympics, and  horseback riding -- with lots of small side forays into one- or two-joke  topics, and the occasional one-liner. ("I'm a single guy; I have no other guys  attached to me.")  </P> <P> Seinfeld is a pleasant, effortless performer who works clean (no small feat in  this the time of the howling, offal-heaving monkey). The kind of likable  smoothie who's popular in school because he's a good dancer and gets his date  home on time -- and even chats with her dad. There's no vindictiveness in his  act. He doesn't traffic in the mindless hate -- or self-hate -- that  characterizes so many other stand-ups. He uses his body well. His language has  imagery and rhythm. He's expressive. He's clear. And he's completely empty.  </P> <P> There isn't a single portion of his act that isn't fun -- amusing might be a  better word -- but 10 minutes or so into it you begin wondering what this is  all about, when is he going to say something or at least come up with something  piquant. With the great comedians, the joke serves a coherent body of  observations, or at least a theme. The laugh is an intro to a deeper truth. The  less-than-great cut out after the punch.  </P> <P> Seinfeld has no attention span. He's flipping channels all the time, through  kiddie sitcoms and chitchat, and after a while you feel the dread unease of  having overdosed on Fruit Loops. Cub Scouts? Halloween? When he announces with  all the officiousness of a crime-show narrator that "the first 10 years of your  life the only thought is: 'Get . . . Candy!' " you strongly suspect that this  was a kid in whom nothing much was going on.  </P> <P> Not long ago, Seinfeld appeared on "Later With Bob Costas" and mentioned having  grown up in Massapequa, Long Island. "There was nothing there," he said. "There  was just . . . nothing." He grinned incredulously. Hearing that line, you can  understand the trouble with his act: He has no frame of reference. Yeats had a  line about "paying homage to unevent." Seinfeld pays homage to insignificance,  and he does it impeccably.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Flavio Figueiredo from the Finance Ministry] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today  said that the Constitution clearly states that no public  employee can have a higher salary than the president of the  Republic's. The minister admitted that public employees'  salaries are low. He added, however, that at the current moment  -- when everyone's capacity to sacrifice is being tested -- it  is not acceptable that cuts be implemented in the salaries of  some and not in the salaries of others. The finance minister  said that if the problem in converting salaries into Real Value  Units results from the wording of the provisional measure, he  will ask President Itamar Franco to write another text.    Minister Cardoso today held a meeting with businessmen at  the  National Confederation of Industries headquarters and tried to  calm down the financial market. He denied today the rumor that  30 April will be a bank holiday. According to him, it will not  be a holiday because the government does not want to touch  savings passbooks or freeze prices:    [Begin recording] There will be no bank holiday on 30 April  or any other day because we will not touch the savings passbooks  or, by no means, impose price controls. We will force prices  down, control abuse, but will not control prices or anything  else that might affect the people's pockets. There will be no  bank holiday; this is a thing of the past and it is over. [end  recording]    Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today received the  businessmen's support for the economic stabilization plan. They  asked the minister, however, to do his best in favor of the  constitutional reform because they deem it fundamental for the  plan's success.    Some entrepreneurs also expressed their support for  Cardoso's possible presidential candidacy. The minister,  however, said the decision will depend on popular support:    [Begin recording] To become a candidate, I need the people's  votes. The moment I feel the people really want me to become a  candidate and that they feel that by becoming a candidate I am  not abandoning the plan, but helping making it successful, then  I will be able to decide better. [end recording]    During the meeting with the businessmen, the finance  minister  again asserted that the implementation of the new currency, the  real, will be announced well in advance in order not to surprise  anyone.</p>

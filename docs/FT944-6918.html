			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Dole blames UK and France for Nato Bosnia rift A leading US politician blamed Britain and France yesterday for a 'complete breakdown' of the Atlantic alliance and called on the United Nations to withdraw from Bosnia, where up to 400 peacekeepers were being detained by the Bosnian Serbs. Senator Robert Dole, who will lead the Republican majority when the new Congress meets in January, also called for the lifting of the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government. 'Get the (UN) soldiers out of the way. Pull 'em out,' Mr Dole said in an outburst of frustration at European nations which cite the safety of their troops in Bosnia as an argument against tougher military intervention. 'I think we have a complete breakdown of Nato,' he added, saying that he held the 'British and French, and primarily the British' responsible. The senator's remarks reflected indignation over last week's refusal by European members of Nato to back a US plan to strengthen Bihac, a stronghold of the Bosnian government, using Nato air power. In Sarajevo, the UN said Bosnian authorities had accepted its latest proposal for a ceasefire in Bihac, where the Serbs have almost encircled government positions and encroached on a 'safe area' notionally protected by UN resolutions. UN officials said fighting continued over the weekend on the southern and south-western outskirts of Bihac. They also reported a large explosion at the Bosnian army's Bihac headquarters, apparently triggered by the government forces before they withdrew. The vulnerability of the UN's 24,000-member force in Bosnia was underlined yesterday when it emerged that up to 400 peacekeepers were being detained in Serb-controlled territory. UN officials said last night they were trying to ascertain the whereabouts of more than 100 Dutch and 62 British soldiers who appeared to have been stopped at Serb checkpoints. About 250 peacekeepers were detained last week after Nato launched air strikes on Serb positions in Croatia and Bosnia. Mr Jovan Zametica, a senior Bosnian Serb official, described the incidents as an 'unfortunate misunderstanding' and hinted that the peacekeeping troops might be handed back their freedom of movement. Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, yesterday conceded that the Serbs had, in effect, won the war in Bosnia. In remarks that reflected European concerns and differed sharply from Senator Dole, he said lifting the arms embargo could stoke the war, and expressed doubt over a military solution in Bosnia. Amid growing signs of disarray over Bosnian policy in the main western capitals, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said he had 'successful and very useful' talks in Belgrade with Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. He said Mr Milosevic was working for a ceasefire in Bihac and throughout Bosnia. Mr Perry said he was not prepared to recommend the deployment of the hundreds of thousands of US troops necessary to reverse the tide of the war. He said he sent 2,000 US Marines to the Adriatic on Friday 'for contingency purposes'. Heargued that Nato had done whatever it had been asked to do, and blamed the UN for the absence of more vigorous action. US and Russia square off over security, Page 2</p>

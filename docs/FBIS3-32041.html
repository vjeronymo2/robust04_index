Such consultation is specifically related to the  "Regulations  on Fuels and Fuel Additives -- Rules for Improved and  Conventional Gasoline," which the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency adopted last 15 December. For Venezuela, this regulation  clearly violates GATT provisions, because it places controls on  imported gasoline different from those placed on U.S. gasoline.    By bringing this issue up with GATT, Miguel Rodriguez  Mendoza, minister-president of the Foreign Trade Institute  [ICE], explained that this is "a matter of great importance for  Venezuela and a matter that requires special attention because,  once more, we are faced with the use of environmental  regulations with disguised protectionist intentions."    Meanwhile, Rodriguez noted the discriminatory character of  the aforementioned regulation and the adverse effects it will  have on the export of improved gasoline to the U.S. market.    According to preliminary estimates, approximately 50 percent  of the export volume of Venezuelan improved gasoline will be  affected by that measure, causing an economic impact for  Venezuela to the tune of $150 million over a two-year period.    Rodriguez also referred to the modernization program of  Venezuelan refining plants that the national petroleum industry  has undertaken with a view to adjusting to the new environmental  demands, which contemplates investments of over $1 billion.    The ICE president presented the aforementioned petition to  the 49th Session of GATT Contracting Parties, the highest body  of that organization held in Geneva, Switzerland, on 25 and 26  January. According to GATT procedures, consultation must begin  by 14 February at the latest, namely 30 days after the request  is presented. Additionally, there is a 60-day term for  processing said request.    The statements by Rodriguez regarding the ties between trade  and the ecology were also addressed by B.K. Zutshi of India,  president of the meeting, who in his opening speech warned of  the need to prevent the conservation of the environment from  becoming a new form of commercial protectionism.</p>

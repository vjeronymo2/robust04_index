			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM INVESTIGATION IS URGED;  </P> <P> POLITICS: TWO FEUDING STATE OFFICIALS HAVE ASKED A TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY  TO CHECK INTO POSSIBLE FRAUD IN THE RETURN OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS.  </P> <P> A top-level law enforcement official disclosed Friday that two feuding state  officials have separately asked for investigations of payments made to  businesses they suspect of defrauding the California beverage container  recycling program.  </P> <P> Whitt Murray, acting chief of the Department of Justice's bureau of  investigations, said the investigations of suspected fraud by recyclers were  requested by state Controller Gray Davis and Director of Conservation Randall  M. Ward.  </P> <P> "I'm looking at all the materials gathered by both the agencies and trying to  determine what the focus of my investigation will be," Murray said in an  interview.  </P> <P> He refused to identify the "targets" named by Davis and Ward, and he would not  estimate how much time the investigations would take to complete. He said,  however, there was "some overlap" of the cases submitted to him.  </P> <P> Likewise, he refused to say whether the cases involved businesses that Davis  charged in an audit report had improperly received more than $12 million in  state funds from the recycling program over the last year. Ward maintains that  Davis provided no evidence for the allegation.  </P> <P> Murray indicated that while he knew both the state controller and the  Department of Conservation have been looking into potentially improper payments  to some recyclers in the redeemable beer and soft drink container program,  Davis' request for an investigation came "most recently."  </P> <P> The disclosure that the state Justice Department, headed by Atty. Gen. John K.  Van de Kamp, has received requests for criminal investigations seemed to  indicate an intensified resolve to root out recyclers suspected of cheating the  22-month-old program.  </P> <P> Virtually from the outset, the penny-per-container program has been the target  of some recyclers who seek to collect the penny on beverage containers smuggled  from out of state that are not redeemable in California. In addition to the  penny from a special $120-million state fund, they are paid by processors for  the scrap value of reusable glass, aluminum and plastic.  </P> <P> Under the self-financing program, distributors of beer and soda pop pay a penny  into the fund for each redeemable container. That penny is, in effect, added to  the cost of the beverage at the checkout stand. Consumers, in turn, can return  the container to the recycler and be paid a penny for each.  </P> <P> Davis, a politically ambitious Democrat who is a potential gubernatorial  candidate, called a press conference Friday to formally release the previously  leaked audit report that accused the Department of Conservation of mismanaging  fiscal controls and paying out funds without proper documentation.  </P> <P> Davis, while insisting that "I don't want any credit" for exposing the alleged  abuses, demanded that Ward immediately "tighten" fiscal controls before actual  payment to recyclers is made. The department now relies heavily on post-payment  audits to discover wrongdoing, much as the Internal Revenue Service does with  income tax returns.  </P> <P> Davis charged that unless the Deukmejian Administration's department takes  remedial action, such as beefed-up prepayment controls, the agency "will turn  this important effort into an industrial welfare program for unscrupulous  recyclers."  </P> <P> "We do have fairly serious prepayment controls," Ward retorted at a separate  press conference later.  </P> <P> He conceded that there are "fraudulent claims, absolutely. We recognize there  is a problem." But he insisted that his agency is vigilant in guarding against  payment of such claims and if the controller "has information regarding  fraudulent activity, give it to us."  </P> <P> Ward said he did not understand Davis' motivations for holding a press  conference to announce the audit report before Ward had an opportunity to  prepare a response, but rhetorically asked, "I'm not sure, but is there an  election year coming up here?"  </P></p>

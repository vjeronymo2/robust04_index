			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Allied forces expand presence in north Iraq ALLIED forces expanded their military presence in northern Iraq yesterday as Britain's proposal for the United Nations to send its own police units to protect thousands of returning Kurdish refugees appeared to gather more support. UN diplomats said a letter from Mr John Major, the British prime minister, was delivered to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who discussed the plan with Sir David Hannay, Britain's UN representative, and other western delegates. A UN source said he saw merit in the police force proposal and felt it could be carried out, possibly without need for a formal Security Council resolution. There were conflicting reports about the exact contents of the letter, with reports in London that Mr Major had been critical of the UN's 'tardy' approach to the relief effort. The UN, however, said last night that the letter had not been critical and had been supportive of the secretary-general's efforts. While diplomatic manoeuvres continued, allied military vehicles were seen carrying Kurdish refugee women and children from Isikveren camp on the Turkish-Iraqi border through Kurdish guerrilla checkpoints towards the so-called 'safe haven' on the edge of the northern town of Zakho, where UN officials hoisted their blue-and-white flag yesterday. British Chinook helicopters landed companies of Royal Marines on hilltops near the village of Kani Masi, about 90km east of Zakho, while Dutch and US troops secured bridges and mountain tracks. The second phase of the repatriation operation, expected today, involves allied troops establishing a perimeter around the refugee sanctuary. Until Monday evening Kurdish guerrillas had prevented most refugees from leaving their mountain camps for the allied zone in Iraq, saying that they wanted to be assured of the refugees' safety. Western diplomats at the UN in New York yesterday emphasised their view that the secretary-general had adequate authority to deploy UN civilian police in the area. The Soviet Union and China, the other permanent members of the Security Council, were described as 'not negative' to Britain's suggestion.</p>

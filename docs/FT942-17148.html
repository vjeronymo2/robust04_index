			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (3): An economic strategy - Profile of the SDEP No one who drives along the causeway which runs from Weymouth, past the pebbles of Chesil Beach, to the Isle of Portland can fail to be aware of the military history. On the east side is the naval base with its huge harbour, enclosed by Victorian breakwaters. On the densely-populated limestone lump of an island, scarred by quarries and with a 16th century castle, is the Defence Research Agency and the Sea Systems Controllerate. Nowhere in Dorset is the consequence of the peace dividend more acutely felt. The naval base will close in 1996 and, next year, the DRA Underwater Systems division is moving 500 staff to the Atomic Energy Authority Technology site at Winfrith. There will be redundancies among its support services at Portland. The SSC is due to relocate much further away to Bristol. Nearly half the jobs in the Weymouth and Portland borough are estimated to be defence-related. They are vulnerable not only to the military retrenchment but to the cutbacks in the defence budget affecting many local contractors. In 1984, the travel-to-work area ranked 235th out of 321 in Britain in terms of unemployment. By mid-1992 it had risen to 132nd. It has been estimated the imminent Portland closures and relocations could result in the permanent loss of a further 5,000 jobs. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, gave a stark warning in a report published in December 1992: 'Unless proactive steps are taken, economic and employment difficulties in the area are set to become the most intractable in England in the mid-1990s.' The report, An Inward Investment Strategy for South Dorset, proposed a South Dorset Economic Partnership (SDEP) to co-ordinate an economic strategy, assist 'catalyst' projects and market the area. This partnership is now established, supported by local authorities, Dorset Training and Enterprise Council, Rural Development Commission, Dorset Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and local companies such as Eldridge Pope, the brewers, and DEK Printing Machines. Mr Ray Coles, managing director of Ultra Electronics Ocean Systems, based in Weymouth, is chairman. An early success for south Dorset has been winning European Konver funding to assist areas suffering from the defence rundown. A grant of Pounds 366,000 will help with projects such as retraining and business advice centres. Another recognition of the difficulties is the granting of intermediate assisted area status. The first new business attracted in consequence is Edwards Medical, which won a Pounds 25,000 grant to open a Weymouth factory sterilising and packing medical products. Dorset, however, failed last December to win European Objective 2 status, which would have given access to funds to improve the infrastructure. The county council regards improvements to roads in the Weymouth area as a high priority, although its plans have met with local opposition. Better road access was described as vital by Drivers Jonas, the planning consultancy, in a report published in January on the potential use of Portland harbour once it is released by the Ministry of Defence. Drivers Jonas said the new uses should contribute to the maintainance of the breakwaters, which costs Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000 a year. But the main limiting factor, it said, was that only 32 acres of land would be available for development. One industrial scheme has been proposed by Roil (UK) for a marine waste and oil recycling project. Interest in the harbour from tourism and leisure operators, Drivers Jonas reported, had so far been muted. Leisure and tourism is one sector which holds out the promise of more jobs in Weymouth - which has a handsome sea front and a charming if undervalued inner harbour - and a tourism development action programme has been set in train. In the present climate for inward investment, attracting new businesses will not be easy, although New Look, the fashion store chain, has chosen to be based in Weymouth. Mr Peter Wheelhouse, SDEP's development director, sees the release of high-quality skills by the defence cutbacks as providing a pool of quality labour. Mr Coles emphasises a further asset for inward investors relocating staff: 'We are surrounded by the most fantastic natural and man-made beauty.' His own company, a management buy-out from Dowty Group specialising in underwater towed sonars, is an example of how defence-related companies are diversifying. 'We've had to tighten our belts significantly. We had a Pounds 10m turnover in 1990 but since then a 25 to 30 per cent reduction. 'We embarked on a product strategy - we decided to be pro-active so that, when the ramping-down in spending started, we had somewhere to go.' Ultra Electronics has developed the hardware for colour printing identity cards, and the use of sonars for mapping seabeds for the oil and telecommunications industries. 'We find that from being in very cold water, our skills are now much sought after.' The DRA itself, even before its move to Winfrith, is also diversifying into civilian markets. Mr David Kimberley, director of Underwater Systems, says there has been an assumption that all its work is secret. 'But we are very keen to exploit the skills we have - as a partner or a sub-contractor - for non-defence activity.' DRA has the technology and techniques, he says, for a whole range of industrial underwater activity ranging from remote-controlled vehicles to image processing. And it does not have to confine itself to the oceans. An example he gives of the DRA's amphibian approach is to adapt its expertise in muffling submarines to cutting the noise of wind farm turbines. On a similarly forward-looking note, Mr Wheelhouse points to the optimistic aspects of the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report. It concluded that, if the SDEP could achieve its objectives, 'We believe that south Dorset's prospects for long-term growth must be seen as good.'</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (The Economy): Current account deficit 'to halve'  -Trade UK economic recoveries all too frequently run into the buffer of balance of payments constraints. There were plenty of people who forecast that the current recovery would end in tears, as rapid consumption growth sucked in imports and a weakened UK industrial base failed to compete in world export markets. However, the Treasury is now forecasting that the current account deficit, which was Pounds 10.3bn in 1993, will fall to Pounds 4bn in 1994 and to Pounds 3.5bn in 1995. This better performance, according to the Treasury, is due to the fact that the improvement in the UK's cost competitiveness, which followed sterling's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, has been largely maintained. The UK's cost competitiveness is estimated to be 10 per cent better than in the second quarter of 1992. With changes in UK unit labour costs predicted to be the same as those overseas, the UK's current level of competitiveness will be broadly maintained. UK manufacturing exports are forecast to grow by 9.5 per cent in 1994 and by 8 per cent in 1995. Next year, stronger growth in Europe is expected to replace weaker demand growth from North America. Meanwhile, import growth has been more subdued than would have been expected, given the pace of the recovery. Non-oil imports are expected to be 5.25 per cent higher in 1994 than in 1993 and to grow by 6 per cent next year. The balance of trade on visible goods is projected to move from a Pounds 13bn deficit in 1993 to a Pounds 9bn shortfall this year, and to Pounds 6.5bn in 1995. In addition, the surplus on invisible earnings is expected to improve from Pounds 3bn in 1993 to Pounds 5bn in 1994, before falling back to Pounds 3.5bn in 1995. Trade in oil has also contributed to the improvement, with the oil surplus more than doubling between 1993 and 1994.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Speculation mounts over Fed easing TRADERS in the US Treasury bond market will be glued to their video monitors this week as a raft of fresh economic data is expected to provide clues as to whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. The most important indicator will be the unemployment data to be released on Thursday, a day after the Fed's policy-making open market committee holds its monthly meeting. The FOMC meeting could be one of the more lively to be chaired in recent months by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman. Recent reports suggest that FOMC members are sharply divided over the need for further easing of monetary policy, with some persuaded that the current 3 3/4 per cent Federal funds target is sufficient to help the US economic recovery, and others convinced the recovery is faltering even more than has been apparent. If a decision to ease is made, it is nonetheless unlikely to come until after the release of the June employment data, which market watchers expect will show a rise of 50,000 non-farm jobs. Mr Greenspan and his colleagues will be acutely aware that they are deliberating in the political shadow of President Bush, who last week issued an unusually explicit call for the Fed to cut interest rates. Mr Robert Di Clemente, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the recent weakness of M2 money supply and other signals of a flagging recovery could well 'tilt the probabilities toward an eventual easing move,' perhaps before the Fed chairman delivers his mid-year report to Congress on July 21. The Salomon Brothers economist said, however, that he did not believe this Thursday's jobs data would be sufficiently conclusive to resolve the debate about the strength of the US recovery. Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, on Friday called for a minimum 50 basis point cut in both Fed funds and the discount rate 'in view of the increasing risk that the recovery is aborting'. Last week, as more data showed the fragility of the US economic recovery, the Treasury market staged something of a rally, boosting the price of the benchmark 30-year bond by nearly a full point, to 102 9/16 . This provided a yield of 7.77 per cent, down from 7.83 per cent a week earlier and the lowest yield level for more than a month. Last week's rally was fuelled by a 2.4 per cent fall in durable goods orders in May, the first monthly drop after four months of consecutive increases. Other indicators that showed the recovery to be flagging included a 1.8 per cent drop in sales of existing homes, the decline in M2 and a slight rise in initial claims for unemployment benefits by mid-June. Aside from the important jobs data, this week's diet of macro-economic figures will begin today with the release of new home sales for May, which could be slightly improved on April. Tomorrow brings the leading economic indicators for May, which are likely to be 0.7 per cent higher. Also to be unveiled tomorrow will be the latest consumer confidence measure, which could be slightly improved. Attention will also be focused on the National Association of Purchasing Managers index on Wednesday, which may well be unchanged on May.</p>

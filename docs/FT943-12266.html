			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Lucas dismisses investigation claims Lucas Industries, the UK-based engineering group, yesterday dismissed claims that it was under criminal investigation in the US for falsifying inspection of parts for commercial aircraft. A report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal caused Lucas's shares to fall from 198p to 183p when trading started in London, but they recovered to close at 193p following the denial. The Journal said US industry and law enforcement officials had told it Lucas was being investigated over serious quality control lapses involving devices that help move the flaps on Boeing's 767 twin-engine jets. Lucas said yesterday that through its own investigations, it had discovered that a small number of in-process visual inspections had not been conducted on the trailing-edge flap actuators supplied to Boeing. It added: 'However, final inspection and functional tests on computerised test-rigs, which determined the integrity of the products, were fully and successfully completed. After this discovery, Lucas voluntarily informed Boeing and, in accordance with Lucas compliance practice, the US government.' The UK group said it had taken disciplinary action against three employees, dismissing two of them. It added: 'Lucas performed analysis to confirm flight safety of the actuators. These indicated that the parts met all quality requirements and Boeing concurs. There were and are no quality problems on these products.' Boeing said: 'This appears to us as a process problem, and not a quality problem, that Lucas caught and fixed. We concur with Lucas that these parts meet all quality requirements and believe the product is absolutely safe.' Lucas said it had notified the US Justice Department of the problems at its Lucas Western plant at Park City, Utah, but was not aware of any active investigation by the department . In May Lucas confirmed that it was under investigation by the Pentagon for allegedly supplying gearboxes from the Utah Plant that fell below specified standards for the US Navy's F/A-18 fighter aircraft. It also recently agreed to pay Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) in the US to settle a dispute over the supply of unsatisfactory components for the Maverick air-to-ground missile. Lucas said yesterday it had made significant progress with its corrective action plan at the Utah factory, since discovery of the problem with the US Navy gearbox contract last year.</p>

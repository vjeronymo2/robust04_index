			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rebounds on rate hopes THE dollar rebounded on the foreign exchange markets yesterday in spite of a further batch of poor economic figures, recovering as buyers stepped in the ground lost on Wednesday, writes Simon London. During late trading in New York on Wednesday and overnight in the Far East, the dollar regained the losses seen in Europe. The US currency rallied to a high of DM1.6103 and Y125.95 in Tokyo, above the New York closing levels of DM1.6020 and Y125.75. Analysts pointed to statements by Mr Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, which were interpreted as meaning that another cut in interest rates is unlikely. The new optimism over rates inspired by Mr Greenspan's comments was briefly dispelled by the release of economic indicators underlining the weakness of the US economy. Durable goods orders during December were down a full 5 per cent on the previous month, following a 1 per cent rise in November. Excluding defence contracts, the position was worse still, with orders down 8.9 per cent on the month. Further gloom came from jobless claims figures for the week ended January 18, which showed a rise to 464,000 from the previous week's 440,000. The US currency dipped to a low of DM1.5975 shortly after the figures were released, but met with support at this level as buyers came into the market and traders moved to cover short positions. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6210, up a full three pfennigs from Wednesday's close of DM1.5900. It eased in New York to end at DM1.6163. Against the yen, the US unit was more stable, with the threat of intervention by the US and Japanese authorities capping it below Y126 for most of the day. The dollar closed at Y126.00 in London, having traded in a Y125.20 to Y126.00 range through the day. It dipped in New York to Y125.80. The D-Mark lost ground against the yen as well as the dollar, closing at Y77.75, from Y78.95 on Wednesday, and losing most of the gains made this week. Analysts said sentiment was weak ahead of today's announcement of the result of a strike ballot by steel workers. Against this, Mr Johan Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank board member, echoed statements from other central bank officials this week by saying that it was too early to expect a cut in German interest rates. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, the peseta remained the strongest currency and advanced against the D-Mark, breaking decisively through the Pta63.00 barrier. The Spanish currency closed the day at Pta62.88 against the German unit. This pushed sterling's floor within the system, determined by its maximum permitted divergence from the strongest currency, close to DM2.8700. The UK currency responded with a firm tone, trading over DM2.8750 for most of the day and closing in London at DM2.8775, from DM2.8725 on Wednesday.</p>

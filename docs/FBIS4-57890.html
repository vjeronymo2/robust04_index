			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Carlos Menem to open the Constituent </F> Assembly in the 3 February Theater in Parana, Entre Rios  Province -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In 1973, on the occasion of  announcing the three-year plan, General Juan Domingo Peron  maintained that the aspirations projected for the 21st century  will have to be written into a new constitution through  constitutional reform.    The opportunity emerges from the political context of the  current sociological and political situation and from the  capability of attaining the difficult forging of a  constitutional consensus. This consensus emerged in 1994. It  would not have been possible to arrive at this consensus without  the preceding 10 years of democracy.    This honorable Constituent Assembly is the epitome of that  democracy, and it will be the point of no return between the  Argentina of fundamental disagreements and the Argentina of  definite agreements.    History has taught us that basic agreements are the major  force behind the progress of institutions, while fundamental  disagreements have led to periods of deterioration or regression.    We can affirm that a system's political stability is  directly  proportional to the degree of agreement reached by its political  and social forces. The degree of this agreement is what we will  write into this reform, and history will be implacable when  judging certain achievements or errors.    This honorable assembly has been convened on the basis of a  popular mandate, a popular mandate that became more and more  consolidated during the past decade, and it now has been given  the opportunity of changing history, of making us a participant  in the most important pages of that history. The opportunity  arises today and we cannot overlook it.    Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: You have been elected  by the Argentine people to reform and bring up to date the law  of laws in order to unfold the reform's contents. You have been  elected by the people to consolidate, through an enlightened  debate, a debate of ideas, the values of freedom and the  instruments of democracy. You have been elected as protagonists  of a time in which history is being written, a time of  institutionalization, and I repeat: a most important time of  institutionalization in this century.    But you have not been elected to think about present times,  to remain standing in this historical time, nor have you been  elected to think about this century. You have been elected to  think of the future, to think of the Argentina of the 21st  century, to give the state the necessary judicial and  institutional instruments with which it can thrive in the times  we are living and in the times in which we will have to live.    History will judge your responsibility. If you succeed in  your performance, if you can place the interests of the  fatherland above and beyond any other type of motivation, and if  you overcome current disagreements by placing the common welfare  in the forefront, then the future will look upon you with the  same pride and respect with which today we look upon the  constituent members of 1853.    I do not doubt that this will be so. I do not doubt that  each and every one of you have alighted on the banks of the  Parana River, on this river that is a witness to heroic actions  like that of the Vuelta de Obligado, and are aware of your  responsibility, of the responsibility given you by 35 million  Argentines.    I know that on this side of the river, you will be  illuminated by the spirit of Pancho Ramirez. I know that on the  other side is the remembrance of Estanislao Lopez. Due to their  passion for federalism, both of these caudillos were fundamental  pieces in the building of Argentina.    The people hope and confide in the revival of that patriotic  spirit. They hope the democratic system will be consolidated  with this reform and the balance between the powers of state  will be perfected; that the organization and functioning of  justice be strengthened; that the organs of control be  strengthened; that the federal system be strengthened to enhance  the economic development and progress of the provinces and  regions; that Latin American and continental integration be  favored. They hope, and they have faith, in the debate on the  points that have been approved by Congress for this honorable  assembly. They hope a consensus will emerge that will be the  noblest of our juridical and political culture.    Messrs. Constituent Assembly members: As president of the  Argentine nation and in the name of the people I represent and  to whom I must respond, I wish to thank all the political  parties that, above and beyond the position each of them defends  regarding the reform, made possible the creation of this  honorable assembly.    I wish to thank each of you for the civic courage you  demonstrated when you assumed such an important historical  responsibility, with the certainty that you will rise to the  occasion.    If the current reform process concludes successfully, then  the future development of the new institutions and the best  balances of power will bury the last vestiges of our historical  disagreements.    It up to this honorable assembly, it is up to you Messrs.  Assembly members to provide an adequate framework for  Argentina's entry into the 21st century.    Now, I can only ask, as politician and Gen. Justo Jose de  Urquiza did, that the light of heaven and your love for the  fatherland illuminate you. God bless you. Thank you very much.  [applause]</p>

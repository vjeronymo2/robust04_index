			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 40m missing from AGB pension fund ABOUT Pounds 40m is missing from the AGB Pension Scheme. This was confirmed by Clay &amp; Partners, the pension fund trustee which is winding up four private Maxwell pension funds. Mr Alan Fishman of Clay said that the fund for the employees and management of AGB Research, the market research company, would have access to about Pounds 20m in assets. There should have been more than Pounds 60m. About Pounds 8m is in the form of assets managed by two external investment managers, Invesco MIM and Legal &amp; General and is seen as secure and readily available. An estimated Pounds 12m is held in the Maxwell Common Investment Fund managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management, but may not be available for months or even years. Mr Fishman believed it would take Pounds 16m to meet the entitlements of the AGB fund pensioners, Pounds 23m for remaining members and a further Pounds 14m for bulk transfers covering groups of people who have moved because of restructuring or sale of a division. If pensioners had first priority they would be likely to get their payments in full but the benefits of those still working would be cut substantially. If the courts decided that the bulk transfer payments should be made ahead of pensioners the position would be very different. 'In this case, current pensions will have to be cut back and the remaining members will receive no benefits,' Mr Fishman warned yesterday in a letter to fund members. The detailed breakdown of likely assets of the private pension funds comes in the wake of last week's announcement from Robson Rhodes, provisional liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, that Pounds 237m had been recovered out of the Pounds 695m sought. Mr Fishman found that the circumstances of the individual private Maxwell funds varied. About Pounds 2.3m has been recovered of the Pounds 3.2m assets of the Maxwell Media Pension Plan. This means that current pensions are likely to be met in full although the benefits of remaining members will be significantly cut. The Headington Pension Plan, however, has a holding of about Pounds 1.8m, instead of the Pounds 11m. In this case there is not enough money to cover payments to pensioners, unless other assets are recovered. Mr Kevin Maxwell is to be forced to answer questions from the receiver of Adviser (188), the family company which began the collapse of the Maxwell empire when it defaulted in December last year on a Pounds 56m loan from the Swiss Bank Corporation.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Demand for floorspace increases A sharp increase in demand from industrial companies has reduced the amount of empty industrial floorspace for the first time since May 1989. A survey by King Sturge, chartered surveyors, shows that the amount of available industrial space fell by 1 per cent to 180.5m sq ft in the last four months of 1993. It records a 60 per cent increase in inquiries from potential tenants and buyers in 1993 compared with 1992. The amount of available space has fluctuated sharply over the last 10 years. The long economic upturn in the 1980s reduced supply from its 1983 peak of 177.61m sq ft to a low of 73.17m sq ft in May 1989. It then rose rapidly to peak at 182.17m sq ft last September. In spite of the generally positive findings of the survey, some parts of the country continue to show increasing availability of property, albeit at a declining rate. In southern England, only Greater London registered a fall in availability, while East Anglia, the south-west and the rest of the the south-east registered rises. There were sharp decreases in the availability of industrial premises in Wales, the Midlands and much of northern England, with the exception of the north-west. The survey says the availability of new buildings has fallen sharply by 2.3m sq ft to 16.92m sq ft, which represents 9 per cent of total industrial floorspace. This decline is attributed to the combination of improving demand, coupled with continuing low levels of speculative construction. The survey, conducted last December, covers buildings of more than 5,000 sq ft. It excludes derelict property and that which is unsuitable for refurbishment.</p>

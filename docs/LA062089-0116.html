			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: KEATING SIGNS WITH TIGERS, WILL SKIP FOOTBALL  </P> <P> David Keating, the No. 3 receiver last fall for UCLA's football team, signed a  professional baseball contract with the Detroit Tigers and will skip his senior  football season.  </P> <P> "Since I've decided to make baseball my career, I figured it was time to  concentrate solely on that and give that 100% of my effort," Keating said  Monday. He caught 23 passes for 341 yards and five touchdowns last season.  </P> <P> Keating, 21, batted .266 in 52 games this spring for the UCLA baseball team,  with six home runs and 24 runs batted in.  </P> <P> Considered to be an exceptional center fielder, he was a fifth-round draft  choice of the Tigers, who assigned him to their Class-A New York-Penn League  affiliate at Niagara Falls, N.Y. He is expected to report in time for the  Rapids' game tonight against the St. Catharines (Canada) Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Keating, who probably would have been a reserve receiver again this fall behind  starters Mike Farr and Reggie Moore, said he didn't believe that he had a  future in professional football.  </P> <P> "I don't think I could have accomplished much more in football," he said.  </P> <P> Still, he contemplated a return to UCLA this fall.  </P> <P> "I went back and forth," he said. "Then, (the Tigers) came back and gave me a  little more money and guaranteed (they would send me to) instructional league.  They showed they were going to take the time to work with me. That was the  deciding factor."  </P></p>

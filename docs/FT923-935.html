			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Letter: New orthodoxy on devaluation Sir, A new orthodoxy seems to be developing. This suggests that, because of the slack in the world economy, competitive pressures will stop us having to pay the normal inflationary consequences of devaluation. Only time will show whether this is true. However, if it is, then presumably we will also fail to reap the export benefits that would otherwise be associated with a lower value of the pound.

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Australian deficit worsens THE Australian dollar fell more than half a cent to 68.3 US cents yesterday after the release of balance of payments figures showing a significant deterioration in the current account deficit in October. The government said the unadjusted deficit was just over ADollars 2bn (Pounds 903m), compared to ADollars 1.7bn in September. The seasonally adjusted deficit rose by 19 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn, the highest since January 1990. The trend estimate, which irons out swings in the seasonally adjusted figures, increased by 5 per cent to ADollars 1.5bn. This was the highest since March 1990, and the ninth successive monthly rise. The main cause of the deficit's rise was an 11 per cent fall in exports, which was only partly offset by a 4 per cent import fall. The underlying import trend was a record high for the second month running. A 13 per cent devaluation of the trade weighted value of the Australian dollar over the last 12 months appears to be having little impact on exports.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREP PLAYER DIES OF ENLARGED HEART  </P> <P> Weston Hatch, a basketball star at Fremont School in Oakland who collapsed and  died during a scrimmage, suffered an enlarged heart, according to the Alameda  County Coroner's office.  </P> <P> The condition, known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, happens when the heart  muscle gets so big that the vessels are unable to supply enough blood to the  heart and heart muscles, said coroner's spokesman Lt. Duane Gull.  </P> <P> Hatch, a senior, had just scored on a dunk in Wednesday's game and was heading  to the other end of the court when he fell face first on to the court. A school  nurse attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation before paramedics rushed Hatch to  Highland Hospital.  </P> <P> He was pronounced dead on arrival.  </P> <P> The high school campus was closed Thursday morning as students mourned the  death.  </P> <P> Hatch, a 6-foot-6 center, was a first team All-Oakland Athletic League player  who averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds a game.  </P></p>

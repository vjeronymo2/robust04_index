			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 3  May.    Finexpo (Venezuelan Fund for Export Financing) has reported  the credits it has granted, through financial institutions in  the importing countries, have had a substantial increase in the  first three months of the year. It financed 113 export  operations between January and March 1994, versus 75 in the same  period last year. The amount of credits also increased by more  than $11 million from January to March 1993 to almost $22  million during the same period of 1994. The lines of credit have  been used primarily by financial institutions in Ecuador (9),  Colombia (22), Peru (7), Chile (4), Bolivia (2), Argentina (2),  Mexico (3), and Paraguay (2). Finexpo Vice President Policarpo  Rodriguez has asserted he is still waiting for the Venezuelan  Investment Fund to approve a new line of credit for $90 million,  $80 million to be allotted to mid- and long-term operations and  $10 million to the Fund for the Special Political Risk  Insurance. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 29 Apr 94  p 20)    Norys Aguirre, the newly appointed president of the Deposit  Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund (Fogade) has met with  economic media representatives for the first time today and told  them the public credit law will be the legal instrument to  obtain the necessary economic resources to recapitalize the  private banks subsidized by Fogade.

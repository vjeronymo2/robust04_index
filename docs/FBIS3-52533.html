Dr. Ni'matallah said  that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid accepted his resignation as of 1 January.    Dr. Ni'matallah noted that he had undergone very serious  surgery and that the doctors told him to rest for a long time.  He denied that differences are behind his resignation. He  noted that Saudi Arabia is expected to name a person to serve  the remainder of his term, which is one-and-a-half years. He  stressed that, because of his health condition, he will not  assume any official position when he returns to Saudi Arabia.    Dr. Ni'matallah wished the Arab League success in its  difficult tasks so that the Arab nation can find a suitable  place on the world map.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid has instructed 'Ali 'Abd-al-Karim, Arab  League assistant secretary general for internal supervision, to  temporarily direct the League's Economic Affairs Department  until a candidate is named.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> 76ERS PULL OUT A 117-115 VICTORY OVER CELTICS  </P> <P> Nobody wants to play the Detroit Pistons in the best-of-five series that opens  the playoffs in the National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> The Pistons aren't just the team with the best record in the league, they are  the team coming up to the playoffs with the most momentum.  </P> <P> In the first round the Pistons figure to play either Philadelphia or Boston.  </P> <P> That's one of the reasons why the 76ers and Celtics engaged in a playoff-type  game Tuesday night at Philadelphia. The team that finishes with the seventh  best record in the East plays New York.  </P> <P> The Celtics, who went into the game 1 1/2 games behind the 76ers, have a poor  road record and were without injured Kevin McHale, but it still took the best  of Charles Barkley for the 76ers to pull out a 117-115 overtime victory.  </P> <P> Barkley had 27 points, 12 rebounds and three steals in another superb  performance. He made a dunk with 27 seconds left in regulation to tie the  score, 102-102. Then, he made a free throw with 34 seconds left in the extra  period and it proved decisive, forcing Dennis Johnson to miss a free throw on  purpose with two seconds left.  </P> <P> The Celtics, who have played almost the entire season without their best  player, Larry Bird, now have McHale out with a foot injury.  </P> <P> Although they didn't win, the Celtics still have 14 games remaining and they  are playing better than the 76ers.  </P> <P> Especially encouraging is the play of youngsters Reggie Lewis and rookie Brian  Shaw. Lewis had a career-high 39 points, while Shaw, the 6-foot-6 guard from UC  Santa Barbara, had 18 points and 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> A rookie also was big for the 76ers. Hersey Hawkins had eight of his 21 points  in the five-minute overtime. His three-point basket with 1:24 left in overtime  gave the 76ers a four-point lead.  </P> <P> New Jersey 111, Atlanta 108 -- The Nets, beaten by Miami by 21 points Monday  night, turned on the Hawks in this game at East Rutherford, N.J., to end a  10-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Roy Hinson scored six of his 25 points in the last two minutes to give the  lowly Nets their first win against the Hawks after 16 consecutive defeats.  </P> <P> It was Hinson's 10-foot jumper with 14 seconds left that clinched the victory.  </P> <P> The stunning loss dropped the Hawks two games behind Chicago in the battle for  fourth place in the Central Division.  </P> <P> San Antonio 130, Washington 114 -- With a chance to close in on the Celtics in  their try for the final playoff spot in the East, the Bullets played one of  their poorest games.  </P> <P> Willie Anderson scored 29 points and Alvin Robertson 28 to lead the weak Spurs  to just their 19th victory in 69 games.  </P> <P> The Spurs went to the front early and seemed to get better after Coach Larry  Brown was ejected after picking up two technicals in the second quarter. They  soared to a 23-point lead in the third quarter before easing off.  </P> <P> Chicago 115, Golden State 106 -- Every time Michael Jordan sets a goal, he  accomplishes it. First, he decided to become a scoring champ and he did that  with ease.  </P> <P> Then last year he decided to become the best defensive player. He did.  </P> <P> After Bulls' Coach Doug Collins decided his team would be better with Jordan at  the point guard instead of the shooting guard, Jordan had a new goal -- -- to  become the best playmaker.  </P> <P> Although he's been at it for only 10 games, Jordan has already served notice to  John Stockton and Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> Jordan, in this game at Chicago, scored 33 points and has his second  consecutive triple-double as the Bulls won their fifth in a row. The previous  four were at the conclusion of a trip West.  </P> <P> Jordan had 12 rebounds and 11 assists as the Bulls handed the Warriors their  fourth consecutive defeat and seventh in a row on the road.  </P> <P> The Warriors built a 52-47 lead late in the third quarter but Horace Grant  scored on a turnaround jumper that ignited a 19-4 spurt that put the Bulls in  command.  </P> <P> New York 128, Portland 124 -- Mark Jackson, just recently returned after knee  surgery, had a triple-double at New York and Kiki Vandeweghe, in his first game  against his old mates, had 24 points to lead the Knicks.  </P> <P> Jackson had 21 of his 27 points in the second half to hold off the determined  Trail Blazers. He also had 10 rebounds and 12 assists.  </P> <P> Houston 120, Seattle 117 -- Akeem Olajuwon scored 17 of his 36 points in the  pivotal fourth quarter at Houston and the Rockets needed them all to hold off  the SuperSonics.  </P> <P> The other Rockets scored only seven points in the 12 minutes against the  Sonics.  </P> <P> Cleveland 102, Dallas 90 -- Almost every other team has been hammering the  hapless Mavericks lately, but the Cavaliers struggled for more than a half at  Richfield, Ohio before handing Dallas its 11th consecutive defeat.  </P> <P> Ron Harper saved them. He scored 15 of his points in a 26-11 spurt late in the  third quarter that broke open a close game. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

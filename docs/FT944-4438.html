			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Observer: Empowered? Fed up with journalists, market researchers, publishers and other undesirables badgering you? Why not take a leaf out of the book of octogenarian management guru Peter Drucker, who replies to correspondents (including the FT) with a pre-printed message that caters for most eventualities. Drucker 'greatly appreciates your kind interest, but is unable to: contribute articles or forewords; comment on manuscripts or books; take part in panels and symposia; join committees or boards of any kind; answer questionnaires; give interviews; and appear on radio or television'.</p>

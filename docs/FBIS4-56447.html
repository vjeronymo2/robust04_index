			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edward Chen] </F>   [Text] Managua, May 3 (CNA) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister  Ernesto Leal Sanchez Tuesday [3 May] reiterated his country's  firm support for the Republic of China's [ROC] bid to return to  the United Nations [UN] .    Speaking at a news conference for the ROC press corps in  advance of President Li Teng-hui's visit, Leal said that the  international community can not deny the economic strength of  the ROC and its huge foreign currency reserves.    He stressed that the road back to the UN will be difficult  and fraught with obstacles, but the UN cannot continue to ignore  the rights of the more than 21 million Chinese people living in  Taiwan.    Leal also said that Nicaragua will strengthen its relations  with other Asia-Pacific nations, and use the ROC to help in its  efforts. The ROC left the UN in 1971 after Beijing assumed the  China seat.</p>

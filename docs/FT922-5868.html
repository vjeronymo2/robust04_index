			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Serbs face EC trade curbs as 16 die in Sarajevo THE 12 European Community countries yesterday agreed to impose a trade embargo on Serbia and are asking the United Nations to impose similar sanctions as well as an oil and financial embargo. The EC move coincided with new bloodshed in Sarajevo, besieged capital of the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Shells fired from Serb militia positions in hills above the city killed 16 people and wounded 110 as they queued for bread. Ms Envera Selimovic, a journalist for Bosnian radio, said: 'It was horrible, unimaginable. There were people lying wounded and missing arms and legs. The street was a river of blood.' Bosnian leaders later called on citizens to rise up in defence of the republic, and Belgrade radio and TV last night reported Moslem attacks on Serb-dominated federal forces at their barracks and at the airport in Sarajevo. The sanctions agreement in Brussels was milder than sought by Mr John Major, who was in Prague on a central European tour. The prime minister wanted an even tougher EC line against Serbia in protest at Belgrade's failure to stop Serbian attacks in Bosnia. British officials said, however, that after the Sarajevo shelling, EC countries resolved to put the issue of an oil embargo and an assets freeze on the UN agenda. EC ambassadors in Brussels agreed to freeze arrangements for national export credits and scientific co-operation with Serbia and its ally, Montenegro. The ambassadors agreed to ask the UN Security Council to adopt a similar trade embargo to the EC and to examine the possibility of a UN-sanctioned oil embargo. They also proposed a UN freeze on Serbian and Montenegrin assets abroad, as well as a UN ban on financial transactions with Serbia and Montenegro. France initially resisted a call for an oil embargo and successfully argued that Community sanctions should not extend to air links, because these might be useful for humanitarian aid. In New York, Security Council delegates said they expected a UN sanctions decision within days. Sir David Hannay, the British delegate, declined to disclose details of a possible resolution except to say that an oil embargo was 'obviously one of the measures under consideration'. He seemed to imply that oil might be excluded initially when he added that sanctions could be adopted in two stages. Other diplomats said the UN was not likely to impose an oil embargo immediately as Russia and China were hesitating. UN sources said civil aviation, trade and possibly sports contacts would be the first areas to be covered under the terms of chapter Vll of the Union charter, which would make them mandatory on all UN member states. The EC trade embargo applies to all goods except oil. Services such as air transport are also excluded. Germany and Italy have already denied landing rights to JAT, the Belgrade-based airline. UEFA, the governing body of European football, is expected to drop Yugoslavia from next month's European championship competition, AP reports from Stockholm. Ban may aid Milosevic, Page 2</p>

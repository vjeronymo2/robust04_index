			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Dudek: "The Uncertainties of U.S. </F> Foreign Policy"]    [Text] U.S. foreign policy decisions concerning the  politically stable European countries (including the Czech  Republic) are made at the so-called lower government level. The  decisions unfold in the "iron triangle": the Department of  Department--special-interest groups--Congress.    Every change of personnel among the leading officials in a  U.S. department is, therefore, a change worthy of note. Among  the most recent and most surprising changes is the resignation,  announced last week, of Assistant Secretary for European Affairs  Stephen Oxman.    "The erroneous impression is often formed in Europe that  U.S.  foreign policy is purely a matter for the president," said  Andrew Steigman, a political scientist and veteran of U.S.  diplomacy, in Prague yesterday. "Nothing is further from the  truth," pointed out the former diplomat.    The news of Oxman's resignation also attracted attention  because it was announced at the same time that Jennone Walker, a  specialist on Europe, is to leave the National Security  Committee in the White House. They will both be replaced by  experienced diplomats. Richard Holbrooke, until now ambassador  in Germany, is to replace Oxman, and Alexander Vershbow is to go  into the White House in place of Walker.    It is of interest to the Czech Republic that Jennone Walker  has been offered the post of ambassador to Prague. Walker,  whose appointment has still to be confirmed by the Senate, has  so far not denied this report. It is supported by at least one  Prague diplomatic source. If no problems crop up--and none are  envisaged--Walker should take over at the Prague embassy at the  beginning of next summer. This will hardly be to the general  delight of current Ambassador Adrian Basora.    Why are Oxman and Walker going? According to Washington  sources, definitely not because serious professional  shortcomings could be attributed to them. The reason is more  likely to be an attempt by Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and President Clinton's security adviser (that is, the head of  the National Security Council), Anthony Lake, to take the edge  off the criticism that for an embarrassingly long time and  uncomfortably emphatically has been descending on them.    Christopher and Lake are apparently guilty of not having  managed to "instill sufficient confidence both at home and  abroad." The resignations of Oxman and Walker should presumably  act as a palliative for the weak reputation of the government  team entrusted with foreign policy.    Of course, in this connection, there is also speculation  about whether the changes could go even further. Until now,  Stephen Oxman was considered in Washington to be a man in an  "unshakable" position because he is a close friend of President  Clinton and has been since they were students together, and also  of Secretary Christopher, with whom he worked in Jimmy Carter's  administration.    If Oxman is resigning now, could Warren Christopher or  Anthony Lake be next? This is not out of the question in the  case of the somewhat colorless presidential adviser Lake. This  probably does not apply in the case of the seasoned Secretary of  State Christopher--at least, until the fall congressional  elections.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts: The women on top - A new generation of arts administrators Jennifer Page is to be the new chief executive of the Millennium Commission. She will have the pleasurable task of handing out over Pounds 1bn pounds of National Lottery money during the next six years to ensure that the millennium is well and truly celebrated. The current acting chief executive, Heather Wilkinson, becomes her deputy. Page is a good if rather surprising choice - good because in her previous incarnation, as chief executive of English Heritage, she was that rarity, someone able to work well with its chairman, the rumbustious Jocelyn Stevens; surprising because the commissioners dropped their first (male) chief executive because they considered he was too independently minded. Jennifer Page is no walk over. What is not surprising is that the commission should have turned to a woman to help master-mind the politically sensitive task of selecting which projects should qualify for millennium funding. Women are everywhere in the British arts and heritage worlds. Page will have frequent dealings with the director of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Georgina Naylor. She will also be in close contact with the secretary general of the Arts Council, Mary Allen. If Mary Allen is engaged, her deputy will stand in - Sue Hoyle. Mary Allen, who has spent the last few days deciding how to divide up the 1995-96 grant of Pounds 191.5m between the nation's arts companies, is the most powerful woman, if not person, in the arts. 'The issue of gender does not arise in the arts.' she maintains. 'Throughout my career the organisations I have worked with have been indifferent whether I was a man or a woman'. It does seem that, true to their liberal principles, the arts are blind to sexual differences. 'The fact that so many women are coming through is just a reflection that ten or 15 years ago women started to go into the arts as administrators.' says Mary Allen. They now account for over 70 per cent of the arts work-force and are in an excellent position to take advantage of the unprecedented boom in the arts industry of the last decade. No institution shows this impartiality more blatantly than the Arts Council. The head of dance is Hilary Carty; of music, Kathryn McDowell; of touring, Kate Devey; of the visual arts, Marjorie Allthorpe-Guyton; and of education, Maggie Semple. These are major jobs: the holders, most of whom have been appointed in the last year, are largely responsible for the health of their arts forms throughout the country. The power of women is not confined to London. Sue Harrison has just been given the task of sorting out the problems at North West Arts. There is another woman, Sue Robertson, running Southern Arts. And the Arts Council of Scotland is topped by Seona Reid. So far women have made their mark more as administrators rather than artistic directors, but this is changing. The largest recent theatre project, the West Yorkshire Playhouse, was entrusted to Jude Kelly and she has been successful enough to be considered a potential successor in 1997 to Richard Eyre at the Royal National Theatre. The current number two at the National is Genista McIntosh, and she, in her turn, is a possible choice for one of the biggest jobs in the arts, director of the Barbican - following on, of course, from yet another woman, Detta O'Cathain. Elsewhere in theatreland Ruth Mackenzie has built up a considerable reputation at the Nottingham Playhouse; Barbara Matthews runs the highly acclaimed Cheek by Jowl; Jenny Topper at Hampstead has produced a succession of West End transfers while Thelma Holt is a producer with an international reputation (as well as a seat on the Arts Council). Among the museums and galleries only Elizabeth Esteve-Coll at the Victoria &amp; Albert has risen to the very top, but among the more avant garde subsidised art galleries, women are everywhere - Julia Peyton-Jones at the Serpentine; Elizabeth-Anne McGregor at the Ikon in Birmingham; Catherine Lampert at Whitechapel; Jenny Lomax at Camden. They are in a good position to take over the big national institutions next time round. There is one area where women have lagged behind - music. Of course Sian Edwards is music director at the ENO, and Louise Honeyman (London Mozart Players) and Louise Badger (BBC Symphony) run orchestras, but music generally remains a masculine stronghold. Jennifer Edwards of the National Campaign for the Arts believes 'the contract nature of the music scene puts women off.' Those with children find the frenzied schedule of touring difficult. Of course the achievements of women in the arts are not without problems. Some feel that they have to be tougher than the men to impress their organisations and to stamp their will. Elizabeth Esteve-Coll struggled at the V &amp; A before her vision of a more accessible museum won through; Detta O'Cathain did wonders for the balance sheet at the Barbican but at the cost of a disaffected work force. And in the arts, people are everything. Despite the headline-hoggers, women are still used in the arts as cheap labour: their desire for a job in the arts, any job, is exploited. A 1990 survey suggested that almost 60 per cent of women in arts administration earned less than Pounds 12,000 a year. But perhaps these foot soldiers were right in thinking that getting a step on the ladder at least offers some chance of advancement. They have already contributed sufficient officers to ensure that the arts world reflects society more truly than most other industries: which is just as well, since one of the main duties of the arts is to hold a mirror up to our lives.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TRACK GROUP STRIPS JOHNSON OF WORLD RECORDS;  </P> <P> HIS 100-METER, 60-METER MARKS ERASED BECAUSE HE ADMITTED USING STEROIDS  </P> <P> Ben Johnson's name will be erased from track's record books because of drugs  that, officially, were not there.  </P> <P> The action came on a chaotic vote by the sport's ruling body that, officially,  was not taken.  </P> <P> The International Amateur Athletic Federation agreed Tuesday to strip Johnson  of his world records in the 100 meters and indoor 60 meters because of his  confession that he used steroids from 1981 on.  </P> <P> The marks will go to two Americans -- Carl Lewis in the 100, his first  individual world record, and Lee McRae in the 60.  </P> <P> Johnson, who lost his Olympic gold medal in the 100 last year after testing  positive for steroids, also will lose his world indoor and outdoor  championships from 1987 and various other world, regional and national titles  and medals, the IAAF said. Final action on those will be taken in several  months.  </P> <P> No ballot figures were available for the stripping measure, which took 3 1/2  hours of debate and two mysterious votes to resolve. It was a raucous meeting  that included charges of racism and ended with the opposition leader, Amadeo  Francis, stalking out of the hall in anger.  </P> <P> "It is a travesty of justice," Francis, a member of the IAAF's policy making  council from Puerto Rico, said.  </P> <P> The record changes take effect when the IAAF issues its annual world-records  list Jan. 1, 1990. But officials and fellow athletes said Johnson had been  stripped of much more.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, he's lost everything," Edwin Moses, the two-time Olympic hurdles  champion from the United States, said. "Everyone knows it."  </P> <P> Asked if titles and medals also would fall, John Holt, the federation's general  secretary, said the IAAF Council, its policy board, would "discuss the next  logical step" at its next meeting this winter.  </P> <P> Officially, the IAAF voted to take away world records from any athlete who  admits under oath or in writing to drug use.  </P> <P> Johnson, however, is the only record-holder in that position, having testified  at a Canadian government inquiry last June that he starting using drugs in 1981  and was taking massive doses in 1987, when he set the world records.  </P> <P> Other athletes, including American javelin thrower Dianne Williams and Canadian  hurdlers Mark McKoy and Anjela Issajenko, also have admitted drug use in sworn  testimony and face the loss of various titles and medals.  </P> <P> That Canadian hearing was called after Johnson tested positive for steroids at  the Olympics last summer and was stripped of his gold medal and world-record  time of 9.79 seconds. He passed doping tests after setting the remaining world  records of 9.83 second for the 100 at the world championships in Rome in August  1987 and 6.41 seconds in the 60 at the world indoor championships in  Indianapolis that February.  </P> <P> When the new lists come out, Carl Lewis of the United States will have the  100-meter record at 9.92 seconds, while countryman Lee McRae will have the  60-meter mark at 6.50.  </P> <P> The world-record stripping was part of a far-reaching anti-drug program adopted  by the IAAF, which also included worldwide out-of-competition doping tests and  the concept that one country can challenge the drug status of another's  athletes.  </P> <P> Those parts passed with no negative debate. Speaker after speaker pledged  support for ridding track and field of drugs.  </P> <P> But taking away records on an athlete's confession was another story.  </P> <P> Arne Ljungqvist, the head of the IAAF's medical committee, said admissions such  as Johnson's were as good as positive urine samples for finding drug cheats.  </P> <P> "The real solution will be a change of attitude," Ljungqvist said. "If we  continue and recognize results achieved by confessed drug takers, we can never  change the attitude. . . . It's a dirty area, a back-yard area, but we must get  rid of it."  </P> <P> Primo Nebiolo, the IAAF president who controlled the meeting with an iron hand,  said the sport had to adopt the revolutionary rule for its own protection.  </P> <P> "We started this fight and we must keep in the vanguard of people fighting  against doping," he said. "These are not proposals against anybody but  proposals to reinforce our fight, to reinforce our image."  </P> <P> At least three dozen delegates took the floor, with a large percentage -- led  by Johnson's home of Canada and his native Caribbean -- speaking out strongly  against stripping.  </P> <P> "What we are trying to do is to use one black individual to show the world we  mean business," said Vera Bird, from Antiqua. "We know there are others in the  same situation. How can we have two standards?"  </P> <P> Francis said all in the room were there because of their love of track. "It is  like motherhood and apple pie," he said.  </P> <P> But Francis added, "I have a conscience," and said it would be wrong to strip  Johnson because of the sprinter's statements under oath at the Canadian  inquiry.  </P> <P> "We may effectively be putting a muzzle on the mouths of athletes who want to  speak out about what is going on in the training rooms, in the locker rooms and  on the little islands," he said. The last reference was to Johnson's trips to  St. Kitts in early 1988, where he got steroid treatment for muscle injuries.  </P> <P> Nebiolo proposed an amendment decreasing the time that can elapse between drug  offense and admission from six to three years and called for a vote that the  IAAF said was on the entire drug package. There was desultory applause and  Nebiolo declared that the package was adopted.  </P> <P> An IAAF statement said the package had been accepted by acclamation.  </P> <P> Some delegates were outraged, saying they didn't know a vote was even being  taken.  </P> <P> "That was democracy -- didn't you see it?" said Cecil Smith, head of the  Ontario Track and Field Assn. "They must have had a clap-o-meter."  </P> <P> After the break, the arguments continued. Bird called for a formal vote,  "asking for some respect," but Nebiolo tried to put it off.  </P> <P> "I made a proposal and the answer was positive," he said. "We were not  different people then. We were all together."  </P> <P> Finally Britain's Robert Stinson, the federation's honorary treasurer,  commandeered the microphone and called for three formal votes -- one on all  drug matters except the record-stripping, one on the statute of limitations and  one on the record stripping itself.  </P> <P> The first part passed unanimously in the show of hands. The second saw 99  delegates vote to restore the doping-confession gap to six years. There was no  final vote on stripping records but Stinson said the outcome by that time had  been assured.  </P> <P> "If you voted for six-year retroactivity, you voted for the whole thing," he  said.  </P> <P> As the meeting moved to other business, Francis stormed off the stage and out  of the room, waving his hand in disgust in Nebiolo's direction.  </P> <P> "We have been under criticism for a long time, unjustly so, and we have to get  tough," Francis said. "But I think he could have gotten what he wanted by  following more normal parliamentary procedures."  </P> <P> Moses said the issue "was dealing with a political position," but one that was  necessary to take.  </P> <P> "We can't deny that a problem exists," he said. "We have to convince young kids  they don't have to load up on steroids to win."  </P> <P> Asked if there was a suspicion that other world record-holders were on drugs at  the time they set their marks, Moses replied: "Suspect, yes, but you can't  prove it. And that's the big issue."  </P></p>

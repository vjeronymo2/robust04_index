			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Beware of the overdraft trap INTEREST RATES are coming down, but in many cases overdraft interest charges have actually gone up in the last six to nine months. So now may be the time to look more critically at interest-bearing current accounts. Interest paid on balances in credit has fallen in quite a striking fashion. In July last year, Abbey National paid 6.25 per cent gross on all balances in credit. Today the figure is 4.5 per cent. Girobank paid a net 9 per cent in July; today it pays 6 per cent. As amounts to be earned from interest-bearing current accounts on balances shrink, it is surprising to see that quite a lot of large banks and building societies have actually raised their overdraft interest rates since last summer. This seems hard to justify, and holders of interest-bearing current accounts seem likely to be especially hard hit: the downside of these accounts is that overdraft charges, especially for unauthorised overdrafts, are generally higher than on the old non-interest bearing variety. The Woolwich Building Society, which has trimmed its overdraft rates, is a shining exception. Some of the large clearers do fairly well, too: Barclays and NatWest have held their authorised rates unchanged. Lloyds is planning to reduce its rates on Monday April 29. Most other large players in the market have increased their interest-rate charges since last summer, even though base rates have fallen. A more glaring injustice is hard to imagine. An unauthorised overdraft on Midland Orchard or First Direct will now cost you 38.1 per cent (up from 37.6 per cent last summer). Nationwide Anglia Building Society, with a charge of 39.2 per cent (36.8 per cent last summer) wins by a short head. Meanwhile, earnings from the accounts are likely to fall. 'All our interest-bearing accounts have been affected by the base rate moving down and the abolition of composite rate tax,' says a Lloyds Bank spokesman. Further falls in base rates will probably mean the attractions of interest-bearing accounts will be progressively reduced.</p>

The State of New Hampshire is not asserting jurisdiction over Indian land recognized by the United States government for the purpose of this notice.

The State has expressed this commitment in the narrative portion of its application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New Hampshire's program. EPA will make a final decision on approval of the State of New Hampshire's program and will give notice of the final determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria.

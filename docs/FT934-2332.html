			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (3): Good cause to cut some charges - Competition among the banks for charity accounts is hotting up The good commercial news for charities is that competition among the main banks for their accounts is hotting up. The less good news is that this has not - not yet - translated into free banking for all. But the competition is far from over. Last month, Girobank launched an aggressive campaign with the somewhat over-stated claim that the high street banks had effectively ended free banking for fund raisers, while the TSB started an account aimed at charities. Another bank has just carried out a direct mail exercise intended to entice at least some of the largest of the 15,000 charities away from their current banks. In August, the Co-operative bank produced two new accounts for charities. Lloyds has recently begun offering a 'treasurers account' aimed specifically at people running charities or clubs. Furthermore, after leaving its tariffs unchanged for some years, Midland is now planning to offer what it says will be a more competitive and 'pro-active' deal in January. Though the banks make little or no money from charities and clubs - indeed,they emphasise that their aim is not to make a profit out of good causes - the sector is so large that the main banks cannot afford not to be in it at all. Banks want their market share. To some banks, such as the TSB or the Co-operative, the sector is particularly important, either because of their background as a mutual institution or because of the particular style of banking they are selling. Midland is offering the new deal as part of its strategy of becoming a more 'community-based' bank. Unless the charity concerned is a large organisation, banks are unlikely to offer much in the way of sophisticated financial services. While some banks offer advice to people setting up or taking over small charities, most seem to feel that what most charities want is a 'no nonsense' cheque account, with perhaps a deposit account or some interest on the credit balance. The largest charities are treated very much as businesses, and the banks say that they accept that they should pay for the services they receive. Those services, and the charges they pay, are negotiable. Negotiation with a branch manager is also available to small charities or organisations to try to improve the deal being offered by the banks. So for small charities, free banking is available on the high street, but may involve some shopping around and hard bargaining. You also need a clear picture of how your organisation works: for example, whether it draws a lot of cheques, or is able to maintain a steady credit balance. You may well not have to be one of the (PIKE TO INSERT FIGURE) registered charities to benefit from banks' professed desire not to make a profit out of good causes. Other fund-raising activities or communal activities - such as Brownies, or the cricket club - can also qualify for almost all the ranges of accounts available for charities. Only the TSB, so far, has restricted its latest offer to registered charities, and even that may be widened over time. But the more controversial your cause, or the more purely social the organisation, the less flexible the bank is likely to prove if the terms for free banking in the account are not met. Banks generally make a sharp distinction between their charitable donations and their charitable banking: so should charities. The fact that your charity or cause has received some money from a local branch should not incline you to bank there unless it really offers you the best deal. On the other hand, if you have a bank manager involved in running your organisation, you have a good chance of getting a good deal from his or her bank. (If you have more than one, you may be able to run a competitive tender for who gets your business.) The right sort of account to get free banking will depend most heavily on the level of credits and amount of activity going through an account. Lloyds estimates that about 85 per cent of all charities and clubs carry out fewer than 10 transactions a month. This is fortunate for charities if they bank with Lloyds. The treasurers' account offers free banking and some interest if the number of withdrawals is lower than 10 a month, but after that the cost per withdrawal is Pounds 2.00. Other high street banks have similar limits on withdrawals: Midland currently offers free banking if in credit and fewer than 25 debit items a quarter, with a charge of 74p per item beyond that. Barclays has no published guidelines as such. It leaves to the discretion of managers whether or not they should charge (after the one year's free banking offered to all charities and clubs). For a good cause, the broad guidance to managers would be to provide free banking where there are up to about 15 transactions a quarter, although if a steady balance was maintained, then more transactions could occur before charging. At both Barclays and at the National Westminster bank, the prevailing emphasis is on the local manager's discretion, so the approach could vary even between different branches in the same town - another argument for shopping around. Nat West says that it tries to do no more than cover its costs, and estimates that, at current interest rates, Pounds 1000 in an account over the year would support about 100 entries through the account. All the banks emphasise the discretion of the local bank manager and the need for flexibility in this area. Unless a charity has been extremely badly run, a bank is unlikely to want to risk bad local publicity by charging for a slight over-stepping of the numbers of transactions, or a slight drop in a credit balance below the minimum level for a particular type of account. All this means that, quite apart from general reasons for change (such as a new treasurer taking over), it is worth ensuring that the inertia that affects many people's attitude towards their personal bank accounts does not apply to a bank account in the name of a charity.</p>

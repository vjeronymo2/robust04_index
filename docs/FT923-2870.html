			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Tthe ERM and Maastricht: Gloom spreads as Italy digests devaluation MONDAY'S burst of enthusiasm has given way to Tuesday's gloom on the Milan stock market as dealers and economists in Italy's business centre digest the effects of the lira devalution. The cause has been the bleaker perceptions of the move after some reflection. While industrialists caught in the vice of relatively high domestic cost rises and a fixed exchange rate may have gained temporary relief, economists are concerned that the devaluation should have been accompanied by firm action on cutting public spending. Mr Bruno Trentin, general secretary of the CGIL union federation, Italy's biggest, offered the most coherent criticism. Devaluation stemmed from 'the contradictory messages given by the government to the country and the markets, reducing the credibility of the defence of the lira in this situation, ' he said. 'It's all up to the government now. We're all waiting for them to show some determination,' said the chief economist of one of Italy's biggest banks. 'Having tasted blood once, the danger for the lira is that it could come under fire again very soon if the government doesn't show signs of getting to grips with cutting spending and raising revenue,' said the chief dealer at one big US bank. Prof Giuliano Amato's government has sprung a number of surprises, notably the planned privatisation of Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, the state-owned bank and engineering group respectively. But the last big attack on Italy's structural economic problems came last month, with the agreement between employers, unions and government to abolish the Scala Mobile wage indexation system. After appearing to rise above the party system in announcing the transformation of the four biggest state-owned groups into joint stock companies the government seems to have lost the initiative. 'They just seem to be reacting to events now, rather than taking matters in hand. Privatising Credito Italiano was the price demanded by the Bank of Italy for pushing up the discount rate earlier this month,' said one bank economist. Growing perceptions that the discount rate, at which the Bank of Italy lends to commercial banks, will not be cut soon has been one of the main factors behind the shift of sentiment on the bourse. Mr Luigi Abete, chairman of the Confindustria employers' federation, has called for a swift cut in interest rates, which he said were punishing Italian companies. Confindustria has estimated that devalution would raise domestic inflation, which was running at 5.3 per cent last month, by half a point. However, yesterday's renewed pressure on the lira suggests there is little sign of that happening, at least before Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht. Rates for securities repurchase agreements between the Bank of Italy and commercial banks, which fell to 16.06 per cent on Monday against 20.75 per cent at the previous bids last Wednesday, rose to 16.30 per cent yesterday. Meanwhile, share prices fell sharply, losing much of the ground made on Monday.</p>

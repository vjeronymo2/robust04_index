			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Businessmen back PM on team for India INDUSTRIALISTS yesterday endorsed the prime minister's decision to take senior businessmen on his India trip next week - a move described from Downing Street as part of efforts to create jobs and promote co-operation between Whitehall and industry. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who will be in the delegation, hailed the trip as symbolic while others said prime ministerial involvement could help speed decision-making in India. 'To find a bit of prime ministerial time spent on promoting exports in a very large but difficult market is something which cheers people up,' Mr Davies said. Businessmen from many of Britain's largest companies will accompany Mr Major, who is travelling at the invitation of the Indian government. Although not unprecedented, it is rare for prime ministers to take businessmen on foreign trips. The CBI told Mr Major at the end of last year that export promotion trips should be higher on his agenda. The business leaders are expected to meet counterparts in the country - and then report back to Mr Major and the Indian prime minster. If successful, Mr Major may consider taking businessmen on his other overseas trips. Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas and a member of the delegation, said the prime minister's decision was a 'tangible expression' of the government's willingness to work with industry. British Gas is involved in several large projects in India including schemes in Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. British Aerospace, whose chief executive Mr Dick Evans is going, said the trip reinforced the seriousness with which UK companies took relations with India, Britain's 20th largest export market. The other industrialists are: Sir Brian Shaw, chairman, ANZ Grindlays Bank; Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive of Rolls-Royce; Mr Norman Davis, director, British American Tobacco; Mr Brian Baldock, deputy chairman, Guinness; Mr Peter Grant, chairman, Sun Life Assurance Society; Mr Philip Daubeney, head of African and eastern region, ICI; Mr Norman Hawkins, Cadbury Schweppes; Mr Patrick MacDougall, chairman, Chartered West; Mr Philip Hills, executive director, Samuel Montagu; Mr G. Douglas Gadd, chairman, GEC Alsthom; Mr Graham Hadley, executive director, National Power; Mr Richard Reynolds, chairman, GPT; Mr Roger Mabey, managing director, Bovis International; Mr Andrew Cummins, Inchcape.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Developers are urged to take up public cash PROPERTY COMPANIES are failing to take advantage of billions of pounds worth of public-sector funding, a local-government minister said yesterday. Mr John Redwood appealed for action from commercial developers to spark the market into life. He warned property specialists that they risked missing the bottom of the market if they did not act now. He said nearly Pounds 3bn of government money was available over five years for those working in tandem with public bodies under schemes such as City Challenge partnerships and urban development corporations. Mr Redwood said in a Commons debate on local-government services that the present state of the property market presented 'enormous opportunities'. There had rarely been a better conjunction of rental yields and borrowing costs. 'When do the property specialists think they will next be able to buy properties and undertake developments at current high yield levels and current low interest rates?' Mr Redwood asked. 'Why did so many clamour to buy land at Pounds 1m or more an acre in 1988, which they would now turn down at Pounds  1/4 m an acre?' The government would benefit from a revival in the property market because it wants the private sector to play a leading role in reviving urban areas. It is also seeking to dispose of large tracts of land and property through organisations including the Commission for New Towns, which has about Pounds 2bn of property to sell; English Estates, the government's property development arm; and public-sector bodies such as British Rail. The property industry is reluctant to increase investment as it is hamstrung by the oversupply of buildings - particularly offices in the south - its own weak finances and the reluctance of banks to make further loans to property. Property companies are especially reluctant to invest in the inner-city areas favoured by the government. The few developers which are still active in inner cities say that an increasingly high proportion of public money is needed if schemes are to be viable. Turning to local government, Mr Redwood made clear that the government had no philosophical objection to councils contracting private companies to provide any service for which they were responsible. Under the government's concept of the 'enabling' council, authorities decided 'how much service the community requires but does not necessarily employ the people providing it'. Councils should move to 'make the best use' of what the marketplace had to offer. Market testing was not just a way of cutting costs but could also improve service quality. Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local-government minister, said the government's 'real' policy over 14 years had been to dismantle local democracy in order to centralise power in Whitehall. He accused the government of contributing to the 'failure' of the Canary Wharf development by ignoring the advice of the local community.</p>

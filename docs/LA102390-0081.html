			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN HIT-AND-RUN THAT KILLED YOUTH  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Sherman Oaks man was convicted Monday of felony hit-and-run  driving and misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter for driving a friend's car into  two teen-agers, killing one of them, after discovering his own vehicle had been  vandalized.  </P> <P> But the Van Nuys Superior Court jury cleared the man, Sean Gauthia, of more  serious charges of murder and felony vehicular manslaughter in the April 7  death of Gavin Kalaba, 17, and the injury of Joseph Elder, 17, both of Van  Nuys.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated seven days. Judge Jerold A. Krieger set sentencing for  Nov. 19.  </P> <P> Kalaba died of head injuries. Elder suffered leg injuries and has undergone  extensive surgery, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The two youths did not vandalize Gauthia's vehicle, said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Leonard Shaffer. But Gauthia, angry over damage to his Jeep, commandeered a  friend's Chevrolet Blazer and deliberately ran into the two youths, Shaffer  contended.  </P> <P> "They just happened to be there," Shaffer said. "There were about 10 or 12  people, and they happened to be the ones standing there."  </P> <P> But Robert Schwartz, Gauthia's attorney, told jurors that the collision was an  accident. A passenger in the Blazer jerked the steering wheel, causing Gauthia  to strike Elder and Kalaba, he argued.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about midnight, after Gauthia and several friends left a  party attended by several hundred people at a rented warehouse at Oxnard and  Sepulveda streets.  </P> <P> Shaffer said Gauthia saw that the windshield and side and rear windows of his  Jeep had been broken. Shaffer contended that the windows were broken by  party-goers who thought the Jeep's occupants had smashed the windows of a  Mustang earlier in the evening, Shaffer said.  </P> <P> Shaffer said that it was one of Gauthia's friends, not Gauthia, who had broken  the Mustang windows that sparked the vandalism of Gauthia's car.  </P> <P> Gauthia is also facing charges in San Fernando Superior Court of raping a woman  in concert with friends, Shaffer said.  </P></p>

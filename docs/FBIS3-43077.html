Yeliseyev, Biomedical </F> Problems Institute, Russian Federation Ministry of Health,  Moscow; UDC 612.822.014.46:577.175.537]    [Abstract] Existing and newly published data on the  mechanisms of the reaction of a number of structures of the  brain and pituitary-adrenal system under stress were examined.  Published information on the following topics was examined: the  role of the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic structures (the  hippocampus, tonsils, septum, and reticular formation); the role  of the adrenergic, seritoninergic, and cholinergic systems of  the hypothalamus-reticulum-limbic complex; the role of  neuropeptides; and delta-sleep inducing peptide [DSIP] and its  biological role. In addition, the regulation of the  pituitary-adrenal system and the functional activity and  intercenter interrelationship of the structures of the brains in  a stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior and the  effects of corticosteroids and DSIP were examined in a study of  982 adult male rats. The rat studies established that the  development of aggressive-defensive behavior results in a marked  restructuring of the functional activity of the  hypothalamic-reticular-limbic structures and cerebral cortex, as  well as in a change in the nature of intercenter  interrelationships that correlate with a change in the content  of corticosterone and DSIP in blood plasma. Specifically, the  stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior was accompanied  by an elevation of corticosterone level from 12.29 +/- 0.5 to  126.1 +/- 1.5 mmol/l and a decrease in DSIP from 388.1 +/- 41.06  to 242.3 +/- 31.88 fmol/l. Also during aggressive-defensive  behavior, the bioelectric activity of the rats' brains  manifested a change in theta-rhythm spectrum, the integral  strength of which (in V/s) in the hippocampus rose from 18.8  +/- 3.6 (background) to 6.1 +/- 5.9. Theta-activity in the  hippocampus thus increased from 31 to 54 percent. In the  ventromedial hypothalamus theta-activity increased from 17 to 43  percent, and in the reticular formation of the midbrain it  increased from 31 to 37 percent (this change was coupled with  increases in respiration and heart rates). The correlation  between DSIP level and corticosterone level during  aggressive-defensive behavior was seen as especially noteworthy.  Exogenous injection of DSIP against the background of advanced  stress resulted in myorelaxation and elimination of aggression.  Injection of DSIP before the development of aggressive-defensive  behavior led to a decrease in corticosterone level from 12.29  +/- 0.5 to 9.64 +/- 0.7 mmol/l and to a less pronounced increase  in the level of corticosterone in the rats' blood plasma after  the onset of aggressive-defensive behavior than occurred without  the injection of DSIP. New data regarding the  structurofunctional organization of the inhibitory process under  the effect of DSIP during aggressive-defensive behavior and the  significant integration of nervous and hormonal factors in the  mechanisms of its development were also obtained. DSIP was  determined to function as a natural tranquilizer that increases  resistance to stress. References 80: 19 Russian, 61 Western.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS SIGN SECOND PLAN B FREE AGENT, ILESIC, UNPROTECTED BY CHARGERS  </P> <P> One week after punter Dale Hatcher signed with the Green Bay Packers, the Rams  announced Friday the signing of punter Hank Ilesic, who had been left  unprotected by the San Diego Chargers.  </P> <P> Ilesic, 30, joined the Chargers after the second game of the 1989 season and  finished with an average of 40.1 yards on 76 punts.  </P> <P> He came to San Diego after a 13-year career in the Canadian Football League,  which he joined out of high school. Ilesic played six seasons for Edmonton and  seven for Toronto, averaging 45.4 yards a kick in his CFL career.  </P> <P> The Rams lost interest in Hatcher after he finished last in the NFC with a 38.8  average last season.  </P> <P> The Rams have signed two Plan B free agents, Ilesic and guard/center Joe  Milinichik, and have lost three -- guard Tony Slaton, safety James Washington  and Hatcher.  </P> <P> Kicker Mike Lansford worked out for the Chargers Thursday and also is  considering an offer from the Phoenix Cardinals. Receiver Ron Brown said he  probably will make a signing decision Monday, and teams still in the running  include the Denver Broncos and the Raiders.  </P> <P> Plan B free agents have until April 1 to sign with other NFL teams.

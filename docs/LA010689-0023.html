			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CLEARED  </P> <P> The stupidity of some federal agencies never ceases to amaze me ("UC Lecturer  Cleared of Bomb Threat on Jet," Part I, Dec. 30). So the FBI has finally  discovered that Peter Canning actually is who he says he is and was, incredible  as it may have seemed to the authorities, telling the truth.  </P> <P> This man deserves a written apology from all concerned. The sad corollary to  all of this is that who among us, having read what happened to Canning, would  have the conviction to act in a similar potentially dangerous situation while  on board an aircraft?  </P> <P> RON R. GLAESEMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Shake-up in benefit rules signalled by chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday raised expectations that tougher benefit rules for the unemployed would be accompanied in his November Budget by improved incentives for people to take low paid jobs. His comments point to an extension of family credit and to further changes in national insurance contributions for those on low incomes to accompany the replacement of unemployment benefit by a new Jobseekers' allowance. The new allowance will be payable for six rather than 12 months and will impose tighter obligations on the unemployed to seek work. But ministers are aware the new system will only operate effectively if the jobless, particularly those with children, do not face financial penalties in accepting work. Mr Clarke's remarks, which included another strong hint that there would be no room for tax cuts in the next Budget, follow a recent lecture in which he argued deregulated labour markets must be combined with a strengthened welfare state. Despite objections from the Tory right to any increase in the number of benefit claimants, the chancellor intends to develop the argument in a speech next week to the Social Market Foundation. The theme is likely to be taken up also by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, in a speech tomorrow to an employment conference organised by the Trades Union Congress. Mr Hunt will underscore a commitment to full employment, but he will combine it with a robust attack on Labour and union support for a minimum wage instead of help for the low paid through benefits. The chancellor's remarks coincided also with a warning by another centre-left minister  - Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary  - that the government must resist the pressure from the Tory right for another burst of ideological radicalism. The stance of the three ministers represents a counter-attack against the right's recent successes in tilting Mr John Major towards Thatcherite policies. Speaking on BBC Television's Breakfast with Frost programme, the chancellor said that the government would introduce tax cuts only when it had restored firm control of public finances. He would give no guarantee of reductions in the basic rate of income tax before the next general election. Mr Clarke has asked officials to provide work on measures to alleviate the poverty and unemployment traps at the bottom end of the income scale. He said he was concerned to improve incentives for the unemployed to return to work. The chancellor has accepted the Treasury orthodoxy that the most effective way of helping the low-paid is through better in-work benefits rather than changes in the tax system. Family credit, paid to top up the incomes of around 450,000 households, is one of the most successful benefits. But it is restricted to households with children. The present rules mean also that more than 500,000 people would face effective tax rates of 70 per cent or more if they returned to employment.

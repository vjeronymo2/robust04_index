			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Espy resignation leaves farm interests adrift - American farmers feel they are losing a valuable friend at court Michael Espy's resignation as US Agriculture Secretary on Monday took many US farmers by surprise, and left farm interests adrift just as they faced their toughest battle ever to preserve their entitlement programmes before a congress less and less interested in rural issues. A minor light in Washington, the soft spoken, articulate Mr Espy had taken on heroic proportions in farm country, where his rapid response to agricultural disasters, and his pro-farm positions on trade issues won him wide popularity. The secretary said he would quit the Clinton cabinet at the end of the year to 'clear his good name' in the face a widening array of allegations that he accepted favours from the agribusinesses he was charged with regulating. Until the announcement most farm interests brushed off the Washington talk of ethics violations as inconsequential. 'He was a congressman, he never really switched gears to operate like a secretary, but he is doing an excellent job,' a Midwestern grain dealer stated last week. In fact, Mr Espy's accomplishments during 18 months in office are substantial. During last summer's disastrous floods, when more than 23m acres in the Midwest were damaged, he not only expedited payment of more than Dollars 2bn in farm disaster claims, but repeatedly visited catastrophe areas to assure producers that government aid was on its way. He also weathered strong criticism of the US Department of Agriculture after tainted meat caused deaths in the US pacific north-west last year. He turned the incident into a crusade, making food safety a major objective of the agency. This past summer, faced with the worst forest fire season in US history, he was again quick to support the US forest service, which comes under the USDA's purview. He also won Bill Clinton allies in farm states by backing trade sanctions against Canadian wheat imports even as he campaigned for agriculture, small and large, to support of the administration's major trade initiatives, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Gatt. In Washington, Mr Espy was forging the first overhaul of the USDA since its creation by Abraham Lincoln in 1863. His push to close 1,200 of the agency's 14,000 field offices, and to cut the Washington bureaucracy made him enemies in his own office, but will trim nearly Dollars 169m from the federal budget if carried through. Most importantly for farmers, the former Mississippi congressman was knowledgeable about the workings of the Farm Bill, a massive piece of legislation that governs every aspect of US Agriculture and often dictates profit parameters for producers of scores of commodities. In place for five years, the Farm Bill is the embodiment of pork barrel and politics. Current US agricultural legislation is to expire next year and farm groups and the USDA are already hard at work establishing the issues to be addressed in the 1995 Farm Bill. Farm interests are now concerned that any one brought on in Mr Espy's place must immediately face the challenge of getting the Farm Bill through congress. Declining farm populations leave farm states with fewer representatives in congress just as budget contraints are making urban politicians resentful of massive US farm payments. The USDA estimates that today, 370,000 farms earn 85 per cent of US farm income and most farm programme payments go to large farms with relatively large household incomes. It is no wonder that farm groups feel they need an effective friend at the helm of the USDA.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Product shrinkage - A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers report on what is happening where Small is beautiful, it seems, to French consumers of gadgets and gizmos. From mobile phones to cars, miniaturisation is the buzzword for plugged-in Parisians. Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of the Bi-Bop portable phone. Weighing less than 200 grammes, the hand-set is small enough to slip into the owner's pocket. The Bi-Bop was launched last year and is available only in Paris and Strasbourg. Yet France Telecom, the company behind it, has more than 70,000 subscribers already. The system has its limits, one being that callers need to be within range of a transmission sub-station. But unlike Rabbit, Bi-Bop's failed British counterpart, there is an adequate number of such stations in the launch cities. And Bi-Bop is expanding: from next month, it will be available in Lille. Another hit is the mini-car - the vehicle sans permit. Unknown to many foreigners, France is home to a handful of companies that produce small cars which can be driven by motorists who have not passed the rigorous driving test. The appeal of these is not just for the young, who may fancy a roof over their heads rather than braving the elements on a moped. The VSP is also aimed at motorists frustrated at failing to find parking spaces. One manufacturer, Microcar, has sold more than 40,000. VSPs are unlikely to set the pulse racing. With engines of about 50cc, or electric motors, they struggle to go faster than 30mph. But they can be driven by 14-year-olds, and they are easy to park, which gives them appeal. Yet the French remain attached to some tried and trusted gadgets, albeit in updated form. One is the Minitel, the teletext system which is to be found in 6.5m offices and households. It has been given a new lease of life since the introduction this summer of a faster model. The Minitel a Grande Vitesse, as it is known, operates at 9,600 bytes a second (eight times faster than its predecessor), allowing the transmission of images through the network.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report from the "Trade" column: "The </F> Importance of the Pipeline and Special Exporter Status Will  Grow. A Government Source Comments on a Presidential Edict  Abolishing Export Quotas and Licensing"]    [Text] After the edict canceling export quotas and  licensing has been adopted, the role of special exporters will  increase substantially, a government source who asked not to be  identified said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.  Because even now the oil pipeline is operating at full  capacity, the abolition of oil quotas and licenses without  abolishing the special exporter status effectively gives the  advantage of "getting into the pipe" to those companies which  have benefited from their status in the past. However,  considering that the oil pipe does not stretch like rubber, it  can be assumed that if special exporters were also abolished,  bribes and connections would be used, which would lead to a  civil war over the oil pipelines.    Experts are rather critical of the edict on cancellation of  duties and quotas. Thus, some politicians believe that the  edict is nonviable. Others (including NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  source) point to the edict's equivocal wording which will lend  itself to different interpretations by specialists.    In fact the presidential edict annulled Appendix 1 to last  year's government resolution "On Liberalizing Foreign Economic  Activity" which laid down procedures for quantity regulation and  licensing. Commenting at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's request on the  new trade scheme, the source noted that it is clear already:  Military equipment, dual-purpose goods, gold, and precious  stones will be subject to licensing and quantity regulation.  Furthermore, under the presidential edict, international  delivery quotas, established from outside, will remain on  aluminum and textiles.    "Much will depend on the interpretation which the government  puts on the edict in its resolutions," the source said. "At  present it is difficult to say definitely what the edict's  implications will be or how they will impact on the business  climate in Russia and foreign investments."    Earlier, Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister Andrey  Dogayev said that the state will regulate trade through six to  seven domestically produced goods, including deliveries within  the framework of "external quotas" under international  agreements.    Incidentally, a joint statement by the government and the  Central Bank provides for the cabinet's obligation to lift  restrictions on all commodities with the exception of crude oil,  diesel fuel, electricity, nickel, aluminum, and copper,  restrictions on which, according to the statement, will be  lifted at the end of 1994.</p>

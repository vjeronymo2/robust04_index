			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Kings - Theatre There has been mileage in Homer since 600BC when the 'Sons of Homer' formed a guild for public readings of The Iliad and The Odyssey. Alan Howard and Christopher Logue are continuing the tradition with Kings at the Cottesloe Theatre, a reading from Logue's 1991 version of the first two books of The Iliad. This two-man, 90-minute performance shows how compelling epic can be when well presented. Aristotle was right to think that it should be read and not acted. Logue's Kings follows his epic companion piece, War Music (1981), which comprised a version of books 16-19 of The Iliad. His story keeps close to Homer, recounts the growing dissent among the Greeks, their reaction to the imperiousness of Agamemnon, the sulking of Achilles at the loss of his captured woman, Briseis, and the fatal prayer he offers to his mother Thetis, to make the Greeks suffer. Homeric style combines seriousness and accessibility: armies are compared to forest fires, or flies around a milk pail. Logue has caught the scope and pitch of Homeric epic by using translations from Chapman (1611) to Rieu (1950) and evolving a supple, muscular verse. He has also preserved the wit in Homer. Besides the whining, jibing Thersites, there is a malicious Athena ('We have arranged another death for Agamemnon') and a skyful of ludic gods: 'How can a mortal make a god smile? Tell him his plans.' The Homeric lyricism has also been kept: retained: 'The dawn stepped barefooted from her lover's bed and shared her beauty with the clouds.' Logue has wisely kept his own speaking contributions relatively slight. The evening is carried by Howard. From the opening lines, 'Think of the East Aegean sea by night ..', Howard is magnificent, delivering the speeches of Greeks and Gods seamlessly intercut with passages of narration. He crouches for the opening on a tall stool, fists clenched, conjuring figures from the Greek camp out of the sea mist. The famous speech from Odysseus, persuading the Greeks not to follow Thersites home, is stunning. Thersites has raised the cry of 'Home' like sudden gusts darkening a lake; Odysseus calms the soldiers and beats him with a cane before handing the situation back to Agamemnon. Howard makes it come alive, and for a moment, you are standing on the shores of history by the wine-dark sea. Cottesloe Theatre (071 928 2033) until 19 September, and 27-29 October. Christopher Logue's Kings is published by Faber.</p>

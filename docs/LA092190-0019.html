			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS MAKES PASSES COUNT  </P> <P> Steve Bresnahan, Laguna Hills High School football coach, wasn't pleased with  quarterback Casey Sullivan's completion percentage Thursday night against  Garden Grove.  </P> <P> But he can't fault his quarterback for being unproductive.  </P> <P> Sullivan, a transfer from St. Monica, completed only four of 11 passes for 108  yards, but three completions were for touchdowns as the Hawks' offense came  alive in the second half for a 26-7 victory at Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Sullivan, a 6-foot-3 senior, threw for two touchdowns in the second half as  Laguna Hills outscored Garden Grove, 19-0.  </P> <P> "Casey missed some plays too," Bresnahan said. "Those touchdowns were big  plays, but we missed some (completions) we should have had."  </P> <P> But Sullivan wasn't the Hawks' only scoring weapon.  </P> <P> Running back Marwan Saba got into the act too, rushing for 189 yards in 37  carries and catching a 16-yard touchdown pass from Sullivan in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> The Hawks' defense held Garden Grove to 111 total yards -- including minus-28  in the second half -- forced a safety and set up two touchdowns for the  offense.  </P> <P> "Our defense did a better job than last week (a 10-7 loss to San Clemente),"  Bresnahan said. "But we still didn't play with a whole lot of enthusiasm  tonight."  </P> <P> Garden Grove appeared to be in good shape offensively in the first half.  </P> <P> The Argonauts (1-2) took a 7-0 lead with 1 minute 54 seconds left in the first  quarter when quarterback Bob Ioja tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to his  brother, Adrian. A 47-yard run by the Argonauts' Bob Rosa two plays earlier set  up the touchdown.  </P> <P> But Laguna Hills (2-1) answered on the ensuing possession when quarterback  Casey Sullivan found tight end Kirk Brown wide open on the right side. Brown  outraced two defenders for a 53-yard touchdown. Marc Brodbeck's extra point  tied the score at 7-7.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills wasted little time taking control in the second half. The Hawks  took the opening possession 63 yards, capped by a 16-yard touchdown pass from  Sullivan to Saba.  </P></p>

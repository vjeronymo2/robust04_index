			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Cash pledge for Aral Sea International donors yesterday pledged Dollars 31.4m (Pounds 20.6m) to study ways to stop the Aral Sea in central Asia drying up. It used to be the world's largest fresh water lake before shrinking over the past 30 years to half its original size of 690,000 sq km, David Buchan reports from Paris. The money is to fund feasibility studies for a larger Dollars 220m investment programme, designed to try to restore the flow of river water into the lake and to counter environmental damage by stemming the blowing of toxic salts from the exposed seabed on to surrounding towns and cropland. The cash pledges were made at a meeting in Paris yesterday, chaired by the World Bank, of various governments and international organisations.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Ministers consider change to employers' liability law The government is urgently considering a possible law change following problems created by new terms that insurance companies plan to impose on compulsory policies covering workplace deaths and injuries. Ministers are expected to decide soon whether to change the 1969 Employers' Liability Act which requires employers to have at least Pounds 2m of cover. The move follows a private meeting this week between Department of Employment officials and insurance industry representatives to discuss the insurers' decision to introduce a basic Pounds 10m claims limit on employers' liability policies renewed from January. The announcement threatens to leave many large corporate groups without the legally required level of insurance because the law at present stipulates that the cover of each subsidiary company, or 'employer', must be Pounds 2m. A change in the 1969 act could be implemented swiftly, possibly in time for the January deadline, because the levels of cover required are set by 'statutory instruments' - regulations that can be changed relatively easily, without long parliamentary procedures. One proposal being mooted in Whitehall would allow corporate groups to be treated as a single employer - though that would mean commercial giants being treated in the same way as small companies. An alternative would be to introduce a sliding scale for the amount of cover required. Meanwhile, health and safety inspectors have been asked to consult Whitehall before taking action against companies with inadequate cover.</p>

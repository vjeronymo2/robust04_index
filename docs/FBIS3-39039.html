A further 28 people already serving prison sentences were  also said to be implicated in the ring, which came to light  following confessions by five former members of the Camorra, the  Neapolitan Mafia.    According to the confessions, the drug trafficking was  controlled by 12 Mafia families headed by boss Raffaele Ascione.    Up to 1,000 fixes of heroin a day were being sold by the  gang. Police did not say if they had seized the drugs.</p>

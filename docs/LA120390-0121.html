			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH PROCLAIMS 'NEW ERA OF HOPE' IN SOUTH AMERICA  </P> <P> President Bush today proclaimed "a new era of hope" in newly democratic South  America as he opened a five-nation tour. He promptly blamed Iraq for making  poor countries pay expensive oil bills.  </P> <P> Bush arrived in Brasilia at dawn after an overnight flight from Washington,  accompanied by a mostly junior staff. He was greeted by a 21-gun salute and  military pageantry at the pillared Plantalto Palace, the workplace of President  Fernando Collor de Mello.  </P> <P> While celebrating the rebirth of democracy in South America, Bush put a strong  emphasis on the Persian Gulf crisis and Iraq's takeover of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Bush said Czechoslovakia, where he visited last month, is paying $1.5 billion  in additional fuel costs because of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's refusal to  retreat.  </P> <P> Collor, during a picture-taking session with Bush, said Brazil is paying $5  billion more for oil.  </P> <P> Bush responded, "That's why, (when) people say to me, 'Well, this can go on and  on and on,' I say, 'No.' "  </P> <P> Bush raised the gulf crisis again during a speech to the Brazilian Congress. "I  realize the sacrifices that Saddam (Hussein's) brutality has caused this nation  and its people, has caused many nations around the world."  </P> <P> Bush said he will not abandon plans to stop Wednesday in Buenos Aires, where  President Carlos Saul Menem declared a state of siege after the fourth military  uprising in four years.  </P> <P> "I have great confidence in the security there," Bush said.  </P></p>

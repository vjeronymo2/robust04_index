			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Kenya expects loans to resume MULTILATERAL lending to Kenya, suspended for nearly a year, is expected to resume shortly, Prof George Saitoti, the country's vice-president and finance minister, said in London at the weekend. Mr Saitoti, speaking after talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, said that both institutions had broadly endorsed Kenya's performance under a revised reform programme. Although not all issues had been resolved, there had been sufficient progress for the early release of blocked World Bank resources - 'about half of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 175m) that has been held up', according to Mr Saitoti. "It's the best news since last November', said the minister, referring to a Paris conference of donors, chaired by the World Bank, which suspended lending to Kenya and called for political reform and more effective implementation of the country's structural adjustment programme. Shortly afterwards President Daniel arap Moi lifted a ban on opposition parties and a general election is due to take place by next March. At the same time the government began measures to reduce the budget deficit, which was running at 6.7 per cent of GDP on an annualised basis, according to the IMF in December 1991. This was well over the ceiling set under the three-year structural adjustment programme, due for renewal in May this year. Although some bilateral donors, including Britain, believe that it is time to review the Paris decision, the US has been more cautious, apparently waiting for Mr Moi set a firm election date. In April Kenya and the Fund agreed on what was called a 'shadow programme' covering the period to January 1993. If the government meets performance targets - notably the budget deficit and parastatal reforms - the final tranche of the extended structural adjustment facility (ESAF) will be released. A combination of tax measures and spending controls, including a freeze on civil service recruitment and cancellation of projects wholly government financed has brought the deficit down substantially, said Mr Saitoti. According to a recent Fund report, the deficit for the year from June 1991 was about 3.5 per cent. It is estimated to have been less than 1.5 per cent over the period December 1991 to June 1992, at an annualised rate. In addition, a parastatal restructuring and privatisation programme has been agreed to with the World Bank.</p>

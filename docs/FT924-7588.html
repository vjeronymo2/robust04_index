			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / MPs may back energy body BACKBENCH MPs examining Britain's energy sector are seriously considering the idea of setting up an energy agency to help oversee strategic decision-making. Under one possible model Offer and Ofgas, the electricity and gas industry regulators, could be merged and given enhanced powers in formulating energy policy. This agency would not seek to usurp ultimate authority from government ministers but would advise them on subjects such as the appropriate energy mix for the country's interests and pollution-related matters. Any such move  -aimed at correcting widely perceived shortcomings in the present regime - would probably require legislation. The all-party trade and industry select committee started its inquiries last month in the wake of the announcement of controversial plans to close 31 coal pits and make 30,000 miners redundant. It is due to continue taking evidence for a further month. Chaired by Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, the committee is expected to publish its recommendations soon after MPs return from the Christmas recess in January. Among a series of presentations arguing for a more interventionist approach to energy strategy, the views of Mr Dieter Helm, the Oxford economist, are thought to have been warmly received by MPs across the political spectrum. Mr Helm argued in evidence to the committee for an energy agency 'quite closely mirrored on the government's proposals for an environmental agency'. He added: 'This agency may well have the duties to produce capacity forecasts . . . and it may well have licensing powers.' Offer and Ofgas, he said, did not have 'the wider interests or the relevant powers to conduct energy policy'.</p>

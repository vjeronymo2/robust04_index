[cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukraine between 1 and 10 March  1994, which was even more than the planned amount (by 128.1  million cu. m.)    Obviously, Gazprom's statement about its alleged intention  to  drastically curtail Russian natural gas supplies to Ukraine,  which was widely circulated by the media, cried wolf.    In the meantime, on 10 March Moscow was the venue of  negotiations between Russia's Gazprom and a Ukrainian government  delegation led by vice-premier Valentin Landik on the sensitive  issue of Russian gas supplies to Ukraine.    The crucial negotiations resulted in an articulated  agreement  on Russian gas supply resumption in full. The Russian side went  even further to state its intention to supply about 80 per cent  of natural gas, which Ukraine used to receive from Turkmenistan  or would have received from there has it not been for the  Central Asian nation's decision to discontinue its natural gas  supplies to Ukraine.    According to the Ukrainian vice-premier, a protocol was  signed in Moscow, under which the two parties pledged to arrange  their account settling within a month. Ukraine's gas  indebtedness for the 1994, first quarter's supplies will be  repaid via monetary means. 1993's indebtedness (which, as  Gazprom's spokepersons maintain, exceeds 1.5 trillion rubles) is  to be repaid, in 50 per cent parts, in hard currency and Russian  rubles, and via equipment and material supplies to Russian  natural gas extractors.    Russia's statements, blaming Ukraine for allegedly curtailed  natural gas supplies to Russia's West European customers in late  January and early February, perhaps, should also be taken with a  grain of salt. In real fact, precisely at that time, Russia's  Gazprom attempted to make its West European clients, primarily  Germany, pay higher prices for its gas through curtailed gas  exports on its own.    According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian exporter curtailed gas  supplies in a most drastic manner to Germany, Bulgaria, Turkey  and Hungary.    Russian natural gas transit across Ukraine's territory in  January and February, 1994 could be characterized by the  following data:                    January                        February                   Factual      In excess of      Factual      In excess of                  Supplies     plants (+)        Supplies     plants (+)                               undersupplied                  undersupplied                               amount (-)                     amounts (-)                   (million cu. m.)

Nonetheless, during a meeting on 11 March with Hungarian  President A. Genz Ukraine's Ambassador to Hungary D. Tkach  assured him, on behalf of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil  and gas, to which Ukrgazprom is immediately reportable, that  Ukraine would unswervingly comply with its natural gas transit  commitments.    As it also became known, the Ukrainian side agreed to  consider the issue of allowing Russia to jointly own some of  Ukraine's major pipe-lines and underground gas storages, which  will be negotiated at a bilateral Russo-Ukrainian meeting on 10  April.    In view of the upcoming process of transforming state-owned  enterprises within Ukraine's petroleum-gas complex into  joint-stock societies (which is expected to start, when  President Kravchuk signs the draft decree "On procedures for  preparing for selling stocks of open-type joint-stock societies  established through corporatization") the Russian side's demand  may be met quite legitimately through acquisition by Russian  enterprises of Ukrgazprom's stocks.    However, Russia's joint ownership of Ukraine's pipe-line  network and underground reservoirs will require a decision by  the government, since, according to the endorsed documents for  Ukrgazprom's corporatization, both the gas transport network and  underground storages should remain the state's property.    Russia's access to Ukraine's gas pipe-line system as the  latter's co-owner, personified by Gazprom, is supposed to  guarantee security of Russian natural gas supplies to West  Europe, since Ukraine will not be in a position to unilaterally  pump out the exported raw material for its own needs, should  supplies to Ukraine be curtailed.    More likely than not, in case the scheme materializes,  Russia will be able to quite legally shift a part of  responsibility for any undersupplies likely to happen to  Ukraine. Presently, the declared by Russia curtailment of  natural gas supplies to Ukraine is technically very hard to  verify.    Moreover, the Ukrainian party will become legally liable  before Russian natural gas buyers and very unlikely to dictate  its charges for transit services.    No reliable and exact data are currently available about  what  facilities may be turned over to Russia. Yet, back in September  1993, when Ukraine's fuel indebtedness to Russia reached the  ball park of 750 billion rubles, Gazprom ventilated long-term  lease of certain facilities in Ukraine as a minimal and partial  redemption of the debt. These reportedly included gas supply  depots in Kiev, Uzhgorod, Nikolaev, underground gas storages in  Ukraine's border regions, as well as port facilities in Odessa  and Ilyichevsk.    Russia's Gazprom is also known to have vigorously opposed a  plan, which provided for repayment of a part of Ukraine's fuel  debt to Russia by means of nuclear weapons, dismantled in  Ukraine and transferred to Russia.    However, on 17 January 1994, when an agreement was reached  on  gas supplies to Ukraine, Gazprom pledged to keep to this  schedule of supplies: 10.3 b. cu. m. in the 1st quarter, 15.6  b. cu. m. in the 2nd quarter, 18.2 b. cu. m. in the 3d quarter,  and 7.8 b. cu. m. in the last quarter of 1994. As Ukrainian  gas officials maintain, the schedule is not very convenient for  Ukraine, in technological terms.    Proceeding from data, regularly published by UBN [UKRINFORM  Business News], the latest agreements on the parties'  obligations Gazprom appears intent on shrinking to the agreed  supply schedule.    Reductions in total gas import amounts due to supply  discontinuance by Turkmenistan were not so critical as to make  the situation a crisis one, Taras Freyuk, Ukrgaz deputy chief  asserts. Moreover, a spell of warm weather, which has recently  set in, allows to radically reduce natural gas consumption by  housing and public utilities, which normally account for about a  third of the nation's total natural gas consumption.    As statistical data suggest, a one-degree drop in  temperature  entails extraconsumption of 4.5 million cu. m. of gas  Ukraine-wide. According to T. Freyuk, daily gas consumption by  the above sector dropped by 100 million cu. m.    All-in-all, during the 1-10 March period Ukraine's gas  consumption amounted to 2,983.6 million cu. m., according to  Ukrgazprom sources, which was by 520.4 million cu. m. less than  expected.    Only debtor enterprises among Ukraine's over 80,000  enterprises were hit by curtailed gas supplies. Many of  enterprises shifted to alternative fuels, such as oil fuel, if  their technological processes allowed to do so.    However, as T. Freyuk maintains, Ukraine's domestic payment  crisis remains a major challenge. The gas supply problem would  be automatically resolved, were it not for the  consumer-enterprises' untimely payments for fuels supplied to  them.    According to both Ukrgazprom and Ukrgaz spokespersons, many  debtor enterprises start repaying their debts only after gas  supplies to them are curtailed and they are notified about  imminent supply suspension.    State-budgeted enterprises, including those of the housing  and public amenities sector, are entitled to continuous gas  supplies, though.    So far, Turkmen natural gas supplies have not resumed after  they were discontinued on 22 February 1994 by the Turkmen  government's decision in view of Ukraine's indebtedness.    According to formation, which was disclosed by Ukrgazprom's  operational and dispatching service sources; not a single cu. m.  of Turkmen natural gas has reached Ukraine since then. The  issue of Turkmen gas supply resumption remains thus suspended.    Ukrgazprom's spokespersons refused to confirm information  about Turkmenistan's official statement to the effect of its  intention to sell its gas to Russia, should Ukraine fail to  comply with Turkmenistan's terms, and Russia likely to resell it  then to Ukraine, at a much higher price. Turkmen natural gas  was priced at 50 US dollars per 1,000 cu. m.    Nonetheless, such a decision by Turkmenistan appears to be a  likely one, considering Russia's agreement to supply 80 per cent  of the amount, which Turkmenistan earlier undertook to supply to  Ukraine. The price and duration issue with regard to these  supplies has not been settled yet.    As Andrew Marshall, a participant in the current session of  the European Parliament, tends to believe, Russia played a trump  card with Turkmenistan both to bring pressure to bear on  Ukraine's and demonstrate its prestige and significance in the  East-European region.    Pedalling Ukraine's gas supply challenge has also spurred  the  USA to increase its aid to Ukraine and prompted Britain to  offers its go-between services in a bid to muster support from  international financial institutions and elicit credits to  Ukraine to repay its fuel debt to Russia.    So, it is Russia, who appears primarily to benefit from this  problem's shift from the field of economics to the domain of  politics, and very likely to have gains in both.</p>

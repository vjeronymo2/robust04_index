On the basis of the political amnesty proclaimed by the  State  Duma the court ruled to drop criminal proceedings against former  Soviet top officials who organised the 1991 August coup in  Moscow.    The political amnesty proclaimed by Duma covered the 1991  coup plotters, organisers of the 1993 armed opposition revolt in  Moscow and of the May Day demonstration last year. All the  three events resulted in bloodshed.</p>

The results of the  operation of the ministry last year were discussed at the  meeting and the main directions for work in 1994 set forth.  After the proceedings of the collegium, Minister of Foreign  Economic Relations Oleg Davydov invited several Russian  journalists to a meeting, in which he shared his considerations  concerning the status of Russia's foreign trade and answered  numerous questions. We offer our readers a brief report on this  meeting.  <H5>  Exports Have Stabilized </H5>   In 1993 the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  structured  its work on the basis of the program of the Government of Russia  "Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian  Economy." It was particularly important for us to actually carry  out the first stage of this program scheduled for 1993-1995. The  ministry concentrated its efforts on this. We continued work to  shape a mechanism for the regulation of foreign economic  activities in the period of transition. It is based on further  liberalization through cutting back measures of nontariff  regulation and switching to mostly economic methods, at the same  time streamlining the system of export and currency control. The  stabilization of exports and the growth of foreign exchange  proceeds testify that the measures being taken are effective. At  the same time, major problems have yet to be solved in the area  of foreign exchange regulation; there have been instances of  violations of legislation in the foreign economic sector.    Despite the overall worsening of conditions for trade,  Russian exports (volume in terms of value) stabilized in 1993,  coming to $43 billion. A considerable positive balance was  achieved in trade with distant foreign countries in the amount  of $16 billion. This was ensured primarily by increasing the  physical volume of deliveries of raw and other materials.    Changes in the geographical breakdown of exports caused the  share of industrialized countries to increase from 58 percent in  1992 to 60 percent in 1993, and that of developing  countries--from 11 to 14 percent, respectively. The share of the  former member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance fell from 19 to 17 percent.    Germany, China, Great Britain, Japan, France, the United  States, Hungary, and Finland hold leading positions in Russian  exports. Exports to the countries of Southeast Asia--Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea--have developed at  a high rate.    In the opinion of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the slump in industrial production in  Russia, worsening trends on the world market, and failure to  solve the problems of state support for exports, including  funding and insurance for them, have affected the volume,  breakdown, and rate of growth of exports. Besides, exports  experienced powerful pressure from industrialized countries,  which have taken discriminatory measures against Russian trade.  The interest of exporters in making deliveries of a number of  types of products fell sharply. This happened as a result of the  growth of domestic prices, transportation outlays, and high  interest rates on bank credit.    Nonetheless, proceeds in foreign exchange from the exports  of  goods went up in 1993, reaching $16 billion. In the opinion of  the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,  this testifies to the gradual assertion of export and foreign  exchange control, especially over the deliveries of  strategically important raw material products.  <H5>  We Have Begun To Import Less </H5>   Compared to 1992, Russian imports fell last year by almost  30  percent and came to $27 billion, which is mainly associated with  the pursued policy of reducing state expenditures, including  those for centralized imports; the latter declined by a factor  of two. We also began to purchase less abroad due to restricting  foreign borrowing, implementing a policy of containing credit  extension, gradually abolishing subsidization of imports from  the budget, and introducing the value-added tax on imported  goods.    Industrialized countries accounted for 54 percent of the  total volume of imports (62 percent in 1992), developing  countries for 18 percent (14 percent), and former member  countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance for 11  percent (15 percent).    The greatest volume of import purchases was generated in  Germany, China, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Great  Britain, and Hungary.    To be sure, we cannot fail to note that the existing  methodology of registering statistical data in the area of  foreign trade with which the State Committee on Statistics and,  consequently, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations operate  is far from perfect. This methodology was developed with the  quite recently existing monopoly of the state in the area of  foreign economic relations factored in; in many cases, it is  simply not functional. For example, numbers indicate that trade  between Russia and Sweden is declining; but according to Swedish  estimates it is increasing, and at a quite confident rate.    In Stockholm they believe that Russia has moved from 32d to  28th place in Swedish exports. The explanation is quite simple:  Unlike Russian statistics, Swedish statistics are based on  registration of the volume of commodity flows crossing the  border of the country; for this reason, they also register  things exported by private persons. Given our current Russian  reality, whereby customs duties have increased sharply, a  majority of importing companies, for example, importers of  automobiles, perform their operations precisely through private  persons.    In the opinion of Oleg Davydov, the latest changes in the  leadership of the State Committee on Statistics should ensure a  change for the better in this area. In his words, so far it has  been virtually impossible in some cases to obtain accurate data;  he personally encountered this in his numerous attempts to learn  about the volume of trade with Baltic countries.  <H5>  Great Changes Are Forthcoming </H5>   In the near future, by all signs from next year on, the  approach to Russia as a country with state foreign trade will  hardly be applicable. As Oleg Davydov stated, the state is  planning to fully withdraw from this sphere of activities in  1995. All indications are that this will occasion major changes  in the structure of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  itself.    As far as changes directly in the area of export and import  operations are concerned, the determination to discontinue grain  purchases abroad beginning next year is noteworthy. In general,  Russian foreign trade will to a considerable degree depend on  the domestic economic situation, what paths the reforms take,  and what the next steps of the Russian Government in the  economic area turn out to be.    The main avenues for the operation of the Ministry of  Foreign  Economic Relations in 1994 are:    --perfecting the regulatory and legal base for regulating  foreign economic activities (VED);    --cutting back administrative methods and perfecting  economic  methods for the regulation of foreign economic activities;    --reinforcing export and foreign exchange control;    --creating a favorable regimen of trade in relations with  foreign countries;    --ensuring the accomplishment of tasks in export and import  operations to meet federal state needs;    --ensuring support for Russian exports;    --stimulating the attraction of foreign investment to  Russia;    --settling the issue of the repayment of the debt of foreign  states to Russia;    --coordinating and facilitating the development of foreign  economic activities of the regions of Russia;    --improving informational and cadre support for foreign  economic activities.    All the above avenues appear important. However, it makes  sense to focus in particular on problems associated with the  operation of the currency market in Russia. The point is that,  in the environment of a high rate of inflation, the exchange  rate of the ruble on the currency market has recently been  maintained at an artificially high level. As a result, a  paradoxical situation developed in January--even the export of  oil and refinery products from Russia ended up unprofitable at  the maintained ratio of 1,160 rubles [R] to the dollar. Oleg  Davydov believes that had the exchange rate of the ruble not  fallen below the line of R1,500 to the dollar, export shipments  could have simply stopped. Consequently, foreign exchange  proceeds from exports, which come to $3-3.5 billion, would have  ceased.    Therefore, the sphere of foreign economic activities  develops  in a close interrelationship with domestic economic development.  When particular measures are implemented in the economic sphere,  it is necessary to soberly evaluate the entire range of possible  side effects which, in terms of consequences, may prove far more  serious than temporary advantages, even if they set the noble  goal of ensuring stability of the national currency.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: Italian telecoms group profits steady at L133bn ITALTEL, the Italian state-controlled telecommunications equipment group, reported virtually unchanged net profits of L133.2bn (Dollars 8.4m) against L132.5bn the previous year. Earnings would have been higher but for a substantial increase in tax to L128.5bn from L101.3bn in 1991 and a sharp rise in one-off payments for early retirement, which reached L61.5bn against L37.8bn in 1991. Sales rose 7.7 per cent to L2,973.4bn, undimmed by a 6.4 per cent fall in average prices as part of cuts in the cost of Italian telecommunications equipment. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the future industrial strategy of Italtel, which is controlled by the Stet telecommunications holding company. Although AT&amp;T, the big US telecoms group, retains a 20 per cent stake, Stet is known to be in talks with several multinational telecoms groups over the possibility of buying shares in Italtel, in an attempt to achieve economies of scale and widen access to technology.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Opole, June 27 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  declined on Monday to answer the question on reasons behind the  dismissals of two deputy finance ministers Henryk Chmielak and  Wojciech Misiag. "I received the motion on the matter from  (Finance) Minister (Grzegorz) Kolodko and it is him who should  be asked," the prime minister told a press conference during his  visit to Opole province. He added that the two dismissed deputy  ministers would be able to continue their work in the public  administration on other important posts, maybe in the economic  sector.    Asked to comment on the decision of the Union of Labour (UP)  to be in opposition to the present government, Pawlak said this  changes nothing in parliament. "Every party has its own  strategy. If the UP had wanted the government to carry out a  more leftist programme, it should not have withdrawn, but got  engaged," Waldemar Pawlak observed. The UP accused the ruling  coalition of shifting its policy towards the right.    The prime minister also met on Monday with members of the  Polish Peasant Party (PSL) in Opole. Pawlak, who is PSL leader,  asserted the PSL activists that the "Strategy for Poland"  economic programme for the years 1994-1997 ensures the revival  of the countryside and its development.    The premier did not, however, reveal details of his own  strategy for the agriculture due to the presence of journalists.  "The conversation is being controlled. I will speak in general  then. Our strategy means being present and participate in  changes in all fields," he said.    Earlier in the day, the prime minister opened the Opole  provincial telecommunications centre. Its inauguration ended  the first stage of modernising telecommunications network in the  province carried out under a government contract with the South  Korean Samsung firm.    The contract worth 50 million dollars will make it possible  to launch 150,000 telephone numbers, in the first two months -  100,000 numbers. At the moment, the Opole region has the  smallest number of telephone subscribers.    The opening ceremony was also attended by Communications  Minister Andrzej Zielinski and Korean Ambassador to Poland Chong  Kae-ok.    Also on Monday, Waldemar Pawlak promised governmental  support  for building the "South" refinery-petrochemical complex in  Kedzierzyn- Kozle, Opole province. The talks on this topic with  foreign contracting parties will start on Tuesday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Life of Virginia and the Accounts currently rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) under the 1940 Act, which provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act for certain VLI contracts. However, the exemptions granted by the Rule are available only where: (i) The Fund offers its shares  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exclusively <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to separate accounts of Life of Virginia or any life insurance company affiliate of Life of Virginia offering either scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, or both; or (ii) the Fund offers its shares to variable annuity separate accounts of Life of Virginia or of any life insurance company affiliate of Life of Virginia. The Rule 6e&hyph;(T)(b)(15) exemptions would not be available to Life of Virginia, the Accounts, or any future accounts if the Fund were to sell its shares to the Plan or to unaffiliated plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In general, section 9(a) of the 1940 Act disqualifies any person convicted of certain offenses, and any company affiliated with that person, from acting or serving in various capacities with respect to a registered investment company. Section 9(a)(3) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter for any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections 9(a) (1) or (2). However, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii) provides exemptions from section 9(a), under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions that limit the application of the eligibility restrictions of section 9(a) to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that the partial relief provided by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) effectively limits the amount of monitoring of personnel that Life of Virginia and its affiliates would have to conduct to ensure compliance with section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. Life of Virginia and the Accounts further assert that the Rule recognizes that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to the many hundreds of individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom typically have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies affiliated with that organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) also provides partial exemptions from sections 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent that, under certain limited circumstances, the Rule permits Life of Virginia and any life insurance company affiliates thereof that establish future accounts: (i) to disregard the voting instructions of VLI contract owners if following such instructions would cause Life of Virginia to make (or refrain from making) certain investments that would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of the Fund; or (ii) (subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)) to approve or disapprove any contract between the Fund and AAI, when such action is mandated by insurance regulatory authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that historically, the exclusivity provision in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) evolved from the Commission's concern about possible divergent interests between or among different classes of investors ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  variable contract owners) in mutual funds supporting variable life insurance separate accounts. The unit investment trust structure for supporting VLI contracts created the opportunity for a mutual fund underlying a trust also to offer its shares to a variable annuity separate account (hereinafter, ``mixed funding''). Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) was designed to permit a separate account supporting both flexible and scheduled premium VLI contracts to share the same underlying fund and engage in mixed funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that the proposed Plan and unaffiliated plan investments in the Fund should not increase the likelihood of material irreconcilable conflicts, and should benefit VA and VLI contracts owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that qualified retirement plan investors in the Fund would have substantially the same interests as current variable contract owners. Like variable contract owners, qualified retirement plan investors are long-term investors. Therefore, most can be expected not to withdraw their assets from the Plan or the unaffiliated plans. In addition, since neither variable contract owners nor Plan and unaffiliated plan investors would be taxed on the investment return of their respective investments in the Fund, they would be taxed on the investment return of their respective investments in the Fund, they would share a strong interest in the Fund operating in a manner that preserves its tax status. For these reasons, Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent that material conflicts between these two groups of investors regarding capital transactions are unlikely. Life of Virginia and the Accounts also note that ERISA imposes general diversification requirements on qualified pension and retirement plan investments that are consistent with the diversification requirements applicable to the Fund under section 817(h) of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent that the Accounts and the Plan are governed in similar ways. Plan trustees have a fiduciary duty to participants that is similar to the obligations that Life of Virginia (or any life insurance company affiliate thereof) has to look after the interests of variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that, because Plan and unaffiliated plan investors would have beneficial interests similar to those of current investors, the addition of the Plan and unaffiliated plans as shareholders of the Fund, and the addition of Plan and unaffiliated Plan participants as persons having beneficial interests in the Fund, should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts among investors. Life of Virginia and the Accounts further assert that even if a material irreconcilable conflict involving the Plan or the unaffiliated plans or their respective participants arose, the trustees of the Plan and the unaffiliated plans, may, if their fidiciary duty to the participants requires it, redeem the shares of the Fund held by the Plan or the unaffiliated plans and make alternative investments without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Similarly, the Plan and most if not all of the unaffiliated plans, may hold cash or other liquid assets pending their reinvestment in a suitable alternative investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that variable contract owners would benefit from the expected increase in net assets of the Fund's portfolios resulting from additional investments by Plan and unaffiliated plan participants. Such additional investments also should lower the costs of investing for variable contract owners, promote economies of scale, permit increased safety through greater portfolio diversification, provide the Fund's investment adviser with greater flexibility because of a larger portfolio, and make more feasible the addition of new portfolios in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The Applicants note that when the Commission last revised Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) in 1987, the Treasury Department had not issued Treasury Regulation 1.817&hyph;5 which permits the Fund to sell shares to qualified pension or retirement plans without adversely affecting the tax status of Life of Virginia's variable contracts. Life of Virginia and the Accounts submit that, although proposed regulations had been published, the Commission did not envision this possibility when it last examined Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15), and might well have broadened the exclusivity provision of the Rule at that time to include plans such as the Plan (or the unaffiliated plans) had this possibility been apparent. Applicants further note that the Commission recently issued an order under Section 6(c) granting the exemptions requested herein to applicants in very similar circumstances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) Voting Rights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not see any inherent conflicts arising between or among the interests of variable contract owners, or Plan participants because of the potential for the Plan to hold a controlling interest in a portfolio of the Fund. If the exemptions requested herein are granted to Life of Virginia and the Accounts, the Plan trustees generally would vote shares of the Fund held by them on behalf of the Plan pursuant to instructions from Plan participants. Thus, Plan participants' interests will be represented in the Fund in substantially the same manner as are those of Life of Virginia's variable contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that it is unlikely that Plan participants as a group vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract owners. Moreover, the trustees and other affiliated persons of the Plan will not be in a position to exercise undue influence over the Fund or any of its portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Also, with regard to resolving or remedying possible conflicts of interest related to voting, the Plan's investment in the Fund does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by traditional mixed funding as permitted by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15). Life of Virginia and the Accounts submit that just because the interests and opinions of Fund investors may differ does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Section 403(a) of ERISA provides that, with few exceptions, trustees of the unaffiliated plans would have the exclusive authority and responsibility for exercising voting rights attributable to their respective plan's investment securities. Where a named fiduciary appoints an investment adviser, the adviser has the authority and responsibility to exercise such voting rights unless the authority and responsibility is reserved to the trustee(s) or a non-trustee fiduciary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Life of Virginia and the Accounts generally expect many of the unaffiliated plans to have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise, in their discretion, voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the unaffiliated plans. Some of the unaffiliated plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers), or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

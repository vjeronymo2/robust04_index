			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> WORKERS PREFER STOCK TO BEING BOSS, POLL FINDS;  </P> <P> WORKPLACE: MANY OF THOSE SURVEYED FAVOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. BUT  MOST STILL WANT MANAGEMENT TO HANDLE THE TOUGH PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Americans have mixed feelings about gaining control of the companies they work  for, a new Gallup survey has found.  </P> <P> Many want to own stock in their employer, and most trust they would be better  stewards of their firm's long-term interests than are outside shareholders,  according to the poll of 1,035 people conducted on behalf of the Employee  Benefit Research Institute in Washington.  </P> <P> But although they want more of a voice in day-to-day matters, most of those  questioned want to work in companies with clear distinctions between employees  and management, and they want managers to make the important decisions.  </P> <P> The poll, taken in September for release today, affirms that some, but not all,  of the advantages cited by backers of employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs.  Increasingly popular, ESOPs now give 10 million workers stakes in more than  9,600 companies, among them Avis, Weirton Steel, Polaroid and Hospital Corp. of  America. In Southern California, companies with employee ownership plans are as  varied as L &amp; L Nursery Supply, a wholesaler in Chino, and Times Mirror,  publisher of the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> One group of supporters -- companies threatened by hostile takeovers -- has  used ESOPs to put stock into the hands of workers expected to be loyal to  current management in any contest over their company's future. The poll  confirms that expectation: 65% of respondents said they would not sell their  stock to a hostile investor even if offered 50% more than the market value of  their shares.  </P> <P> Other ESOP backers -- advocates of workplace democracy -- have contended that  employees are more productive and companies less buffeted by pressure to  perform in the short term when workers have a significant ownership stake in  their firms.  </P> <P> Indeed, the poll found that 69% of respondents said they believed that  employees would be more likely than outside stockholders to vote their shares  in the long-term interest of a company.  </P> <P> But the results were hazier as to stock ownership's likely effects on workers'  attitudes toward their jobs. A bare majority of those questioned, 51%, said  stock ownership would increase their "commitment" to their work, though smaller  percentages predicted a positive effect on their work quality, productivity or  job satisfaction.  </P> <P> Experts on employee ownership say ESOPs have their greatest impact on the  workplace in the roughly 40% of cases in which stock ownership is coupled with  heightened worker involvement in decision-making. Studies have found that firms  that pair stock ownership with employee involvement programs achieve annual  growth rates 8% to 11% higher than those of firms where employees get stock but  little else changes.  </P> <P> "Either one by itself, in theory, is supposed to produce that kind of result,"  said Martin A. Staubus, associate director of the ESOP Assn., a Washington  trade group. "Yet, in practice, we just see very spotty results when only one  approach is tried and a remarkably consistent result when they're coupled  together."  </P> <P> The survey results indicate a real, but not universal, hunger for stock  ownership. According to the poll, 44% of the respondents would trade their next  pay increase for stock in the company they work for. But another 44% would not.  </P> <P> The decision was easier when those polled were ask to choose between stock that  could be cashed out at retirement and employer-paid health insurance after  retirement. A decisive 69% preferred the insurance.  </P> <P> Nor does it appear that ownership lessens American workers' historic reserve  about controlling the destiny of their companies.  </P> <P> Most Americans, 56% in the poll, prefer to work for a company with a clear  management hierarchy, rather than for a more level, democratic organization --  though younger people, minorities and residents of Western states said they  were more open to a less structured workplace.  </P> <P> And while 61% of those questioned felt strongly that companies fail to give  workers enough say in decisions that affect them, large majorities want  management to remain firmly in control. Of those polled, 72% said management  alone should determine a company's long-term financial strategy, 71% said  bosses should set hiring and firing policies, and 56% said managers should set  rules for conduct at work.  </P> <P> "Employees really are not very interested in the overall policies of their  companies as long as things are going reasonably well," said Corey Rosen,  executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, a membership  and research group in Oakland.  </P> <P> Employee stock ownership, Rosen said, is like citizenship: "You're glad you  have the vote, but you don't really want to get involved in being a city  councilman."  </P> <P> The error range in the poll was plus or minus 3.1%, according to the Employee  Benefit Research Institute. Of those polled, 56% were employed full time and  17% worked for companies with employee stock ownership plans.  </P> <P> THE GROWTH OF ESOPS  </P> <P> Cumulative number of employee stock ownership plans  </P> <P> Cumulative number of employees covered by ESOPs, in millions  </P> <P> Source: National Center for Employee Ownership Inc., Oakland  </P> <P> EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Companies at least 50% owned by their workers  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:4.31IN:2.11IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Company  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Business, location  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Employees  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Science Applications  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Defense contractor, La Jolla  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> International  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Parsons Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Engineering, Pasadena  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Treasure Chest Advertising  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Printing, Glendora  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> National Steel &amp;

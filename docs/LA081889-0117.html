			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATARI MUST PAY BENEFITS TO 2 FIRED FEDERATED EXECUTIVES  </P> <P> Atari Corp. was ordered Thursday to pay severance and other benefits totaling  about $600,000 to two top officials of the Federated Group who were fired  shortly after Atari bought the retail chain two years ago.  </P> <P> Atari officials had tried to convince an Orange County Superior Court judge  that the two executives had forfeited the money through questionable business  decisions.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Jack K. Mandel was not persuaded by that argument.  </P> <P> Ruling only minutes after the four-day trial ended, he awarded former Federated  president Keith Powell of Laguna Hills about $260,000 in severance pay and  former vice president Merrill Lyons of Los Angeles $175,000.  </P> <P> "I feel like we've been exonerated," said Powell, now head of a door and window  company in San Juan Capistrano. "I'm just glad I had my day in court. All the  facts are finally in, and clearly we didn't do anything wrong."  </P> <P> Powell's and Lyons' life insurance policies will resume, and the men will also  receive interest on the severance payments, bringing the total value of the  award to about $600,000, their attorney said. The judge did, however, deny  punitive damages against Atari, a computer maker based in Sunnyvale.  </P> <P> The case is one of the first in a number of legal disputes arising from Atari's  purchase of Federated for $67 million. Atari has since soured on Federated, as  Federated's losses have continued.  </P> <P> Federated is now for sale, and about 15 of its 65 stores nationwide have closed  in the past few months. Atari had hoped Federated would be a retailer for its  computers and video games.  </P> <P> In the broadest of its legal claims, still pending in federal court in Northern  California, Atari argues that Federated officials and others close to the deal  duped Atari into buying a company that had been overvalued by as much as $43  million.  </P> <P> A similar line of argument was presented in the Orange County case. Atari  Chairman Jack Tramiel and other Atari officials testified that they were never  made aware of, and therefore probably would never have agreed to, several  business decisions Powell and Lyons made at the time the acquisition was being  completed. Powell and Lyons were fired a few months after Atari bought  Federated.  </P> <P> The decisions included the transfer at favorable terms of an $800,000  condominium to Federated commercial personality Shadoe Stevens and a $1-million  payment to the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. for its role in the  Atari acquisition.  </P> <P> Mandel, in an interview after the ruling, said that Powell and Lyons "acted  reasonably" in their business decisions and that Atari wrongly refused to honor  legitimate severance agreements.  </P> <P> At the same time, in denying punitive damages against Atari, Mandel said that  Atari officials may have had reason to question those business decisions and  that they did not act in bad faith in refusing to pay severance benefits.  </P> <P> Because of the denial of punitive damages, Powell described Mandel's ruling as  "bittersweet." "It's a disappointment to the extent that we still have a lot of  legal fees to pay, but we never had great expectations" about collecting  punitive damages, he said.  </P> <P> Officials with Atari could not be reached for comment after the ruling.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Provinces to benefit at expense of Paris THE French government plans to give more money to poorer regions of the country and relatively less to Paris over the next five years in an attempt to restrain the capital's congestion and economic dominance. Approximately 10.6m people live in greater Paris, nearly a fifth of the population. As part of a five-year planwhich it will legislate in the autumn, the government said this week it aimed to limit the greater Paris population to 11.8m by the year 2015, and to redeploy up to 30,000 civil servants to the provinces by the year 2000. A French appeal court yesterday confirmed a four-year prison sentence on the former head of the national blood bank, Mr Michel Garretta, for knowingly distributing Aids-contaminated blood products to haemophiliacs. The court, ruling after an appeal by former health officials accused of involvement in France's worst modern health scandal, also confirmed that Mr Jean-Pierre Allain, ex-director of transfusion research, should serve four years with two suspended. About 1,250 haemophiliacs were infected over a period up to the end of 1985. More than 300 have died.</p>

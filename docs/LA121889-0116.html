			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> JACKSON WON'T TAKE SONG CREDIT  </P> <P> Michael Jackson says his hit songs are not his doing, that he is merely a  conduit for tunes already written.  </P> <P> Jackson made the remarks in a 1984 home video taped at his home in Encino. It  was scheduled for broadcast tonight on "A Current Affair," said Jeff Erdel, a  spokesman for the syndicated program.  </P> <P> In the video, the reclusive star said he feels his songs existed somewhere else  before he wrote them.  </P> <P> "I feel I'm just a tunnel, a tube through which they come," Jackson said in the  video. "I mean, 'Billie Jean' and 'Beat It' and all those songs have been up  there somewhere and just came through to me. So even if I did it, I just can't  always take credit."  </P> <P> The video also shows Jackson playing with his pet llamas and performing scenes  from "Peter Pan."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: SOMETIMES, TOO MANY COOKS SPOIL ANYTHING  </P> <P> Would-be stand-up comic Norman Chad, currently making ends meet as a Washington  Post sports television columnist, has done the world a (dis)service by  collecting one-liners delivered by ESPN football commentator Beano Cook.  </P> <P> Herewith, a sampling:  </P> <P>  -- "Twenty years from now, this place (ESPN) is gonna be a rats' nest. And  I'll be dead, but unlike Brent Musburger, I won't be expected back in five  days."  </P> <P>  -- "I worry about these people whose biggest thing in life is following high  school prospects. They indeed lead a life of quiet desperation."  </P> <P>  -- "You only have to bat a thousand in two things -- flying and heart  transplants. Everything else, you can go four for five."  </P> <P> Trivia time: The Calgary Flames' Lanny McDonald this week became the 23rd  player in NHL history to reach the 1,000-point mark. Who was the first?  </P> <P> Punch and Gary: After taking that celebrated swing at teammate Keith Hernandez  during a photo session last week, the New York Mets' Darryl Strawberry  supposedly glared at catcher Gary Carter and said: "You're next."  </P> <P> And what does Carter think about that?  </P> <P> "I didn't hear him," Carter told Claire Smith of the Hartford Courant. "If I  did, I would have just waved him off. But I was too busy jumping in front of  the cameras, saying, 'Come on, guys, you don't need to shoot this stuff.' I  heard nothing but clicks . . . I felt like I was in the Japanese embassy.  </P> <P> "It was only talk (from Strawberry). If he'd swung at me, he would have had to  put me down for good, though."  </P> <P> Add Carter: Although Carter might be concerned about his less than stellar  season in 1988, New York management apparently is not.  </P> <P> Judging by the cool reaction the Mets gave to San Diego's suggestion that they  might like to look at minor league catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., Carter's job is  safe.  </P> <P> "Despite what everyone reads in the papers, our reports (on Alomar) do not  indicate that he is Moses incarnate," said Mets Vice President Joe McIlvaine.  </P> <P> Perceptive: CBS commentator Billy Packer, on the upcoming NCAA basketball  tournament:  </P> <P> "There are a lot of teams that can win a couple of games, but there aren't many  who can win it all."  </P> <P> Only one, in fact.  </P> <P> Chair man of the boards: Indiana Coach Bobby Knight says he can't understand  why more attention is paid to him than to the average basketball coach.  </P> <P> "What difference does it make who it is? How many coaches have kicked chairs,  thrown chairs, thrown jackets?" he asked the Washington Post's Anthony Cotton.  "Why is it me? If I threw 500 chairs in 900 games, that would be one thing, but  I've thrown one and now I'm the chair-thrower. . . .  </P> <P> Add Knight: "It seems to me that pounding on a table pales in significance to  97% of our players graduating. How many stories are written -- not about  academics -- where somewhere there's a line that says, 'By the way, Coach Jones  has graduated only 20% of his players in the last 10 years?'  </P> <P> "You'll never see it, but to me, that should be the same as sticking in a line  that says I threw a chair."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Gordie Howe of Detroit, who reached that mark on Nov. 27 1960.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> One of the old gems from broadcaster Jerry Coleman: "There's a fly to deep  center field. Winfield is going back, back. He hits his head against the wall!  It's rolling toward second base."  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Britain gets its way on frontier declaration BRITAIN yesterday persuaded its EC partners to water down a declaration on the abolition of frontier controls, so as not to prejudice its hard-line position on the preservation of border-checks on people. The declaration by internal market ministers outlines the measures which need to be taken to remove barriers to the free movement of goods after January 1, 1993. But Mr Richard Needham, British minister for trade, insisted that the draft declaration should be amended to make clear the UK's opposition to the removal of checks on people crossing internal EC frontiers. For example, the text no longer refers to the member states giving priority to the abolition of 'all border controls'. It is the second time this week that the UK has made clear its determination to preserve checks, against the wishes of the European Commission. On Monday, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, reiterated the country's determination to maintain controls over people. The Commission is threatening the UK with legal action if it does not remove border checks on travellers entering from other Community states.</p>

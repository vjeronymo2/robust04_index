Laar emphasized that the talks between the two countries  "have come to a deadlock" and "an impetus on a higher level than  that of experts" is needed to break the deadlock.    "Lately Russia has shown no wish to withdraw its troops from  our country," the Estonian premier said. "We confront a  political problem which will have to be solved by the top  leaders of both countries."    Laar voiced his hope that a meeting between the premiers or  foreign ministers of the two countries will eventually take  place, but he didn't consider it likely that the Estonian and  the Russian presidents would meet any time soon.    The Estonian-Russian negotiations reached an impasse after  Russia announced at the 17th round of talks at the beginning of  March that it may reconsider the final deadline for the troop  withdrawal and linked the pullout to the signing of an agreement  on "social guarantees" for retired Russian military and a  number of other issues. Estonia then declared it may break off  the talks. The parties did not set the date for the next round  of negotiations.    The Estonian Government proposed on March 4 that  consultations on a higher level be held.    Laar stressed in the interview to BNS that "the ball is now  in Russia's court" and that "Russia must show how serious its  intentions are."    Meanwhile, Aleksandr Udaltsov, a high-ranking official at  the  Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview to BNS on Wednesday [9  March] expressed doubt about the need to raise the level of  negotiations, saying the government delegations of the two  countries "haven't yet exhausted their potential."    Udaltsov proceeded to say that the two parties "don't see  eye  to eye in questions of principle, and consultations would only  make sense if there were a sign of some give and take, but  Russia has seen no such signs so far." The Russian diplomat  voiced his opinion that "there's no point in meeting for the  sake of meeting."    Laar regarded Udaltsov's statements as an indication that  Russia's approach to talks with Estonia "isn't serious enough."</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: US listings Germany's desire for its companies to be listed in New York without conforming to US accounting standards is both silly and cheeky. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, argued at the IMF meeting that German companies should be able to list unconditionally in the US because US companies can list in Germany. But such an unsubtle view of reciprocity ignores the well-established principle of national treatment in international commercial relations. This decrees that countries should grant access to foreign companies on the basis of treatment no better or worse than they accord to their own companies. There is no reason why national treatment should not apply in this case. Indeed, to allow German companies preferential treatment would be counter-productive. It would dilute the integrity of the New York market. Moreover, without improved disclosure, German companies will find it hard to attract their fair share of international capital wherever they are listed. It is no use their huffily complaining that without more concessions none of them will want to follow Daimler-Benz to New York. Theirs will be the greater loss in the long run if they elect not to.</p>

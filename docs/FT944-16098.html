			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (8): Controversy highlights difficulties - Efforts to harmonise European plugs and sockets To the layman, it might seem odd that the world's standards authorities cannot agree on a single set of standards for equipment as simple as the plugs and sockets used for electrical domestic appliances. But the controversy over present proposals for a harmonised European plug and socket system shows that reaching agreement on the issue is extremely difficult when so many different viewpoints are represented. Safety experts, consumer groups, plug and socket manufacturers, appliance makers and others have all had their say in the debate, and the various views and technical opinions expressed seem irreconcilable. Supporters of the proposal, which seems unlikely to be approved, believe a chance may be missed - perhaps for the next 20 years - to establish a standard that would benefit European consumers but could also pave the way for a world equivalent. They believe the saga raises important questions about the way such standards are decided. Their opponents, especially in the UK, say the proposal raises serious safety issues and could have disastrous industrial consequences. European politicians and bureaucrats bent on harmonisation for its own sake are accused of pushing the standards authorities into a corner. The relevant standards setting system works as follows: the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has responsibility for worldwide electrical standardisation. The European electrical standards body is Brussels-based Cenelec, whose policy is to adopt IEC standards as Cenelec standards as far as possible. Cenelec is organised into technical committees which prepare European standards on topics within their scope. In the case of plugs and sockets this is called TC 23X. Individual European countries are represented on this committee - for example the UK representation is provided and briefed by the British Standards Institution's technical committee PEL/4/3 covering installed electrical accessories. Countries do not have to adopt international standards, but if a European standard achieves the required number of weighted votes, all 18 Cenelec countries must adopt it, discarding in the process conflicting national standards. A derogation would be necessary to achieve exemption. Various schemes have been suggested - and rejected - for a worldwide standard, involving both flat-pin and round-pin plugs, since the IEC first discussed the issue in 1966. In Europe, which has about 20 conflicting systems, harmonisation first became a political issue in 1991 after Cenelec produced a document called Live with the Differences. Its laisser faire thrust - self-explanatory from the title - was a red rag to the European Commission, which demanded a fresh attempt to introduce a common system. Accordingly the technical committee TC 23X came up with a revised version of a standard first issued in 1986 by the IEC for round-pin plugs, known as 906-1 and so far implemented only in South Africa, but not totally. The Cenelec version proposed a small, moulded two-pin round plug - with a three-pin version for appliances that need earthing. The pins were widened from the 4.5mm in the IEC standard to 4.8mm so that they could fit most continental European systems without being 'dangerously compatible.' The UK plug and socket industry, backed by some safety experts, has been mounting a well-organised campaign against the proposal. It says the new Cenelec plug could, in some cases, be dangerously inserted into UK sockets, some of which have holes wide enough for the 4.8mm pins. It also says the British ring main system requires fused plugs, while the Cenelec proposal is for unfused plugs, as used on the continent's radial networks. Supporters of the proposal say the UK flat-pin system - introduced in 1947 and based on the standard BS 1363 - is overfused, has safety problems of its own, is awkward for arthritics and has outlived its usefulness because it is not suited to modern appliance use. The battle is also being waged on the economic front. Claims by the Electrical Installation Equipment Manufacturers Association that the new plugs could make half the UK industry's Pounds 1.3bn capital employed redundant are rebuffed by opponents. A recent report for the Department of Trade and Industry on the costs and benefits to the UK of plug and socket harmonisation in Europe said British consumers would face costs of Pounds 78m a year for 40 years if the UK backed the harmonisation and opted for 'a big bang' changeover. But Mr Simon Hossack, a leading campaigner for the harmonisation proposal, has told the DTI that the port contains fundamental errors which potentially turn its cost-benefit conclusions on their head. The Cenelec committee is now working on the final draft for its proposal, which would then be sent to the individual country committees for voting. The aim is for a result by around the middle of next year. However, with large countries having 10 votes and small countries five, it only takes opposition from three countries to exceed the 22 votes necessary to kill the proposal. Mr Hossack is concerned that the final proposal will almost certainly fail because of French, Spanish and Italian objections to the detailed specification for the body thickness at the point where the cable enters the plug. Then there is the fierce opposition of the UK and reservations among other national committees, notably Germany. Mr Hossack believes the saga shows that the standards setting process is not working. 'It has to be open, transparent and totally accountable, but at the moment it is putting standard-setting in the hands of manufacturers, rather than consumers.' He claims BSI has failed to take effective action to prevent plug and socket manufacturers from dominating the UK committee - a criticism echoed strongly last year by appliance manufacturers who felt their views were being ignored. But BSI rejects this, saying it has no commercial interest in, nor influence over, the conclusions reached by technical committees; it merely facilitates their work. It says PEL4/3 has trade association membership from manufacturers and users of plugs and sockets, consumers, government, safety experts, certifiers, testers, cable makers, academic institutions and many more. In contrast to Mr Hossack, Mr Dave Dossett, EIEMA's director, says the issue does not suggest the standards organisations have lessons to learn. Rather, he believes the European Commission takes 'the lion's share of the blame' for bulldozing the Cenelec committee into drawing up a standard without giving it time to do the job properly.</p>

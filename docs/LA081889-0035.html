			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP REVIEWS;  </P> <P> KING: '70S SOFT-ROCKER GETS TOUGH FOR THE '90S  </P> <P> On the cover of her signature album, "Tapestry," Carole King appeared as a  serene Madonna for the soft-rock early '70s, dressed in denim and wool and  surrounded by her knitting and her tabby cat.  </P> <P> On stage Wednesday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, there were  moments when a miniskirted, black-booted King resembled a Madonna of a  different sort -- or, to pick someone closer to her own age, perhaps a  high-stepping Tina Turner. For significant segments of her two-hour show before  a scaled-down but extremely happy house of about 2,500 fans, this 47-year-old  mellow-pop icon strutted and pranced and behaved like a frisky, fun-loving  rocker.  </P> <P> Not a minute of it was forced: Doing the Locomotion for all she was worth, King  seemed like a Natural Woman -- and the fun she was so clearly having proved  infectious.  </P> <P> This unexpected strong suit as a confident rocker gave King a thoroughly  winning hand that she played with command and finesse. When she wasn't bopping  out in front of her sharp, young, seven-member band, she could retreat to her  reliable grand piano and play those sure-fire selections from "Tapestry" -- 10  in all, sprinkled judiciously through the set, most of them in crowd-pleasing,  close-to-the-original form (the one major departure was an inspired, funk-rap  recasting of "Will You Love Me Tomorrow?").  </P> <P> King balanced those mostly introspective "Tapestry" songs with an even older,  but more exuberant batch from her '60s days as a Tin Pan Alley hit-generator  (along with lyricist/ex-husband Gerry Goffin). Splice in seven well-placed  songs from her solid new album, "City Streets," and the result was a show that  was familiar without being dated and that shifted constantly in musical focus  and emotional mood as it built to a wonderful concluding sequence: a feisty,  sexual "I Feel the Earth Move," touching solo encore readings of "A Natural  Woman" and "You've Got a Friend," and a romping finale with "The Locomotion,"  in which King and her band were helped out by opening act Wayne Toups and  Zydecajun. Accordionist Toups' warm-up set wouldn't have pleased cajun-zydeco  purists, but it should have satisfied anyone interested in zestful, well-played  roots rock. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Major seeks to shore up support Mr John Major was in a buoyant mood last night as he made a last-ditch attempt to shore up Tory support for tomorrow's European elections by attacking the 'seven deadly sins' of his Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents. The prime minister used the last Tory rally of the campaign to spell out issues on which the two main opposition parties were 'damagingly wrong'. Addressing 500 party activists in a west London hotel, he spoke of his 'passionate conviction' that Britain should play a part in shaping Europe's future and described 'this European Union of ours' as 'a very great venture'. But in a carefully-balanced speech he again conjured up a vision of a flexible, multi-speed Europe with member states free to act in their own way and at their own speed. Flanked by Union Jacks, Mr Major was firm on defence, saying there was no need 'for the Commission to be involved in the defence of Europe'. He sought to undermine opposition charges that the government had broken its promises on tax, saying that the Tories always planned for the long-term good of the country - even when taking decisions that were unpopular. Mr Major said Britain's EU veto, which the Tories would fight to keep, was just one of the subjects on which Conservative views were different from those of the other two leading parties. Others included: deregulation, which the Tories stood for, while the other two parties supported 'more regulation' and 'more powers' to go from Britain to Brussels; the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, which Labour and the Liberal Democrats wished to impose; a single currency, which the other two parties 'urged us to agree to . . . without leaving it to parliament to decide'; taxes; EU spending; and Britain's EU rebate, which Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, 'says he would renegotiate'. Mr Major was supported by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, who cautioned against the view that the Liberal Democrats represented 'some middle way' on Europe. In defiant mood, Sir Norman said Liberal Democrat policies were just as 'extreme' and 'damaging' as Labour's. Mr Major's recent comments about 'aggressive begging' were much closer to the views of the general public than the response of the Liberal Democrats, he said.</p>

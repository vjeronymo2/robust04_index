			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Homes Less Affordable in July: Homes in the United States became less  affordable in July as higher prices offset lower mortgage rates, the National  Assn. of Realtors said. The NAR said the housing affordability index, which  tracks home buying ability, was 98.0 in July, down from 99.1 in June. At 98.0,  a family earning the median income of $32,876 had 98% of the income needed to  qualify for conventional financing covering 80% of a home priced at $96,400.  The association said the national median price for existing homes of $96,400  was an increase of $3,000 from June. In the West, a family earning $34,907 had  only 73.5% of the income needed to purchase a home priced at $138,200.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING;  </P> <P> 11 BUICKS WILL HAVE A RACE OF THEIR OWN IN INDY 500  </P> <P> While the 10 Chevrolet-powered cars battle among themselves up front Sunday in  the 74th annual Indianapolis 500, there will be several "best in class"  struggles going on farther back in the pack.  </P> <P> Surprisingly, there are more Buicks, 11, than any engine in the race. Equally  surprising, not one of them is in a 1990 model chassis.  </P> <P> Randy Lewis, campaigning a 1988 Penske-Buick for Frank Arciero, is the fastest  Buick qualifier with a 218.412-m.p.h. run that put him in the fourth row. He is  also the fastest qualifier in an older-model car, with any make engine.  </P> <P> Arciero, an Orange County construction magnate and winery owner, has  established a reputation for bringing young drivers to Indianapolis Motor  Speedway to give them their first chance at the 500. Among them have been Al  Unser in 1965, Pete Halsmer in 1982, Randy Lanier in 1986, Fabrizio Barbazza in  1987 and Didier Theys last year.  </P> <P> Lanier and Barbazza were each an Indy 500 rookie of the year.  </P> <P> So it was a surprise when Arciero tabbed Lewis, 44, a veteran of three 500s and  20 years in racing, and Rich Vogler, 39, to drive his cars this year.  </P> <P> "We hadn't been having much luck here, and neither had Lewis, so I thought  maybe if we got together, it might give us both a new lease on life," Arciero  said.  </P> <P> Lewis responded with the fastest four laps of his career, but Vogler crashed  twice and failed to make the race.  </P> <P> "Here, the Buicks are fantastic," Lewis said as he watched team Manager Dennis  McCormick direct the changing of an engine for today's final testing. "Anywhere  else, its unfair to run with the rules the way they are. Here, we get 10 more  inches (of manifold boost), and that is about 120 more horsepower.  </P> <P> "The Buick engine is a little heavier than the Chevy, and the center of gravity  is higher, which makes it more difficult to get the chassis working. The key to  running Indy is to go flat-out through the short chutes. If you can't run fast  through them, it doesn't matter how much horsepower you have."  </P> <P> The Indy 500 is run under United States Auto Club rules, but the rest of the  Indy car season is under Championship Auto Racing Teams rules. The only  significant difference is in the amount of manifold boost permitted the Buick  V6 stock-block engine against the V8s.  </P> <P> "My goal is still to come here with a new car and a competitive engine," Lewis  said, "but in the meantime, I think running a Buick for Frank Arciero is the  best alternative. I still see flashes of the way I drove when I was racing  Formula Threes in Europe 20 years ago and won races against drivers like (world  Formula One champions) James Hunt and Alan Jones.  </P> <P> "I know I used to have it. Now I want to show that I still have it."  </P> <P> Other Buicks will be raced Sunday by Tony and Gary Bettenhausen, Kevin Cogan,  Theys, Tom Sneva, Stan Fox, Jim Crawford, Billy Vukovich III, John Paul Jr. and  Rocky Moran.  </P> <P> Dominic Dobson, driving a 1990 Lola-Cosworth for Bruce Leven, a Seattle  businessman, is the fastest of the Cosworth-powered drivers. He qualified at  219.230 m.p.h., with one lap at 220.162.  </P> <P> "I only did one lap at 220, but it does make you feel as though you've moved  into a new league," Dobson said. "At that speed, the short chutes tend to  disappear. You have two long straightaways connected by two long U-turns. It  felt like I surpassed a barrier, like when I hit 210 in 1988. It would be  interesting to go 225. I think the short chutes would even be shorter."  </P> <P> Dobson is one of two drivers used by the British-based factory in developing  the Cosworth DFS short-stroke Indy engine. Scott Brayton, of Dick Simon's team,  is the other.  </P> <P> "The DFS has more r.p.m.'s and more power at the higher end, but the Chevys  come off the corners quicker," Dobson said. "Cosworth is working on a brand-new  1991 engine with no derivative from the current models. They are working with a  clean sheet of paper. That's what Chevy did a few years ago, and it worked.  </P> <P> "I would like to will the Cosworth in front of the Chevys on Sunday, but I must  be realistic. We hope for attrition, to have a better race setup, to be able to  concentrate on a good driveable car, one that's as good for the second half of  the race as the first half. We also need good pit stops.  </P> <P> "Can we win? That's theoretical. We must concentrate on doing the best job we  can. We want the engine running perfectly. We want the chassis where it should  be. We want to have good communication.  </P> <P> "We'll take what we can get, as long as we do the best we can, we'll be  satisfied. We wouldn't be happy finishing second and thinking we didn't do a  good job."  </P> <P> Cosworth engines will also be in cars driven by Brayton, Tero Palmroth, Pancho  Carter and Dean Hall.  </P> <P> There will also be three Judd engines for Raul Boesel, Geoff Brabham and Scott  Goodyear; two Porsches, for John Andretti and Teo Fabi, and two Alfa Romeos for  Roberto Guerrero and Al Unser.  </P> <P> Up front, however, in the first three rows, the fastest nine cars are all  powered by the Chevy engine developed and built in England by Ilmor  Engineering.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- Ascot Park in Gardena will present its "Salute to the Indy 500"  for California Racing Assn. sprint cars Saturday night, honoring those members  -- such as Troy Ruttman, Parnelli Jones, Mike Moseley, Bill Vukovich Jr.,  Johnny Rutherford, Al Unser and Al Unser Jr. -- who went on to drive in the  Indianapolis race. Bubby Jones of Glen Avon will be trying to win the holiday  feature 50-lap race for the fourth time. Only one man has four victories in the  event, Billy Wilkerson of Temple City.  </P> <P> This will be the last Memorial Day Day weekend for the 34-year-old track. The  late J.C. Agajanian, who signed the expiring 15-year lease to promote sprint  cars at the track, will be inducted into the Auto Racing Hall of Fame at  Indianapolis this weekend.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club Western States midget drivers, headed by  point leader Sleepy Tripp and 1989 champion Robbie Flock, will be in action  Saturday night at Ventura Raceway with the first race of the season on the  seaside quarter-mile oval. On Sunday evening the action moves to Ascot Park's  quarter-mile. The smaller three-quarter midgets will also compete on both  programs.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY MOTORCYCLES -- Mike Faria of Colton will go after his third victory in  four starts tonight at Ascot Park's Southbay Speedway in the kickoff event of a  five-day holiday celebration at the Gardena track. Speedway action moves to  Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa on Friday evening.  </P> <P> STOCK CARS -- NASCAR sportsman, hobby stocks, jalopies and a destruction derby  will make up Saturday night's program at Saugus Speedway. John Cran of Reseda  will be seeking his third straight victory in the 25-lap main event for  sportsman cars. . . . Marcus Mallett continues his bid to become the first  black driver to win a track championship when he goes after his third main  event win in the pro stock class in Monday night's NASCAR racing at Ascot Park.  Mallet, who has five top-five finishes in six starts, is the current point  leader. Also on the program will be bomber oval cars, figure 8 races and a  demolition derby. . . . Sportsman, modifieds, street and bomber stocks will  compete Saturday night at Cajon Speedway in El Cajon.  </P> <P> JET SKI -- The International Jet Ski Boating Assn. will open its eight-event  national tour with races at Long Beach Marine Stadium Sunday and Monday. Racing  starts at 10 a.m. each day. The pro finals are set for about 3 p.m. Monday. The  defending champion is Jeff Jacobs of El Cajon.  </P></p>

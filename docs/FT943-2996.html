			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Company chiefs on shorter contracts The service contracts of chief executives are getting shorter, according to a survey of senior managers' pay and conditions, Vanessa Houlder writes. Monks Partnership, the remumeration advisers, found that the percentage of chief executives of parent companies with contracts of three years or longer had fallen from 63 per cent to 55 per cent in the past year. At subsidiary board level fewer than 10 per cent of managing directors or general managers had three-year contracts. The shorter-term nature of the contracts reflects criticism of long-term contracts by institutional investors. The total earnings of UK directors rose an average 8 per cent this year compared with 5.8 per cent last year. Much of the increase was the result of larger bonuses.</p>

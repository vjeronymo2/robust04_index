			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Mozambique peace urged A South African delegation yesterday met Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and the leader of the former rebel movement Renamo to urge peaceful transition to democratic government after multi-party elections more than a week ago. This follows warnings by Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama that he may not recognise the poll results, due next week. Partial results, released yesterday, showed Mr Chissano and his ruling party well ahead of his challengers. In the presidential race, Mr Chissano had 62 per cent of the vote at more than 2,000 of the 7,444 polling stations, compared with 26 per cent for Mr Dhlakama. In the vote for parliament, Mr Chissano's Frelimo led with 52 per cent, compared with Mr Dhlakama's Renamo on 30 per cent. The possibility of renewed violence, which racked the country for 16 years, worries Mozambique's neighbours. The South African delegation included Defence Minister Joe Modise, Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi and Mr Aziz Pahad, deputy foreign minister.</p>

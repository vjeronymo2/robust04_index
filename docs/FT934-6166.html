			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Mexican move on investor rights: Law would extend Nafta-style protection worldwide The Mexican government has sent to congress a foreign investment law to give investors worldwide almost all the rights enjoyed by the US and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new legislation, which is certain to be approved, would replace the 1973 law that substantially restricted foreign investment. While the 1973 law has been partly modified by subsequent regulations, foreigners have complained that the rules do not offer legal transparency, and still protect important sectors. The law permits foreign investment in all areas of the economy and under the same terms granted to the US and Canada under Nafta, except the financial sector. It eliminates all performance requirements for foreign investment, such as obligations to transfer technology or meet local content rules, that govern industries such as car parts and computers. Under Nafta, Mexico agreed to open up only partly some sectors such as airlines to foreign investment. Others, such as the car parts industry, secondary petrochemicals and mining, were fully opened. Nafta also put into law existing regulations that permitted 100 per cent investment in most businesses. Such rules will now apply to all countries. However, investors outside the US and Canada would not have recourse to arbitration panels in disputes over investment, as envisaged under Nafta, nor would they be guaranteed the same treatment as domestic investors. Mr Pedro Noyola, under-secretary for foreign investment in the Trade Ministry, said Mexico was ready to open talks with countries on investor protection on a bilateral basis. The proposed law, like Nafta, does not open up strategic sectors such as oil and satellites to private investment; other sectors, such as television and internal transport are reserved exclusively to Mexicans. The law goes further than Nafta in permitting foreigners to invest within 100km of the border and 50km of the coasts through Mexican incorporated companies in industry, hotels or commerce. The legislation would limit foreign investment in banks and brokerages to 30 per cent, and 49 per cent in insurance companies. Labour Minister Arsenio Farell said yesterday there would be no revision to Mexico's federal labour law. Trade unions had objected to proposed reforms, including the scrapping of a seniority clause that restricted companies' ability to promote workers and proposals to speed up the arbitration of disputes.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Art of women reappraised - A pioneering exhibition in Norwich Popular histories of 20th century art have been projected as a series of dramatic moments and movements. The moments are signalled by momentous works  -Picasso's 'Demoiselles d'Avignon' for example  - the movements are those of Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction(ism), Post-Modernism. What is generally overlooked is that the 'isms' of modernism have been 'hisms', and that star artists and popular icons are only the tip of a cultural iceberg. Ten Decades, a pioneering exhibition at the Norwich Gallery, examines the careers of 10 British women artists who participated very fully in the art of their times - a span of most of this century. It is possible to hype the contributions of some of the included artists - Eileen Agar, the flamboyant and successful Surrealist; Gertrude Hermes, the print-maker and sculptor who shaped graphic conventions in the 1930s; Barbara Hepworth with a guaranteed seat in sculptors' Parnassus. But the aim of the exhibition, curated by Dr Katy Deepwell, is precisely to question this sort of myth-making. By presenting work once at the forefront of avant-garde practice within the context of an individual artistic development and professional career, we are encouraged to examine the criteria which have shaped art history and cultural institutions, and question why many of these women artists have been marginalised. The 10 artists belong to a 'birth cohort': all were born between 1897 and 1906. They have little else in common, being from widely varying backgrounds and having pursued very different careers except in their professional commitment to practising as painters, sculptors, print-makers, muralists and their identification with the different art movements of their times. What pulls the exhibition together, as a visual presentation as well as a coherent argument, is the way in which each group of works is hung next to text panels of the artist's biography. Apart from being extremely informative, this is also a strategy to subvert the usual pop-histories of art, which focus on headline events rather than artistic development. The exhibition has been restricted to three works by each of the 10 artists, irrespective of their standing. The works come from different periods in the artists' lives in order to indicate change and development - again a strategy not often allowed in monocular historical survey exhibitions, where works are carefully selected to present a coherent picture. Ten Decades is one of those rare exhibitions where the intentions of the curator are made explicit through the presentation, and one does not have to mull through an immense catalogue to try and tease them out. Katy Deepwell knows her material so thoroughly and is so politically astute that question and strategy are identified. Nevertheless, three works are not sufficient to inform one about unfamiliar artists and if the venue had allowed, this could happily have been a much larger exhibition. The works, chosen from private collections, are not necessarily key works, and selection could have been tighter. However there are some wonderful inclusions: Sylvia Melland's 'Girder' etching of 1964 is one of her most successful prints, dramatic and vibrant. Although there is nothing referential of Japan in the work, the confident handling of the semi-abstract girder forms, and the lively texture of the sugar-lift, remind one of Hokusai's nice balance between stylised elegance of form and toughness of organisation. Nan Youngman's 'Steel Works, Ebbw Vale' of 1953 is one of the finest works on the exhibition, both distanced and moving. The little figures in the painting, overwhelmed by the industrial landscape, are ciphers and not the stylised mannequins of Lowry, whom, at a brief glance they seem to invoke. Where Lowry reduces urban and industrial decay to faux-nave games, Youngman's technical control allows her to imbue the scene with dignity and melancholy. A much later work, 'Path to the Sea' of 1976, exhibits the same combination of awesome technique and evocation of mood; here the simple composition and pale palette is handled with great delicacy and restraint, Lilian Holt is also very well represented with a glowing, pulsating painting of broad and paint-loaded strokes evoking 'City Construction, Night'. Urbanism has been central to the modernist project of the 20th century, so it is not surprising that many of the women on this exhibition have used the city as their subject matter. There is also a very fine charcoal drawing of David Bomberg from 1928 - to my mind a more searching, competent drawing than Bomberg himself ever produced - which raises questions about the relationship between men and women artists. It is well documented that Lilian Holt's commitment to her partner David Bomberg and her family took precedence over her career as an artist. Part of the problem, as Dr Deepwell points out in the catalogue, is not so much that 20th century women artists have been excluded from an established profession as the fact that 'Being an artist is frequently seen as being, and popularly mythologised as, more of a vocation than a profession.' We all know that one can assume multiple roles as well as participating in a profession; but vocations are decreed by a patriarchal world to be singular and indivisible. The customs of the art world are in many ways as mysterious and fixed as the rules of Trobriand Island Cricket. Deepwell deconstructs an awful lot of them in this subtle little exhibition. Whereas the art world judges artistic success by the venues and frequency of exhibitions, Deepwell investigates the other, equally significant ways, in which her 10 artists have engaged in 20th century art - through teaching; through participating in the war effort (although only Evelyn Gibbs was 'officially' commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee which favoured male artists); through organising artists groups and historically-significant campaigns. Ten Decades is not a competitive or a combative exhibition, polarising the activities of male and female artists, nor does it bemoan the historical lack of opportunities for women and present them as victims. Instead it poses interesting questions through its intelligent presentation of a rarely-seen body of work. Norwich Gallery until May 30</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Leading Article: On workfare THERE IS nothing like a large budget deficit to focus the minds of politicians on how to constrain the government's welfare spending. Even at the best of times, societies cannot prosper if large and growing sections of the population subsist on state handouts. Mr Major is right to ask whether paying benefits 'without offering or requiring any activity in return' is in the interests of either society or welfare dependents. The prime minister is not alone in wanting to find ways to sharpen incentives for people to move from welfare dependency into employment, although the end of a lingering recession may not be the most politic time to voice the issue. President Bill Clinton has also talked of extending the scope of workfare schemes, which require unemployed US welfare recipients of working age, the large majority of whom are female single parents, to participate in community work or training schemes, in return for more generous benefits. Nor, despite yesterday's howls of anguish from opposition front-benchers and trade union leaders, will Labour be able to avoid confronting the fiscal and political difficulties which welfare-dependency throws up. Labour's Social Justice Commission will inevitably spend the next 18 months trying to find creative ways to attack poverty and spread opportunity against the electorate's desire not to pay higher taxes in order to fund universal and non-conditional benefits. Yet proponents of compulsion must ensure that their schemes have the intended effects. Here the US experience spins a cautionary tale. While workfare has been the chosen method for encouraging welfare mothers back to work, unemployed American men without children receive little or no welfare support at all after the first six months of unemployment. The consequence is not a markedly higher employment rate among US men than in those European countries where unemployment benefits last indefinitely. Instead a growing minority of US men, particularly young blacks with poor educational qualifications, have chosen black market activities or crime over poorly paid employment. Nor has the UK been immune from the effects of rising crime and drug use among the young unemployed as their relative wages have fallen and access to state benefits has been restricted. Linking benefits to participation in public works schemes for a nominal financial reward risks pushing more young British men out of legal society into crime. The solution to the growing number of welfare dependents must, instead, involve some combination of better training schemes, the removal of tax and benefit obstacles to part-time employment and recruitment subsidies for hard-to-employ groups such as the young long-term unemployed. Only if attractive opportunities are provided does the government have a good case for compelling its citizens to accept them.</p>

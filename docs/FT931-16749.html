			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Observer: Death of a Springbok South African rugby fans will be hoping that the passing of rugby supremo Danie Craven ushers in a new era for the beleaguered national team whose return to international competition has been less than triumphant. Even worse than performances on the pitch - played five tests, lost four - has been the attitude off it, where rugby has given every impression of being deeply mired in the symbolism of old South Africa. Unlike cricket, rugby is a classic contact sport and this is one of the reasons why black South Africans were so long ostracised. Having presided over the game for more than 40 years, Craven must inevitably take some of the blame. But though he may not have been fully prepared for the new South Africa, nor was he ever much in sympathy with the old regime. Indeed, he always prided himself on being a supporter of Jan Smuts and was never close to the Afrikaans political establishment. He was no friend of the ANC, though, and spent much of his time telling it to stop meddling in rugby's affairs. Craven's replacement has yet to emerge. His co-president, Ebrahim Patel, has the right political credentials, but no support base. Some believe that Louis Luyt, the maverick Transvaal rugby boss and former fertiliser magnate, is the only man for the job, but he suffers from the opposite defect. Former captains like Morne du Plessis and Wynand Claasen have the right profile, but haven't served administrative time. Ironically, it fell yesterday to cricketing chief Ali Bacher, ANC sports head Steve Tshwete and the South African and Indian cricketers playing in the test at Newlands to be the first to mark Craven's passing with a minute's silence. Rugby fans must be hoping that someone of similar political and diplomatic skills to Bacher can now be found to make their sport more internationally acceptable.</p>

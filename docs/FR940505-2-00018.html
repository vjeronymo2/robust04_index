This system is the method by which international personal property shipment rates will be submitted for Department of Defense (DOD)-sponsored international household goods (HHG) and unaccompanied baggage (UB) shipments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received before July 5, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be mailed to Headquarters, Military Traffic Management Command, ATTN: MTOP&hyph;T&hyph;NI, room 621, 5611 Columbia Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041&hyph;5050. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Alex Moreno, (703) 756&hyph;2383. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> MTMC's intention to institute an EDI program for acquisition of carrier rates is in furtherance of the following policy and directives: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy Memorandum directing use of American National Standards Institute EDI standards, dated May 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. 41 Code of Federal Regulations, &sect;101&hyph;41.007, permitting use of EDI to document and pay transportation bills, April 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Defense Management Review Decision 941 directing use of EDI standards, dated November 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MTMC proposes the use of EDI to receive, return, file, and use rates submitted by HHG and UB carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The meetings listed below were held to discuss use of EDI for billing and rate filing purposes. The carrier industry was invited to attend these meetings and was briefed on MTMC's desire to convert from a magnetic tape media for rate submissions to an EDI process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. DOD/Industry EDI Personal Property Working Group meetings on June 14, 1991, and January 29&hyph;31, 1992, at Bethesda, Maryland. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. DOD/Industry EDI Personal Property Working Group meeting on March 23&hyph;25, 1992, at Indianapolis, Indiana. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposed change, carriers will be able to electronically file their rates on a daily basis during filing windows, and will be electronically notified by the next business day of the results, i.e., total rates received and rates rejected with a rejection error code. For the initial filing (I/F) window, carriers will have a 3-week period, prior to the I/F deadline, in which they can add, delete, or change rates on a daily basis. Upon completion of the I/F window, MTMC will notify all interested parties via an electronic bulletin board of all rate levels filed by traffic channel, including which carrier established the rate. If two or more carriers establish this rate level, each carrier will be shown. MTMC will continue to verify all carriers filing rates in the I/F window have a letter of intent on file at each applicable installation. There will be approximately a 3-week period after notification of established low rates and the me-too (M/T) window to allow carriers an opportunity to determine their M/T rates. Carriers will have a 2-week period, prior to the M/T filing deadline, in which they can either add or change M/T rates on a daily basis. However, once both I/F and M/T filing deadlines have passed, no further modifications to those rates or other rates will be allowed. The mistake-in-rate filing (MMIRF) process will be included in the window period. The input rates will be edited for suspect rates and returned to the carriers so they may make ``MIRF-like'' changes. There will be two cancellation periods during each 6-month cycle in which carriers will be allowed to cancel rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this proposed change is to convert the rate filing process from a magnetic tape media to electronic submission. Initially, MTMC will accept electronic mail capabilities or in the public standard format of ANSI X.12 Transportation Services Tender Transaction Set 602 using EDI technology. However, MTMC plans to transition over the next 18 months to ANSI X.12 602 public standard format as the sole method for submission of international personal property rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is anticipated that many automated data processing (ADP) firms currently filing magnetic tape on behalf of carriers will continue to provide rate filing services under the electronic submission requirement. Carriers that elect to use the services of these ADP firms will only have to notify MTMC, in writing, of the firm representing them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For interested parties who wish to file rates using EDI procedures, the first step will be to obtain the services of a Value Added Network (VAN) for either X.25 protocol for the EDI 602 format or X.400 protocol for the electronic mail proprietary format. The VAN will be the conduit for exchanging rate submissions with MTMC. The next step will be to complete a Trading Partner Agreement and submit to MTMC. A Trading Partner Agreement provides the terms and conditions governing the exchange of administrative information between carriers and MTMC, and legally binds both parties to those terms. The final step will be to complete three successful transmissions of rates without a communications or technical error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All international personal property rates will be filed via electronic submission for the International Winter 1995 (IS95) cycle, rates effective October 1, 1995. It is anticipated that the I/F window will be in May 1995 for a 3-week period. Magnetic tapes will no longer be accepted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOD-approved international personal property carriers and current ADP rate tape filers will be provided instructions on filing electronic rate submissions after comments received as a result of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice have been reviewed. Instructions for filing rates electronically will also be provided on the AT&amp;T Bulletin Board. The instructions for filing electronic international personal property rates will include procedures for filing a Trading Partner Agreement, and procedures for testing transmission of rates, along with MTMC points of contact for these procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Kenneth L.

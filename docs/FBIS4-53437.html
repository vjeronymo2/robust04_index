			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japanese banks have  suspended handling remittances of dollars to North Korea  following allegations that such money might have been used for  development of nuclear weapons, banking sources said Thursday  [19 May].    The move follows a decision by a bank handling most of the  money remitted to North Korea not to serve as an intermediary on  behalf of other Japanese banks, the sources said.    Ashikaga Bank, a regional bank based in Tochigi Prefecture,  has told other Japanese banks that it would not remit dollars to  North Korea for them, the sources said.    Some of the Ashikaga Bank's customers are Korean residents  of  Japan who use the bank to remit money to North Korea as the bank  is a main bank for a North Korean-born owner of a pachinko  machine maker, the sources said.    Ashikaga Bank issued statements that the bank stopped  intermediating with other banks in remitting dollars to North  Korea some time ago, but is still handling such transactions by  its own customers.    The bank also said it is not the sole bank in Japan that is  handling money transactions to North Korea.    But a Finance Ministry official confirmed the suspension of  dollar remittances to North Korea, describing it as a voluntary  action.    "It's each bank's own decision to suspend remittance of  dollars. Remittance of money in yen and (German) marks is still  carried out as in the past, so I don't believe (banks) are  discriminating against North Korea in money remittance," the  official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.    The United States has reportedly asked Japan to regulate  remittance of money to North Korea as Pyongyang is suspected of  using the money to promote its alleged nuclear weapons program.    It is not known how much money is actually remitted to North  Korea from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum  at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills.    Then-Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa pledged in February to  take appropriate action if the UN Security Council adopts a  resolution calling for economic sanctions against North Korea.    Asked at a news conference about the reported suspension of  dollar remittances to North Korea from Japan, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said the government will look into the  matter. He did not elaborate.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> QUARTERBACK OPTION TANTALIZES KENNEDY  </P> <P> At 6-foot-5, Kennedy High quarterback Mike McMullen is a full head taller that  teammate Tavarus Logi. In terms of ability, however, the two stand nose to  nose.  </P> <P> The battle for quarterback is so close, in fact, that Coach Bob Francola might  alternate the pair, something he tried while coaching quarterbacks Danny Larson  of Birmingham and Jesse Wallace of Monroe in a recent all-star game.  </P> <P> "They split series, and it didn't seem to affect the team," Francola said. "But  I know Granada (Hills) tried it last year and it didn't work out that well."  </P> <P> Both McMullen and Logi are capable starters, but they are cut from different  cloth. Logi is more mobile and is a better rollout quarterback. McMullen is a  pocket passer and has better field vision. During summer passing-league  competition, the two alternated, but changing the entire offensive scheme with  each series might prove troublesome during a real game.  </P> <P> "Right now, Mike's a little ahead," Francola said. "I'm not sure what we'll end  up doing. We've never had two that were neck and neck before."  </P> <P> Man in the middle: His name sounds like something from a detective novel, which  as it turns out, is oddly appropriate. Those looking for information on Sam  Hardy's performance as a junior at Taft better bring along their sleuthing  tools.  </P> <P> According to Coach Tom Stevenson, Hardy started two games at inside linebacker  last season before he was removed from the team for disciplinary reasons. Hardy  is back for his senior year, however, and could be one to watch.  </P> <P> "He's potentially the best player we've ever had there," said Stevenson, now in  his sixth year. "He's a great athletic kid."  </P> <P> Kid? Stevenson must be kidding. Hardy stands 6-4 and weighs 245 pounds.  </P> <P> Trivia time: Of the eight teams in the Northwest Valley Conference, how many  finished with winning records in 1989? (Answer below).  </P> <P> Multitalented: Royal's Tim Ross is a two-time all-Marmonte League safety, yet  Super Prep magazine considers Ross the third-best linebacker prospect in the  Far West. According to Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt, Ross (6-4, 205) will play  as many as seven defensive positions this season.  </P> <P> Uebelhardt said he doesn't want Ross to play only in the secondary in a league  that traditionally is run-oriented.  </P> <P> "If he's the best defensive player in the western United States, which I've  been told, then I don't want him lining up 15 yards from the ball," Uebelhardt  said.  </P> <P> Kirksey out: Kris Kirksey's comeback attempt at Simi Valley ended this week  when the former Camarillo running back decided against risking further damage  to his injured knee.  </P> <P> Kirksey, who rushed for 670 yards at Camarillo before he injured the knee  midway through the 1988 season, missed all of last season. He transferred to  Simi Valley and reinjured the knee while playing baseball last spring.  </P> <P> He practiced with Simi Valley for two weeks this fall.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Only Granada Hills, which finished 10-1 overall, played better  than .500 ball last year. Next closest were El Camino Real (6-6) and Taft  (5-5).  </P> <P> Increasing numbers: Fred Cuccia, who took over the Poly football program last  August, had approximately 60 players competing for positions on the varsity and  B team squads a year ago. This season, after a full year of recruiting  basketball and baseball players, Cuccia has nearly 100 athletes in his program.  </P> <P> "The best athletes in the school are playing football now," Cuccia said during  a conditioning workout last week. "The lettermen liked the program last year  and told the basketball and baseball teams about it."  </P> <P> Staff writers Steve Elling, Paige A. Leech and Jeff Riley contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

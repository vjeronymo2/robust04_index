			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS AT THE BOWL  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Philharmonic, ever eager to brave new cultural frontiers,  couldn't muster 76 trombones for the concert at Hollywood Bowl on Thursday.  </P> <P> But the management did come up with seven -- count 'em, seven -- trumpets.  </P> <P> Why?  </P> <P> Don't ask your faithful, ever-befuddled scribe.  </P> <P> The rather strange, rather vacuous, evening began with the entire orchestra  assembled on stage for the national anthem as conducted by David Zinman, the  accommodating guest-maestro from Baltimore. However, the Banner ritual was  dispatched, con brio, by only the seven tootling soloists, their efforts  occasionally punctuated by a dauntless drum-roller.  </P> <P> After that, a third of the Philharmonic ensemble dutifully marched off stage so  a modest Mozartean configuration could get on with the throat-clearing business  of the "Prague" Symphony.  </P> <P> The logistics proved confusing. The performance proved more notable for clarity  than for charm.  </P> <P> Then it was trumpet time again. Hakan Hardenberger, the Swedish virtuoso,  served as splendid protagonist for the Philharmonic premiere of Henri Tomasi's  Concerto of 1949, a sticky and dated melange of jazzy indulgence, movie-music  pap and mock-Stravinsky pretense. With luck, it will turn out to have been the  Philharmonic derniere.  </P> <P> Intermission followed this anticlimax, after which the orchestra got another  rest. The assembled trumpeters offered some crisp but inconsequential,  eminently contrapuntal blasting on their own.  </P> <P> In the modest flourishes of Heinrich Biber's Sonata (1668), Hardenberger was  joined by a quartet of Philharmonic stalwarts -- Thomas Stevens, Donald Green,  Rob Roy McGregor and Boyde Hood -- plus a stellar guest: Doc Severinsen.  </P> <P> The Generalmusikdirektor of Johann Carson's "Tonight Schau" also participated  in the flamboyant Baroque exercises of Johann Ernst Altenburg's Concerto for  seven trumpets (1795), which required the additional services of Irving Bush.  In both chamber-music excursions, Zinman beat time efficiently, Mitchell Peters  thumped the timpani deftly and Zita Carno provided discreet continuo support on  a portable organ.  </P> <P> And what did this so-called trumpet summit have to do with a symphony concert?  </P> <P> Nothing.  </P> <P> How did it project in a 18,000-seat amphitheater (with 9,097 in attendance)?  </P> <P> Meekly.  </P> <P> The underemployed orchestra got to mutter the last word, and not exactly a  strenuous one, with Richard Strauss' short-winded and now-hackneyed "Till  Eulenspiegel."  </P> <P> The playing was fine. The amplification system cooperated splendidly. Zinman,  ever efficient, conducted like a man who wanted to get out of there as quickly  as possible.  </P> <P> One couldn't blame him.  </P></p>

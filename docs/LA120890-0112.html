			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO AGREES TO TALK ABOUT BINATIONAL AIRPORT  </P> <P> After initial meetings this week with a San Diego-area delegation, Mexican  officials have agreed to further talks on the proposed binational airport on  Otay Mesa, which would be run jointly by Tijuana and San Diego.  </P> <P> A senior official in the Mexican Communications and Transportation Ministry  said Friday that the government is willing to discuss the idea, but would  prefer that U.S. federal officials be included in future talks.  </P> <P> The two sides agreed to create an informal joint study group to explore the  issue further, said delegate Jack Doyle, mayor of Santee and president of the  San Diego Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> "Just to have a willingness (from the Mexican government) to participate with  us in gathering more information is encouraging," Doyle said.  </P> <P> The meetings Thursday and Friday were the first direct attempt to gauge the  Mexican government's interest in a binational airport, although San Diego  officials have discussed the possibility intermittently for 20 years. Advocates  see a binational airport as the best solution to crowding and lack of room for  expansion at Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> The Mexican government's willingness to consider the airport is seen as an  encouraging sign after reports in August that Communications and Transportation  Secretary Andres Caso Lombardo opposed the idea.  </P> <P> "They have an ongoing plan and feel that their needs will be adequately met  with their current plan," Doyle said after meeting with officials in the  ministry. "However, they said they would be willing to look at other  information."  </P> <P> The proposal is to build an airport between Brown Field Air Station on Otay  Mesa and Tijuana's Rodriguez International Airport. Baja California state  officials have called for expansion of Rodriguez airport, saying it is crowded  and needs more air-control equipment.  </P> <P> The California-Mexico Project at the University of Southern California has  termed the airport one of "several worthwhile proposals that have thus far been  stymied by funding constraints or by the political hurdles to cross-border  projects."  </P> <P> However, opponents Reps. Jim Bates (R-San Diego) and Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado)  and San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner say the idea is impractical because of  jurisdiction complications.  </P> <P> Binational airport advocate Ron Roberts, whose City Council district includes  Lindbergh Field, has said the critics dismiss the project "without even  trying."  </P> <P> Roberts led the delegation that also included Doyle, County Supervisor Leon  Williams, Port Commissioner Dan Larsen and Kenneth E. Sulzer, executive  director of the San Diego Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> The delegation met with Gustavo Patino, undersecretary of operations at the  Communications and Transportation Ministry, which oversees airports, as well as  Tourism Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell and representatives from the Commerce  Department, the presidential staff and private industry.  </P> <P> One observer said the Mexican officials appeared interested in the idea,  although not enthusiastic.  </P></p>

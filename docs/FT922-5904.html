			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: NM Rothschild to advise on Hungarian telecom privatisation HUNGARY yesterday appointed NM Rothschild to act as financial adviser to the privatisation of Hungarian Telecommunications Company (HTC). The UK investment bank said it would be contacting potential investors within the next few days. A number of international companies such as BT, Mercury and AT&amp;T are understood to be interested buyers. The Hungarian authorities plan to float a significant minority in HTC, possibly more than 30 per cent. The sale to an industry investor is scheduled for early to mid-1993. It will be followed by a public offering. Investment bankers say the HTC privatisation will be the largest in Hungary and one of the most significant in eastern Europe to date. HTC has an asset value of Ft132bn (Dollars 1.67bn), and has capital requirements of around Dollars 600m-Dollars 1bn over three years and Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn over five to 10 years. The HTC privatisation is driven by the pressure to reverse decades of neglect with the telecommunications system and bring infrastructure up to international standards. Hungary, which has only 10 access lines per hundred inhabitants, compared with 45 in the UK, is thus aiming to increase the penetration rate by 10 per cent a year. NM Rothschild said the undeveloped state of Hungarian telecommunications offered opportunities for strong earnings growth. Unit volumes would increase along with line penetration; and efficiency gains would result from the privatisation's injection of capital. NM Rothschild won a hotly contested tender to advise on the privatisation against competition. The mandate to advise HTC is due to be announced in the coming days.</p>

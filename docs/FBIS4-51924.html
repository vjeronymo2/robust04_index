			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- If North Korea continues to  reject additional inspections of its nuclear sites, further  action by the United Nations Security Council is inevitable, Yi  Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National  Unification Board, said Wednesday.    Yi gave a briefing on the "recent North Korean situation and  inter-Korean relations" at a meeting of the Advisory Council on  Democratic and Peaceful Unification, saying that Pyongyang will  eventually change its attitude because it has no good reason to  delay settlement of the nuclear problem.    The newly appointed minister said, "Respecting the principle  that the unification policy should maintain coherence, the  government will adjust its direction according to changes in the  situation as well as continue to study detailed ways to push  ahead with this policy."    He said the Seoul government will deal separately with the  nuclear and humanitarian issues.    "The government's decision to bring in North Koreans who  escaped from the Siberian logging camps was made from a  humanitarian point of view," Yi pointed out.    He clarified that the government will emphasize its  unification policy in settling the North Korean dispute.    "Unless the deadlock on the nuclear issue is broken, the  government will stick to its policy of linking the North Korean  nuclear problem to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he said.    Seoul will continue to maintain the principles of  inter-Korean relations -- settlement between the countries  concerned, settlement between the governments, productive  dialogue and implementation of agreements -- in pushing ahead  with South-North dialogue, he added.</p>

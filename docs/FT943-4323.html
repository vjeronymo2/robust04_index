			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Euro-dust in their eyes Nothing creates more dust in British politics than a row about Europe. The foggy English mind, ever less self-confident, falls to pieces when it contemplates political life across the Channel. This has bedevilled discourse for 40 years, and may do so for as long again. The 'William and Mary lecture' delivered by the prime minister at Leiden on Wednesday would serve as a model text for students of self-frustrating rhetoric, were it not primarily intended to maintain the fragile balance of opinion within the Conservative party. Mr John Major did his best, but it was the Tories' best, and that explains everything. For example, the prime minister sought to dispel what he called a 'ludicrous caricature' of Britain - that it is interested in no more than a 'glorified free trade area'. He did not mention the well-known views of his predecessor, now a caricature of her former self, or her remaining acolytes, whose devotion to the single market is exceeded only by their detestation of its institutional implications. Nor did Mr Major dwell on the fact that it was the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's attitude to Europe that led to her defenestration, while he depends for his continuance in office on the acquiescence of his party's Euro-sceptics. Only intellectual squirmers could call for a multi-speed Europe with one breath and then whinge about not being in the fast track with the next. Hold on, it may be protested, that is not quite fair. A fast track confined to a small elite should be rejected. 'I recoil from ideas of union in which some would be more equal than others,' said Mr Major. 'No member state should be excluded from an area of policy in which it wants and is qualified to participate.' If he was thinking of the policy document put forward by Germany's CDU last week, it is true that it alluded to a core comprised of 'five or six countries'. (Translation: Benelux plus France and Germany.) The CDU paper did, however, go on to say: 'This core must not be closed to other member states; rather it must be open to every member state willing and able to meet its requirements.' If that is a first division, it is one with an open door. Perhaps the prime minister was thinking of the rather more provocative formulation of the same idea by Mr Edouard Balladur. If the account I have is right, the French prime minister ob-served that 'for long years to come, Eu-rope will consist of a central homogenous core, made up essentially of France and Germany'. All of this is posturing. In spite of Maastricht, the European Union is still a collection of independent states, bound by treaties. It is what Mr Major, and General de Gaulle before him, proclaimed that it should be. Opt-outs, derogations, empty chairs, vetoes and all the other familiar devices ensure that this congeries of nations is in permanent negotiating session. The French and Germans may often lead, but they do not inevitably get their way, as the prime minister's recent veto demonstrated. The much-feared 'super state' will only be born when - if - a group of countries forms a single economic unit, in which a single currency is managed by a supranational central bank. Such a unit would be something more than a vast debating chamber in which sovereign governments traded concessions. It would indeed be an embryo United States of Europe. Benelux-France-Germany would doubtless constitute the initial agglomeration. The reasons why this may never happen are often rehearsed, but a British government should act on the assumption that it will. What follows then could be the principal question of British politics in the mid-1990s. Mr Major's opt-out, famously won at Maastricht, leaves it open to a future administration to decide whether to race to catch up or, instead, to stay out of a first-division, upper-tier, fast-lane, Franco-German, single-currency core. Heaven and Mr William Cash alone know what the prime minister's response would be. Mr Major may never be put to this particular torture. When (if) make-up-your-mind-up time comes, the prime minister could well be Mr Tony Blair. His position is quite clear. It is firmly and unwaveringly on the fence. 'Exclusion would carry an economic downside,' he said during the contest for leadership of the Labour party, 'both in terms of the perception of the long-term strength of the UK economy and of our attractiveness for world investment.' Plain enough. Except that 'on the other hand, the price of joining without genuine convergence may, precisely because of underlying economic weakness, be too high to pay'. The Labour leader does have one advantage over the prime minister. Mr Major is obliged by his precarious political situation to sound unenthusiastic about strengthening the institutions of the EU; he must focus on enlargement. Mr Blair leads a party of recent converts to the European mirage. He is happy to embrace the social legislation shunned by the Conservatives. He can say, as he has, that the purpose of accepting further integration 'is not to deny our sovereignty, but . . . to extend our sovereignty by deciding that our future prosperity depends on co-operating with other nations . . .'. He can talk Europese; Mr Major can only speak Klingon. Britain's European policy ought to have a single objective: to get into the lead and represent British interests. That might have meant establishing a threesome with France and Germany, but successive British governments have been too inconstant for that. It could have meant becoming an unofficial leader of the smaller countries, but we have seemed too anti-federal for that. Mr Major is winning some support from the Dutch and the Italians, but he would be unwise to bank on either. In spite of his cautiousness, Mr Blair is better-placed. He can appeal to the pro-European streak in the British psyche. When Labour turned against the then Common Market, it split. Its new leader cannot compete with Mr Major for the allegiance of Euro-sceptics. He could, instead, make his cleverest colleague, Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary. He might then set him the task of convincing the electorate that a Labour government would end the long record of Britain's failure to establish a lasting, satisfactory relationship with the EU. We might even believe him.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: AIRLINE OF STARS  </P> <P> Come Fly With Me: MGM Grand Air, the all-first class airline that flies twice  daily from each coast, is offering a perk to tonight's Oscar winners. Instead  of the usual $3,600 one-way fare for a private luxurious compartment, those  "special few" flying home with a golden statue will get a reduced rate of only  $2,817 for a four-seat compartment. "Since MGM Grand Air caters to many people  from the entertainment community, we wanted to do something special to  commemorate those who have excelled in their field," explained Charles L.  Demoney, the airline's chief executive and president. "We would be honored to  fly the Academy Award winners and their Oscars." The airline's 727s seat only  33, have five flight attendants and a choice of six films (which may or may not  be Oscar winners). ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 surpasses 3,400 on rate cut hopes - Market report Hopes that a further cut in British interest rates may not be too far away were increased by the latest outpouring of economic data and provided another shot in the arm for a rejuvenated UK stock market, which moved effortlessly back above the 3,400 Footsie level yest-erday. At the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was up 24.5 at 3,417.7 and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was ahead 22.1 at 4,050.6. Over the past two sessions the 100 index has risen some 54 points or 1.6 per cent since it was hit by fears of an impending slide throughout world markets. The surge in confidence and market prices yesterday came from a deluge of economic numbers published by the UK authorities, which mostly provided more justification for a further cut in interest rates. More encouragement for the UK market came from an initial good performance from Wall Street yesterday, plus a rise in UK gilt-edged stocks. Just about the only element of disappointment in the market was another relatively slack day's trading. Turnover came out at a surprisingly low 817.5m shares, with activity in non-Footsie stocks accounting for 64 per cent of the total. Dealers were surprised at the low level of business, which they said represented only a small upturn from the weather-affected levels seen on Monday and Tuesday. The value of customer business on Tuesday edged up to Pounds 1.62bn from Monday's Pounds 1.45bn, but both these figures were well below recent average levels. The equity market opened higher, but just short of the 3,400 Footsie level, responding to the good rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight and shrugging aside the disappointing performance of the Hong Kong market. Some said the latter had been affected by selling of Hong Kong stocks from one of the big Anglo-Hong Kong funds. The trigger for the market's strong performance came, however, with the day's economic figures. Market strategists said the unemployment numbers provided the greatest shock. Although expected by most analysts to show a fall of upwards of 40,000, they rose by more than 15,000, and this figure, combined with slightly worrying retail sales numbers, produced an immediate uptick across the equity market. The FT-SE 100 made rapid progress thereafter, and was helped by the latest rise in the Dow Industrial Average. It reached the day's peak of 3,423.2, up 30 points, before easing back on profit-taking. Senior traders in the market said the day's economic news provided ample justification for last week's  1/4 percentage point interest rate reduction. 'It puts paid to last week's story that the cut was pol-itically, rather than economically, inspired; it is becoming clearer that it was the Bank of England, via Mr Eddie George, and not the chancellor of the exchequer, who was doing the driving,' commented one dealer. He added that the market was much happier having appreciated that the reduction was undertaken on purely economic grounds. He also said the market was increasingly looking for another quarter of a point off UK rates in the medium term and had now fully asbsorbed the story that US rates are likely to go higher this year. Traders said the market was still affected by stock shortages in crucial areas. 'It is the same old story, you cannot buy stocks you are short of and you cannot sell the longs at the right price,' said one.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Brooks Service falls Pounds 392,000 into loss LOSSES CONTINUED into the second half at Brooks Service Group, and for the full 1992 year the pre-tax figure was Pounds 392,000, against profits of Pounds 587,000. As forecast, there is no dividend. Last year the group, which provides textile care and rental services, paid a total of 4.05p from earnings per share of 3.25p. Losses this time came to 1.76p. Mr Simon Brooks, chairman, said the group faced unprecedented trading conditions and the upturn in sales usually experienced in the second half failed to materialise. The year's turnover was Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 23.8m) but operating profits slumped to Pounds 117,000 (Pounds 1.11m). He added that there had been tentative signs since the year-end that the group's markets were improving. The drop in operating profit was exacerbated by restructuring costs of Pounds 208,000 (Pounds 151,000) and higher interest charges of Pounds 532,000 (Pounds 490,000). The figures have been produced under FRS 3. Last year's reported pre-tax profit was Pounds 645,000.</p>

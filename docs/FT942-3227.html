			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (9): Europe lags behind - Andrew Adonis on a contrast in paging markets Until recently, Europe's paging industry was at a loss to know how to counter the relentless rise of the mobile phone. The main casualty has been the consumer market, barely tapped by the pager, but the business sector has also languished. Three explanations are put forward - technological, cultural and commercial. With its limited versatility, the pager is supposed to be inherently inferior to the mobile phone and destined for the museum. The fate of 'one- way cellular' telepoint services, such as Hutchison Whampoa's 'Rabbit', wound up last year, are cited to underline the point. Culturally, Europeans are often claimed to be naturally averse to indirect means of communication. On the commercial front, most of the companies operating paging networks derive the bulk of their 'mobile' revenues from their cellular phone businesses, where subscribers are far more numerous and margins higher. So, it is argued, paging inevitably gets pushed to the side. The technological and commercial arguments are valid - up to a point. Many of Europe's paging operaters are indeed obsessed with mobile telephony; and in the long term, technology will doubtless kill paging. But given the high price of cellular phones, both to buy and to service, the paging obituaries appear to be rather premature. The contrast between the US and Asia's booming paging markets and the lacklustre European scene ought at least to give pause for thought. With 760,000 subscribers, the UK is Europe's largest paging market. CIT Research, the London telecoms consultancy, predicts that across western Europe the paging market will increase from 3.1m to 5m over the next decade. The US, by contrast, has about 21m pagers. Singapore has more than 600,000, Hong Kong 1m, Taiwan 1.4m and Japan 7.7m. According to CIT, the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has 18.94m paging subscribers, which it estimates will more than double within a decade. China is the largest growth market, but all countries are likely to see rapid growth. 'It's largely cultural,' says Mr Duncan Scott, CIT's mobile analyst. He compares Hong Kong with Australia which, proportionately, has far fewer subscribers and a paging market resembling that of the UK. However, the experience of Sweden over the past year cautions against the cultural alibi. A little over a year ago Mr Jan Holmgren, paging marketing manager for Telia Mobiltel, an offshoot of the state telecommunications operator Televerket, launched a campaign to sell pagers in the high street and shift charges from a monthly rental to a per-call price charged to the caller. It has been a startling success, despite Sweden's 10 per cent level of cellular penetration. 'The crucial thing was to study the telephone market, not existing mobile markets,' says Mr Holmgren, an ex-Motorola executive. TM market research showing a potential paging market of 1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population. 'But people wanted a charging structure more attractive to the consumer.' Nearly 100,000 pagers have been sold through retail outlets in the 14 months to May. Pagers are for sale on the Swedish high street for as little as SKr1,000 (Pounds 87), with no connection fee. Between 9am and 4pm the calling charge is SKr6 (about 50p) and at other times and all day at weekends, it is SKr1.5 - a huge price differential with mobile phones. The new regime has had almost as great an impact on the business market as on the consumer market. TM's traditional subscriber network has grown from about 70,000 to 102,000 since last year's launch of the 'calling party pays' (CPP) option, while a proportion of the new CPP customers are small businessmen. Other European operators are studying the Swedish experience. Portugal, Finland, Swirzerland, Ireland and Germany are either about to launch a 'CPP' service, or seriously considering doing so. In the UK, Mercury Paging - the third largest network operator after British Telecommunications and Vodafone - has taken a tentative step with the launch in March of a quasi-CPP service. Customers buy their own pagers for about Pounds 70, after which callers pay to leave messages at Mercury's '0881' premium rate - 39p a minute at peak rate, 25p at other times. But customers still have to pay a monthly subscription - Pounds 8.50 for national coverage, against more than Pounds 30 on the standard rental-plus-calls alphanumeric option. 'Already 2 per cent of calls into our bureau are on the new service,' says Mr Chris Neary, Mercury Paging's managing director. 'It gets over the initial perception that paging is expensive - for businesses as much as consumers.' With growth in the UK paging market of only 5 per cent last year, he views the move as essential to restoring the late-1980s record of about 20 per cent. However, large monthly rental-plus-service charges based on zonal divisions remain the norm in the UK - except for Hutchison, which has only one zone for the whole country. Vodapage and Mercury have three zones. BT has six, its tariffs guide resembling a railway timetable. Pagers come in three sorts: the simplest and cheapest is the tone-only radiopager, which bleeps to alert its owner that someone wants to get in touch with him or her. BT's option costs Pounds 10 a month to rent and use for one zone - or Pounds 6 if you own the pager. the numeric radiopager uses a small screen to display numbers - the phone number of the person who wants you to call, or a coded message. It costs Pounds 18.50 a month to rent and use with a bureau service from BT (one zone) - or Pounds 14 on the purchase option. the alphanumeric radiopager, which has a small screen showing text and numbers, typically up to about 400 characters though some display more. With a bureau service this costs Pounds 28 a month to rent and use from BT - Pounds 20 on the purchase option. However, published price lists do not have a lot of meaning in the corporate environment. Large businesss users - taking 100-plus pagers - can get 'up to 35 per cent off published prices,' says one marketing director. The main development in the UK market has been the reduction in the number of operators, down from seven to four in three years. BT has more than 50 per cent of the market, with 418,000 subscribers; Vodapage  - Vodafone's paging subsidiary - has about 200,000 - including subscribers to Aircall; Mercury has about 130,000, and Hutchison 30,000. The most popular recent service innovation is the personalised bureau answering service ('Hello, this is Joe Blogg's office  ..'). Even the local plumber can now pretend he has a 24-hour secretary.</p>

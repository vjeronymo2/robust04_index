			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 29 (XINHUA) -- More than 40  overseas-related copyright cases have been accepted by the  intellectual property right tribunal of the Beijing Intermediate  People's Court since last June, it was announced here today.    These lawsuits were mostly launched by overseas companies or  foreign-funded ventures in China, who complained that their  rights were being violated by Chinese bodies.    But there were also a few Chinese who said their rights had  been violated by foreign firms.    These cases account for 20 percent of the total number of  copyright cases which the court has accepted since its  establishment last year.    Cases now under investigation include a suit launched by the  U.S. Disney Company who said its copyright had been violated by  the Beijing Children's Publishing House, and that launched by  Microsoft, Auto Desk, Lotus, who alleged that five Chinese  companies had pirated U.S. computer software technology.    There were also several Hong Kong and Taiwan companies  seeking compensation for copyright losses through the court.    "We have sealed up the software and computers in those  accused Chinese companies last week for preserving evidence,"  said Su Chi, chief of the copyright court. He said these  companies are all situated in Zhongguanchun, north-west Beijing,  known as China's silicon valley.    "But we cannot yet draw any conclusion at this moment," he  said, adding that previously a Chinese firm was prosecuted by a  foreign company based on false evidence.    Professor Su, 37, who has studied law in Germany, said his  court will treat overseas and Chinese parties based on the  principle of fair judgement. "The judge is just a machine to  execute laws at our court," he said. "We exclude any personal  feelings."    Judgements will be made according to China's Civil  Prosecution Law and Copyright Law, which su said are in line  with German laws and international copyright conventions.    In the court, litigants have equal chances to air their case  and no illegal interference will be allowed. Media and experts  will be invited to hear the judgement if the case contains  nothing confidential.    According to Su, most cases were tried by his court  successfully and the litigants felt satisfied.    Recently, the court has tried a case concerning a  Sino-French  food firm and a Beijing supermarket. The supermarket illegally  used the foreign-invested firm's well-known brand, "Vie de  France", to sell Chinese-made bread. The Chinese firm was fined  15,000 yuan for copyright violation, though the illegal profit  was only 700 yuan.    "This is a warning to any copyright violators," Su said.  "And the French boss told me his investment confidence has  become stronger after the trial and he was preparing to set up  new branches this year in China."    China never favors local protectionism in court, he added.    Su's court was the first copyright court in China. Now it  has 16 full-time workers, including a computer software expert.  All the judges have court working experience of at least five  years and know English.    Cases tried by the court covered the fields of patents,  brand-names, publications, illegal competition, and pilfering of  commercial secrets. The largest compensation stood at 31  million yuan.    Copyright courts have also been established in some other  major Chinese cities.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Markets surge as Budget boosts hopes of recovery: Stocks and bonds record highest daily gains since ERM departure Financial markets rose sharply yesterday on the back of hopes that this week's Budget would help the UK recovery without stoking inflation and that a cut in interest rates was on the way. The London stock and government bond markets recorded their biggest daily gains since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 as investors gave a vote of confidence to the spending cuts and tax rises announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on Tuesday. In hectic trading, the FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares jumped 66.3 to 3,233.2, a new high, while long-dated gilts gained nearly 2 points helped by large purchases from UK institutions and investors in continental Europe and the US. Stocks in BT, British Gas and the privatised water and power companies were especially buoyant. Construction companies and some retailers also gained on the view that those sectors had received favourable treatment in the Budget. The optimistic sentiment was helped by comments from Mr Clarke that the economy was strong enough to withstand the tax increases and spending cuts announced on Tuesday. He said that the growth forecast of 2.5 per cent next year was 'modest and realistic' and that the measures to bring down the 1994-95 fiscal deficit from an expected Pounds 44bn to Pounds 38bn would help to bolster business and consumer confidence. Although Mr Clarke did not encourage hopes of a cut in interest rates from the current level of 5.5 per cent, the pound fell on speculation that such a move might come in the next two months. In London, sterling closed against the D-Mark at DM2.5425, down half a pfennig, while against the dollar it lost nearly half a cent to end the day at Dollars 1.4805. In New York, the pound fell further to close at Dollars 1.478. Markets took a positive view of Mr Clarke's decision to cut Pounds 3.6bn from next year's public spending control total and his tax changes which will raise Pounds 1.67bn in 1994-95 on top of the Pounds 6.7bn already announced. Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities, the London investment house, said the market had been enthusiastic about the theory that the moves would put the nation's finances in better shape but not harm the recovery. Exceptionally high trading in futures derivatives, which track likely share movements, spurred much of yesterday's heavy buying. Business in the futures contract which represents the FT-SE 100 Index was worth more than Pounds 2.5bn, about twice as much as on a normal day. A less favourable view came from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, which said the two Budgets, in March and on Tuesday, would reverse the tax cuts of the 1980s and reduce household incomes by an average of 3.5 per cent. Middle-class families would be especially badly affected. Shrugging off such sentiments, Mr Clarke said it would be 'quite easy' to get the tax changes announced on Tuesday through the House of Commons. He said the forecast 2.25 per cent increase in consumer spending next year would be supported by increased consumer confidence, falling savings and the continuing effects of the past year's mortgage interest rate cuts, which transferred cash to people with a relatively high propensity to spend. However, he gave no encouragement to speculation about a further interest rate reduction beyond last week's cut in base rates to 5.5 per cent from 6 per cent. He underlined that any judgment to cut rates had to be based on a range of monetary indicators and the medium-term outlook for inflation.

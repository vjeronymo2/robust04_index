			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Creditors will lose, says Abu Dhabi THE Abu Dhabi majority shareholders in BCCI said yesterday they regretted the Luxembourg court's decision and pointed out that creditors would suffer. Observing that the liquidation arrangements had been approved by the English and Cayman courts, they said: 'The creditors, who voted 93 per cent in favour of the arrangements last year, will be the losers. They have lost their only opportunity for a timely payment. The liquidators have already said that in the absence of the arrangements creditors cannot expect a payment for as much as 10 years and that they may then recover less than 10 per cent of their claim.' Abu Dhabi shareholders, including members of the ruling al-Nahayan family and state-owned organisations, owned 77.4 per cent of BCCI. Diplomats suggest there are now three options for Abu Dhabi: To consider an improved offer above the 40 per cent payout which has now been rejected. But this assumes that Abu Dhabi would be willing even to consider an improved offer and if so whether it could be sure that an improved offer would pass muster with Luxembourg law. They point out it will take some time to study the judgment. To dig in its heels and challenge the liquidators to take Abu Dhabi to court. But if this happened the issue could drag on for years with creditors having little hope of recovering even 10 per cent. For representatives from the majority shareholder and the liquidators to agree parameters for a settlement and make a joint proposal.</p>

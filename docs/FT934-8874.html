			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / Magistrates accuse Corleone clan SICILIAN magistrates said yesterday that bosses of the Mafia's Corleone clan killed anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in May 1992, Reuter reports from Rome. After sophisticated detective work, including DNA testing of saliva found on discarded cigarette butts, they issued 18 arrest warrants for the car bombing which outraged Italy. 'We are now in the position to identify each person and his role,' judge Giovanni Tinebra of Caltanissetta, who led the inquiry, said. Mr Falcone, a popular anti-Mafia crusader, was killed by a bomb as he was being driven into the city of Palermo from the airport.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL FARMERS LOSE LONG LEGAL BATTLE OVER UC AGRICULTURE STUDY  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court, in what could mark the end of a decade-long legal  battle, on Wednesday rejected an attempt to force the University of California  to devote more agricultural research to the needs of small family farmers.  </P> <P> The justices let stand an appellate ruling that struck down a heralded 1987  trial court finding that federal law required the university and other  land-grant institutions to give such farms "primary consideration" in devising  agricultural research policies.  </P> <P> Wednesday's action by the high court eliminated the remainder of what had been  a sweeping challenge by lawyers for farmers, workers and consumers to UC's  far-ranging, $116-million-a-year agricultural research program.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in 1978, charged that the university improperly favored large  farmers, food processors, chemical companies and machinery manufacturers, and  that UC officials were guilty of conflict of interest and unlawful expenditure  of tax money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Claim Detriment  </P> <P> As an example, the suit cited the development at UC Davis of a mechanical  tomato harvester the plaintiffs claimed was designed for farms of at least 150  acres -- to the substantial detriment of smaller growers.  </P> <P> But over the years, most of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed or dropped  from the suit, leaving only the question of whether provisions of the federal  Hatch Act of 1887 required UC, as a recipient of federal funds, to give special  attention to the needs of small farmers.  </P> <P> William G. Hoerger of California Rural Legal Assistance, an attorney for the  plaintiffs, said he was "greatly disappointed" with the justices' refusal to  review the appellate ruling rejecting the suit. It was uncertain whether the  case would be taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, he said.  </P> <P> Hoerger added, however, that he believed that the suit was "tremendously  successful" in focusing attention on the UC research program -- and was at  least partly responsible for new emphasis by the university on research that  benefits small farmers. Among other things, the university has studied new  pest-control methods requiring less reliance on expensive chemicals, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10-Year Struggle  </P> <P> On the other side, attorneys for the university welcomed the apparent end to  the 10-year legal struggle and lamented what they said were thousands of hours  wasted on defending against charges that had no merit.  </P> <P> "This suit made very serious charges of conflict of interest and mismanagement  and questioned the integrity of university research," said UC counsel Gary  Morrison. "Over the years, all those charges fizzled away, leaving only a  narrow question of interpretation of a statute. And now that issue has been  resolved, completely vindicating the university."  </P> <P> James C. Martin, an Oakland attorney representing the university, said  Wednesday's action reflected the high court's recognition that "this case never  belonged in the courts in the first place." Debate on research policy instead  should be conducted within the university and by the Legislature, Martin said.  </P> <P> Both lawyers said there was no basis for the claim that the lawsuit had  resulted indirectly in any marked change in the university's agricultural  research program.  </P> <P> The 1987 ruling at issue in the case was made by Alameda Superior Court Judge  Raymond L. Marsh. The judge, citing what he said were the requirements of the  Hatch Act, ordered the university to devise new policies -- subject to annual  court review -- that bring greater benefits to small farmers, consumers and  farm workers.  </P> <P> Marsh's decision, hailed by farm activists, could have had far-reaching impact.  While federal funding under the act accounts for less than 5% of the  university's total research budget, those funds are spread among most of the  more than 1,000 research projects under way at any one time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appealed Ruling  </P> <P> The university appealed Marsh's ruling, arguing that research projects were and  should be chosen solely on scientific merit and that any court-ordered  requirement to favor special groups would violate academic freedom.  </P> <P> Last May, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco upheld the university and  struck down the decision, finding that there was nothing in the language of the  act or in federal regulations explicitly requiring recipients of federal funds  to place special emphasis on small-farm needs.  </P> <P> "The judiciary is not the forum to debate national farm policy or to develop  administrative procedures for enforcing the Hatch Act," Appellate Justice Harry  W. Low wrote for a unanimous, three-member panel.  </P></p>

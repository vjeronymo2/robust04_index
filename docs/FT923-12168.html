			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Transport - conflicts and little hope Sir, Richard Tomkins appears to be over-enthusiastic about the benefits of private enterprise in the early years of the railways ('Politicians send the trains down yet another track', July 15). While the achievements of this sector in its first 50 or so years are indeed impressive and laudable, the means by which they were made are open to criticism. There is too much evidence in this period of rail company managers displaying little competitive edge and of a huge misuse of funds in over optimistic investment and aggressive, imperfect competition for us to look forward to a future of private railways with anything more than the faintest glimmer of hope.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, following a </F> meeting with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, in  Carthage on 25 February -- recorded]    [Text] This meeting with the president coincides with this  grave and large-scale massacre against people praying in the  holy al-Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil [Hebron] in our occupied  land, which resulted in 65 martyrs and 256 injured. It was  perpetrated by armed settlers in collusion with, and with the  participation of, the army guard which was guarding this area.  The latter had taken part in the opening of fire against our  kinfolk in al-Khalil area [following the massacre] killing 8  martyrs and injuring 28. Clashes flared up in all our land, in  Gaza, Nablus, Jenin, in Galilee, in Bethlehem, in Khan Yunis, in  Rafah, in Qalandiyah, in Jerusalem. Even in Jerusalem, people  performing the Friday prayers today were subjected to an attack  by special units of the [Israeli] army resulting in between 60  to 65 injured.    I have put the president in the picture of all these matters  in detail, and of the collusion between the armed settlers and  some elements in the Israeli Army.    I would like to add also that we have called for an urgent  meeting of the Security Council because we are now in need for  an international force to protect our people, our kinfolk, our  children and women, and the conspiracy has now become clear,  aimed at all our people and all our kinfolk, and it clearly  exposes the dangers caused by settlements and settlers. I want  to say all these things, and I have coordinated with the  president so that he may help us whether at the international,  local, or UN level, or all levels. In my own name, I have  thanked him for the noble feelings showed by Tunisia in this  terrible loss. This is not surprising on the part of Tunisia,  and its president, government and people.    Despite the large-scale nature and size of the tragedy  concerning this massacre, our people, the people of martyrs,  freemen and mujahidin, will bear it as it has borne before it  many blows dealt to it by these dangerous elements.    At any rate, clearly what is meant is to deal a blow at the  heart of the peace process, and the dimensions of this  conspiracy have become clear. In this respect, I address myself  to the two cosponsors of the peace conference who had signed  with us the agreement last September in the White House, to all  the international community and to the members of the Security  Council, whether the permanent ones or the non-permanent ones,  to take up their tasks and shoulder their responsibilities at  all levels to face up to this serious development. Thank you.</p>

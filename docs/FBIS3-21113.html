			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "France Prefers Beijing </F> to Taiwan"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] To restore relations with mainland China, where it  hopes to open up civilian markets in which Aerospatiale is well  positioned, Paris will curb arms deliveries to the Nationalist  island...    Alternation in the political sphere is also having its  effect  on French foreign policy. In a 180-degree change of course, the  government is turning its back on Taiwan and normalizing  relations with Beijing. It is thus putting behind it a  Franco-Chinese estrangement stemming from the 1982 sale of 60  Mirage 2000-5 to Formosa, and is meeting the PRC's two  conditions: recognition of Beijing as the "sole legal government  of China, and recognition of Taiwan as an integral part of  Chinese territory." In addition, it is promising "in future not  to authorize French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan."    The Chinese for their part have not committed to much in  return for all this "kowtowing" (or grovelling, as one expert in  Franco-Chinese relations calls it). They merely declare that  "French enterprises will be welcome to compete in the Chinese  market on an equal footing." In other words, the Chinese agree  to recognize as applying to France a trading privilege that  exists with respect to every country with which our country  maintains diplomatic relations.    The news has had a mixed reception in aeronautical circles.  Firms currently filling arms contracts with Taiwan are clearly  somewhat nervous about how the Nationalists will react. But for  the moment it appears they have nothing to fear. Taipei does not  appear keen to retaliate by voiding current contracts, and  Beijing is not insisting on their cancellation. Dassault,  SNECMA, Thomson, and Matra will thus be able to fulfill their  30-billion-franc [Fr] contract. Similarly, arming of the six La  Fayette class frigates built by DCN [Directorate of Naval  Shipbuilding] at Lorient is expected to continue. The primary  beneficiaries of that contract, valued at between Fr10-15  billion, are Thomson-CSF (battle system, Crotale naval missile),  Matra (Mistral missile), and Aerospatiale (Exocet). But  notwithstanding the government's assertion of the right to  continue selling arms to Taiwan--so long as Beijing does not  consider them "offensive"--doubts persist regarding the future  of the big contract (an option for nine more frigates) and  prospects for other deals such as submarines, armored vehicles,  a second tranche of Mirage 2000, and a complement of Mica for  Matra.    However, the news was received with a measure of  satisfaction  in civil aeronautics circles. Particularly at Airbus Industrie,  which has just expanded its Beijing office. As pointed out by  the consortium and its French partner Aerospatiale, dialogue  with the Chinese buyers will be greatly facilitated. The  partners hope, for example, to close the gap with Boeing, which  has already placed 250 of its commercial jets--compared to only  about 30 Airbus (and some 20 to Taiwan)--in a market estimated  at 600 aircraft between now and the year 2005. Louis Gallois,  Aerospatiale's CEO, has a lot of hopes riding on the ATR-42/72  regional air transport, which he sees as "perfectly adapted to  the Chinese market." All the same, it has not been ordered yet  by any airline on the continent, despite the fact Beijing is  participating in fabrication, whereas 18 of them are flying the  colors of the Nationalists' Trans Asia Airways, formerly Foshing  Airlines. Also in the civilian aeronautics sector, the robust  growth in air traffic means air traffic control systems will  have to be modernized and airports expanded, opening up major  opportunities for Thomson-CSF and Aeroport de Paris. The Chinese  have already purchased several dozen TB-20 from Socata for  training their airline pilots.    The situation is less clear in the defense sector. The few  contracts signed in the past have not been renewed. There was an  order for Rasit radars from Thomson, for 13 Super Frelon, for  eight Super Puma (some of them put to civilian uses), for eight  Ecureuils, eight Gazelles armed with Hot antitank missiles,  several batteries of Crotale missiles (which some people believe  were used to develop an equivalent indigenous system), and the  first phase of modernization of the A-5 fighter-bombers  (formerly MiG-19) by Thomsen and Sagem. The only success story  to stand the test of time is the fabrication of 50 Dauphin under  license, with Ariel engines provided by Turbomeca. The French  opening is expected to give a boost to Eurocopter's current  negotiations for a new series and strengthen cooperation on the  EC-120 light helicopter.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Spanish Government denied today that it had sold  weapons to the Angolan authorities. It did confirm that Spain  was supporting the training of the Angolan Government police.  Vasco Lourinho reports from Madrid.    [Lourinho] New scandals are being uncovered as  investigations  proceed into the Luis Roldan affair. The former head of the  Civil Guard was a discreet intermediate in the sale of Spanish  weapons to Angola worth 40 billion escudos. The operation was  carried out with the knowledge of Foreign Minister Xavier  Solana, who less than a year ago was still trying to deny what  was a reality.    [Begin recording] [Solana in Spanish with superimposed  Portuguese translation] As you know, we have a commitment to  Angola. We are contributing to the UN initiatives -- that is our  role and no more.    [Unidentified correspondent] And the weapons?    [Solana] We did not sell weapons. We have a commitment with  the police that we are fulfilling. [end recording]    [Lourinho] The deal was made by the Spanish public company  (DEFEX), which with the help of Luis Roldan, disguised the  weapons as antiriot equipment.</p>

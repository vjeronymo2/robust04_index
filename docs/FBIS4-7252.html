			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  will name a new deputy prime minister and head of the National  Unification Board (NUB), and possibly a few other cabinet  members, if the National Assembly approves the appointment of Yi  Yong-tok as prime minister by Thursday.    President Kim could carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle in  consultation with Yi Yong-tok, who replaces Yi Hoe-chang, within  Thursday. [sentence as received]    Parliamentary approval of the new prime minister has been  stalled at the National Assembly over two other controversial  issues. But it appeared possible that the Assembly would  approve Yi Yong-tok's appointment during its plenary session  which opens at 2 p.m. Thursday.    President Kim will then immediately hand credentials to Yi  at  Chongwadade [presidential office] and begin consultations to  select, among others, Yi's successor as deputy prime minister  and NUB minister, a Chongwadae official said.    If National Assembly approval comes later, a partial cabinet  reshuffle will take place Friday morning, sources said.    President Kim will hold a cabinet meeting Friday.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> MEMBERS SEEKING TO PURCHASE COUNTRY CLUB  </P> <P> One of Ventura County's most exclusive country clubs is about to become even  more exclusive.  </P> <P> Members of the North Ranch Country Club in Thousand Oaks are planning to buy  their own club and the championship golf course that surrounds it for $28  million in a deal that would make it the priciest in the county, officials said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Club members on Monday will launch a sale of memberships to finance the  purchase from Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said Leonard Alexander, an  attorney and board president of the organization representing the 600 members.  </P> <P> "We believe it's a good investment, and we'll have control of the management of  the operation," Alexander said. "We're real pleased to make this thing  possible."  </P> <P> Alexander said he was confident that the funds would be raised through the sale  of memberships and private financing. Memberships would be offered first to  club members, he said.  </P> <P> To finance the purchase, 400 memberships need to be sold. Memberships for golf  course privileges would cost $42,500, with an additional $4,250 for tennis  court privileges.  </P> <P> Country club members now pay about $15,000 for the privilege of using the  greens but are unable to sell their memberships.  </P> <P> Members initiated the purchase to gain control over operation of the country  club and its facilities, Alexander added. The 27-hole golf course, 12 tennis  courts and dining rooms sit on rolling hills north of the Ventura Freeway.  </P> <P> The sale would transfer control of the club to members and change the  membership to an equity or share in ownership of the operation. At equity  clubs, a person's membership can be sold, with certain conditions and fees.  </P> <P> The newly formed organization of club members may be able to buy the 250-acre  property and 49,000 square feet of buildings for $3 million less if the money  is raised before Dec. 24.  </P> <P> Prudential acquired the property in 1973, then developed the golf course and  tennis courts. The sale is part of a decision to sell off Prudential's share in  golf courses and country clubs, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The New Jersey-based company still owns real estate, hotels and recreational  facilities nationwide.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the North Ranch Country Club held a tournament for the NCAA  Division I golf championship.  </P> <P> Ventura County has 20 golf courses, seven of which are private with membership  fees ranging from $25,000 to $40,000. Members usually agree to pay monthly dues  and to spend a minimum amount in the country club bar or restaurant.  </P> <P> North Ranch directors said the membership price is on a par with other private  golf courses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. An appraiser has told North  Ranch Country Club officials that a membership was worth at least $60,000,  director John Baloff said.  </P> <P> "It is our opinion we are selling it at a discount," Baloff said.  "Traditionally, for the last 20 or 30 years, golf courses have all gone up in  price."  </P> <P> When directors polled members of the club, 417 people signed letters agreeing  to the purchase, Baloff said.  </P> <P> One city official applauded the sale.  </P> <P> "It's a good deal for the members and the city," said Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex  Fiore, who is also a golfer but does not belong to North Ranch. "I don't know  what other golf courses are going for today, but it is a competitive fee."  </P></p>

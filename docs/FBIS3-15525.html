The mission has brought a  renewed variant of the Russian plan on the Karabakh settlement.  The plan is based on Armenia's and Azerbaijan's compliance with  the Russian initiative and their readiness to withdraw their  forces form the hostilities zone.    According to the renewed plan, several observation points  will be deployed along the disengagement line around  Nagorno-Karabakh. Representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and  Russia will be in the composition of these posts. Main  coordinating headquarters of peacekeeping forces which are to  control the cease-fire agreement will apparently be based in the  Azerbaijani city of Agdam and Karabakh regional center of  Khankendi (Mardakert).    The same sources reported that Vladimir Kazimirov, special  envoy of the Russian president, would participate in the Baku  talks.</p>

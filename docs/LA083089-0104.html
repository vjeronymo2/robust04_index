			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 MAGAZINES' WAR EDITIONS LACK JAPANESE, GERMAN ADS  </P> <P> Advertisements from Japanese and West German companies are almost entirely  absent from recent issues of Time magazine and U.S. News &amp; World Report,  which feature cover stories on the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World  War II.  </P> <P> Newsweek magazine, whose special World War II coverage was limited to slightly  more than two pages of book reviews in its Sept. 4 issue, had a normal amount  of advertising from Japanese companies in the issue.  </P> <P> West German companies do not advertise every week in any of the three news  weeklies, so it was difficult to tell whether any had pulled ads because of the  cover stories in Time and U.S. News.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loss of Business  </P> <P> But Time and U.S. News confirmed that some Japanese advertisers, which they did  not identify, had pulled ads from their World War II issues, in some cases  switching them to other issues.  </P> <P> "The net of it was that we did lose some business," Time spokesman Brian Brown  said.  </P> <P> Calls to some of the Japanese companies that frequently advertise in the news  weeklies -- including auto makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda -- were not  immediately returned Tuesday.  </P> <P> News weeklies often notify advertisers when they plan articles that might  embarrass them, such as a cover story on alcoholism that would spoil ads by  liquor companies.  </P> <P> "We make it very clear that the story is going to run in any case, and I think  that speaks well for editorial integrity," Time's Brown said.  </P> <P> U.S. News has a similar policy, spokeswoman Beth Kseniak said.  </P> <P> U.S. News has no ads from Japanese or West German companies in its Aug.  28-Sept. 4 double issue featuring stories on World War II. Time's Aug. 28 issue  on World War II carries a single Japanese ad, a two-page spread from Japan's  Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc.  </P> <P> Japanese and West German advertisers are entirely absent from Time's Sept. 4  issue, which has 17 pages about World War II and a small headline about the  special section on the top of the cover.  </P> <P> Newsweek's Aug. 28 issue has 10 pages of advertising from Japanese companies  and some small ads from West German companies, which are in an advertising  supplement by the nation of Nigeria. Its Sept. 4 issue, which contains the  World War II book reviews, has 10 pages of Japanese advertising.  </P> <P> (A senior advertising manager for The Times said Tuesday that no Japanese or  West German companies had withdrawn or delayed advertising in response to the  paper's current series of Page 1 stories on World War II.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Infiniti Ads  </P> <P> Volkswagen USA ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 issue of Time but did not have  anything scheduled for the Aug. 28 issues of Time or U.S. News, regardless of  the contents of those issues, said marketing director William Gelgota.  </P> <P> Nissan's Infiniti division, which is gearing up for the launch of its new  luxury car, ran no ads in Time and U.S. News but had a four-page spread in the  Aug. 28 Newsweek.  </P> <P> Honda's Acura division placed three-page ads in the Aug. 21 issues of Time and  U.S. News but nothing in the World War II issues. It has a two-page ad in the  Aug. 28 Newsweek.  </P> <P> Toyota ran a one-page ad in the Aug. 21 Time and had the back cover of the Aug.  21 U.S. News, but was absent from the World War II issues.  </P> <P> World War II began Sept. 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and  France declared war on Germany two days later. The United States entered the  war after being attacked by Japan on Dec. 7, 1941.  </P></p>

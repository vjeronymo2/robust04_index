			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / What's good for Shanghai is good for China: Zhang Tingting on the role of a city that provides a sixth of the country's budget revenues SHANGHAI has long been regarded as the engine of growth for China's economy. But as the country has experimented with market policies, the city's massive state-run industries have held back its growth. Shanghai is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on projects such as Pudong, a planned industrial estate the size of Shanghai itself. The city remains the largest contributor to national budget revenues, providing a sixth of the total - 10 times the amount contributed by fast developing Guangdong province. But it has lost its position as the largest regional economy to Jiangsu province. Shanghai has long embraced reform - its previous mayor was Zhu Rongji, now leading the national economic reform programme as vice-premier - but the preponderance of large state-run industries, with outdated products, excess labour and lack of management autonomy, has produced huge challenges. By contrast, industry in Guangdong province, where the 'open-door' policies were first introduced with the creation of special economic zones, has been able to grow from a small base on greenfield sites and has employed what was previously a mainly rural population. Shanghai is China's industrial centre. It is so interwoven with other parts of the country that almost every move it makes to reform affects the national economy not least because its industries rely heavily on energy and raw materials from other provinces. The initial impact of the transition to a market economy was to divert from them at least 60 per cent of the energy and raw materials which had been provided under central planning. In 1988, the city found itself with only a few days' coal reserves. The government, which had previously fixed all coal prices, had begun to free them. The immediate result, however, was chaos in supplies. The partial liberation made it hard for Shanghai to find fuel for its industries in competition with manufacturing enterprises throughout China, including those not run directly by the state, which queued up to bid for a share. Meanwhile, the local state-run textile industry, the biggest hard currency earner, was on the verge of bankruptcy because of new competition from township enterprises in neighbouring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Township enterprises, which mushroomed in the mid-1980s as a result of market reforms, usually outperform their state-run counterparts because they have advantages in flexibility of pricing, distribution and the right to hire and fire. Shanghai's 940 large- and medium-sized state-run enterprises, by contrast, have had little impetus to grow because of old-fashioned inefficient management with no answers to the intense competition. However, the development of Pudong, a 350sq km area - larger than China's four special economic zones together - offers the chance to renew Shanghai's industrial base. The project is expected to take 30 to 50 years and to cost at least Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn). Premier Li Peng has called the Pudong project 'the focus of China's efforts to attract foreign investment in the current decade'. Of three special zones within the area, one - Waigaoqiao - allows foreign investors to re-export for the first time since the communists took power in 1949. C. Itoh, the Japanese trading house, was the first to set up there. The other zones are for export processing and financial services. To finance the development, Beijing will help Shanghai raise 4bn yuan (Pounds 475m) a year through Pudong construction bonds. It will also sell shares in state-run companies on domestic and overseas markets, provide state funding and low-interest loans, and try to revive state-run enterprises by various means including granting them the right to import and export. According to Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, the 45.5bn yuan needed in the first five years of development (1991-1995) has been secured and is being spent on capital infrastructure projects such as bridges, roads, telecommunications facilities as well as water, power and gas plants. To attract investors, the mayor pledged not to change for three years the low 1991 price of land leases. He promised to complete major capital construction projects by 1995 and to cut down red tape. While most western investors waver, domestic investors have been eager. Anhui province, one of China's leading rural provinces, has committed 1bn yuan to a capital project to get a firm foothold in Pudong. However much Pudong is being used as a market laboratory to revitalise Shanghai, the city will continue to face problems. The authorities are concerned that higher salaries and better social protection in Pudong will create a completely different system from that in the rest of Shanghai. They fear that social and economic stability may be disturbed by a 'one city, two systems' approach. State-run enterprises have been converting enthusiastically to the shareholding system, but the legal and accounting framework is inadequate to accommodate the rapid changes. However, reform is progressing quickly. Mayor Huang has said that, in addition to the national price reforms featuring a free market for grain and edible oil introduced last year, Shanghai would co-operate with neighbouring provinces to free prices of some industrial products such as energy and raw materials. Prices for more than 80 per cent of industrial products in Shanghai are now determined by demand and supply. Local government officials say the idea behind these localised reforms is to attract investment and trade from all parts of the country with a free market, enhancing Shanghai's position as China's leading trading centre. It already has a stock exchange and commodities markets. National trade centres for non-staple food and non-ferrous metals were set up in Shanghai last year. Contracts have also been signed for China's first retail joint venture with a foreign investor, involving the Shanghai No 1 Department Store and Yaohan International of Japan. Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old paramount leader who is the architect of the economic reforms, has said that he regretted not having granted Shanghai the status of special economic zone, as he did to Shenzhen in Guangdong province 10 years ago, 'or Shanghai would have been playing a greater role in the national economy'. Yet he believes Pudong will overtake Shenzhen in vitality and contribution to the country's economic future. Zhang Tingting is a Shanghai correspondent of China Daily</p>

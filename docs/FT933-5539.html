			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Still tight in London CONDITIONS IN the sterling money market remained extremely illiquid yesterday, with discount houses and clearing banks failing to offer bills to the Bank of England in the earlier rounds of trading, writes James Blitz. For the second day running, the overnight rate for lending sterling in the wholesale cash market came close to 8 per cent as liquidity in the system remained tight. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 1.75bn, but by lunchtime yesterday less than half of this shortage had been removed. In the afternoon, Pounds 983m was removed via the provision of band 1 and 2 bills at the prevailing rates. But the Bank of England provided dealers with an unusually large level of late assistance - or emergency funding - to the tune of Pounds 700m. The shortages that the market has experienced lately are nothing new. They are partly due to the draining of wholesale funds that accom-panied the Bank of England's recent gilt auctions. The authorities have returned some of these funds in their regular operations, but it will take time for the def-icit to be completely removed. However, one market dealer yesterday reiterated a long-standing complaint of London dealers: that the system is increasingly dominated by one or two clearing banks who have built up a large stock of eligible bills in recent years. He said these banks can sometimes hold back from offering bills to the authorities with the aim of pushing up the cost of overnight lending and improving the state of their balance sheets. For the time being, the Bank of England continues to stand by the advantages of a system in which commercial banks are far more deregulated than they are on the Continent In Europe, the focus of attention was on the fall in French franc interest rate futures as dealers took the view that French rates would not come down quickly. The December Pibor contract ended 18 basis points down at 92.83. The March 1994 contract shed 15 points to 94.02. In the German market, call money declined sharply as the new month started. It dropped from Tuesday's level of 7.75 per cent to as low as 6.85 per cent yesterday after the Bundesbank allocated DM56.8bn of liquidity into the market, against DM48.9bn of expiring facilities.</p>

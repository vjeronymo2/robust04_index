			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and </F> foreugn minister, to the Chamber of Deputies in Zagreb on 26  January -- recorded]    [Text] Esteemed deputies: The peaceful reintegration of  the temporarily occupied territories, the efforts to advance and  consolidate relations with our neighbors, the very urgent need  at the present juncture to halt the Muslim offensive in central  Bosnia, and our participation in European processes of  integration remain the main goals of Croatian policy.    As for the world position of the Republic of Croatia, over  the last few weeks the president of the Republic personally and  the government and our diplomats have been totally preoccupied  with, and have spent most energy in, putting in order relations  with neighboring countries. Relations with neighbors are always  seen as the first criterion that the international community  uses to assess the policy in general, the level of its  democratic development, and the level of civilization in a  country. In the case of young countries and democracies such as  Croatia, the world relies on the nature of their relations with  their neighbors to assess the level of their maturity and their  capability to join integrational process on a wider scale.    In addition, when outlining the strategic attributes of our  foreign policy, we placed our relations with neighbors at the  very top. Namely, we cannot enter Europe over the heads of our  neighbors. We made efforts of differing intensity and at  different times but with the same amount of dedication to  normalize -- in some cases to remove the initial and in some the  old obstacles on the road towards full normalization of  relations with the countries in our immediate and near  neighborhood: with Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, with Slovenia, with Italy,  and even with Macedonia. We can proudly say that in relations  with some of our neighbors, we no longer need to put anything in  order but only try and advance them. I refer here to Hungary  and Austria. However, I firmly believe that one day we shall  come before this chamber to talk only about further improvements  in goodneighborly relations of the democratic, sovereign, and  integrated republic of Croatia, which we aspire towards and  which is our prime goal.    In any case, all we did in the preceding period was governed  by this goal. However, it should be stressed that at the same  time we have made and will continue to make considerable efforts  to bring forward the date when Croatia will join many of the  European and world processes.    The president of the Republic, Dr Franjo Tudjman, headed our  state delegations at negotiations in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva.  In addition, he met a large number of world statesmen. In  Zagreb he had meetings with a member of the U.S. Government,  Ambassador Madeleine Albright, former French president Valerie  Giscard d'Estaing and the cochairmen of the international  conference.    I have just returned from a visit to the Council of Europe  --  that inevitable and decisive stop on the road to functional  integration in the European Union. Prime Minister Valentic and  I talked with the Slovenes in Ljubljana yesterday. I had a very  successful visit to Bulgaria, I will be meeting Italian Foreign  Minister Benjamino Andreatta in Rome at the beginning of  February. We plan to initiate a procedure geared towards joining  the process known as Partnership for Peace under the auspices of  NATO and we are conducting bilateral talks within the framework  of the CSCE on regional security arrangements both in the  Mediterranean and in this part of Europe.    The normalization of relations with our neighbors, regional  security arrangements, participation in the Partnership for  Peace and membership in the European Union and NATO itself --  with an active role in economic arrangements -- this is part of  the network of the continuous activities and logical objectives  of Croatia's foreign policy. The realization of these  objectives perfectly, clearly, and permanently determines the  position of the sovereign, unified, and integral Republic of  Croatia in Europe and the world.    It occasionally happens in this process that our efforts are  not in proportion to the results just as it happens that a  positive result can be reached unexpectedly owing to a favorable  alignment of circumstances. However, this is also a process  where even the longest journeys begin with a first step in which  politics are an art of the possible but in which the essence and  objective are always clearly defined and unmistakably in the  interest of the Croatian state, the Croatian nation, and all  citizens of the Republic of Croatia.    In this respect, most of the attention of the Croatian and  foreign public over the past couple of days was focused on the  joint [Serbian-Croatian] declaration signed in Geneva on 20  January. Before this, an equal degree of attention was  commanded by our negotiations with the Muslim side. Both talks  were conducted within the framework of the international  conference as well as through numerous bilateral channels and  mediatory efforts. The talks have a continuity, sometimes they  are mutually interdependent and they are also known to have  affected the development of events in the UN Protected Areas.    We should reiterate this clearly: Croatia is not conducting  talks with anybody to the detriment of a third, absent party.    Ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to Croatia, the goal of  both negotiations is the normalization of Croatian-Serb  relations and interstate relations with the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and the permanent resolution of overall  Croatian-Muslim relations. We entered these talks guided by the  principles of our peace-loving policy and obligations stemming  from our participation in the international peace conference.    But at every moment we were deeply aware that the war of  aggression within the Greater Serbia project is the main reason  for and the only real source of the crisis and all the  indescribable suffering both in Croatia and in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, at that time we gave priority to our  relations with the Muslims, while we have achieved considerable  and important results in out relations with the Serbian side.    However, it is beyond any doubt and it comes as proof of our  priorities that we offered much more to the Muslim side and are  still offering it under certain conditions: a treaty on the  establishment of a permanent and global peace between the Croat  and the Bosnian Muslim nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  foundations of their coexistence. Such a proposal was  repeatedly offered to them in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva. This  is a precondition for the permanent normalization of relations.  It is actually a proposal for an alliance between two nations  and two states, for halting the war, eliminating consequences of  the aggression and destruction, and for long-lasting and  mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres from the economy,  to security and foreign policy.    For such a proposal which is in essence a refinement of the  overall and consistent Croatian policy towards  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also a further expansion of the peace  initiative, Croatia and her president received numerous praises  from foreign statesmen: in Bonn, Brussels and Geneva, and also  at many meetings with foreign ministers Kinkel, Claes, Cetin,  Hurd, Mrs af Ugglas, [name indistinct], and Mock.    Despite such offers and such assessments of our policies and  efforts, there have been no satisfactory results so far that  could place the progress achieved in our relations with the Serb  side in the right perspective and context. I am deeply  convinced of the existence of such a possibility, and we shall  do our utmost in this respect, because the normalization of  relations with the Muslims and their state entity in wartime,  and especially in peace, is of strategic importance for and in  the interest of the Croats and the Republic of Croatia.    The joint Geneva declaration is an important political  document, maybe even a crucial step in the normalization of  relations between the two signatory countries and an important  contribution to the beginning of the establishment of a lasting  peace, stability, and security in this part of Europe. If the  Serb side displays goodwill, this document will determine the  future course of the normalization of the situation in both  states and the normalization of relations between the two states  and it will also have an impact on the position of minorities in  these states. This is a document whose final form was shaped by  the international community, but also by the dynamics of the  international conference on former Yugoslavia.    This declaration contains several elements that could be  relevant to UN Security Council Resolution 871 -- in case a real  peace is achieved -- inter-state relations were mentioned,  offices are being opened. It was said that the two sides should  be guided by the principles of the UN Charter and the basic  tenets of the CSCE in the establishment of goodneighborly  relations. Moreover, an official statement from Belgrade calls  on the Serbs in Croatia to regulate their relations with the  Croatian authorities in the Republic of Croatia. This  represents the first, and very important, step in the  normalization of relations between Zagreb and Belgrade and it  should lead to the establishment of full diplomatic relations.  This is also an important step towards the peaceful  reintegration of the UN Protected Areas into the constitutional,  legal, political, and economic system of our country which would  effectively finalize the integrity of the sovereign Republic of  Croatia.    This once again reiterates Croatia's determination to  establish peace in these areas and to restore and consolidate  stability and security, primarily through political means, in  other words through dialogue and negotiations in an atmosphere  of goodwill and respect for the individual interests of the two  sides and for the efforts outlined in the documents of the  international community such as the European Union's action plan  and relevant documents of the UN Security Council and General  Assembly. The international community has already expressed and  will continue to give us support for this policy. If we  continue to pursue this policy, we will move closer not only to  finding genuine and lasting solutions but also to the political,  European milieu to which we belong historically.    It is important to stress that both the comprehensive offer  made in Bonn to the Muslim side and the joint declaration  consistently reflect the basic idea and the logical theme of  President Tudjman's peace initiative and to a large extent  represent a concrete step toward implementing it. As a vital  step toward the day when the two sovereign states are eventually  recognized within their international borders the declaration is  seen as being of crucial importance for contributing to and  enhancing the effectiveness of the international conference and  for helping to implement all the points in the European Union's  action plan on the so-called modus vivendi, or rather of  Resolution 871 which is so crucial to us.    Any delay in normalizing Croat-Serb relations, or rather the  absence of any shifts in them hamper the efforts to normalize  the situation in this part of Europe. Accordingly, any shift in  this sphere must be welcomed and supported.    However, while on the one hand we will continue to normalize  relations with the Serb side in order to accomplish our own  objectives as soon as possible -- in particular those concerning  the temproarily occupied territories -- on the other, we will  again try to restore dialogue with the Muslims to tackle all  vital issues, including the territorial integrity of the two  entities in a future state, releasing prisoners, normalizing the  humanitarian situation, in particular, providing gurantees for  the free passage of humanitarian convoys, and the general state  of relations -- in other words, harmonizing our Bonn proposal  with their reply to us in Geneva recently.    The Bonn proposal for negotiations and agreements to benefit  both peoples and peace in this part of Europe will remain on  long-term offer. However, the Muslim side's current behavior  demonstrates a lack of genuine desire to find a lasting and  systematic solution to Croat-Muslim relations and to  establishing appropriate relations with the Croatian state.    There are very clear indications that the Muslim side wishes  to invalidate and reject the Geneva documents on the  establishment and set-up of the union of republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the negotiations, and even more so in  its public relations, the Muslim side very skillfully evades and  jumps from the concept of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to  the union of the republics and then into the Bosniak Muslim  entity, mixing and intertwining the actual situation on the  ground with the real level which has been achieved in  negotiations.    In addition to this, by repeatedly issuing demands for the  replacement of the negotiating forum, it has been trying to  return the negotiations to square one. This has considerably  burdened our negotiations, because the other side's definition  is constantly changing. In negotiations, and even more so  through its behavior in the field, the Muslim side has shown  that it was not ready to recognize the equality and  constitutionality of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor  is it ready to recognize all indisputable achievements of the  struggle of the Croat people and the realization of its right to  self-determination expressed through the establishment of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    By shunning the union of the republics, which is the level  of  the resolution achieved in objective terms in the negotiating  process, and which is a euphemism for the agreement reached  aboard the "Invincible", back to the model of the republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Muslim leadership is in reality trying  to negate the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    The current Muslim offensive in central Bosnia, with its  horrific proportions, duration, and tragic consequences, most  obviously proves the lack of real will and reveals the genuine  intentions of the current Muslim leadership -- the eviction of  the Croats from their historic and ethnic areas in central  Bosnia. This is in complete contravention of the fundamental  documents and constitutional principles of the present-day  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the principles of the set-up  and demarcation within the union of the republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    This entitles and obligates the president, the assembly, and  the government of the Republic of Croatia, in line with the  constitution and their own conscience, to do everything in the  political, diplomatic, humanitarian, and every other legitimate  field in order not only to stop that merciless offensive but  also to secure the survival of the Croats and guarantee them a  life worthy of human beings in those historically ethnic Croat  areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats must remain in their  homes in central Bosnia, which is in the interest of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and of peace in this part of Europe.    Despite everything, we again call on Bosnian Muslim  representatives to continue negotiations in good faith so that a  permanent and just solution for all sides be achieved, peace in  Bosnia-Herzegovina restored, a permanent community of equal  constitutive nations set up, and conditions for their  coexistence be preserved. If the Muslim offensive is halted it  is not yet too late for politics and negotiations. At the same  time we again wish to express the readiness of the Croatian side  to work toward and persevere in reaching precisely such a  political, peaceful, negotiated and mutually beneficial solution.    In the course of the last meeting between two delegations,  i.e. between presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, certain  progress was achieved as regards [Muslim] access to the sea,  without calling into question the territorial integrity of the  Republic of Croatia. An agreement in principle on Mostar and the  hydroelectric system on the Neretva River was also achieved.  However, the important problem of central Bosnia remains to be  solved: In this respect demands by the Bosnian Muslim side were  ultimatum-like and thwarted any agreement. At the same time  Izetbegovic's sudden demands as regards central Bosnia called  into question the very principle, which has been one of the  foundations of the negotiating process so far and which had been  coordinated by all three sides, according to which the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would get 17.5 percent of the territory.    Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Let me say just a few words  about our relations with Slovenia: A meeting that took place in  Ljubljana yesterday between the prime ministers and ministers of  foreign affairs of our two neighboring states was, in many  aspects, a great step forward in the removal of obstacles  burdening bilateral relations, i.e., as Prime Minister Nikica  Valentic stressed after the talks, it transpires that no problem  is of such a nature as to prevent the interest of the two  nations and the two states in the establishment of better and  friendlier relations.    In brief, as regards open issues, a complete agreement on  the  Krsko nuclear power plant is likely to be reached by the end of  the summer; we have coordinated a trade agreement as a framework  for the future exchange on the free trade principle, and also an  agreement on payment transactions. In a few days we could  settle the issue of our property relations. Standpoints  regarding Ljubljanska Banka have been clarified and brought  closer, agreements on air traffic, fishing, and cooperation in  culture and education have either been completed or are nearing  completion. Through treaties on employment and social security,  which are also nearing completion, the issue of employment of  Croatian citizens in the Republic of Slovenia will be resolved.  A joint commission will continue work on the demarcation of the  border line.    The Croatian side presented to the Slovene side a proposal  in  writing on the Bay of Piran with a number of interesting  solutions as regards political, customs and ecological control  and fishing. In line with these proposals, Piran would become a  linking bay -- not a contentious issue on which international  mediation could make decisions should it become necessary.    An increase in bilateral trade between the two neighbors was  singled out as one of the most urgent tasks. Finally, it was  agreed that the same delegations meet again in Zagreb on 7  February to sign the agreements that have already been  coordinated and to continue the dialogue.    As regards our relations with Italy, i.e., the forthcoming 3  February meeting and talks with Foreign Minister Beniamino  Andreatta in Rome, I would like to stress that on that occasion  we wish to remove all remaining misunderstandings in our  relations and thus give a fresh impetus to the  good-neighborliness of the two states. For us, Italy is not  only one of the most important business partners, but is also an  influential state and a factor creating European and world  politics to which we are inevitably inclined, and with which we  are very closely cooperating in regional organizations, such as  the central European initiative or Alpe-Adria. We are convinced  that Italy will play an even more important role in the  resolution of the crisis in this area and also in the peace-time  reconstruction.    My visit to the Council of Europe in the course of which I  had numerous complex, but very important talks, showed that it  understood our position, but also that Croatia can and must do  most on its own. Further strengthening and widening of  democracy in all its forms is our first and fundamental  imperative. Croatia has kept its special guest status in the  Council of Europe, while the change of that status will depend  on the development of the situation, the nature and the course  of a denouement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Esteemed deputies. We attach great importance to the recent  NATO summit, bearing in mind the pivotal position of this  organization in the building of an adequate system of security  and stability in Europe and the world in general. Our  particular attention was attracted by decisions on further  strengthening of the so-called NATO European component, or wing,  on the basis of the development and strengthening of the  European Union, i.e., the WEU [Western European Union]. Croatia  supports NATO standpoints on political and security priorities,  particularly as regards support for the stabilization of new  European democracies, the further improvement of the CSCE  process and mechanisms, the struggle against terrorism, and arms  control and disarmament.    Even though some NATO standpoints are inadequate when it  comes to the real state of affairs and the need to establish  security in our continent, particularly as regards crises in  areas such as the Balkans, we derive hope from the fact that  NATO has expressed its awareness of the interdependability of  security in all democratic European states, and readiness in  principle to gradually extend its membership. In this sense an  invitation was sent to European states and CSCE members to  develop direct cooperation in practice with NATO through  Partnership for Peace. Principles and goals of Partnership for  Pease are in their essence in agreement with Croatia's  standpoints and its long-term interests, and therefore we  welcome them expressing our readiness to join the implementation  of that initiative.    We are not regarding our possible participation in the  Partnership from the standpoint of our current defense needs and  interests, but rather as a way and modus of standardization and  long-term inclusion of our defense system and forces into the  institutional framework for the defense of the democratic order,  security and stability in Europe and the world in general.    Ladies and gentlemen. We have achieved significant moves  forward in the strengthening of our international position and  thus our internal security. We have approached our main goal by  several more steps. But in the forthcoming period very complex  tasks, fresh huge challenges are awaiting us. Quick  breakthroughs are possible, but also long-lasting frustrations  in the implementation of our fundamental policy. It will be  necessary to make quick decisions, react quickly and even more  quickly adapt to circumstances in order to achieve our strategic  goals to an optimum degree and fulfil our national task  consistently.    We are leaving the war behind and entering peace and Europe,  being aware that forces that pull us back are still strong. Two  words are decisive in this connection: National unity and the  future of the nation and the state. Therefore I call on you to  unite and give support to each other when it comes to our mutual  goal. Let me paraphrase a well-known statesman: Let's not allow  the opening up of disputes between the past and the present lest  we should find out at one moment that we have lost the future.    Thank you, madam deputy speaker.</p>

			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Higher welfare charges blocked by Brazil parties PRESIDENT Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil was left isolated yesterday after an emergency government bill to increase social security contributions had been rejected by all parties, including those which support the government. The bill was introduced to cover Dollars 10bn in extra pension payments that the government will have to make as a result of a court having ruled that pensioners shall be given a 147 per cent increase. Unless the government can find a way to raise this money, the payments would threaten to jeopardise its fiscal adjustment plans, which will be presented to the board of the International Monetary Fund next Wednesday. The board is due to discuss then a Dollars 2bn stand-by loan for Brazil. The unanimous rejection of the bill, effected in talks before any vote could take place in Congress, was communicated to Mr Collor in a note signed by all 17 parties in Congress and written by Mr Ricardo Fiuza, leader of the government bloc. Meeting journalists yesterday, the president warned that the government would not print money to meet the payments as this would threaten the battle against inflation, which is running at 24 per cent a month. He said: 'One more time, I must make clear that this government is not going to reopen sources of inflation.' The president added, however: 'I am open to any suggestions as to how we can pay this pension increase.'</p>

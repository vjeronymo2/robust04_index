			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Richardson quits chair at Smith New Court Sir Michael Richardson, who yesterday announced that he will retire as chairman of the broking firm Smith New Court, is not only a shaker in the City of London, but one of its rare movers. Unlike most City financiers, Sir Michael has worked at the helm of both a broking firm and a merchant bank. Sir Michael, 69, retains the energetic manner which earned him his reputation as the top corporate finance adviser to UK government privatisations while at NM Rothschild. He is far from retiring. Although remaining a vice-chairman of Rothschild, he insists he is now looking for work. 'If you are here at 8am every morning and stay until 6pm at night, you are bound to have a bit of a gap when you stop,' he said yesterday, 'I do not really feel terribly old, and I think I have still got an enormous amount of energy and experience. I hope something will come along.' Sir Michael is to retire from the end of the year, and will be succeeded as executive chairman by Mr Michael Marks, chief executive. Mr Paul Roy, head of the UK broking business, will be chief executive, and Mr Gavin Casey will step up from finance director to be chief operating officer. Sir Michael's breadth of experience, from his days as a partner in Cazenove &amp; Co, the broker, to heading corporate finance at NM Rothschild, is unusual. Furthermore, he had bridged an old divide without joining one of the integrated investment banks which increasingly dominate the City. These are buoyant times for Cazenove and Smith New Court, as the two large independent brokers which can be used by merchant banks such as Rothschild and Schroders. Sir Michael argues that 'Cazenove is at the top of the tree and we are somewhere up it' as a result of staying independent. But despite his reasons for sentimental attachment to the divide, Sir Michael says it may not last. He says that new capital adequacy requirements in the EU will make it harder for independent brokers to take on large blocks of shares in 'bought deals' before placing them with clients. Furthermore, he argues that distribution capacity will become more important for merchant banks and 'there will come a time when people do not want a bank just for the brilliance of its ideas'. He says he cannot predict when the defining moment will come, although it will be within a decade. Smith New Court is already linked to Rothschild through the 26 per cent stake the bank bought in the jobber Smith Brothers in 1985. Since then, it has grown corporate and retail broking in both UK and abroad to the point where UK market-making in equities accounts for only 20 per cent of profits. Market-making is now under pressure, a report commissioned by the Office of Fair Trading having found that market-makers gain excessive commissions. Sir Michael defends the system as ensuring liquidity, saying that a continental European-style order-matching system would be 'madness' for London. Yet Sir Michael, who retired earlier this year from the board of the London Stock Exchange, is not complacent about London's financial role. He is among City figures who worry that developments such as the siting of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt could be portents of decline. 'The City has to be very careful about things such as the difficulties at Lloyd's (of London), the internationalisation of banking and commodities dealing, and the growth of small stock markets. It is not going to remain the financial centre of Europe unless it is constantly watchful,' he says. Sir Michael was one of a group of senior City figures such as Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, who have made way on the Stock Exchange board for figures such as Sir Michael's successor, Mr Marks. Sir Michael argues that the new group will need all the initiative it can muster. 'John Kemp-Welch (the new chairman of the exchange) could be marvellous, but he needs a group of punchy young executives like Michael Marks to provide new ideas,' he says. Sir Michael has been a strong supporter of the exchange taking on a more European role to reinforce its primary position. One of Smith New Court's unusual policies has been that nearly 10 per cent of equity is held by staff. Sir Michael argues that this has helped to prevent employees being poached in lean times. 'All my assets have two legs. If you are having a bad year, someone can take them away,' he says. Sir Michael seems unlikely to disappear from the City for some time yet. In addition to his role at Rothschild, he is a non-executive director of Sedwick Group and Savoy. And if he has his way, it should not be too long before one of the City's guiding hands re-appears at another helm.</p>

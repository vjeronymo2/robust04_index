			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Observer: Bags not me Meanwhile, 59-year-old Rudi Mueller, who stays on as chairman of UBS in London, tells Observer that he has counted himself out as a candidate for the chairmanship of the Stock Exchange when Sir Andrew Hugh Smith steps down in just under a year. Planning to move back to Switzerland when he turns 62, he considers two years to be far too short a time to devote to 'such an important assignment'. It would seem that the exchange has yet to identify Sir Andrew's successor, which may be one reason why the headhunters had such difficulty in recruiting a chief executive. Who would want to take on this already daunting task whilst in the dark as to the identity of the next chairman? After searching long and hard, and apparently even trying to persuade City firms to second a senior figure for a couple of years, the exchange seems finally to have struck lucky, and a chief executive, from outside the current staff, is expected to be named at Thursday's council meeting. So now what is called for is an imaginative choice of chairman. Among those already on the board, one obvious candidate would be deputy chairman Herschel Post, an American so anglicised that a fellow board member had no idea Post was not English. Sir Michael Richardson has also been mentioned, but the chairman of Smith New Court would have trouble establishing his independence from the interests of the market-making fraternity. Outside its own ranks, the board might consider Hoare Govett chairman Peter Meinertzhagen. But why not cast the net far wider, outside the membership of the exchange for once? Out there, perhaps, is a fresh mind which would actually relish the challenge.</p>

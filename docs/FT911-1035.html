			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Daimler-Benz track project angers ecological lobby DAIMLER-BENZ, the German motor conglomerate, was yesterday given the green light to build a DM300m vehicle test track across north German moorland, in a decision likely to attract wrath from the country's active ecology lobby. Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the northern state of Lower Saxony, which is run by a Social Democrat-Green coalition, said his government's decision in favour of the project was 'difficult but ecologically justifiable'. That was not the view of the country's leading ecological action group, Bund, which immediately attacked the move as endangering the environment in the rural region of Emsland near the north German coast. Yesterday's decision by the Lower Saxony government envisages a 13km test track for lorries and cars being built by 1996 near the town of Papenburg. Both Green ministers in the Lower Saxony government approved the action, although the Green faction in the Hanover state parliament voiced considerable misgivings. Mr Schroder, said the state government was spending 'not one D-Mark' on subsidies for the project. Proceeds from sale of the land  - whose only current industrial use is to provide peat for farms and gardens  - would be put towards developing alternative public transport systems. Daimler Benz earlier fought for a decade to build a test track at Boxberg in the company's home state of Baden-Wurttemberg in the south of the country. But Daimler-Benz was forced to retreat in 1987 when Supreme Court judges ruled that the company could not go ahead with compulsory purchase of land for the site from farmer who refused to sell up. The Stuttgart-based giant has been considering building a test track in Alsace in eastern France, but said yesterday that it would no longer pursue these plans.</p>

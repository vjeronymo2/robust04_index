			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: BankAmerica purchase raises presence in Texas BANKAMERICA, the leading bank in the western US, yesterday moved to strengthen its modest presence in the important Texas market with the purchase of 130 branches and Dollars 7.5bn of deposits from First Gibraltar Bank, a large savings institution controlled by the financier Mr Ronald Perelman. The deal, part of the consolidation of the fragmented US banking industry, came as North Carolina-based First Union agreed to buy Virginia-based Dominion Bankshares for stock valued at Dollars 850m. Californian-based BankAmerica said the cost of the First Gibraltar deal was expected to be around Dollars 110m, mainly in cash, paid to MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, the parent company behind Mr Perelman's privately-owned empire. Mr Perelman's acquisition of First Gibraltar four years ago created immense controversy because of the favourable terms he won from a government agency overseeing the national crisis of failed savings and loans institutions. He pieced together First Gibraltar from failed thrifts acquired for Dollars 355m, while gaining Dollars 900m in tax breaks and a contract to manage distressed loans held by the institutions. He now appears to have utilised most of the tax breaks and management fees. First Gibraltar was put up for sale earlier this year. But despite its extensive branch network, its attractions for potential purchasers were reduced by its relatively slim loan book and lack of business customers. BankAmerica said it would be buying some Dollars 225m of commercial loans and Dollars 640m of consumer loans. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes would retain First Gibraltar's federal savings bank charter, four branches in Plano,Texas, and non-banking subsidiaries. BankAmerica operates 130 branches in Texas and has some Dollars 3.7bn of deposits. It claimed the deal would boost it to second place in the state in terms of branches, behind North Carolina-based NationsBank, and fourth position in terms of deposits. The Californian bank moved into Texas in 1991, buying the assets of a troubled Houston bank, and followed this up with deals involving two thrifts.</p>

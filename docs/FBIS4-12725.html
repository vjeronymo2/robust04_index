			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas] </F>   [Excerpt] "The war against terrorism will continue  relentlessly, despite high hopes for change in Gaza, but it is  important to stress that the total and indefinite closure of the  territories could facilitate more incidents, said OC [Officer  Commanding] Southern Command Maj.-Gen. Matan Vilna'i yesterday.    Vilna'i, speaking to reporters in Gaza, stressed the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] had successfully dealt with total  closures of the Gaza Strip in the past, and is ready to do so  now.    "The burden of a total closure on the Palestinian population  is heavy, because they are economically dependent on employment  in Israel, and they are closely tied to Israel," said Vilna'i.    Military sources in the Southern Command said there had been  sharp increase in shooting attacks on the IDF in the Gaza Strip  during the past three months. There were 78 shootings in the  last three months, compared to a total of 40 for the whole of  1992, they said, adding that 48 incidents occurred in March  alone.    The sources estimated that with the establishment of  Palestinian self-rule, local feuds and power struggles between  Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] are to be  expected. [passage omitted]    [Writing on page A5 of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 11  April, political correspondent Aluf Ben says that in a briefing  delivered at the 10 April cabinet meeting, "a senior Shin Bet  figure reported that 58 Israelis have been killed and 270  wounded since March 1993. The fatalities were made up of 43  civilians and 15 security personnel. Twenty-four were killed  inside the Green Line. In the previous closure months -- March  through September 1993 -- three Israelis were killed inside the  Green Line. Over 90 percent of the perpetrators of attacks were  under the age of 24, and all the perpetrators of attacks inside  Israel were single men."]</p>

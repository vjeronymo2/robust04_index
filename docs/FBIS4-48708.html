			<p>BFN     [Text] Reaction by political leaders to President Mandela's  speech was generally positive. Some parties expressed concern  over the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development  Plan and the amnesty issue. But politicians across the  political spectrum said it would boost investor confidence.    [Correctional Services spokesman Sipho Mzimela] I think it  was a very comprehensive speech. It dealt with all the major  areas which government has to attend to and it touched on the  major issues and problems which are facing the county. So in  that sense I think it's a very good speech.    [Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen in Afrikaans] I think  the reconstruction program which President Mandela talks about  is a very ambitious plan. He is talking about big amounts of  money. I hope it will be possible. For it to become possible  will entirely depend on a, Foreign aid, and b, to what extent  our economy is going to produce. There is quite a strong  feeling among many people that the economy can pick up strongly.  I hope that will be the case because if the economy is not  strong, then we will not be in a position to get this  reconstruction program off the ground.    [Minister Without portfolio Jay Naidoo] I believe it's a  very  realistic program. It offers us a kick start to the  Reconstruction Development Program and we are wanting to deliver  the goods now. And that is what the president has instructed us  to do, and that is what we are going to do.    [Democratic Party acting leader Tony Leon] The Democratic  Party is very encouraged by the tone and by the content of the  speech. We think President Mandela went a long way toward  reassuring all the communities which need to be brought into  nation-building and reconciliation, particularly the financial  and investment community.    [Pan Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu] Well, it  is  not easy for me to comment on the speech as it is, but it was a  well balanced one because it covered quite a number of issues  affecting our country -- the issues like health, gender issues,  education, unemployment, housing etcetera. And these are the  issues we need to address.    [Environmental Affairs, Tourism Minister Dawie de Villiers]  I  think it is a speech that will encourage confidence. The  president succeeded in marrying the objectives of the  Reconstruction and Development Program with sound economic and  financial management. I believe the speech will be well  received by the private sector. [end recording]</p>

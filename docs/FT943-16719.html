			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The price of Pibs In the Weekend FT of May 21/22, you gave details of permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs) in several building societies. You stated in your article that investors can get back their capital only by selling these in the stock market. Where can you buy Pibs and where are the daily prices published? Permanent interest-bearing shares in building societies can be purchased through the market and you should contact your local broker. Prices are published in the stock exchange Official List and under the London Stock Exchange Dealings heading in section one of Saturday's FT. Investors should be aware, however, that Pibs are not protected investments for the purposes of payments out of the building societies' investor protection funds. (Answer by Murray Johnstone). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

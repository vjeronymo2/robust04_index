			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Climbing out of the hole THE BRITISH government is in better shape at the start of the new parliamentary season than it was at the conclusion of the old. The Conservative party appears to be in a less fractious mood now that the Maastricht treaty is behind it. Tories should be able to unite behind the items outlined in the Queen's speech on Thursday. The prime minister, who at the end of the summer was left hanging by his fingernails over a chasm, has begun a long climb towards safer ground. His bold initiative on Northern Ireland might just restore his reputation, at least as a skilled negotiator. Meanwhile the economic recovery is leading its political counterpart, at about the optimum pace. The rate of return to growth is sufficient to provide hope, but not too rapid to constitute overheating. This should best suit the government as it prepares for Budget day on Tuesday week. Encouraging It must have been hoping for signs of increased activity encouraging enough to allow the chancellor to raise taxes without appearing to risk choking off recovery, and yet not so strong that an offsetting interest rate cut is ruled out. To judge by the past week, things are turning out just right - the economy is indeed growing, but only modestly. Output rose by 0.6 per cent in the third quarter and at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent. Broad money growth accelerated in October. An unexpectedly large seasonally adjusted 49,000 fall in unemployment last month brings the total decrease this year to 137,000. A batch of encouraging, if statistically unreliable, trade figures suggested this week that the government may be getting the kind of export-led recovery that Britain needs. The overall trade deficit in August fell to its lowest monthly total for 6 1/2 years. More reliable was yesterday's news that the deficit with countries outside the European Union fell to Pounds 293m in October from Pounds 921m in September, while the value of exports rose by 8.8 per cent. Yet the improvement in the balance of trade is partly the result, of low retail demand. The value of imports from non-EC countries fell 3.5 per cent, while total retail sales volumes rose in October by a mere 0.1 per cent to stand 3.2 per cent higher than a year ago. This is the lowest year-on-year rate of growth for five months. Price competition is intense. The fall in unemployment disguises a still rather depressed labour market with employment growth effectively flat while wage inflation is low and falling. Meanwhile the retail prices index fell 0.1 per cent in October, cutting the annual rate of inflation to 1.4 per cent. In short, Mr Major has a sufficiently modest recovery to justify a further interest rate cut. Whether he will get the kind of accelerating recovery he needs over the coming two years remains in doubt, given the fact that still indebted consumers will be facing a rising tax burden between now and the next election, while the ability of UK exporters to grab market share as growth in Europe revives is, as yet, untested. On the political front his new slogan, 'back to basics', remains very much under test. Conservative party workers and, perhaps, backbench MPs have shown signs of rallying round, but the broader electorate remains sceptical. Insofar as 'back to basics' means anything, its application to the legislation announced in the Queen's speech is questionable. A harsher law-and-order regime is, at best, an incomplete answer to the challenge of rising crime. A new quango for teacher training is an inadequate response to the challenge laid down on Monday by Sir Claus Moser's freelance national commission on education, which argued forcefully that the development of knowledge-based industries requires an intensified educational programme. The rest of the Queen's speech is a rag-bag, containing proposals chosen for their acceptability by potential Tory rebels. What is left of the coal industry is to be privatised, but the government has declined to apply the same principle to London's buses. It is leaving Sunday trading to a free vote - which, it must be hoped, comes down in favour of maximum deregulation - and dodging the promise of a new environmental agency by passing a 'paving' bill, allowing officials to prepare the way. The umpteenth local government bills since 1979 will restructure councils in Wales and Scotland. Verified If the overall programme is uninspiring, Mr Major's courageous assumption of personal responsibility for Northern Ireland this week is wholly to his credit. In spite of his administration's occasional dependence on Unionist votes he has put the more recalcitrant of them on notice that if they decline to take part in peace talks they will be left out. He has offered Sinn Fein a place at the table in return for a verified end to IRA violence. He is working, with Dublin, towards an overall political settlement. If the Ulster parties fail to agree on new structures, he intimated on Thursday, he will produce proposals of his own. History suggests that the odds are against success, but the prime minister is right to try.</p>

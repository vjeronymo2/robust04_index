			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: British Aerospace pays Asda Pounds 79m - New row breaks out over option in dispute about joint venture BRITISH AEROSPACE yesterday announced that it had paid Pounds 79m to resolve a dispute with Asda, the supermarket group, over an ill-starred joint venture. However, a new row broke out over an option which could force BAe to buy out its partner, potentially for some Pounds 75m. Arlington, BAe's property subsidiary, said the option was irrelevant. It only applied in the event of a default and so it was invalidated by the payment of the Pounds 79m, it said. 'Any action against Arlington will be vigorously contested,' the company added. Mr Paul Dowling, corpor- ate affairs director for Asda Group, said that Asda's lawyers took a different view. 'Our legal advice is that we have a put option. It is clear.' Mr Dowling said that Asda had not decided whether it would exercise its option. 'We are reviewing the situation,' he said. It is unclear what value would be placed on a half share of the Burwood House Group, the joint venture. However, it would probably be less than Pounds 75m, the equity injected by both partners when it was set up. The joint venture was set up two years ago, just before BAe took over Arlington, partly to help Asda raise cash to finance its acquisition of 61 Gateway stores. Gazeley Holdings, part of Asda, put 34 of its stores, then valued at Pounds 350m, into the group and extracted Pounds 275m of cash. Arlington injected a number of shopping schemes, then valued at Pounds 75m. Arlington guaranteed the value of these development sites when it set up the joint venture. Its payment of Pounds 79m into Burwood House arose from its obligation to make good a shortfall in value of the development properties. 'The decision was the most beneficial to British Aerospace after considering various proposals designed to protect the position of the joint venture company and the interest of both its shareholders,' it said in a statement to the Stock Exchange. It added that the payment avoided 'any question' arising from an option that would require Arlington to sell its interest in the Burwood House Group to Gazeley or to buy Gazeley's interest in the Burwood House Group, at open market value. BAe had already made provision for the payment in its 1991 accounts. Both companies have been under severe pressure recently. A month ago, Asda reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 68.8m for the half year to November 9. In recent months BAe has seen the failure of a Pounds 432m right issues, a heavy fall in profits and the departure of senior managers. BAe's share price fell from 295p to 282p. Asda's share price was unchanged at 38 1/2p.</p>

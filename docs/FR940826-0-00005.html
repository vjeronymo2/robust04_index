The Secretary of Agriculture has found that these marketing orders no longer tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. In a press release issued on May 16, 1994, the Department of Agriculture announced the intention to terminate the orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons, noting the division and turmoil in the industry and that the programs are not functioning as they should. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Christian Nissen, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&amp;V, AMS, USDA, Room 2522&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127; or Maureen Pello, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&amp;V, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This action is governed by the provisions of section 608c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR Parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California. Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR Part 910], as amended, regulates the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This termination order has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing of the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges, 125 handlers of Valencia oranges, and 70 handlers of lemons who were subject to regulation under the respective marketing orders and there are approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges, 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges, and 2,000 producers of lemons in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marketing Order No. 907 has been in effect since 1953, Marketing Order No. 908 since 1954, and Marketing Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 910 since 1958. When order authorities were utilized, the orders provided for the establishment of weekly volume regulation and size requirements. In addition, the marketing orders authorized marketing research and development and provided for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for affected handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: MR-Data Management at Pounds 6.35m as orders slide Pre-tax profits at MR-Data Management Group fell 27 per cent for the year to June 30, from Pounds 8.76m to Pounds 6.35m, because of order slippage and higher than expected restructuring costs. The group had issued a warning in July which resulted in a 19 per cent fall in the share price; yesterday the shares rose 6p to 135p. Mr John Redmond, chairman, said: 'The effects of our reorganisation are complete and we are now in a stronger position to market our business services in the area of information management'. Turnover was flat at Pounds 40.52m (Pounds 40.79m). Earnings per share were 8p (10.6p) and a dividend of 5.53p will be paid, 6.5 per cent ahead of the previous 5.19p. Cash balances were Pounds 4.3m at the end of the year. MR-Data, which operates in the UK and US, provides a range of bureau services including large-scale laser printing, computer output on microfilm and document scanning and transcription. It also markets software for free-form text retrieval. Mr Mike Elliott, chief executive, said restructuring charges had hit profits at the document image processing division, which made a Pounds 480,000 loss. Both the document filming and the map scanning businesses were now trading on an appropriate cost base, he said. Three orders for the company's Memex information retrieval software had been delayed. One, for the National Criminal Intelligence Service, had now been secured; the other two were expected to be concluded in the first half of the current year. The group is exploring moves into CD-ROM as an extension of its computer output on microfilm (COM) business in the UK and US.</p>

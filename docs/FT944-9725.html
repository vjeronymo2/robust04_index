			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (8): The Matif success story - Andrew Jack talks to the chairman of the financial futures exchange If Matif, the French financial futures exchange, was a quoted company, its shares would have been unlikely to have suffered as much as many on the malaise-ridden national markets over the last few months. The marche a terme international de France (Matif) began operating in February 1986, the result of a law passed in the previous year as part of a wide-ranging series of liberalisation measures designed to modernise the French capital markets. During 1993, the last full year for which information is available, it had grown to a point at which more than 72m contracts were exchanged - with trading volumes up more than 30 per cent on the previous 12 months. Net banking income jumped by 7 per cent to FFr606m, and total assets stood at FFr11.19bn. But Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, chairman, sees no reason to blush at the apparent embarrassment of riches. 'We have to guarantee every trade and we are a clearing house so we need assets like every insurance company to ensure our guarantee is as good as gold,' he says. He also points out that much of the money has been reinvested: in a new trading floor opened this autumn, in a new registration system, in developing new markets and products, and in a wide range of other technological and strategic innovations. However, the profitability of Matif has certainly triggered some frustrations among those who cannot share the spoils. It was created as a unique tripartite initiative, a corporate entity with the shareholders equally split between banks, brokers and insurance companies. Now some of those who did not originally take part are calling for a share of the equity. There is another potential problem with Matif's heady expansion. Much of the growth has come from demand in other countries. At the end of 1993, non-residents' share of open positions on the market was substantial: 42 per cent on the notional contract, and up to 83 per cent for the Ecu long bond, for example. This partly reflects the organisation's success in its increasingly aggressive international marketing campaign - with recent presentations in countries including the US and UK. But it may also present future challenges, and reflects the relative weakness of French domestic markets to use financial derivatives to a greater extent. Sit down to chat with Mr Pfauwadel and it is difficult to get him to stop. 'I can talk for 24 hours,' he says. 'I love this job.' It is one he is well suited for. In effect, he has been forced to swallow his own medicine, as the deputy under-secretary at the French treasury who drafted the laws in 1985 that still dictate the framework within which Matif operates. Mr Pfauwadel says the organisation was developed 'in French style': largely through the work of civil servants, who were not suspicious of the market, but in fact extremely keen to develop an efficient, workable futures exchange to modernise the country's capital markets and compete with those in other countries. The result is that he sees no need for great changes to the law. Nor does he see the need for enormous restructuring of the services currently provided. After rapid growth in its first eight years, Mr Pfauwadel looks more on the next few as being primarily time for consolidation of existing strategies. Matif has developed a series of new financial products, and now offers long, medium and short-term interest rate contracts; stock index futures on the Paris bourse's CAC 40; and currency options; as well as commodity contracts in white sugar and potatoes. Now Mr Pfauwadel believes that most products for which there is currently demand are catered for. 'It is becoming more difficult to innovate,' he says. However, he argues that there may be scope still in commodities - notably agriculture, in a reflection of France's strength in the sector. So, at the end of October Matif launched a rapeseed futures market, two years after the European price of the product was wrested from the control of civil servants in Brussels. As other commodities such as wheat are liberalised, Mr Pfauwadel believes there may be scope to provide futures in these crops too. Not all have been so successful, however. Matif has had to abandon several of its financial contracts, and has also had to close its commodity futures in coffee and cocoa, for example. However, Mr Pfauwadel says he is in no hurry to look for quick returns on rapeseed, and stresses that providing new services is far more important than generating a profit in the short to medium term. An arguably more significant set of new developments is in expanding the range of products available by connections to other exchanges. Traditionally, Matif has been an 'open outcry' market, with deals done by traders on a physical floor. However, Mr Pfauwadel is far from dogmatic about this approach continuing to dominate in the future. In 1993, Matif members gained access to Globex, the 24-hour screen-based electronic trading system developed by Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and which now accounts for an estimated 80 per cent of its total volumes. At least equally important, at the end of the same year, it signed a co-operation agreement with the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) in Frankfurt, its opposite number. This allows members to trade electronically in two German products. Reciprocally, two French products will be available within the next few months. If all goes well, new products will be developed in both directions, and a clearing system between the two exchanges put in place by the end of next year. Mr Pfauwadel says he is already in discussions with his equivalents in other European countries to do the same: notably the Dutch, Spaniards and Swiss. One country is strikingly absent from the list: the UK, represented by its London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe). Mr Pfauwadel says he approached the market before going to the Germans, but officials refused to take part. 'The British have another strategy,' he says. 'They want an open outcry system, with a big market in the City to quote all European products. It is in conflict with our strategy to develop a domestic niche and link to other exchanges by a network.' It may be that these two different and opposing approaches which, more than anything, set the tone for the competition for the markets for futures and options across Europe over the next few years.</p>

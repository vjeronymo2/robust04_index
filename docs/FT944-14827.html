			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Eximbank to favour Beijing The US Export-Import Bank expects to increase sharply its concessional finance to China to help US business gain access to the world's fastest-growing market. Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of Eximbank, yesterday said that China had, in fiscal year 1994, become the bank's biggest customer in Asia. Financing of US exports this year to China had reached Dollars 1.3bn, against Dollars 800m in fiscal 1993 - a 63 per cent increase. Mr Brody noted that the bank had applications pending for additional financing of Dollars 3.3bn. He expected priority areas for US business would continue to be the power sector, aircraft sales, airport construction, air traffic control facilities and equipment for aircraft. This was the first vist to China of a US Eximbank chairman for eight years, and it reflects growing US determination to penetrate the Chinese market. Mr Brody said that under the Clinton administration there had been a significant change of policy. 'The US government is going to help US companies to compete and win in the global market place.' He said there was 'no limit' on Eximbank lending to China within the bank's guidelines, which include provision for project financing and financing of exports of consumer goods, spare parts, raw materials, bulk agricultural commodities and quasi-capital goods. Mr Brody said his bank was seeking to develop closer relations with Chinese institutions, including the State Development Bank.</p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.N. SAYS IRAQ MUST PAY;  </P> <P> FRANCE SHUTS ITS EMBASSY IN KUWAIT  </P> <P> The U.N. Security Council today adopted a resolution holding Iraq responsible  for war damages and asking states to document financial losses and mistreatment  of civilians arising from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.  </P> <P> The vote was 13 in favor and none against, with abstentions by Cuba and Yemen.  </P> <P> The draft was sponsored by Britain, Canada, Finland, France, Romania, the  United States, the Soviet Union and Zaire.  </P> <P> The resolution, which touches on various aspects of the Iraqi occupation, also  demands an end to all hostage-taking and a halt to the destruction of property  by Iraqi forces in Kuwait. It says Baghdad must resupply foreigners and the few  embassies operating in Kuwait with adequate food and water.  </P> <P> Also today, France ordered its diplomats to quit their besieged embassy in  Kuwait and return home with 300 French hostages being freed by Iraq.  </P> <P> That left just two embassies defying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's order to  close -- the United States and the British.  </P> <P> The U.N. vote had been scheduled for Saturday, but in a last-minute turnaround,  the Soviet Union asked the council for a postponement in the hope that talks in  Baghdad between Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov and Iraqi leaders would lead to a  peaceful solution of the crisis.  </P> <P> But Primakov left Baghdad early today empty-handed after failing to persuade  Hussein to compromise on Kuwait. However, Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev, speaking in Paris, held out hopes Iraq may yet be willing to give  ground in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The new resolution sets up a mechanism that would make Iraq liable for  financial damages caused by its invasion of Kuwait by "inviting" all states to  document their economic losses.  </P> <P> According to Council President David Hannay of Britain, states will begin  "systematically drawing up the balance sheet" to provide evidence "as and when  arrangements are made" in a final settlement of the conflict.  </P> <P> But the resolution does not say how Iraq is to pay for any damage. Suggestions  by British officials to compensate states and individuals from Iraq's assets  abroad have been put aside for the time being.  </P> <P> It also asks states to collect evidence on Iraq's mistreatment of civilians,  which some diplomats defined as a first step toward action on war crimes at a  later date.  </P> <P> However, several council diplomats admitted this would prove extremely  difficult to carry out.  </P> <P> Meanwhile today, hundreds of French citizens left Baghdad on a flight to  freedom after three months as hostages of Hussein.  </P> <P> Among the French were the last seven diplomats who endured an arduous siege of  their embassy in occupied Kuwait. Also aboard the flight to Paris were nine  Greeks, four Britons, two Filipinos, one German and one Spaniard.  </P> <P> The Iraqi Airways jetliner picked up more than 50 French evacuees in Kuwait  City in the early afternoon before flying to Baghdad, where hundreds of  hostages celebrated with beer and whiskey as the plane landed.  </P> <P> Iraq announced last week that it would allow French hostages to leave. France  stressed it had not engaged in negotiations to obtain their release.  </P></p>

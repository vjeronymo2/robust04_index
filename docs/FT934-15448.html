			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Technology: Going for gold in the computer race - At next February's winter Olympics computers will ease the load of TV and radio commentators After the global drama centring on the decision to site the 2000 Olympics in Sydney rather than Beijing, Berlin or Manchester, the next winter Olympics will take place in the quietest and most unassuming of venues - the little town of Lillehammer in Norway. With most of the construction finished - one stadium has been blasted out inside a hill, another built like an upturned Viking ship - there is little of the usual last-minute panic and controversy. All should function with Nordic efficiency when the 2,000 athletes, the 100,000 or so daily spectators and 6,000 media representatives descend on the area in February. For winter sports addicts, the games will be a must. Those who cannot be there will be glued to their television screens or radios. But however rapt their attention, it will be nothing compared with the concentration required by the commentators. In many cases, they, too, will be staring at screens - on computers as well as TV monitors. As part of its technological contribution to the 1994 winter Olympics, IBM has developed a touch-screen system of constantly updated data about timings, rankings and biographies of the events as they take place. Called the Commentator Information System and based on a more limited service provided at last year's Barcelona summer games, it provides real-time information to people who have never been trained on the system. 'TV and sports commentators expect to come in five minutes before an event starts, sit down and work on the system,' says Erik Andersen, senior consultant at A/S EDB, a Norwegian computer company which is working with IBM on CIS. 'There is no possibility of any time for training.' The system is easy to use. Commentators touch the screen with a finger or pen to reveal a list of sports, their participants and how they are performing. Results information is fed in directly from the timing system of Seiko of Japan. With an expected global TV audience of around 2.5bn people, IBM has tried to make it as simple as possible to report on one or more sports - on the spot or at another site - using information visible on both the TV and computer screen. 'Our main challenge is the stopwatch,' adds Andersen. 'This is the 1990s and the solution is computers.' The first thing the commentator will see on the IBM screen is a sparkling winter scene of a skier slicing though the snow in front of a clump of trees. A touch of the screen reveals a display of all sports at the games with their official pictograms. An event held locally is shown in green, those at distant venues in blue. Three languages can be selected, the official Olympic ones of English and French and the host country's Norwegian. Curiously, the German language, important in winter sports, is not on the system. It could be, says Andersen, but the International Olympic Committee specifies only three; German, Austrian and Swiss commentators will have to rely on their linguistic abilities. When the event is chosen on the IBM screen, the list of athletes is shown. In the case of the biathlon, for example, commentators can check on who is starting, who has finished, what the rankings are during this combined cross-country skiing and shooting event, and how stragglers compare with leaders. Athletes of any country can be highlighted and biographies called up. TV sports reporters will not need starting lists as all athletes will be on screen. If anything unusual happens, such as a disqualification, this will be described. To switch to another sport, the user will have to return to the original pictogram display; it will not be possible to shuffle between sports without doing this or follow two events on a split screen. Even so, CIS is likely to be a big help, especially when combined with Info 94, IBM's Olympic Information System which will store all news about events, ceremonies and athletes throughout the games. Data will be wiped from the screens at the 800 CIS stations around the games at the end of each day, but be stored in Info 94 for viewing on separate terminals in the venues, press and broadcasting centres and hotels. The biggest user of CIS will be CBS, the US TV channel which is sending around 1,000 people to Lillehammer. Both CBS and Norwegian TV will use the system to produce graphics. Another important user will be Britain's BBC. 'Most TV companies want to send as few commentators as possible and comment on as many sports as possible,' says Andersen. Although the IBM system will help both the best and the least expert journalists, he does not believe CIS will narrow the gap in skills between them. 'Good commentators stand out anyway, as they tell you things the system can't tell you,' he says. There will still be plenty of scope for the usual flow of anecdotes, jokes or criticism. Although final contracts have still to be signed, IBM expects the system to be used at the Atlanta summer games in 1996 and the next winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Maybe a few jokes and stories will have been worked into the computer to liven up those inevitable dull moments when the weather takes a hand.</p>

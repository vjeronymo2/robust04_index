			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with PLO official Nabil Sha'th by Yariv </F> Ben-Yehuda at the Rafah border terminal "several minutes ago" --  recorded]    [Text] Nabil Sha'th said today that East Jerusalem will be  the capital of an independent Palestinian state. He said this  prior to leaving Egypt for the Gaza Strip. Sha'th arrived at  the Rafah border terminal several minutes ago. In an interview  with our correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda, Sha'th refused to say  when 'Arafat will arrive in the autonomous area:    [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] Nabil Sha'th crossed into  the Rafah border terminal several minutes ago. Sha'th told IDF  Radio that no date has been set for Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in  Gaza and Jericho, but he believes that 'Arafat will arrive by  the end of the month:    [Sha'th, in English] He is preparing for his return. I  don't have a date, but I suppose it will not be after the end of  this month. I think he will be coming....    [Ben-Yehuda, interrupting, in English] How much money have  you brought with you this time?    [Sha'th] I don't give out that information. The money that  is being transferred here is enough to pay all the salaries that  have not been paid and all the expenses that have not been paid.  Very soon the World Bank is going to assume responsibility for  transferring the $42 million we agreed on in Paris. It will be  transferred directly by the World Bank.    [Ben-Yehuda] What are you planning to do in the next few  days?    [Sha'th] I am planning to start my life, my home, my office,  and to solve the problems that have not been solved.    [Ben-Yehuda] You are here to stay?    [Sha'th] I am here to stay. [end recording]</p>

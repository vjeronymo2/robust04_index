			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "Ministry Calls For </F> Immediate Action To Combat Drought"]    [Text] The Agricultural Ministry now believes it is  critical that the government speed up efforts to fight North  China's disastrous drought that is threatening spring sowing.    "Every possible means must be utilized to combat the  persisting drought and minimize its damage," the ministry  spokesman said yesterday.    The ministry has urged all local agricultural departments to  mobilize any available manpower, materials and funds to  reinforce the antidrought campaign.    "All agricultural departments in the drought-stricken areas  must tap every resource and take effective measures, according  to their local conditions, in order to overcome the disaster and  win a bumper harvest both in summer and autumn this year," he  added.    Beijing, suffering from a severe 16-month drought, has  answered the call and decided to strengthen its irrigation drive.    The city has 2.7 million workers plus millions of machines  and other materials fighting the dry spell.    And the central government recently allocated 1.5 million  yuan ($172,000) to support Beijing's effort.    A ministerial report released yesterday said the protracted  drought seriously jeopardizes spring ploughing in eight  provinces and cities.    The shortage, which began last winter and became more severe  this spring, has affected more than 4.7 million hectares of  farms, mainly in North China.    The report said another 9.3 million hectares of farmland,  almost one-tenth of the country's total, are under threat.    The affected provinces are having difficulty in sowing  cotton  and spring wheat, and winter wheat and rapeseed have already  been damaged.    Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi have been hardest hit by  the drought, while Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, and northern and  western Henan Province are also affected, the spokesman said.    Beijing's water supply suffered a sharp drop in nearly all  its reservoirs, drying up most of its rivers and pushing down  the level of its underground water.    As a result, more than 133,000 hectares of its suburban  farmland have been damaged.    Moreover, about 90,000 people and 11,000 heads of livestock  in its suburban counties are faced with a serious water shortage.    And in Tianjin, most of the farmland is barren, with more  than 115,300 hectares of wheat crop dried up and 280,000  hectares of suburban farmland unsown.</p>

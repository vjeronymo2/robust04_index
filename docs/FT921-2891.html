			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Real depth - Ballot Box Labour has a bountiful range of politically powerful economic statistics about the length and depth of the recession with which it can embarrass the Tories. So why do they keep quoting one of the more dubious comparisons? It is true that total UK gross domestic product fell by 2.5 per cent last year; and yes, that is the largest annual fall since the 1930s, outstripping the 1980 contraction by 0.5 percentage points. Yet this is a needlessly misleading statistic. The current recession may be the longest recession since the war, but 1980-81 is still the deepest, whatever these annual gymnastics seem to suggest. GDP has fallen, in this recession, by 3.7 per cent over the six quarters since the middle of 1990. But GDP fell by 4.9 per cent in the five quarters between the fourth quarter of 1979 and the first quarter of 1981. Counting from the third quarter of 1979, the first quarter of both negative growth and Tory government, output fell by 5.5 per cent. This government may have presided over the two deepest recessions since 1945 but this is still the shallower of the two - at least so far. Another quarter or two of recession and 1990-92 could win both prizes.</p>

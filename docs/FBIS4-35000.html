			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] On 26 June, two days after making the announcement,  Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo withdrew his resignation. In  fact, there was considerable expectation over the weekend over  the outcome of Carpizo's announcement on 24 June. It was  announced that same day that Carpizo and President Salinas would  discuss the matter on 25 and 26 June. Saturday was a long day  of waiting and the following letter addressed to the president  and the general public was released on 26 June at noon. The  text of the letter follows:    1. Due to the decisive support I have received from ample  sectors of society, the president of the republic, political  parties, and nongovernment, professional, and academic  organizations, and in order to dispel the belief I am acting  irresponsibly and unpatriotically, I will remain in the post of  interior secretary to fulfill the inherent duties of that post  during the federal electoral process.    2. I hereby confirm the commitments established in the  agreement signed by eight political parties and myself on 27  January 1994 regarding democracy, justice, and peace. Likewise,  I guarantee my impartiality, which I intend to firmly maintain.  To do this, I will require the support of the general public and  political parties so that there will be no further speculation  concerning the party to which I referred in my letter of  resignation. Any disclosure on my part at this time would  seriously affect my impartiality and the duties I must carry out  in the forthcoming electoral process.    3. I will continue to strictly adhere to the de jure state  by holding clean, reliable, objective, and honest elections.    4. I hereby affirm my current post is the last political  post I will hold during my lifetime. I will not, under any  circumstance, hold a political post in the future.    5. I urge all Mexicans to strengthen our de jure state, to  always speak the truth, and to make political civility and  mutual respect govern our actions. In my opinion, these  principles constitute an irreversible commitment.    Dr. Jorge Carpizo concluded his letter by thanking the  general public, the president of the republic, and the political  parties for their support in urging him to continue as the head  of the Interior Secretariat.</p>

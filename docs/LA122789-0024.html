			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM  </P> <P> Making Guthrie's song into the national anthem is a good idea. I've been  sympathetic to the idea of replacing "The Star Spangled Banner" as the national  anthem ever since I heard the idea expressed on "All in the Family" many years  ago, but I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of replacing it with "America the  Beautiful."  </P> <P> I don't have anything against "The Star Spangled Banner," mind you. I don't  have anything against "America the Beautiful," either. I just think we ought to  change the national anthem, and I would personally like to see it replaced with  something that, on the one hand, couldn't be objectionable to anyone while, on  the other, wouldn't be so watered-down that it wouldn't be inspirational. "This  Land Is Your Land" is the perfect sort of song if you think about it.  </P> <P> Just the other day, I saw Dale Evans on one of those Christian stations singing  it. I let her finish before I turned (the channel).  </P> <P> Also, Guthrie was the sort of American who ought to have one of his songs as  the national anthem. Pete Seeger said in a documentary that when the FBI came  to ask him about the so-called communist conspiracy, Guthrie made up a song  with, as I recall, the following words: "They said would I fight for my  country/ I answered the FBI 'Yea'/ I will point a gun for my country./ But I  won't guarantee you which way."  </P> <P> RONALD WEBSTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Letter: The harder facts of life in Germany Sir, A 20 per cent increase in the price of an ice cream cone is bad enough (Observer, April 27). But even worse are the average 10 per cent increases on everyday items such as bread, newspapers and magazines, fruit (up to 100 per cent dearer this year]) plus ever-increasing rents, charges for water and refuse collection, etc, etc, etc. These are the facts of life in Germany which are leading to increased 'militancy' among ordinary workers. There have been several demands for a 'zero round' - ie no wage increases - this year. But most people already suffered a 'zero round' last year: the so-called 'solidarity surcharge' of 7.5 per cent of normal income tax deductions (as if it was voluntary]) meant that many people had no net wage increase last year. People here are angry. The Bonn government lied when it said reunification would not result in higher taxes; and admitted the real, huge additional financial burden only after the federal elections were over. Meanwhile, it is insisting on going ahead with insane projects such as the Jaeger 90 fighter aircraft; the political parties are 'helping themselves' to enormous sums from public funds; there have been various attempts to increase politicians' pension rights to astronomical levels; German industry is making huge profits, but failing to invest in the eastern states; and the ordinary people are being accused of greed and asked to pay for the mess] Inflation rate 4.8 per cent? Tell it to your Tante. Alison Bailey, Lange Reihe 47, D-2000 Hamburg 1, Germany</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Turkey strides firmly on to a new stage: Ankara has suddenly found itself at the centre of things THE high profile visit which Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, paid to six central Asian republics and his participation in a central Asian summit last weekend has underlined forcefully the new role his country hopes to play in world affairs. No longer does Turkey see itself as merely a bridge between Europe and the Middle East - a favoured argument deployed over the years by Ankara in support of its application for membership of what it perceived as an unimaginatively inward-looking European Community. The ending of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union has allowed Turkey to broaden its horizons to an area of central Asia from which many of its people originated and with which it retains strong ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic ties. From being on the periphery of both Europe and Asia, Turkey has suddenly found itself at the geopolitical centre of a newly emerging region. . Suddenly, the fact that Turkey has been jilted by the EC, which has made clear that it sees no early prospect of admitting it as a full member, is looked upon as much less of a disaster by Turkish officials, at least in the short term. The emotional rhetoric that accompanied Mr Demirel's triumphal progress through Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, might send shivers down the spines of some Balkan states like Greece, whose ancestral fear of Turkish expansionism and domination lies barely quiescent at the best of times and needs little reawakening. For the US and most of its western allies, however, the prominent role that Turkey aspires to play in the development of the republics, is a welcome contribution to stabilising a highly volatile region. Though Turkey's religion is Moslem, the secular values bequeathed it in 1923 by its founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, makes it the ideal mentor of the new central Asian republics, with a similar mixed recent tradition. In that capacity, Turkey is more acceptable in the region as an advocate of western ideas and values than any western power is likely to be. Equally important, it is likely to act as a bulwark against Iran, which has been making strenuous efforts to extend both its influence and that of a more extreme form of Islam. Yet in spite of some grandiose pronouncements, Mr Demirel hasnot his ambitions run away with him. Though calling for a Turkic summit in Istanbul in the autumn, he has ruled out a formal pan-Turkic alliance for the foreseeable future. The desire not to go it alone and, whenever possible, to act in concert with its main allies and partners in international organisations such as Nato and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, continues to be a guiding principle of Turkey's foreign policy. In the explosive dispute between Christian Armenia and Moslem Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey had, until last weekend, refrained from openly backing its Moslem sister state and had attempted to play a neutral mediating role. However, the fall of one of the last important Azeri strongholds has forced it to adopt a more partisan stance. The prime minister has been somewhat less cautious in his promises of economic aid to the republics, given the need for belt-tightening demanded by the parlous state of the domestic economy - inflation was running close to 70 per cent last year and there is a rampant public sector deficit. The offer of a total of Dollars 1.1bn of credits to the Moslem republics was greeted with scepticism by Turkish Eximbank officials in Ankara, given the state of the country's foreign exchange reserves and the incapacity of debtor countries to provide adequate guarantees for the loans. The limits to Turkey's regional leadership aspirations, as well as those of Iran and Pakistan, its direct rivals for that role, became clear at the summit of five of the republics in Ashkhabad, Turkemenistan, last weekend. Though wide-ranging plans for economic co-operation, covering road and rail links, oil and gas pipelines and a customs union were discussed by the five republics and their three potential benefactors, no concrete agreements were reached. The blocking of the plan for an oil pipeline between Kazakhstan and the Iranian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas by both Kazakhstan and Turkey, because of fears that it would give Iran control over central Asian oil exports, was symptomatic of the kind of political obstacles to regional co-operation which are likely to arise constantly. Even in the best of circumstances, it would take a long time before Turkey could reap any substantial benefits from what will remain, for the foreseeable future, an essentially one-sided economic relationship. In the short and medium term, central Asian, Black Sea regional or even Middle Eastern links cannot constitute an alternative to membership of the European Community, which already offers a duty-free market for 53 per cent of Turkey's industrial exports and has provided the impetus for its economic modernisation and political democratisation over the last decade. The real problem is how long Turkey will have to remain on the sidelines. For the moment, the Ankara government seems reluctantly to have come to terms with the European Commission's December 1989 opinion that it will have to wait until the EC has absorbed at least the European Free Trade Association applicants and, probably, some east European countries too. Realistically, the target date for Turkey's entry cannot be set before the beginning of the next century. But in the meantime, steps will have to be taken to bring Turkey closer to the Community, some of which have so far been blocked by Greece pending a solution of the Cyprus problem. Failing an assurance that at least the groundwork for eventual membership is being prepared, Turkey might indeed abandon its European aspirations in favour of the eastern promises, however insubstantial, that it is pursuing today.</p>

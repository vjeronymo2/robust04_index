			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Associated Nursing makes Pounds 725,000 Associated Nursing Homes made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 725,000 for the 28 weeks ended October 10 compared with a restated Pounds 379,000. The accounting policy relating to the capitalisation of interest on new homes has been changed, now being restricted to a maximum of three months from the date of the opening of the relevant home. That reduced the current pre-tax figure by Pounds 140,000 and last year's by Pounds 403,000. No interim dividend can be declared because of the lack of distributable reserves, but it is hoped to pay a final. Earnings per share were 6.6p (6.9p)</p>

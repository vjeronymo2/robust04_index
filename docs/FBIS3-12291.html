A Fatah source told AL-DUSTUR that there are undeclared real  divisions in the Fatah Movement ranks, the most acute of which  is that the Fatah command outside the territories has lost  control over the Fatah strike forces in the occupied territories  which call for suspending the negotiations with Israel.    The sources added that several Fatah military officials  might  announce stands completely different from Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat's stands if the Revolutionary Council does not  convene.</p>

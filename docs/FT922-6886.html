			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / All eyes on German money supply: The broad M3 measure has clearly grown more quickly than the Bundesbank would like, writes Andrew Fisher in Bonn. Exactly why is not quite so evident IN THE PAST, not many people bothered with the German money supply figures. German monetary stability was taken for granted. Those who watched to see if the Bundesbank's carefully set monetary targets were met were only the economists, bankers and financial market traders. But that was before the costs of reunifying Germany knocked the country's public finances sideways, with the money supply trend becoming a key factor in its high interest rates. The Bundesbank lifted rates in December to levels uncomfortably high for the rest of Europe, where economies remain weak, and foreign politicians and executives are acutely aware of what German money supply means for business abroad. Today, when M3, the broad monetary aggregate, is racing away at a near double-digit annual rate - twice the centre point of the target range for this year of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent - and inflation is higher than in Britain and France, Germany's money supply is one of the most closely watched financial indicators. However, while M3 clearly has grown much faster than the German central bank would like, it is not so evident why. In March, the growth rate was an annual 9.4 per cent after 8.6 per cent in February and 8.9 per cent in January. The rate is expected to slow, but there is little likelihood the Bundesbank will meet its target. The April figures will be out in the next few days. Curiously, M3 was already out of line at the start of the year; the target is based on the average for the fourth quarter of 1991, but December's rapid growth put the 1992 starting point well above that level. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank does not intend to make the target range higher simply to make it easier to reach. Its goal for M3 (comprising mainly cash, savings, and short-term deposits) is a firm expression of its intent to maintain stability. Past targets have not always been met, but they acted as beacons of monetary resolve to the financial world. Why is the target not being met now? What's more, does it really matter? Each year, the Bundesbank assesses Germany's potential for economic growth and adds a few percentage points for expected inflation and the rate of monetary circulation. The result is the M3 goal, with the range representing acceptable upper and lower variations. This time, however, unification has upset the calculations. The bank's determination to stick to its target range is its counter-strategy to the high, and inflationary, state spending and borrowing wave embarked on to support the east German economy. Most of the funds going from west to east still finance consumption rather than productive investment. Even so, investment in the east is moving ahead. It is this factor which is mainly behind the steep rise in the money supply. The benefit is that such spending represents the rebuilding of east Germany. But much of it is subsidised by soft loans, grants, and subsidies. Thus, credit demand from the private sector, up at an annual rate of 12 per cent in the past six months, is less subject to the Bundesbank's control. Also helping propel M3 along more quickly than usual are: lower profit levels, leading companies to borrow more at a time of economic slackness to finance investments; increased lending for consumption and residential property deals; and the effect of high interest rates in encouraging funds to be placed in short-term deposits. All this points to the question of how seriously M3's growth should be taken. The bank lifted interest rates by an unexpectedly high 0.5 percentage point in December, making it harder for other European countries to put theirs down at a time when their economies needed a stimulus (although Britain and France have just done so). Now, Germany's Lombard rate is at 9.75 per cent and the discount rate at 8 per cent. The longer money supply keeps expanding quickly, the less likely the Bundesbank is to cut rates. Inflation has moderated to an annual rate of 4.5 per cent in March, but the Bundesbank is obviously unhappy about wage trends and the vigour of M3. Moreover, the German economy, though flaccid after a lengthy period of growth, is resisting world recession and is expected to perk up in 1993. So high interest rates, in the Bundesbank's view, do not carry the risk of torpedoing the economy. Of immediate concern is the impact of monetary growth on inflation, which the bank wants to see below 4 per cent this year and around 2 per cent later. In its January report, the Bundesbank stressed its legal obligation to regulate money supply and credit to safeguard the D-Mark. It noted: 'There is also a growing worldwide conviction that central banks should primarily ensure stable prices. In this connection, managing the money stock is of crucial importance, for there is broad agreement that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the long run.' In the 1970s, the average rise in the money supply outpaced real potential growth in the economy by more than 6.5 per cent. This was accompanied by high inflation; prices increased by an annual average of 5.5 per cent. In the 1980s, M3 grew less rapidly and so did prices. These days, the link is less straightforward, partly because the D-Mark now floats against the dollar; this influences import costs and delays the influence of the money supply. 'Prices have tended to follow the growth of the money stock with a lag of about two to three years,' the bank said. So the full effect of what the Bundesbank is doing now may not show through for some time. For those abroad chafing under high German rates, patience may thus be the only response to the Bundesbank's stern policies.</p>

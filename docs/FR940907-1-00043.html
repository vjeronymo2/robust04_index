			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The issuer would disclose the required information for each solicited rating. If the rating designation includes a reference to a designation or published evaluation of non-credit payment risk (e.g., sensitivity to movements in interest rates), the additional analysis should be described. Where related evaluations are done, any use of the rating designation should include the designation for the related non-credit payment evaluation so investors relying on the designation are not left unaware of the related evaluation. For example, where a cash flow security is evaluated both for likelihood of cash receipt and susceptibility to interest rate volatility, the designation always should be presented in combination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not infrequently, the problem in clearly understanding the scope and meaning of the rating of structured instruments is exacerbated by the complexity and lack of clarity in the description of the securities being offered. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In some cases, even the title of the securities could lead to investor misunderstanding of the nature of the securities. The description of the securities should make clear the extent to which payment obligations are fixed or contingent, clearly explaining the nature of the contingencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Item 202 of Regulation S&hyph;K. 17 CFR 229.202. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In many cases, securities are offered on the basis of expected returns that can vary from the issuer's contractual commitments. For example, the terms of some asset-backed securities obligate the issuer only to pay available funds passed through from the underlying assets, but investors may expect a minimum stated return and, in fact, the security may be marketed as providing a stated return. In such cases, care needs to be used in both primary and secondary transaction disclosures to ensure that investors understand the limited obligation of the issuer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment is requested on the adequacy of the proposed disclosure requirements and whether the proposed requirements would assure that investors will be able to understand the limitations associated with a rating and will be able to compare ratings. Commenters suggesting alternative items should be specific in their suggestions. Commenters also should suggest approaches to ensure that the description of securities is clear and complete, and to ensure that security titles convey the risks involved in an investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment also is requested as to whether issuers should be required to disclose activities that could be viewed as ``rating shopping''_that is approaching a number of rating organizations to determine which organization will provide the highest rating on security terms most favorable to the issuer. To what extent does this practice occur and warrant such disclosure? Should the rules require issuers to disclose contacts with any NRSRO with respect to rating the securities being registered? If such disclosure is favored, should it only be required if the issuer discloses a rating in its prospectus? Alternatively, should such contacts be reported even if no rating is disclosed or required to be disclosed in the prospectus? If disclosure of preliminary contacts with NRSROs is required, what effect will such disclosures have on rating practices?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mutual funds often represent that they invest only in securities that have a specified rating, such as investment grade, or disclose the percentage of their portfolios comprised of securities with specified ratings. As discussed above, a rating may not convey a security's level of market risk, and, in the absence of appropriate disclosure, investors may not perceive the limitations of a rating or the investment characteristics it addresses. Comment is requested whether current mutual fund disclosure practices and requirements adequately address the limitations and scope of ratings and how mutual fund disclosure documents could be improved to improve investor understanding of the limitations of ratings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Rating Designations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, rating organizations frequently have used the same rating designations to represent their evaluation of a wide range of instruments with disparate types of payment obligations and, in many cases, subject to substantial market, cash flow, and liquidity risks. In some cases, the same designation has been used to represent limited scope ratings such as those involving cash flow securities and residuals. Recently, some NRSROs, when rating various interest rate sensitive instruments, have begun to use modifying designations to indicate the existence of non-credit payment risk but not a judgment of the extent of this risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the market's widespread use of ratings, and the common use of simple letter designations as shorthand communications of the rating, there is a substantial potential for investor misunderstanding. This problem can be particularly acute in the secondary markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment is requested as to the potential for investors to be confused or misled about the nature of the security or the meaning of a rating as the result of current rating designation practices. Should the disclosure of ratings require the use of designations that clearly distinguish traditional credit ratings from cash flow, residual or other limited scope ratings? Should ratings of securities subject to substantial non-credit related payment risks continue to be designated the same as securities that do not carry such risks? To the extent that commentators believe that there is a significant likelihood that investors may be misled through rating designations, should the Commission rely on rating organizations' self regulation to address the problem, or should the Commission take regulatory action to assure that a rating organization's designation system avoids issuing the same rating designation to securities having substantially different credit or other non-credit payment risks?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Security Rating Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is proposing to require issuers to report material changes in security ratings of their securities on Form 8&hyph;K. Not only is such information of importance to a company's security holders, but, as noted in the Commission's recent release on municipal disclosures, timely disclosure of such rating action is important to the efficiency and transparency of the debt markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Act Release No. 7049. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposal, issuers would be required to file a Form 8&hyph;K report within 15 calendar days of having been advised by the rating organization of a material change in any NRSRO rating obtained for its securities, including commercial paper, or any other rating of its securities that has been previously disclosed in a prospectus or registration statement for such securities registered under the Securities Act. As proposed, the disclosure of the changed rating would be accompanied by the same disclosure specified in Item 202(g) of Regulation S&hyph;K. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Only information with respect to the ratings subject to change would be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment is requested as to whether the Commission's proposal to mandate disclosure of material ratings upgrades is appropriate. Under the proposal, it is contemplated that reporting of all adverse rating changes would be required. The Commission requests comment as to whether there are rating downgrades that commenters believe should be viewed as immaterial. In particular, are there classes of securities as to which information on downgrades would not be material to a company's shareholders or debtholders?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment also is requested as to the appropriateness of the 15 day calendar period for reporting the rating change. Should the period be shorter, e.g. 5 business days, or longer, e.g. 20 days? Should the period run from the date of the rating change, rather than the date of notice of the change to the issuer? Should rating changes be reportable on a quarterly basis on Form 10&hyph;Q and Form 10&hyph;K (for the fourth quarter) rather than Form 8&hyph;K?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also should address the extent of the proposed disclosure matters. Should the proposed disclosure be streamlined to require only reporting: the NRSRO or other rating organization taking the action; the title of the securities affected; and both the prior and the new ratings? Comment also is requested as to whether the proposed disclosure requirement should be triggered when there is a change in a rating disclosed in any filing with the Commission (e.g., annual report on Form 10&hyph;K).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Request for Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the proposals, as well as any other matters that might have an impact on the proposals set forth in the release are requested to do so. The Commission requests comments on the impact of the proposals on issuers, potential investors, security holders, broker-dealers, rating organizations, and others. Comments also are requested on whether the proposed rule would have an adverse effect on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Commission will consider comments in complying with its responsibilities under Section 19(a) of the Securities Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 USC 77s(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 USC 78w(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposals, commenters are requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and benefits associated with these proposals. The proposals are expected to increase to some extent the net costs to issuers associated with registering securities for sale and complying with reporting requirements; these costs could be significant if the exemption for NRSROs from the consent requirements under the Securities Act were rescinded and the disclosure of ratings were mandatory. The costs to investors associated with these proposals are minimal. The proposals are expected to provide additional benefits to investors by enlarging the mix of information available to investors regarding security ratings and by alleviating the potential for market misunderstanding. Currently, many issuers seek security ratings for their securities in order to make them marketable. Because the proposals would require disclosure of security ratings and do not address whether issuers should obtain security ratings, the proposals are not expected to affect the issuance of rated securities, assuming the exemption for NRSROs from the consent requirements under the Securities Act is retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 for the proposed amendments. The analysis notes that the proposals are expected to increase regulatory costs for small entities which offer securities registered under the Securities Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

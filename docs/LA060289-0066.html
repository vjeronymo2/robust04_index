			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies moved to investigate whether the Baltic  republics willingly joined the Soviet Union, after historian Roy A. Medvedev  and other deputies charged that the Kremlin forcibly annexed them and then  doctored the truth. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, responding to a request  from an Estonian deputy, supported setting up a commission to look into whether  secret clauses in a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany assigned Lithuania, Latvia and  Estonia to the Soviet Union, paving the way for annexation a year later.  Gorbachev said he doubted that the Baltic people had opposed joining the Soviet  Union.  </P></p>

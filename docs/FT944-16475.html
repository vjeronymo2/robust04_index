			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: Opening the books and limiting liability  -Jim Kelly examines the ramifications for accountants of Peat Marwick's move towards incorporation The problem with the uncovering of secrets is that it often disappoints. One of the big secrets in the accountancy profession is how much the partners at the big firms earn. Thanks to KPMG Peat Marwick's historic decision to support incorporation of its audit arm we are about to find out. We will, I suspect, be disappointed. The independently audited accounts of Peat Marwick Audit plc, or whatever it may be called, will probably reveal earnings for partners of a modest kind. KPMG appears confident the figures will not raise eyebrows. What has caused a stir is its decision, if supported by its clients, to be the first accountancy firm of any size to move away from the confidential world of the partnership. Its declared aim is to limit the exposure of partners to legal actions. Those in a partnership face joint and several liability when, for example, an audited corporate client collapses. Disclosure will draw back the veil on KPMG's business for both clients and competitors. This is one of the penalties KPMG is prepared to pay to limit liability. They are also prepared to reveal a full financial statement for the rest of the business: a bold undertaking which has caught some competitors on the wrong foot. There are other penalties to partial incorporation. The increased tax burden on partners in the company is not inconsequential - although the benefits of partnership are not what they were and will diminish further. It is also likely that all Peat's partners, both inside and outside the audit practice, will share the financial burden. So taxation and disclosure are the immediate penalties. KPMG, and its clients, might also fear that the partnership ethos will be lost within the corporate framework. KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman has obviously decided that his partners do not need the fear of liability as a spur to commitment. Corporate management structures, after all, also have advantages. Most large partnerships with international links have moved toward a corporate structure. KPMG's competitors are likely to see other disadvantages to partial incorporation: after all, despite a lot of movement behind the scenes, none of them looks likely to follow suit in the short term. There are certainly doubts within KPMG itself, where there is some disquiet up to partner level, and possibly beyond. But the real problem with the KPMG option is that it does not solve the one problem which threatens the very existence of some of the big firms  - the explosion in claims against auditors under joint and several liability. In 1983 litigation as a proportion of audit costs for the eight largest firms was 2.6%. In 1993 it was 8 per cent and rising. In 1983 the six biggest firms faced three claims. In 1993 they faced 210 with 600 still open at the end of the year. In the past 10 years three out of five corporate collapses resulted in action against the auditor. Earlier this year the big eight, including Peat Marwick, put a submission to the Department of Trade and Industry urging reform of Section 310 of the Companies Act 1985 to allow the limitation of liability for auditors. The report noted that: 'Incorporation of accounting firms does not provide an effective solution.' Incorporation does not tackle the heart of the problem because the company can still be sued; in fact it can still be brought to destruction. Also those partners directly involved in negligent work are still liable. Legal advice about the extent of this liability is variable but crucial. For example: Is the accountant who trained the auditor who produced negligent work also liable? Is the immediate manager liable? Is the consultant liable? If the American experience, in which the leading accountancy firms have become Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP), provides any precedent, it is that liability would be strictly limited. Expert opinion on the question of liability in the LLPs points to the conclusion that direct supervision would need to be proved to extend liability. In the British context it appears that KPMG believes the law would follow similar reasoning. KPMG is also likely to see pursuit of partners in its audit arm as the second option for claimants after they have tackled the company. Another problem with incorporation as a counter-balance to liability is that the partners are not protected from prior actions against them lodged before incorporation. This is enough in itself to take the icing off of the corporate cake for most of the Big Six. There are other disadvantages. Being first, KPMG will take most of the pain and some of the costs for the rest of the profession. When it comes to disclosing full financial results for the business KPMG will be under pressure to have them independently audited - hardly an inviting option. So why has KPMG taken the plunge? The reorganisation of a business is usually either superficial, as in the case of the LLP's in the US, or profoundly structural, in order to gain competitive advantage. What has KPMG to gain from what appears to be a halfway house? After all, the new audit arm will fit into KPMG's exisiting structure admirably. Competitors muse that the production of full financial results for the audit arm will allow KPMG to declare to major customers the strength of its financial resources to meet future claims. Transparency will also remove suspicion from fee negotiations. Mr Sharman seems more than happy to face new customers with his company's results on the table. KPMG are canvassing clients on incorporation but reactions seem generally positive. Alan Spall, finance director of ICI, gauges his views as 'neutral to positive'. His concerns are over adequate capitalisation and maintainance of standards. KPMG has clearly won itself a head start on incorporation and a distinctive image in a market place often seen as bland and anonymous. But the firm is just as aware as its competitors that incorporation is not the final answer. Another incomplete option, not available under British law, is the move in the US towards LLPs. One leading partner admits that if the legislation was available in the UK he would move to LLP status overnight. Registration in the US costs Dollars 100 per partner. Interestingly, one of the few requirements for LLP status is the need to demonstrate that the partnership provides Dollars 1m of liability insurance or Dollars 1m of funds set aside to meet claims. But here again partners are still liable for commercial debts and direct negligence. Given the absence of the LLP option in Britain, KPMG has taken the only viable action left to a firm which wants to act now. There are those in the profession who privately say that KPMG, in going for the audit incorporation option, has damaged the campaign for reform of the law on liability. That campaign is currently stalled while the government considers the professions' call for legal reform. Meanwhile accountants will continue to work in the shadow liability. Graham Ward, a partner in Price Waterhouse, and chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants' working group on liability, sees a 'fundamental imbalance' in the economics of auditing, in which the risks do not match rewards. KPMG's initiative, while courageous and potentially astute if it captures the imagination of clients, does little to redress that balance. It does, however, promise to put more accountability into accounting.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Membership of teacher quango announced The Teacher Training Agency, the newly formed quango, will aim to fund institutions according to their quality, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said yesterday. She named the membership of the agency, established two weeks ago to fund teacher training both in English schools, where the government is trying to introduce new training courses, and in universities. They include representatives of universities, primary schools and grant-maintained schools, and members of two other educational quangos - the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The agency hopes to appoint a chief executive by the end of this month. The move angered teachers' unions, which had fiercely contested the legislation which created the agency. Mrs Shephard said: 'I shall expect the agency to base the distribution of an increasing proportion of its funding on the grounds of quality and cost-effectiveness, while developing and maintaining a diverse system of training.' She added that the agency should make it a condition of making certain grants that Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, had full access to assess quality of provision, while it should also consider assessments by the higher education funding and quality councils. Mrs Shephard has the power to require the agency to take account of other quality measures at a later date. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, was 'very fearful' of the new body. He said: 'We've always been anxious about bodies of this kind when the government appoints the kind of people who will do that which the government wants. For this body, it has been even more sinister than usual in the sense that they've kept secret the personnel until now.' He attacked the fact that Mrs Shephard had the power to change its terms of reference.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> (C) Individuals in the RCP program who fail the exam and wish to re-take the exam shall pay an application processing charge of $50. Individuals wishing to re-take the exam will not be reassessed the charge under paragraphs (a)(4)(i) (A) and (B) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (ii) An organization or individual who is not a listed participant in EPA's radon proficiency programs on the effective date of this section and/or whose proficiency program application has not yet been accepted by EPA becomes subject to the fees described above once its application has been accepted by EPA. Fees for such organizations or individuals will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of the application. To remain listed, each participant in the RMP or RCP programs, whether individual or organization, shall submit a renewal application and appropriate annual fee to EPA each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Exemptions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> State and local governments are exempted from these fees under section 305(e)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2665. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of fees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Participants listed in the RMP and RCP programs on the effective date of this section will be sent, by EPA, an annual renewal application with appropriate fee calculation at least 30 days prior to the payment due date. This renewal application also serves as an organization's or individual's payment invoice. Fees will be assessed based on the information in EPA's proficiency program data bases. Participants who intend to pay the invoiced fee amount shall complete the renewal application and send the appropriate payment to EPA following the procedures in &sect;195.20(d). Organizations or individuals who believe the invoiced fee amount is incorrect or wish to amend or adjust their listing status shall do so by indicating the appropriate corrections or adjustments on their renewal application. Corrected renewal applications for the RMP Program or the RCP Program shall be sent to: Radon Proficiency Program Information Service, c/o Sanford Cohen and Associates, Inc., 1418 I&hyph;85 Parkway, Montgomery, AL, 36016. EPA will review the corrected renewal application, adjust the payment invoice amount (if appropriate) and issue a revised invoice. Participants shall pay the corrected amount within 30 days of receipt of the revised invoice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the appropriate fee or revised renewal application for an individual or organization participating in the RMP or RCP program has not been received by EPA on or before the payment due date, EPA will send, by certified mail, notice to the individual or organization that they will be delisted from the proficiency program unless they pay the fee within 30 days of receipt of this second notice. If payment has not been received by EPA within 30 days of the participant's receipt of the second payment invoice, the organization's or individual's listing will be removed from the proficiency program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) New or initial applicants to the RMP or RCP programs will be assessed a fee at the time of their initial application. EPA will send a payment invoice to the new applicant upon acceptance of its initial application. The invoice will state that the applicant will be given 30 days to remit payment. The fee assessed will be prorated quarterly, based on the acceptance date of the application. If the appropriate fee has not been received by EPA by the payment due date, the application will be returned to the submitter and the applicant will not be listed in the proficiency program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payment procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each remittance to EPA under this rule shall be in United States currency and shall be paid by certified check, personal check, or money order made payable to the order of the ``U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'' and sent to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Radon Proficiency Program User Fees, P.O. Box 952491, St. Louis, MO 63195&hyph;2491. The fee shall be submitted with the original copy of the EPA invoice. Collection of fees shall begin in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1993.

In order to do this, EPA shall adjust the initial fees established by this subpart each year over the next five years to collect the following percentages of program costs: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,tp0,i1,6,6,6,6,6 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Initial fees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Year 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Year 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Year 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Year 4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Year 5 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> 30% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 47.5% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 65% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 82.5% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 100% <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The actual fees for each fiscal year will be calculated based on program costs and participation rates.

First, EPA will estimate the costs of providing each of the proficiency programs for the upcoming year. EPA will account for future additional fixed costs (e.g., updating examinations) and increases/decreases in variable costs due to inflation and other factors. In order to calculate increases/decreases in costs due to inflation, EPA may use one of the three following indices: the Federal General Schedule (GS) pay scale, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and/or a component of the CPI, such as services. Second, EPA will estimate the number of participants for each program. At a minimum, these participation rates will be based on past and current program participation rates. Third, EPA shall calculate the per capita costs that individuals or organizations should pay to enable it to recover its fixed and variable costs each year for each program. EPA shall also consider potential industry impacts as it adjusts to levels to ultimately achieve full cost recovery over the period of five years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;195.30 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Failure to remit fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will not process an application or continue a participant's listing in the National Radon Measurement Proficiency program, individual proficiency component of the RMP program, or the National Radon Contractor Proficiency program until the appropriate remittance provided in &sect;195.20(a) has been received by EPA. Failure by a currently EPA-listed organization or individual to remit the required fees in a timely manner will result in the loss of that organization's or individual's listing status as specified in &sect;195.20(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 700_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Moves to help women gain top science posts urged The government should set a target of filling 25 per cent of its senior scientific posts with women by the year 2000, an independent advisory committee said yesterday. At present women make up about 12 per cent of such appointments. The Committee on Women in Science, Engineering and Technology was set up last year by Mr William Waldegrave, the minister for science. It has put forward recommendations with the aim of encouraging more girls to study science at school and then helping them to gain careers in research. The proposals range from broadening the secondary school curriculum to making research grants more flexible so that women scientists can work part-time when they have family commitments. According to the committee's report, few women scientists get top scientific jobs. Only 118 of 917 people serving on government committees in science-related fields - and six of the 95 members of the councils that award research grants - are women. Members of the committee said the most important single recommendation was that the government should set up a development unit within Mr Waldegrave's Office of Science and Technology with the specific aim of promoting women's interests. 'If the development unit is not set up, we're sunk,' said Professor Patricia Clarke of University College, London. The Rising Tide: Women in Science, Engineering and Technology. HMSO.

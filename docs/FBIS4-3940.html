			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter from Beijing": "Beijing Grain Shops Have No </F> Grain to Sell For a Month; Grain Growers Are Cornering the Grain  Market"]    [Text] In mid-April, an engineer who is a native of south  China living in Beijing suddenly discovered that several grain  shops in the vicinity were only selling flour, and rice was no  longer available in these shops. Infuriated, he telephoned the  municipal government to ask about this and learned that many  grain shops in Beijing had had no rice to sell for almost a  month. In the free market, individual peddlers are selling rice  at a price of 2.4 yuan per kg, 50 percent higher than the  government limited price. This is hardly unacceptable to  southerners, who are used to eating rice as a staple but not  other grains.    Some experts said that this situation in the Beijing grain  market is the result of contention between different interest  groups which use rice as a pawn.    At the end of last year, grain prices began to soar in some  southern Chinese provinces, and this astounded the high-level  CPC leadership. The State Council immediately took measures to  control grain prices to prevent overall inflation. Price  inspection teams were sent out one after another, and many  cities introduced grain price limits.    Some officials optimistically estimated that grain prices  could be controlled. Several months have passed and these  measures which were effective under the planned economic  structure--a structure which was backed by state monopoly over  the purchase and marketing of grain--have been mercilessly  restricted by the market mechanism.    In this "contention for rice," the government and consumers  are on one side whereas grain selling departments, officials in  grain producing regions, and peasants are on the other. An  assistant in a grain department said that the government had set  the rice price at 1.6 yuan per kg, but now the purchase cost of  rice is 1.7 yuan per kg, so the more rice it purchased, the  heavier losses it is suffering. The government's attitude is  very clear: Grain shops may stop selling rice but may not sell  rice at a high price. So grain shops stopped selling rice.  Similarly, in some grain producing provinces, the government  and grain growers are cornering the grain market to wait for an  upward adjustment in grain purchase prices which will be  introduced soon. Thus grain purchasing personnel sent out by  Beijing Municipality have found doors slammed in their face.  The good old days when of all parts of the country supported  Beijing at all costs under the planned economic structure has  ended once and for all.    Reports say that to control rice prices, the government will  use the grain reserve fund to purchase rice from grain producing  regions at high prices and then sell it at low prices. The  relevant government department is worried that this sum of money  will not be recovered after being spent. How long will the  government be able to play this "game?"    The present situation reminds us of the "combat" against  inflation carried out by the old and new regimes in Shanghai  40-odd years ago. In 1948, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was then in  charge of economic control, introduced monetary system reform in  Shanghai; to curb inflation, he adopted measures to limit prices  and even resorted to the use of economic policemen for the  enforcement of the measures. But Shanghai industrialists and  businessmen declared that there were no commodities. The  confrontation between these administrative measures and the  market mechanism resulted in Chiang Ching-kuo's failure.    Years later the newly born CPC regime encountered a  situation  similar to the one Chiang Ching-kuo had met. Under Chen Yun's  plan, the new regime skillfully injected the liberated areas'  cotton and coal reserves into the market to control prices. As  a result, the tactic of cornering the market failed and  businessmen who wanted to become wealthy by "honest and  dishonest means" suffered heavy losses. Subsequently the CPC  won a key battle in curbing nationwide inflation.    Forty-odd years have passed, and the "contention for rice"  in  Beijing reminds us that administrative measures which were  effective under the single planning structure in the past are no  longer "panaceas." Introducing market mechanisms and  administrative measures simultaneously and establishing a new  price control system to curb inflation are difficult problems  for a government in an economic transformation period.    We will soon know the outcome of the ongoing "contention for  rice" in Beijing. Reports say that after a special meeting is  held, the municipal government's relevant department will  allocate a fund and send rice purchasing teams. Then millions  of kilograms of reserve rice will be injected into the market.</p>

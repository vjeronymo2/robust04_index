Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Empowerment Zones program is a key step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and rural heartland. It is designed to empower people and communities across the nation in developing and implementing strategic plans to create job opportunities and sustainable community development. The program combines tax benefits with substantial investment of Federal resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies. All communities which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it, whether or not they are selected as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities, as the Federal Government will work with applicants to overcome programmatic regulations and statutory impediments to encourage more effective economic, physical, environmental and community development activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communities will gain by taking stock of their assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and by structuring a plan for achieving it. Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions, service providers, neighborhood associations and State and local governments can be formed or strengthened to support a plan for change by going through the application process. Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with these new partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based strategic plan. Community Development Corporations nominated by the locality will be considered eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions from donors. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers of Federal program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates, even if they do not receive a designation. Communities may apply comprehensive strategic planning to their entire community anticipating proposed consolidation of planning requirements for four major formula grant programs administered by the Office of Community Planning and Development in HUD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enterprise Communities are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities. States with designated Enterprise Communities will receive approximately $3 million in Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grant funds to pass through to each designated area for approved activities identified in their strategic plans. Enterprise Communities will receive special consideration in competition for funding under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and proposed Community Policing initiatives. The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise Communities to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist these Communities in meeting essential mandates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Empowerment Zones will receive all the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities and other communities with innovative visions for change. Empowerment Zones are awarded substantial Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grant funds, in the amount of $100 million for each urban Zone. An Employer Wage Credit for Zone residents is extended to qualified employers engaged in trade or business, in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an increased deduction under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The urban part of the program will be administered by HUD as a Federal-State-local partnership, with a minimum of red tape associated with the application process. Communities must demonstrate the ability to design and implement an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems in a comprehensive way and must demonstrate the capacity to carry out these plans. Development of an effective plan must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the urban area, and of the private sector, acting in concert with the nominating entities. The plan should be developed in accordance with four key principles, which will serve as the basis for the key selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the plan. These principles are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Economic Opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, as well as entrepreneurial initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

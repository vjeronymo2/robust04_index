			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 7 (AFP) -- PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat,  emerging from a five-day isolation due to illness, warned  Washington on Tuesday [7 June] that he might put off a visit to  the self-rule enclave of Jericho, a source close to the PLO said.    'Arafat told the US ambassador to Tunis, John McCarthy,  "clearly and firmly" that he would not travel to Jericho unless  he received a guarantee of international aid for Palestinian  autonomy, the source said.    He said the PLO chairman wanted assurances that the  Palestinians would receive monthly payments of several million  dollars to keep self-rule on track in the West Bank town and the  Gaza Strip.    McCarthy, in turn, told 'Arafat that the United States  wanted  the Palestinian self-rule authority to take up its  responsibilities "as soon as possible," the Palestinian news  agency WAFA said.    It reported that 'Arafat, who was "feeling better" according  to his aides, also met Russian ambassador Boris Shchiborin to  discuss the aid issue, amid demands from donors of assurances on  how their money would be spent.    They were the first official meetings for the PLO leader  since he took refuge in his rooms five days earlier because of  illness.    Arafat, coughing and looking tired, said last week during an  interview with the US television network CBS from the PLO  headquarters in Tunis that he had a cold.    But Palestinian and hospital sources said he had been  suffering from heart problems and was being monitored by doctors.    The PLO chief is scheduled to travel to Jericho in mid-June,  for a visit during which a 24-member Palestinian authority  headed by Arafat is due to be formally sworn in to run the  autonomous areas.    WAFA said 'Arafat on Tuesday also telephoned Norwegian  Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal, whose country heads a liaison  committee in charge of coordinating the aid.    The PLO leader could travel to the French capital on Friday,  the source close to the organisation said.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / KPMG may publish its own results in full Britain's second-biggest accountancy partnership said yesterday it would publish full financial results if its clients backed a plan to incorporate its audit practice. KPMG Peat Marwick confirmed that it is to consult clients, investors, and regulators with a view to creating a limited company to audit its clients which are public limited companies. Other options, including the incorporation of the whole business, were dismissed at a board meeting last week. The firm audits one-fifth of all the UK's listed companies. If incorporation goes ahead it would be the first such venture in a leading accounting firm. Publication of results would also be a first, except for a brief attempt in 1979 by Arthur Andersen, which was not repeated. Mr Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: 'We intend to reach a final decision early in 1995.' He added that if incorporation of audit went ahead KPMG would move to publication of full financial results for its whole business. Such moves could prompt the most radical restructuring of the profession since the begining of the last century. Several other leading accountancy firms are known to be discussing incorporation. Publication of financial details is likely to bring into the public arena information on what partners earn, fee structures, and details on profits. KPMG has 600 partners and 9,000 staff, and reported a profit of Pounds 498m last year. The new audit company would have 200 partners and would take a large share of the Pounds 200m now earned in the audit and accounting division. The new audit company would be owned by the partners, including those left in the original partnership, and would itself be independently audited. There are no plans for a flotation. Initial reaction among large corporate clients to the scheme is said to be positive but KPMG is cautious about the consultation process. 'This is a big step; we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot,' Mr Sharman said. 'It is vital that we gain the views of our clients on being serviced by a limited company, that the regulatory authorities and the investment community have no fundamental objections, that government bodies will accept a changed status and, of course, that incorporation is acceptable to our partnership.' The driving force behind incorporation is the desire to limit the liability of partners. Recent corporate collapses have resulted in litigation against auditors who are seen as having 'the deepest pockets'. While a new KPMG audit company could still be sued as a corporate entity, most of the partners would have their own wealth protected. However, individual partners could still be sued personally. Incorporation also means that new partners would be protected from becoming liable for outstanding legal actions.</p>

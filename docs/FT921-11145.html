			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK brewing Yesterday's statement by the Office of Fair Trading on the contentious Allied-Lyons/Brent Walker pub deal was so misleading as arguably to create a false market in both companies' shares. In announcing that the deal was not to be referred, the OFT omitted to mention that it will be hedged around with such conditions as to make its implementation very difficult. Both companies play down the scale of the problem, which is understandable given that the issue may have to be resolved in court and that the failure of the deal could finish Brent Walker. But under the conditions required by the OFT, it is hard to see how Brent Walker can afford to lease 734 Allied pubs on terms which would make it worth Allied's while. The wider implication is that the competition authorities are making a fresh attempt to bring the industry to heel. The Allied/BW deal is a minnow compared with the otherwise very similar Courage/GrandMet arrangement, which slipped through before the authorities grasped which way the industry was headed. It now sounds as if all agreements on the supply of beer will come under close scrutiny, while the current OFT inquiry into beer pricing may turn out more than a formality. The OFT ruling on the Allied/Carlsberg brewing merger, due in a fortnight or so, will also bear close attention. Given the costs incurred by the brewing industry in conforming to the new regime, it is possible to feel a twinge of sympathy. But its attempts to recoup the losses, by price rise or merger, have been so crude as to make further official measures almost inevitable. From the investor's viewpoint, the sector looks more risky and turbulent than ever.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fayiz 'Abbas] </F>   [Text] "In principle, I support a just and lasting peace  that will guarantee the Palestinian people their rights." This  statement was made over the weekend by Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, the  founder of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].    The shaykh was speaking to his attorney, 'Abd-al-Malik  Dahamshah, in response to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres'  assertion that Yasin could be released if he were to express  support for the peace process. Yasin said he rejects any  conditions being set for his release; however, he supports a  just peace process.    Tomorrow will mark five years since the disappearance of  soldier Ilan Sa'adon. In reaction to statements made by the  Sa'adon family, Shaykh Yasin asserted this week that he does not  know the whereabouts of the soldier's body. The shaykh claimed  he only learned of the murder after the fact.</p>

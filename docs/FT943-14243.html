			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Observer: Not yet licked If you can't beat them, get them to join you. So must think Britain's Union of Communication Workers, which has hired Lowe Bell Political, part of Sir Tim Bell's public relations outfit, to lobby backbench Conservative MPs against the government's plans for partial privatisation of the Post Office. Sir Tim built his reputation by working for the Tories. He helped the Coal Board beef up its PR campaign during the 1984 coalminers' strike. Nor should we forget his key role in all Baroness Thatcher's general election victories. Thus who better, reasons the UCW, to persuade disgruntled Tory backbenchers of the need to keep the Post Office public? And Sir Tim's advice comes relatively cheaply too - an initial three-month contract costing 'in excess' of Pounds 10,000 a month. Watch closely who poses Post Office questions in the Commons, after the summer recess . . .</p>

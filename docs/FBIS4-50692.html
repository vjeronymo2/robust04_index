			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (CNS) -- According to a research  report recently published by the state Statistical Bureau of  China, with the deepening of China's reform, failing to meet  demand of market by Chinese enterprises has become the main  factor conditioning their low economic efficiency.    The report said with the economic system reform got underway  in an overall way and the implementation of those regulations  concerned in recent years, adjustment of market force had played  more and more important role. An investigation made by relevant  departments in 1991 into loss-making 50 enterprises from  Beijing, Shenyang and Tianjin had attributed the reason for loss  of these enterprises to wrong policies, unfavourable  circumstances and bad management, which made up 19.4 percent,  47.8 percent and 32.8 percent of the total reason respectively.  However, according to another investigation made in last year  into more than 2500 loss-making enterprises from eight provinces  and cities such as Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin, the ratios of  the reason of wrong policies and unfavourable circumstances had  dropped to 9 percent or so respectively and the ratio of the  reason of bad management in these enterprises risen to about 82  percent, indicating bad management and failure in meeting demand  of market had become the main factor conditioning their economic  efficiency.</p>

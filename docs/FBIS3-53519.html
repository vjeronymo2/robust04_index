			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Children of our people in the wounded Syria,  children of our glorious Arab nation: Was the Geneva summit  between al-Asad and Clinton, which lasted for over five hours, a  meeting [liqa'] or an encounter [iltiqa']? Is there a  difference between a meeting and an encounter? Yes there is.  Hafiz al-Asad did not go to meet with Clinton. He went to  Geneva to have an encounter. Meeting is between two parties each  of which has a specific position and opinion on the issues under  discussion. An encounter is between two parties that agree on  positions, opinions, and views under discussion or disputed  issues.    From the first moment of that encounter, observers noted  there was a full agreement in views and positions. If this  conclusion is not new to our people in Syria and the Arab world  in general, it does at least put an end to what was said in  certain Arab and Western capitals to the effect that Hafiz  al-Asad has something to say to Bill Clinton. Hired and yellow  [signifying anti-Arab] media hinted, or even stated decidedly,  that Hafiz al-Asad would propose to Clinton solutions to our  problems and issues out of concern for our national and pan-Arab  issues, the most important of which is the Arab's central cause,  the Palestine question, and withdrawal from the Golan Heights  and South Lebanon as stipulated by UN Security Council  resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 338, and 425.    "The peace of the brave" is a term that was uttered  repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, but neither of  them said what it means. The "just and comprehensive peace" was  also uttered repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, also  without explaining what they mean by it.    Bilateral ties and removing anything obstructing their  improvement and progress between al-Asad's regime and the U.S.  Administration was Hafiz al-Asad's main concern for the past  four years. He did not want to be bypassed by the new world  order, the order of hegemony and control which the United States  is trying to impose on the world under the current imbalance.  Consequently, during that period Hafiz al-Asad did everything  to please the U.S. Administration. He even went so far as to  send Syrian Armed Forces to stand by the side of the  U.S.-Atlantic forces in Hafar al-Batin trenches to launch a  flagrant, treacherous aggression against fraternal Iraq.    In Geneva, and from the start, Hafiz al-Asad was nominated a  representative and a faithful defender of the U.S. and Zionist  interests.    Lockerbie, terrorism, narcotics, and Lebanon are cases with  which the U.S. Administration used to threaten Hafiz al-Asad's  regime. They will all be closed after Hafiz al-Asad confirmed  his good conduct and intentions toward the U.S. and Zionist  interests and his constant readiness to be the obedient executer  of all that he is asked to do in the forthcoming phase, the  phase of normalization and entry into the Zionist age, the age  of submission and capitulation and the burning of all false,  shining slogans on liberation, progress, development, and  defending the pan-Arab interests.    Therefore, what happened in Geneva was not a meeting, but an  encounter and a full agreement in views, directions, and  conduct. The Geneva summit between Clinton and al-Asad marks a  new phase that has its own characters and features. It will  certainly be the phase of openness and publicity and the phase  of full agreement and harmony between al-Asad's regime, the  Zionist enemy, and the U.S. Administration to humiliate our  nation, subjugate it, and plunder its wealth. However, Clinton  and al-Asad have forgotten that the will of the free peoples  cannot be tied to what the agents and the usurper enemies agree  upon.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MAYNARD JACKSON III DOING TIME  </P> <P> The 19-year-old son of Mayor Maynard Jackson apologized for knocking down his  girlfriend on a street, but it wasn't enough to keep him out of jail.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Harvey Moskowitz on Monday upheld a charge of disorderly  conduct and ordered Maynard Jackson III to complete a 45-day sentence.  </P> <P> Jackson has been in jail since soon after the June 18 incident involving Maria  Norma Duarte, 30. He was charged with pushing her to the ground after trying to  grab her can of Mace. It was his third arrest this year. "I know I was wrong,"  he told the judge. "I should have held back my temper."  </P></p>

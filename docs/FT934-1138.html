			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / All I want for Christmas . . .: The modest desires of UK business leaders A Washington radio station once asked local diplomats what they would like for Christmas. The French ambassador said that he would like world peace. The Canadian ambassador said he wanted enough food to feed starving people everywhere. The British ambassador said that a box of crystallised fruit would be nice, thank you very much. This year the Financial Times put a similar question to business and City leaders. Unlike the ambassadors, they did not want to throw away their one wish on peace and goodwill all round. Instead, they picked something nice for themselves, their companies and the economy, in that order. Prudently, most had a fall-back, just in case their first choice was unobtainable. Among those desiring material items, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of W H Smith, asks for a kilogramme of caviar. Failing that, he wants the most expensive Bang and Olufsen CD player that money can buy. He is not alone in wanting something electronic. Dominic Cadbury, chief executive of Cadbury Schweppes, would like a video so idiot-proof that he can programme it without his children. At the other end of the scale of technological competence is Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, who would like a 486 PC with a gravis ultra-sound card. 'The 486 is the latest PC and the card will allow me to compose music on it,' he says, in case Santa is computer illiterate. But the most popular personal gifts for business leaders this year are things that money cannot buy: what they would really like is to change themselves, their circumstances or their opportunities. Lord Hanson, who at the age of 71 must know his career cannot last forever, is in no doubt about what he wants. 'My fantasy gift is to have more time,' he says. 'When you are spending six months of the year in the US and six months here it is as though you never have more than half a day to get things done.' Peter Morgan, who will be out of work next year when he steps down as director-general of the Institute of Directors, would like a new job. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the media group, craftily slips a bit of personal PR into his Christmas wish. He would like to relive that perfect day in June 1992 when he triumphed over West Indian cricketer Clive Lloyd at a pro-celebrity cricket match. David Simon, chief executive of BP, has a more modest sporting request: a new golf swing. On a more humble level, Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, would like a Christmas card from the Police Federation. His recent report recommending that bobbies be paid in performance-related pennies went down so badly with police that he is more likely to get handcuffs. Less politically correct is a suggestion from Dominic Cadbury. Besides a video, he wants a radar to inform him when his wife is wearing something new or has had her hair done. Some captains of industry have spared a thought for their company's Christmas needs. Failing his cricket request, Martin Sorrell would like an extra one per cent on margins at his WPP. Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of London Weekend Television simply wants to keep what he has: LWT. His present would be to foil Granada Group's unwelcome takeover bid. This year's most popular high-minded gift for executives was a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. But Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters, and Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, the mining group - both of whom said they wanted this above all else - have not had to wait until Christmas morning. Others with worthy requests will have to wait rather longer. Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman of the TSB, asks for an independent Bank of England: he might have been better off requesting another valuable clock to add to his collection. John Monks has shown that stuffiness is not restricted to the board room. No frivolity for him. He is treating his first Christmas as TUC general secretary as an opportunity to reiterate the wishes of his organisation. He has sent Santa a detailed request for legislation on basic rights for people at work, with clauses on health, safety and training. The wish of Peter Morgan, his counterpart at IoD, is just as unlikely to be granted. His ideal present is 1m people off the unemployment register. Paddy Linaker, managing director of M &amp; G, the fund management group, also chooses the economy as his theme, but his wish is unseasonal. He would like to see all those who formulated Treasury economic policy out of a job. 'Some have been there too long. In this harsh economic climate, if you don't bring home the bacon you usually find yourself on the way somewhere else.' He is not the only one short of seasonal cheer. Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the high street electrical retailer, is too busy selling computer games to think about what he wants himself. Andrew Coppel, the new chief executive of Queens Moat Holdings, the hotels group, is having such a wretched time trying to keep the company afloat that he postponed any thought of Christmas gifts until next year. Martin Taylor, having given a profits warning as his parting gift to Courtaulds Textiles before he leaves to become chief executive of Barclays bank, is also in no mood to discuss presents. 'I'm afraid Mr Taylor is too busy to help you with your article,' his secretary said. At least the ambassadors kept their wishes seasonal, with a thought for the poor and needy, or of traditional luxuries. If Sir Simon Hornby gets his caviar, perhaps he will show some Christmas spirit and share it around.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. officials have criticized Japanese bureaucrats  for standing in the way of agreements in the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. Commenting on this criticism at a news  conference following an 11 January cabinet session, Minister of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] Hiroshi Kumagai--who is  renowned for "sacking a bigwig bureau chief"--refuted the  criticism and defended Japanese bureaucrats, saying:  "Bureaucrats and politicians share the same judgment."    The United States has been escalating its criticism of  Japanese bureaucrats. In December last year, Bowman Cutter,  special assistant to President Clinton for economic policy,  said: "Japanese bureaucrats have a tendency to give more  priority to the interests of their respective ministries than to  the prime minister's intentions." U.S. Commerce Under Secretary  Garten, who is in charge of handling the automobile and auto  parts issue, has been shunning contacts with bureaucrats and  increasing contacts with other people since he arrived in Japan.    The U.S. criticism against Japanese bureaucrats aims to win  public support in Japan by shifting its spearhead to the  bureaucrats instead of the Hosokawa cabinet which enjoys a high  public approval rating, and to keep bureaucratic resistance to  the cabinet in check. The relationship between politicians and  bureaucrats has changed delicately since the coalition  government was inaugurated and the resignation of former MITI  Industrial Policy Bureau chief Masahisa Naito drew attention in  the United States as a symbol of that change.    MITI Minister Kumagai criticized the bureaucrats shortly  after taking office, saying, "The Japanese market is a lump of  established interests. Government officials are unaware of this  because they work at their desks." At the 11 January news  conference, however, he defended the bureaucrats, saying, "MITI  officials are working hard. They are not closeting themselves in  the logic of government office." Stressing the need for the  "unity of politicians and bureaucrats," he clarified his  attitude that he will not yield to U.S. trade demands. It is  believed that, mindful of smoldering distrust of him among MITI  officials following the fuss over Naito's resignation, he made  the comments in a bid to "mend fences" with them.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IS JDL'S NEW PATROL REALLY A NEW DAWN?  </P> <P> While reading David Haldane's article on Irv Rubin and the Jewish Defense  League ("JDL's New Patrol," July 23), I found myself recalling a warm morning  in May when I was introduced rather abruptly to Rubin and his style of public  demonstration. I was immediately put off and was ready to throw the  Constitution, and the First Amendment in particular, to the wind.  </P> <P> I will never forget that day for many reasons. What an honor it was to be the  First Crucifier, an acolyte, serving in the same service as one of the most  humble and gracious servants in the world -- South African Archbishop Desmond  Tutu. I was proud, joyful, and in complete awe of this man, who risks his life  to battle oppression and hatred among the human family and has been duly  recognized for his peacemaking efforts by no less an authority than the Nobel  Institute.  </P> <P> As the acolytes, banners, flags, choir and clergy recessed from the nave of All  Saints Episcopal Church onto the streets of Pasadena, the throng of people  outside applauded and cheered in a show of respect and love.  </P> <P> As their esteemed visitor passed them, glory and grace turned to fear and  ugliness. The two other acolytes and I were shoved out of the way. Rubin and  his colleagues were shouting and verbally accosting Archbishop Tutu in a very  threatening manner, hissing, "What about the Jews, Tutu?" . . . "Jew Hater!" .  . . and much worse.  </P> <P> Instead of being able to greet the eager congregation, the archbishop was  quickly escorted to a safer place.  </P> <P> It is obvious that the JDL's reputation is thwarting the effectiveness of other  respectable Jewish advocacy groups, yet JDL fills a void as well. There must be  found, in this situation, a medium for passionate expression in a civilized  manner.  </P> <P> Rubin and the Jewish Defense League caused a great deal of nervousness and  disappointment among the congregation and the people in charge of the service.  However, with the gracious and kind manner in which Archbishop Tutu deals with  situations, even in the face of threat and harsh words, he presented himself as  such a man again, saying: "That is all right . . . in my country they would not  be allowed such a freedom . . . I understand their frustration."  </P> <P> It is to Rubin's credit that attempts at reconciliation have been made by him  if they are, in fact, genuine. I hope that others are as forgiving and  understanding as Archbishop Tutu.  </P> <P> JARED BENJAMIN HUGHES  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: UK insurance If this insurance cycle is going to be less painful than the last, investors are loathe to believe it. This week's sell-off in the sector - sparked by Guardian Royal Exchange's observation that personal insurance rates are softening - is only the latest leg in a run of underperformance stretching back to the summer. The market is right to be sceptical. With solvency margins back around 60 per cent, the big composite insurers are again well endowed with capital. New entrants from continental Europe and direct writers backed by banks can only add to the competitive pressure. The memory of underwriting losses should be fresh enough to maintain discipline on underwriting for a time. The snag is that not all insurers have an equal incentive to hold the line on rates. With costs well below those of traditional companies, direct writers could afford to chase rates lower and still show decent profits. Established insurers would then face an uncomfortable choice between ceding business and following rates down. If the big insurers are serious about underwriting for profit rather than market share this time around - even if that means writing fewer policies - they already risk being over capitalised. Higher dividend payments would be one answer, although the companies are rightly wary of setting dividends at an unsustainable level. Should solvency creep substantially higher, the promise of share buy-backs would help inspire confidence that this cycle will indeed be different.</p>

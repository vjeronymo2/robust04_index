			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Rival Budgets key to marginals AS THE election campaign moves into its second week, party strategists believe that the reaction of voters to their tax proposals could be decisive in crucial marginal seats. Conservative officials have set out to make income tax an electoral issue, and the March 10 Budget, featuring a lower rate of tax for the first Pounds 2,000 of earnings, signalled the start of the election campaign. Labour's shadow Budget responded by proposing to abolish the earnings ceiling on National Insurance contributions and setting a tax rate of 50 per cent for higher earners. It claimed that eight out of 10 families would benefit. This concentration on the tax issue is risky for both main parties. The danger for the Tories is that there is evidence that people are prepared to pay higher taxes for better public services. For Labour, the risk is that they will be branded as the party of tax increases. In order to assess the impact of the rival proposals, FT reporters have visited three marginals in different regions where Labour came second in the last election. Brentford and Isleworth in London, Birmingham Hall Green in the Midlands and Davyhulme in north-west England look typical of marginals within their regions. They were selected because they are likely to reflect the social make-up of marginals in these three regions - which contain 63 of the 94 Tory seats Labour would probably need to win an overall majority. A rough guide to how typical the marginal seats are of their region can be drawn from the 1981 census on 'socio-economic groups'. In the north-west, London and the west Midlands, the marginals seem to contain more of the higher-income groups than the regional average. The east Midlands marginals contain fewer high earners. So the marginals appear to contain a bigger proportion than the country in general of voters likely to be disadvantaged by Labour's tax proposals. Price tag on the promises, Page 17</p>

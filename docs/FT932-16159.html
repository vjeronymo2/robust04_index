			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Letter: Tecs provide special programmes for women Sir, Joanna Foster's comment (Letters, April 3) is welcome since your article 'EOC says women overlooked by Tecs' (March 31) did not reflect my own experience at the local level, or that of other training and enterprise councils. In Bedfordshire, in addition to all the normal programmes available for women, we run six initiatives to tackle the barriers experienced by women who want to train, start a business or return to employment. An example is the Tecs' Out of School Clubs programme which is now being expanded with funds from the secretary of state's Childcare Initiative to make it easier for parents, particularly women, to have choice of work and training opportunities. We are just one Tec; I know of some 12 others providing special opportunities for women and there are many more reported in local Tec newsletters. However, the issue of the severely retracting workforce, the consequence of recession, is real and has certainly had an adverse effect on women's prospects. Tecs continue to work with employers and all members of the workforce - particularly those disadvantaged in the community - to overcome these difficulties. Since women represent almost half of the workforce they receive a great deal of attention in Bedfordshire - and throughout the Tec network.

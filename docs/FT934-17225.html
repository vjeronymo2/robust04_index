			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Surprise shortage TENSIONS IN the UK money market failed to materialise yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a much smaller than expected liquidity shortage. With dealers believing that end-of-quarter requirements would prompt a shortage as high as Pounds 3.5bn, there was some surprise when the Bank came up with only Pounds 1.1bn. This was revised marginally to Pounds 1.05bn. Earlier this week, dealers had suggested that the Bank's decision to hold a gilt auction just before the end of the quarter was unwise, since it would add to demand for cash and thus increase pressure in the money markets. A dealer said of yesterday's shortage: 'Its size would certainly suggest that the cash management at the Bank of England was better organised than people thought.' None the less, it took a while to clear the shortage. In early operations the Bank purchased bills totalling only Pounds 20m, followed by Pounds 160m in later morning trading. This pushed the overnight rate up as high as 8 per cent, but a purchase of Pounds 506m of bills in the afternoon, and late assist-ance of Pounds 360m, brought it back down to around 6 per cent. The three-month interbank rate was slightly lower at 5 15/16 -5 7/8 per cent. The previous day it closed at 6 per cent on the offered side. Short sterling moved in a very narrow range, with the market uncertain about the timing of future cuts in interest rates. The December contract opened at 94.39 and finished slightly lower at 94.35. Trading was subdued, with just over 10,000 contracts traded. In Germany call money firmed to 6.9-7.0 per cent from 6.85-95 per cent, after the Bundesbank withdrew section 17 funds which had been circulating in the market for almost a week. Some dealers expressed surprise when the funds were withdrawn, as they had hoped the extra liquidity would be left in the market to compensate banks for the draining of DM8.5bn of funds earlier this week. The December and March Euromark contracts slipped, reflecting a belief in the market that the German central bank will take its time over monetary easing. Longer dated contracts held up relatively better, indicating that even if the Bundesbank takes a while to ease monetary policy, rates will eventually have to come down.</p>

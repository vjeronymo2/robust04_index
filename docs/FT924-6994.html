			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Currency gains and cost cutting helps Readicut READICUT International, the household textile, carpeting and yarn company, yesterday reported a small increase in profits helped by currency gains and cost cutting. Pre-tax profits increased 6 per cent from Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 6.01m in the six months to September 30. The previous year's figure was boosted by undisclosed insurance gains of a 'few hundred thousand'. The shares gained 3p to 72p. Mr Clive Shaw, managing director, said most markets remained difficult. 'There are signs the US is coming back, but Europe is going down.' Turnover increased 3.6 per cent to Pounds 106.7m (Pounds 103m). Of the increase, Pounds 2.3m came from currency gains and Pounds 1.4m from like-for-like increases. Exports from the UK increased strongly before sterling's fall, Mr Shaw said. In the UK, carpet sales fell despite further switching from high street to contract sales, but Firth Furnishings, a supplier of carpets and trim to the car industry, performed well. Russells Rubber, which makes moulded rubber for car doors, was helped by a large contract from Iran. Despite the fall in interest rates, interest costs were little changed at Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 1.36m). Capital expenditure increased from Pounds 4m to Pounds 7.3m. For the full year expenditure is expected to increase to Pounds 12.5m, compared to depreciation of Pounds 8.7m. Readicut continued to reduce its workforce and UK staff fell by 77 to 3,100. Redundancy costs were Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 175,000). Year end gearing is expected to be 'in the low 20s', according to Mr Shaw. This compared to net borrowings of Pounds 11.5m and gearing of 19 per cent at March 31. Earnings increased from 2.01p to 2.12p. The interim dividend is held at 0.63p, covered 3.4 (3.2) times.</p>

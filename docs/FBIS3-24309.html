			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Expert-Analysis Department of the Joint </F> Stock Company "Kinto": "Only Financial Intermediaries Are  Capable of Getting `Voucher' Privatization Moving in Ukraine:  This Is What the Experts of the Trust Association `Kinto-Trust'  Think"]    [Text] Recently in certain mass media organs, an ugly  campaign has appeared concerning the trust associations which  perform services in the distribution of privatization funds for  the population. Today, we present the thinking of experts on the  matter of the privatization funds.    Ukraine is not the first country to take the path of  privatization, in which privatization documents are used to pay  for objects of privatization -- in our case, privatization  property certificates. And even though in each of these  countries, the processes of privatization have their own  national specifics, one thing, certainly, is shared: the very  broad participation of financial intermediaries in them --  investment funds, trust associations, and the like. Thus,  two-thirds of the citizens of the Czech Republic and Slovakia  have used the services of investment privatization funds in the  distribution of their privatization funds, and investment funds  in Russia have already collected more than half of all vouchers.    Perhaps one of the main reasons why privatization,  especially  "voucher" privatization, is going so slowly in Ukraine, has been  the absence of institutions capable of giving the population  qualified help in the distribution of privatization funds. Today  in Ukraine, only one percent of the population has used its  right to obtain privatization documents and invest them in  objects of privatization. The majority has invested in the  enterprise in which they work. However, significant categories  of citizens are deprived of this possibility. They are forced to  seek, independently, objects for the investment of privatization  funds, and to resolve on their own all questions connected with  the exchange of property certificates for the stock of a given  enterprise. Anyone who has made such attempts knows how complex  this procedure is, considering the mechanism for the use of  privatization funds that exists in Ukraine. Moreover, the  problem of choosing an enterprise is complex enough in  circumstances of an almost complete information vacuum.    The awarding of licenses by the Fund for Ukrainian State  Property for work with the privatization funds of the population  to the trust associations (in Kiev, "Kinto-Trust" was the first  to work with them) has, at last, made it possible for most of  the population quickly and effectively to use the right of every  citizen of Ukraine to privatization funds. What are the  advantages given by the transfer of privatization property  certificates to the management of a trust association? First,  there is the possibility of using the services of genuine  professionals in a field of financial activity, eliminating the  necessity of independently, at one's own risk, seeking  directions for the profitable use of privatization funds, and  most of all, the possibility of influencing the activity of  these joint stock companies.    Recently, various conjectures concerning the intermediaries  which provide services in the distribution of privatization  funds are spreading more actively. Perhaps it is advantageous to  certain circles that such institutions, capable of directing the  privatization of property on a professional basis, not arise in  Ukraine. It will be much easier if these stocks are scattered  among thousands of stockholders, each of whom will be deprived  of any influence on the activities of the joint stock companies,  rather than to have to deal with an investment fund or trust  association, which, because of the unification of the votes of  individual investors, will be capable of protecting their  interests.    What sorts of accusations are being made against the trust  associations? First, it is said that they do not indicate  guaranteed dividends. This accusation can only be made by people  who are not competent in this question, since in no civilized  country does a joint stock company indicate the scale of  dividends in advance. They are set according to the results of  the work in the course of a given period at meetings of the  joint stock company. The following reproach is also made  concerning the trust associations: the trusts wish to use the  funds for their own goals, without buying anything. But this  anxiety lacks any basis at all. The privatization property  certificates are not cash, or even Russian "vouchers;" they can  only be used to pay for stock in enterprises that are being  privatized. In this case, the interests of the trustee and the  trust coincide, since until privatization funds are invested,  they do not provide any profit. The circumstance that the trusts  do not indicate definite terms for investing the trustees' funds  in stocks also worries many. But the task of the trust is not to  invest privatization certificates in the first enterprise that  comes along, rather precisely to choose those that will provide  profits; the trust bears the ultimate responsibility for this to  the trustee. In this, a great deal depends not on the trust, but  on government organs, and how fast the process of privatization  is carried out. Now a great number of the most promising state  enterprises are getting ready to become stock companies. The  enterprises which have already offered their stock for  privatization documents, are not among the most interesting ones  from the point of view of the investor. And the final thing  concerns the terms. Some of the "well intentioned" are advising  that people not hurry to entrust their privatization funds to a  trust. It is known that the term of action of the privatization  funds in Ukraine will finish in 1995, and the majority might  simply not be able to take advantage of them.</p>

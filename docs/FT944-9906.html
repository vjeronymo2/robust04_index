			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / France's employers to elect chief After months of campaigning, France's presidential hopefuls today face the moment of truth when their candidacies are put to the vote. Not the election to replace Mr Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee palace, but to determine who will become the next president of the Patronat, the French employers' federation. The 36 members of the Patronat's executive council are set to choose between two candidates - Mr Jean Gandois, the former chairman of Pechiney, the state-owned aluminium and packaging group, and Mr Jean-Louis Giral, head of the family-run building contractor Desquenne et Giral. If a clear majority is reached the decision should be endorsed by the organisation's 536-member general assembly next month. There is much at stake. The next 'boss of bosses' will be faced with the task of revitalising the organisation, which has traditionally played an important role in forming economic and labour policy, but which has seen its influence recede somewhat in recent years. The decline of planning in the French economy, the reduction in union power, and divisions within the organisation have given it a less central role. The successor to Mr Francois Perigot will also take the reins at a time when French business has been tarnished by a series of corruption scandals. Despite their differences - Mr Gandois is a captain of big industry, his rival a champion of small and medium-sized companies - the two candidates agree on many policy areas. Both believe that the contributions payed by employers to the social security budget should be further reduced, particularly in the case of small companies, to stimulate employment. Similarly, they are in accord about the need to clarify the rules concerning political funding and the need to respect judicial secrecy in corruption investigations. 'We must stop this massacre game', said Mr Giral, after Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint Gobain, the glass and packaging group, was placed under investigation in a corruption probe. But there are several important areas of disagreement. Mr Gandois, who remains chairman of Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel group, is a convinced European. His rival is a Euro-sceptic, dubious about the virtues of tight monetary policy. 'This is the first time there has been a doctrinal disagreement in the Patronat contest,' says one official at the organisation. With French presidential elections just six months away, the two candidates are also divided on political allegiances. Mr Giral, a local councillor for the Gaullist RPR party, is close to Mr Jacques Chirac. Mr Gandois is more eclectic in his political ties, claiming close relations with all mainstream parties. Favourable to the economic policies of Mr Edouard Balladur's centre-right government, he says, however, that 'it is regrettable that important reforms which need to be taken have not been'. A further important divergence concerns their vision for the Patronat. Mr Gandois has more ambitious objectives than his rival, seeking to develop a 'force for proposals' on all important economic policy issues, from unemployment and taxation to European integration. He is seeking stronger direction at the Patronat, which has been weakened by attempts to find consensus among a membership increasingly divided over issues such as the Gatt negotiations on trade liberalisation. 'If you seek consensus on everything, you will be left behind,' says Mr Gandois. Such an approach has ruffled feathers among the Patronat's members. But many business leaders are sympathetic to such a view. The chairman of one leading industrial group said: 'France needs important social and economic reforms. So we need to find a strong voice to direct the debate.' For most observers, the voice is likely to be that of Mr Gandois. But officials at the Patronat caution that the contest has been the closest for many years.</p>

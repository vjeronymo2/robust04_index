			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Commercial radio audience expands Commercial radio is continuing to eat into the BBC's market share and took more than 45 per cent of total listening in the first quarter of this year, Raymond Snoddy writes. Latest figures from Rajar, the radio listening research body, show that since the first quarter of 1993, commercial radio has grown from a 37.4 per cent share of total listening to 45.1 per cent. Mr Douglas MacArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a body which promotes commercial radio, said yesterday: 'If present trends continue, commercial radio will be in the lead by early 1995.' Last year, commercial radio had a 27 per cent increase in revenue compared to a 4 per cent increase in advertising generally. In the first quarter of this year, commercial radio had, according to RAB, gross advertising revenue of Pounds 43.3m - a year-on-year growth of 25.1 per cent. The big loser in radio ratings continues to be BBC Radio 1 under Mr Matthew Bannister, its new controller. The loss of familiar presenters and a drive towards more challenging programming is costing the station listeners.</p>

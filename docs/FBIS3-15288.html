Speaking at a meeting with editors-in-chief of leading  Russian periodicals in Moscow on Thursday [3 March], Rybkin said  the state Duma will support the mass media and free it from "the  pressure of strict economic censorship."    He suggested setting up a working group to draw up a draft  law on the operation of mass media in 1994-1995. Rybkin  believes the group should include Pavel Gusev, editor-in-chief  of MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Igor Golembiovsky, editor-in-chief of  IZVESTIYA, Shod Muladzhanov and representatives of news agencies  and television and radio companies.    The participants in the meeting blamed the current  difficulties on the monopoly of the Ministry of Communications  and the impossibility for the employees of publishing houses to  privatise their enterprises.    Gusev, who is also chairman of the Moscow Union of  Journalists, called for urgent changes in the system of state  financing of publications and creation of equal conditions for  their survival.    Rybkin said the draft law on mass media in 1994-1995 which  should help the press pull through the current crisis is  expected to be discussed by the State Duma at the end of April.</p>

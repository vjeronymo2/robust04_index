			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleh Shmid: "Ivan Plyushch Is Forced To Choose </F> Between a Tomtit and a Crane. Both Birds Are in the Sky.* The  Bloc of Communists and Socialists Intend To Elect Their Own  Candidate to the Post of Chairman of the Supreme Council. This  Could Be Ruslan Bodelan or Borys Oliynyk or Oleksandr Moroz"]    [Text] The leftist forces have ultimately agreed to form a  single faction in the new Supreme Council. This became clear  from the consultations held throughout the week following  elections among the initiatory groups made up of newly elected  members of parliament from the Communist, Socialist, and Peasant  parties. Former Agriculture Ministers Tkachenko is responsible  for organizing the agrarian faction. This means that the two to  three dozen collective farm chairmen, who by tradition were  being sorted out in political circles as one of the branches of  the "party of power," will be hammered together in parliamentary  style into a collective-state-farm tractor designed to ram  through the decisions of Communist-oriented deputies. If the  agrarian lobby is persuaded to do the same work it did in the  last Supreme Council, the faction of ideologically committed  Communists, which numbers 120 members, will be short of only 20  votes in their attempt to squeeze the whole country back into  the same tube from which it has just begun to slowly emerge.    The Red bloc is openly set on revanche. While in the  preceding Supreme Council, the Communists were prepared to  retreat step by step and gradually give up their symbols,  command-administrative system, councils, and laws, their sole  desire now is to bring all these things back. For the near  future, the situation in the country will depend on their  appetite and the pace at which this revanche is carried out. The  simplest solution would be not to stand in the way of the  Communists' passion to return to 1991 at one stroke -- the  objective laws of economics would inish the Marxist movement  within half a year. The problem is that these same laws could  just as easily finish the state.    If, however, the leftist forces have among them a few  politicians capable of dragging out the extinction of the  communists as a class over a longer period of time, they will  urge their group to agree to a broad-based coalition government  and even invite several national-democrats to join this  government in order to divide equally with them the  responsibility for the collapse of the state. This could be a  mosaic cabinet of ministers, headed by a compromise figure (for  example, Roman Shpek, the current minister of the economy), in  which the reformers will sparkle like ornaments on a dried-up  Christmas tree. It would be a fatal mistake for the democrats to  agree to such a government. Compromises of this sort are the  ones that result in the greatest disillusionment for the people.  The electorate must understand that a Red parliament -- if it is  not impotent -- cannot elect a national-democratic government.    However, the mood among Communists attests to something  else:  the Leninists want revanche rather than to discredit anybody.  They feel strong enough to seat their own man in the chair of  the chairman of the Supreme Council, to elect their own  Presidium, to appoint the head of government, and to put forward  their own candidate for president. While Petro Symonenko  promises to use his candidacy as a means to advertise the  incompatibility between the institution of the presidency and  the platform of the CPU and at the decisive moment to renounce  the fight for the office of the president in favor of an  ideologically likeminded claimant, the other potential  candidates from the leftist camp -- Borys Oliynyk and Oleksandr  Moroz -- have yet to say the same. Although the latter two are  also among the claimants to the Supreme Council chairman's  microphone. Under the present laws and existing trends, the most  powerful person in the country for the near future will be the  speaker. And the Red members of parliament have the best chance  to seat their own man in this chair.    Orthodox Communists will not forego the opportunity to  remind  Ivan Plyushch of his passivity when the Presidium of the Supreme  Council banned the CPU. The most exacting counts show that today  Plyushch can obtain only 160 votes in parliament. This number is  insufficient to allow him to regain his favorite chair. Ivan  Plyushch's closest associates are urging the former  parliamentary leader to try his luck in the presidential  election. Thus, even as I write these words about Ivan  Stepanovych, Ivan Stepanovych is probably making up his mind.  His decision will unquestionably be in favor of running for  president. On 15 May, when the deputies gather for their first  session, all of them will already know that Ivan Plyushch is a  candidate for the office of president of Ukraine. Should the  former chairman of the Supreme Council be tempted to put up  another fight for his "microphone," his new status will lose him  an additional 20-30 votes.    I am far from believing that one of the ideologically  committed "Reds" will succeed in winning the speaker's chair.  They will be chronically short of about 15 votes. However, after  Oleksandr Moroz and Borys Oliynyk are defeated, for want of  anyone else, someone will propose Ruslan Bodelan, the chairman  of the Odessa Oblast Council -- a man of openly leftist  orientation, albeit not a member of either the CPU or the  Socialist Party of Ukraine [SPU]. Bodelan will be able to pick  up the 10-15 votes that the Red faction lacks in order to elect  their own candidate. The danger of this prospect lies in the  fact that today the speaker is half the parliament. If the  speaker's job goes to a candidate of the leftist forces, Ukraine  will be rid of the institution of the presidency, and parliament  will probably form a "Red" government headed by former Prime  Minister Vitaliy Masol and take over the National Bank. And  everyone will become equal again. Just like before...    But there are also other, more optimistic prospects. These  involve the national-democratic camp and consist in the fact  that the democrats have no prospects of their own. They must  therefore link all their prospects with the "party of power."  This is somewhat embarrassing in light of the image of the  latter. The democrats are compelled to stake all their chances  for success in parliament on one person -- Plyushch, who,  moreover, will probably want to make an attempt at winning the  presidential throne. All candidates from the democratic front  for the office of chairman of the Supreme Council are doomed to  failure, if only because the national-democrats will find it  difficult to agree on a compromise candidate. The best solution  for the democrats in this ituation would be to form an alliance  with that segment of the "party of power" that supports Ivan  Plyushch, or even Kravchuk, and try to seat Ivan Stepanovych in  his old chair, first persuading him that he would be better off  with the "first microphone in the land" than with the status of  the English queen. If this proves successful, they could try to  play their own game in the presidential election. Past  experience in such matters, as well as the unpredictability of  action and differences among the democrats give us reason to  conclude that up to now the democratic forces have found it  easier to agree to support a political figure from outside the  democratic camp than to reach a compromise amongst themselves.  However, the periodic nature of repeating the same mistakes over  and over again should finally lead them to realize that such  compromise figures could be found among economists who are not  overly involved in politics. There are not many such people in  Ukraine: they are Volodymyr Lanovyy, Viktor Pynzenyk, and  Volodymyr Pylypchuk. Standing aside from politics, these  reformist economists, who are prepared to assume responsibility  for economic changes, could become a bridge between the two  disparate halves of Ukraine and take many votes away from Leonid  Kuchma. This would be an ideal solution for the  national-democrats. Otherwise, they will have to trail in the  wake of the "party of power," singing in tune with either  Plyushch or Kravchuk, which could end in a total fiasco for the  national-democratic idea in Ukraine if neither wins the election.    P.S. An unfortunate error occurred in issue No. 11  of POST-POSTUP (15-21 April). In an article entitled "The  Supreme Council. A Spectral Analysis," Mr. Smyrnov, the newly  elected deputy from the Tulchyn Electoral District in Vinnytsya  Oblast, was included among the predicted parliamentary faction  of Communists. In reality, Mr. Smyrnov is an independent deputy,  who is an anticommunist and a former political prisoner.  POST-POSTUP apologizes to Mr. Smyrnov for any moral damage he  may have suffered because of this article.    * [This title is a play on the Ukrainian proverb "a tomtit  in  hand is better than a crane in the sky" which is analogous to  the English "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."]</p>

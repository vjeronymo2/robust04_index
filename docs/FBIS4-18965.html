			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis warned that the  continuation of dialogue will not be productive unless the UN  Security Council makes the necessary decisions. One of these  decisions, he stressed, is the disarmament of Cyprus. President  Kliridhis made his statement this morning at Larnaca Airport  before leaving for Strasbourg, where he will address the Council  of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly.    President Kliridhis was talking with regard to the backstage  deliberations at the Security Council regarding the UN secretary  general's report. With the intervention Of Britain, the  president said, the first report prepared by the UN secretary  general's representatives in Cyprus did not circulate  officially. The second one, which was prepared later, did. But  the president said the British side claimed it intervened so  that no report would circulate for 15 days so as to give the  Turkish side time to accept the documents. President Kliridhis  revealed that the UN secretary general's report, which was not  circulated, noted very clearly that the Turkish Cypriot side  does not have the political will to find a solution. He said  the report also noted that there was no progress on the  substance of the Cyprus issue or the Butrus-Ghali ideas, because  there was no political will from the Turkish side.

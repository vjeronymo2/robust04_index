			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Rules for workplace insurance relaxed A temporary relaxation of the law on compulsory insurance for workplace deaths and injuries was announced by the government yesterday, pending a comprehensive review of the 25-year-old legislation. The move follows a decision by insurance companies to impose policy changes that threatened to leave many large companies without legally required cover. Mr Phillip Oppenheim, employment minister, ordered the review of the 1969 Employers' Liability Act after admitting that large corporate groups would have found it impossible to meet a requirement that each subsidiary should have at least Pounds 2m of cover. Worries about the escalating cost of injuries and disease have led to insurance companies imposing a basic claims limit of Pounds 10m on policies renewed from January 1. Such policies previously offered unlimited cover. Even where companies have only a few subsidiaries it is not clear Pounds 2m would have been available for each in all circumstances - as required by law  -under the policy terms proposed by insurers. Under the temporary rules, a holding company with subsidiaries will now be treated as if it was a single company. Mr Oppenheim said that, longer-term, he wanted the legislation amended to provide an 'acceptable level' of protection consistent with the cover the insurance market was able to deliver. He also wanted to avoid employers having to take out unnecessarily expensive policies. Employment department officials said that most companies comfortably exceeded the Pounds 2m minimum - or had the resources to self-insure themselves. They did not rule out the review concluding that no increase was necessary. However the Trades Union Congress warned that even the temporary relaxation would leave people who were seriously injured at work without compensation. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'This is a step backwards.' The government's announcement will do little to ameliorate the extra costs companies are likely to face from buying cover above the Pounds 10m level. But there are signs that a market for cover up to about Pounds 50m is emerging. Mr Laurence Law, national services director at Alexander &amp; Alexander (UK), part of the international insurance broking group, said: 'The insurance market isn't standing there with proposal forms printed but I think that cover can be got.' Mr Peter Lerwill, chairman of the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers, welcomed the government's move. 'It's a pity that we've had to wait until the 11th hour for this to be resolved, but it's good news,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Gustavo Roosen, the chairman of the Banco Latino  Board of Trustees, has hinted that the government is preparing a  program to rescue the Venezuelan financial sector, which is  currently experiencing a crisis, to prevent the situation from  deteriorating. Roosen outlined what he thinks should be done to  extricate the financial sector from its current difficulties.    [Begin recording] [Roosen] I believe that a current of  opinion is forming on the crisis and that people are very  willing to generate ideas and solutions to confront the  emergency. Such efforts should result in a program that can be  announced to the country in the near future.    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct]    [Roosen] I presume the economy minister will have that  responsibility.    [Reporter] But there has to be a way to get the financial  sector out of its current crisis based on [words indistinct]?    [Roosen] Based precisely on that, of course.    [Reporter] Based on what?    [Roosen] Based on the fact that the banks' account  portfolios  will suffer progressive deterioration with the current high  interest rates. I believe that 1) the financial sector totally  agrees that this is the situation; 2) the intermediate margins  between the active and passive rates are too high and have to be  reduced so that an appropriate remuneration for the activity can  be obtained; 3) the banks, which have been financially aided,  require major surgery and a reorganization program that will  allow their privatization as soon as possible; and 4) the  financial aid mechanism that is [word indistinct] directly to  the banks and is managed more efficiently must be reformed  because those banks end up putting their money in zero coupons  because they cannot find clients. A solution for survival has to  be found to reverse the cycle that has been established. Those  are the four points on which we have to reach a consensus in the  coming days to effectively stop the financial crisis, return the  country to financial order, and restore its payment system. We  must see economic growth more clearly. Thus, government policies  regarding economic growth also have to be established. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Carrier bag that's very square A revolution in carrier bags which involves cutting four holes in the plastic receptacle may sound unlikely. But the Saklok carrier, distributed by WBC Packaging of Tonbridge, Kent, believes it is exactly what is needed for carrying home a take-away pizza. Because the corners of the square box sit securely in the holes of the Saklok carrier, the pizza arrives home as it leaves the shop. The bag can also be used for carrying cake boxes or trays of garden plants. WBC: UK, 0732 810811.</p>

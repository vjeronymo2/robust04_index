			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rujub, official in charge of </F> Preventive Security in the West Bank, by correspondent Basim  Abu-Sumayyah; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril  al-Rujub, there is another challenge. This is the Israeli  presence, specifically the presence of settlements on  Palestinian soil. This constitutes a constant factor for  friction. How will you address this issue?    [Al-Rujub] I spoke about intrinsic challenges. But  concerning objective challenges, there is certainly the issue of  settlements and settlers. I believe that there can be no  stability, security, tranquility, and the Palestinian national  authority will not be able to impose its national presence in an  ethical manner so long as there are settlers and settlements.  There is a challenge of another type, that of Jerusalem, the  question of East Jerusalem should be settled in a manner that  fulfills the minimum level of our aspirations. By this, I mean  the withdrawal from East Jerusalem.    [Abu-Sumayyah] Mr. Jibril, since we are speaking about  Jerusalem, is there actually a secret Israeli commitment to  President 'Arafat on the future of Jerusalem?    [Al-Rujub] I do not know. What I know is that there is a  U.S. pledge to continue tackling East Jerusalem as occupied.  [passage omitted]    [Abu-Sumayyah] How do you assess the implementation of the  agreement on the ground over the past period?    [Al-Rujub] From the Palestinian side, I believe there are  some difficulties. However, we should overcome them. We in the  PLO are not a major power. We work within our limited  resources. In spite of this, we managed to transport our  forces. We managed to take over the duties of the police force  and to impose a minimum of political respect. I view this as an  achievement when compared with the means we have. We must not  forget the economic siege the PLO has been experiencing since  the Gulf war. [passage omitted]    [Abu-Sumayyah] Are there negotiations for releasing more  Palestinian detainees, is there a timetable for this, or what  about the question of the detainees in general?    [Al-Rujub] With respect to the detainees, there is a  two-point agreement. The first point is to release 5,000  prisoner during a record time, and a committee will be formed  from the two sides to discuss the vehicle for releasing the  rest. The upshot of this means that all the prisoners and  detainees will be released without any consideration to their  affiliation, and the reasons for which they were arrested. This  is because we in the PLO look at ourselves as negotiators and  speakers on behalf of the entire Palestinian people with all  their political and social sectors. From this premise, we  signed the agreement in the name of all the Palestinian people.  That's why we consider that we are responsible for releasing  all who have resisted occupation, and those who have exercised  their natural right in confronting an illegal occupation of our  land. After releasing them and implementing the Palestinian  national authority, we will be responsible for making this  citizen respect the agreements signed by the Palestinian  National Authority, or try to topple them in a democratic manner  through the Palestinian arena. We do not accept, in any way  whatsoever, the principle of classification or discrimination by  saying this one belongs to this faction and that to another  faction. We reject this. We also refuse to consider the  reasons that led this or that to be detained as a cause for  keeping him there because we have fought, and many of our people  were killed and punished by Israel. What is the meaning then  that our fighters and strugglers remain in prison while those  who fought us and killed us from their side enjoy happiness and  freedom?    [Abu-Sumayyah] Will the Palestinian authority allow freedom  of expression and the press and the pluralism of parties?    [Al-Rujub] From my position within the PLO as a member of  the  Palestine National Council, of the PLO's higher military  council, and as the official in charge of preventive security  and within the limits of my prerogatives and my position as a  Palestinian nationalist, I promise that we will give the  opposition forces the natural right and the right that is  acknowledged by all laws to express their opinion in a  civilized, democratic, and ethical manner without physical and  verbal violence.    [Abu-Sumayyah] As well as political and press freedom?    [Al-Rujub] The freedom of the press and expression, the  right  to demonstrate and to criticize, and to hold seminars praising  or criticizing the sound or wrong performance of the national  authority.    [Abu-Sumayyah] Will there be Palestinian military censorship  on the press?    [Al-Rujub] The censorship will not differ from that  exercised  by the most democratic states in the world.

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Firebrand ignites Mexican poll: The opposition candidate threatening continued rule by the PRI A few months ago he was dismissed as a right-wing eccentric with a loud voice. Now Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of Mexico's conservative opposition, is mounting a serious challenge to the governing party's 65-year hold on power. Public support for Mr Fernandez de Cevallos, the candidate of the National Action party, has surged after his clear victory in the televised debate between the three main candidates. In less than a month, he has moved from third place to being close to or ahead of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) nominee, in opinion polls. A trial lawyer and experienced parliamentarian, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos has proved a far more engaging and colourful speaker than his sombre rivals. Easily identified by his sprawling beard and cigar, his confrontational but good-humoured style has turned him into something of a folk hero for Mexicans looking for an alternative to the cold technicians who have run the country for the past decade. His description of Mr Zedillo as a 'good little boy with high grades who has not passed the test of democracy' may have done more to define the PRI candidate than months of government propaganda. His withering attacks on Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas look to have finished off the presidential ambitions of the candidate of the left, once considered the strongest of the two opposition nominees. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos still faces considerable obstacles in his quest to unseat the PRI, and even some supporters acknowledge that he has at best an outside chance of victory. With memory of the debate fading, there are already signs that his support is beginning to soften. The ruling PRI is better organised than the PAN, has more money and is backed by the television networks, the unions, big business and the farmers' organisations. Polls show that voters are more confident of its ability to manage the economy and worried about political instability that might follow a change in government. The PAN's core support is the urban middle-class, and even within that group many are suspicious of its conservative, pro-church views on social policy. The party is hardly represented in the rural parts of Mexico, where 30 per cent of Mexicans live, a weakness not reflected in the opinion polls, which generally exclude voters in the countryside. But the surge in popularity of the combative Mr Fernandez de Cevallos has revealed the vulnerability of the PRI and the volatility of the electorate. Even if Mr Fernandez de Cevallos does not win the election, he could draw enough votes to prevent the PRI winning majority control of the Congress, forcing it to govern with the support of the opposition for the first time. Apart from his success in the debate, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos's campaign has benefited from discontent with the government, fuelled by economic stagnation and political turmoil that began with the peasant revolt in Chiapas over New Year. He has cleverly positioned himself as the candidate of change, but who unlike the leftist opposition, can maintain political and social order. 'We have finished the myth that the candidate of the PRI is invincible,' Mr Fernandez de Cevallos said in a recent interview. 'All of society is demanding change, indicating that the moment of the PAN has come.' His message of conservative and cautious political reform may have been given a boost by the assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former PRI presidential candidate. The murder of the PRI candidate, along with recent kidnappings and an increase in drug-related violence, appears to have shifted public opinion to the right, helping Mr Fernandez de Cevallos at the expense of Mr Cardenas. Unlike Mr Cardenas, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos approves of most of the pro-market economic policies of the current administration. If elected, he says would fully open sectors such as banking to foreign capital, allow limited private investment in the protected petroleum industry, introduce more competition in telecommunications and broadcasting, and decentralise federal powers to the states. But compared with the detailed positions put out by Mr Zedillo, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos's proposals are vague, and among his small team of advisers there are no well-known economists or businessmen. In some economic policies, he is probably to the left of the governing party, keener on protecting small businesses from the effects of free trade and, for example, supporting a controlled devaluation of the currency of about 20-25 per cent. To reassure voters worried about his lack of administrative experience, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos says he will invite members of other parties to join his government. Advisers to Mr Fernandez de Cevallos encourage rumours that Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, will be asked to remain in his job if their candidate wins the presidential election. Mr Aspe has yet to comment on such rumours. But if the campaign remains close, the pressure on him and other well-trained officials in the governing party to distance themselves from the firebrand candidate of the centre-right opposition is sure to grow.</p>

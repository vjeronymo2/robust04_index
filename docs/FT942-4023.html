			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Fashion: Men who dress to suit - Richard Rawlinson urges British men to lighten up this summer The long-standing reputation of British gents for sartorial elegance is marred by one thing - they do not seem to distinguish between summer and winter clothes for the office. Their formal wardrobe is one of the few remaining parts of their heritage which commands respect from mainland European and American counterparts. Those foreigners prone to mocking the fashion sense of British women (along with the nation's alleged taste for pork scratchings and warm beer) often wax lyrical about British men's restrained style. Indeed, Prince Charles often features on the annual best-dressed man list in France, and many international executives make a bee-line for Savile Row's tailors when they visit London. Clothing brands such as Burberry, Dunhill and Aquascutum have thriving export businesses, selling le style anglais across Europe, the US and Japan. Overseas social observers, however, have detected one risible flaw in the way the British gent dresses himself. While they have no quarrel with his idiosyncratic penchant for mixing pin-stripe suits with loud, stripey shirts and busy, paisley-patterned ties, they are baffled by his tendency to wear thick, flannel suits and heavy brogues in temperatures over 70`F. British men do not seem to acknowledge climatic changes. From June to August, it is commonplace to see British business executives, in charcoal-grey worsted wool suits and solid Oxford shoes, wiping sweat from their brows as soon as they leave their air-conditioned offices. And tweedy country solicitors, attending drinks parties after work on sticky summer evenings, look distinctly hot under the collar as they gulp Pimms on garden terraces. 'Some British men even wear overcoats in summer]' says Roland Klein, a French designer who has made London his home. He adds: 'The British seem to think lightweight clothes are too relaxed for the office. Some men are also probably too economical to justify separate summer and winter wardrobes.' It does not have to be this way. Technological advances in cloth manufacturing mean lightweight suits are not necessarily inappropriate for the office. Gone are the days when a summer suit conjured up images of shiny, sky blue jacket and trousers or unstructured, unlined, crumpled cream linen. Brioni, an Italian menswear company, is regarded as a pioneer of the lightweight suit. Throughout the 1950s, when most men still settled for coarsely-woven, bulky, utilitarian demob suits, Brioni offered luxurious suits in the lightest of wools and with minimum padding. The Rome-based tailor uses a cloth known as Vaticani, so called because the Pope's red cassocks are made from it. Graded (in technical parlance) from a fine 'super 100' to a deluxe and rare 'super 150', the same fabric is also popular with orchestral conductors who need to remain cool during energetic performances. Retail stockists of Brioni include Beale and Inman in London's New Bond Street, where off-the-peg suits range from Pounds 1,100 to Pounds 1,900 and custom-made suits from Pounds 3,500 to Pounds 4,000. The beauty of the tightly-woven merino wool and fine cashmere is that they are cool in summer, yet warm in winter. Clothes made from them often have all-year appeal, prompting the term 'trans-seasonal' fashion. The investment in top-quality fabrics also means the clothes are likely to be thoroughly comfortable, durable and resistant to creases when in a suitcase. The Italians have always been ahead of the game when it comes to understanding the importance of fabric in menswear. Giorgio Armani, Cerruti and Ermengildo Zegna all are maestros of smooth, textural, trans-seasonal attire; indeed, it is no coincidence that the latter two began as textile manufacturers. Since they emerged on the UK menswear scene in the 1980s, they have had a profound influence on the way traditional British brands, such as Austin Reed and Jaeger, use fabric. But while their shift away from heavy cloth has rubbed off on younger men, the more mature and conservative British gent remains obstinately loyal to his heavy suit, perhaps equating weight with quality. Many UK brands are using a lightweight, supple wool which has been devised and promoted by the International Wool Secretariat and has the trademark Cool Wool. For this spring and summer, Daks Simpson is offering navy and grey three-button, single-breasted and doubled-breasted suits in cool wool woven into a super 100 gabardine. Prices range from Pounds 229 to Pounds 375. Aquascutum has experimented with making sober-coloured cool wool suits. Its charcoal cloth has a thin gold pin-stripe while the navy fabric has a fine rust stripe. Its range of shirts often has short sleeves and its silk ties are brighter than the winter collection. Burberry presents lightweight, crease-free, wool gabardine suits in navy, mushroom and khaki, while its shirts come in soft white, cream, lemon, mint and sky blue. Dunhill's suits have become increasingly informal in cut and fabrication in recent seasons and, this summer, it offers wool and linen mixes in light grey. Merchandise director Alan Duddle says: 'Men have become used to wearing comfortable casual wear on weekends, and they are becoming intolerant of having to wear restrictive suits for work. Menswear is getting more relaxed.' All these brands are dabbling, to various degrees, in the crumpled, earthy-coloured linen garments promoted so strongly on the international designer catwalks for this season. But they realise also that this extremely informal look would not be acceptable in many offices. They are, therefore, combining the comfort of lightweight suits with the conservative looks of heavier tailoring, to give men the best of both. Richard Rawlinson is news editor of Fashion Weekly.</p>

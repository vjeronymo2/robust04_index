			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 -- The Agrarian  Democratic Party of Romania [PDAR], whose representation in  Romania's Parliament is ensured by only five parliamentarians,  has decided to withdraw its support given so far to the ruling  Party of Social Democracy, told a news conference PDAR leader  Victor Surdu, on 28 June.    Also, he said the Agrarian parliamentarians "will take  advantage" of the debate of the opposition's no-confidence  motion in order to present their stand on their own, while  shunning certain "opinions" of the opposition. The PDAR leader  said that the no-confidence motion promoted by the Democratic  Convention ignored certain achievements of the ruling party.  The PDAR will back it though.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: Deft portrait of naval rivalry DREADNOUGHT: BRITAIN, GERMANY AND THE COMING OF THE GREAT WAR by Robert K Massie Jonathan Cape, Pounds 20, THIS IS a book you are bound to enjoy. It is a chronicle of the Anglo-German naval rivalry placed against the broader background of the personal and national clashes that led to the Great War. The set pieces  - the naval review of June 1897, the Jameson Raid, the Kaiser's visits to Windsor, Winston Churchill visiting the fleet, 'the spring of the panther' - are dramatically re-created. The pen portraits of the political and naval establishments of Wilhelmine Germany and Victorian and Edwardian Britain are brilliantly evoked with a sharp eye for the memorable detail (Bismark's knowledge of Walter Scott's novels is a case in point). Massie keeps his complex story under tight control, covering large areas of domestic history and international manoeuvring without losing his reader's attention. Monographers like myself can only envy the sheer sweep of Dreadnought and the author's rich palette of colours so deftly applied. Like Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August, this is narrative history at its very best. There are but a few instances where the author's appeal to a general audience dictates his selection of high points. There is an extended treatment of the Eulenburg affair, an intimate of the Kaiser brought to trial for homosexuality. We are presented again with the now seemingly obligatory account of Winston Churchill's unhappy childhood, the school beatings, nanny and all, as well as his early adventures in the Sudan. Occasionally, a major figure escapes even Massie's skilful brush. He can do little with Sir Edward Grey, the all-important yet ultimately elusive British foreign secretary, who was left permanently shocked by his failure to preserve peace in 1914. For Grey, more than any other British politician, played the decisive role in determining Britain's course in July. Multi-dimensional in approach and amply filled with larger-than-life politicians and seamen, this book is necessarily short on analysis but also curiously inconclusive. As Massie knows, the dreadnought race did not lead to an Anglo-German war. That issue was really settled by 1912 and relations between Berlin and London were far better in 1914 than they had been earlier. The naval race, as Massie's central them, leaves little room for any real examination of the roots of the Great War and the German and British decisions to engage in it. The British decision, taken out of weakness rather than strength, haunted the imaginations of the inter-war generation and remains the subject of sharp historical debate. Belgium was but a fig-leaf to cover radical doubts; more deep-seated fears of the consequences of neutrality convinced the Cabinet waverers to cast their vote for Mars. We are not told why they should have thought that this war could be fought on the high seas and so believed its course to be limited. Nor why all the statesmen of Europe believed that the conflict would be a short one, an illusion that critically influenced their actions. Robert Massie's final chapters, already too crowded to give full play to the drama of that final crisis, omit much that is critical to any understanding of the origins of the Great War. For this, one must consult a different kind of book. If only it could be as engrossing and readable as this one.</p>

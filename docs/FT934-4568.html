			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Sunday shopping opponents muster forces Opponents of deregulated Sunday shopping yesterday launched a last-minute campaign to swing wavering Labour MPs into line before a vital Commons vote next week. Keep Sunday Special (KSS), a coalition of church, trade union and small retailing groups, claims the support of a majority of MPs for tight controls on Sunday shopping in England and Wales. Organisers are privately worried that the Labour front bench and the executive of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, are boosting support for deregulation. MPs will choose in a free vote on Wednesday between three options in the Sunday trading bill intended to replace the 1950 Shops Act: Full deregulation, supported by the prime minister, the chancellor and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who is responsible for the bill. Unrestricted trading hours for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger stores, which is supported by the Shopping Hours Reform Council (SHRC), mainly representing chain stores. Limited opening for small shops, DIY stores and garden centres, with unrestricted opening for all shops on four Sundays before Christmasm, which is the option supported by KSS. The group's hopes were damaged during the second reading debate when Mr Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, described its proposals as unworkable. Its main concern, however, is the Usdaw executive council's decision in October to switch support from the KSS proposal to the SHRC option. The decision has prompted concern among Usdaw-sponsored MPs loyal to KSS, who fear other Labour MPs may follow the executive's lead. In an attempt to shore up Labour support KSS has stepped up its attack on the bill's employment protection provisions, which it says are 'not worth the paper they are written on'. The group released a survey of Usdaw members showing that 55 per cent of those contacted had not worked on Sundays, and 95 per cent of those did not wish to.</p>

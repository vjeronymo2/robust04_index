			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Stakebuilding continues at Pathfinders Group AN INTRIGUING group of shareholders is being assembled at Pathfinders Group, the USM-quoted entertainment and media recruitment agency which has been chaired since last September by Mr Stephen Hargrave. Mr Jon Pither, the former Amari Group chief executive and Glynwed International director, has bought a 6.3 per cent stake and joined the board. This follows the acquisition of a 3 per cent interest by Mr John Donachie, former chairman of Alfred Walker, the commercial property developer, in March. Mr Hargrave said yesterday that the purchases were not connected and that Mr Pither's presence did not necessarily mean that Pathfinders was scouting acquisitions in metals. 'I think he will play an active part-time role,' he said. 'He has fantastic connections and a lot of managerial experience. He will be helping us to source and fund acquisitions.' Mr Hargrave has a colourful background having worked for Warburg, Save &amp; Prosper and the Evening Standard. Prior to Pathfinders, he was head of planning at United Newspapers. He is the author of a novel about 'a 30-year-old stockbroker who gets involved in some shady dealings.' Mr Pither is currently a director of Suter, the industrial holding company. He was once on the board of the London Metal Exchange. Pathfinders shares rose 1p yesterday to 7p.</p>

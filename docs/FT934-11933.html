			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Neste sinks deeper into the red HEAVY financing costs more than offset a better operating performance to produce a deeper loss at Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, in the first eight months. The group's deficit before reserves and taxes amounted to FM1.32bn (Dollars 231m), exceeding last year's loss by FM330m. Although market conditions in the group's core areas remained tough, the group blamed the deterioration on increased capital costs and foreign exchange losses. Currency losses alone amounted to FM650m, following the weakening of the Finnish markka over the last year. This pushed up the group's overall financial costs to FM1.82bn from FM686m. The increased costs overshadowed the improved operating result, which moved to a FM413m profit from a FM253m deficit as a result of cost-cutting. Sales rose to FM42.8bn from FM36.4bn. Oil sales rose to FM33.6bn from FM29.7bn while chemicals sales improved to FM8.0bn from FM6.0bn.</p>

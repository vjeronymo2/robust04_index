			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace: "Turlais Returns From NATO </F> Northern Group Training"]    [Excerpt] Riga, 11 Feb -- For the first time, the Baltic  states, Poland, Russia, and all Scandinavian countries, which  thus far do not belong to NATO, took part -- on partnership  rights -- in NATO Northern Group staff training "Viking rewiev  '94" in Norway. Latvia was represented in this training by the  Commander of the Latvian Defense Forces, Dainis Turlais.    All three commanders from the Baltic states had a separate  meeting with the chiefs of the Scandinavian Armed Forces. The  most important was the meeting with the Danish high-level  military persons, D. Turlais told DIENA. During the talks, a  decision was made that Latvian officers would begin their  training with Danish assistance as early as this month. A plan  was worked out to prepare the Latvian officers for the joint  Baltic peace battalion. The Scandinavian states have decided to  create a council with the aim of coordinating military aid for  the Baltic states.    As DIENA was told by Turlais, this year the training had a  special meaning -- how to create new relations between the  northern states and the Baltic states in the framework of the  Partnership for Peace program. The foreign minister of Norway  made a forecast for the nearest future -- Sweden and Finland  would join the EC and later would become members of NATO.  Subsequently, this would show the Baltic states the way to  integrate in the group of the Scandinavian states and next also  in NATO.    The mayor of St. Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak Spoke against  this very sharply and categorically. He described such  cooperation as a threat to Russia, which absolutely cannot be  permitted.

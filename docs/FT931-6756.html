			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Continental expects difficult year CONTINENTAL, the German tyre maker, expects an 'extraordinarily difficult' current financial year in Europe, only partly relieved by improving conditions in north America. However, there will be no dramatic effect on sales, deliveries or earnings, the company said yesterday. Last year had been satisfactory despite the weakening in the second half. Deliveries of both car and commercial vehicle tyres rose 6 per cent, while turnover, affected by currency fluctuations, rose only 3 per cent to DM9.7bn (Dollars 5.9bn). Without giving any profit details, the company said full-year results were 'clearly in the black' after a DM128m net loss in 1991. At the halfway mark it reported profits of DM118m.</p>

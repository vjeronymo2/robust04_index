			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro surges in face of prices pressure NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, yesterday reported a surge in first-half net income to NKr2.63bn (Dollars 361m) from NKr903m a year ago, despite difficult market conditions and pressure on prices in all operating segments. The sharp improvement was due to a pre-tax gain of NKr2.5bn from the disposal of Hydro's 38.3 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate maker, which yielded proceeds, plus interest, of NKr3.6bn. Hydro's performance was also helped by lower production costs, higher crude oil production and a stronger dollar. Nevertheless, the group's result was below analysts' average forecast of NKr2.9bn. Second-quarter net income increased to NKr2.128bn from NKr686m last year. Group first-half revenue rose by NKr1.487bn to NKr32.262bn and increased in the second quarter by NKr680m to NKr15.797bn. First-half operating income improved by NKr511m to NKr2.364bn, while rising in the second quarter by NKr113m to NKr923m. 'In spite of very adverse market conditions we have been able to improve our operating figures as a result of reduced costs and the stronger US dollar,' said Mr Egil Myklebust, president and chief executive. First-half foreign exchange losses widened to NKr360m from a loss of NKr1m in the same period last year. The group's financial position strengthened significantly as a result of the Freia Marabou disposal and the issue of Dollars 300m and NKr1.1bn debentures. 'The proceeds of these loans and the sale of shares on Freia Marabou will be used to repay medium-term bank loans,' Hydro said. Group debt was reduced by NKr4bn to NKr23.2bn at the end of the second quarter from end-1992.</p>

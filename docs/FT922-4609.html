			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Corporate Britain lays out over Pounds 2.5m for a day at the races THE HUNDREDS of companies which entertain clients and staff at Epsom's Derby Day meeting yesterday paid out Pounds 2.5m - but still only half the amount that the great British public is said to have wagered on Lester Piggott's chances in the big race. (He trailed home ninth). The Derby's sponsor, battery maker Ever Ready, accounted for almost half the total bill for the day's corporate hospitality. The company laid out just under Pounds 1m for a lunch hosted by Lords Hanson and White - who this year made their swansong appearances as the Derby's paymasters - and prize money for the day. Derby Day guests are the biggest single group of helicopter users outside the Farnborough Air Show. But the least expensive options for companies which want a presence at the racing calendar's best-known bonanza lay in the buses which park along the rail in the middle of the course. 'Passengers' from companies as diverse as SG Warburg Securities and Currie Motors lined up in about 100 double-deckers, exuding alcoholic bonhomie. Back on the other side of the fence, the better-off racegoers watched from their private boxes. The least a company can expect to pay for the cachet of a terraced room in the grandstand is Pounds 10,000 - the cost of renting a standard box for eight days - plus about Pounds 100-a-head in catering. This option was favoured by the likes of News International, the newspaper group, and John Laing Construction. Extra kudos was available this year in the Queen's Stand which her majesty opened yesterday. Lady Beaverbrook and some of the oil sheiks were among those who decided a box in pristine-white building was worth Pounds 25,000. Observer, Page 25</p>

The account is advertised as instant access but withdrawals will be subject to a penalty of seven days interest. The minimum deposit is Pounds 5,000, compared with Pounds 2,500 in the Share Account. There are three tiers. Interest rates start at 9.6 per cent gross (annual) and 9.11 per cent (monthly) and the top rate is 10.2 per cent gross on Pounds 25,000 or more (annual) and 9.66 per cent (monthly).</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Dublin markets stage recovery SIGNS of confidence returned to the Dublin financial markets yesterday, after the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt at the weekend, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Foreign exchange dealers reported heavy fund inflows, reversing last week's outflows and pushing the punt up to its new ceiling within the ERM band of DM2.44. The Irish gilts market was also active. The National Treasury Management Agency, which manages the government's debt, placed around IPounds 150m of 5- and 10-year maturity stocks on the market, which dealers say were quickly taken up. On the Irish stock exchange, the ISEQ overall index gained almost 5 per cent, with financial and food stocks performing particularly well. The most active buyers on the foreign exchange market were corporations and foreign banks. Dealers said overseas buyers were still exercising caution, and that much of yesterday's dealing was related to profit-taking resulting from positions taken out by speculators before the weekend. The central bank dropped its overnight lending rate from 100 per cent to 14 per cent yesterday, and the key one-month interbank interest rate fell sharply to 16 per cent from over 40 per cent, where it stood most of last week. Concerns linger that commercial lending rates, particularly mortgage rates, might still be increased if interbank rates do not fall further. The building societies hinted yesterday that they might still be obliged to increase mortgage lending rates, at present standing at about 14 per cent, if the one-month rate does not fall below 14 per cent. Analysts say much now hinges on sterling's performance. Further weakness of the pound could undermine the effect of the devaluation. The punt was yesterday trading at about 1.03 to the pound, still well above the level of 0.93 to sterling before sterling was taken out of the ERM last September.</p>

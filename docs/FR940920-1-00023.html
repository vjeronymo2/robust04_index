This revision establishes an emission statement program for stationary sources throughout the State. New Hampshire's submittal includes amendments to Chapter Env-A 900 (Parts 901&hyph;903). This action proposes limited approval of New Hampshire's Chapter Env-A 900, ``Owner and Operator'' for the purpose of strengthening the New Hampshire SIP. In addition, this action proposes limited disapproval of New Hampshire's Chapter Env-A 900 (Parts 901&hyph;903) since the regulation fails to meet all requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is being taken pursuant to section 110 of the CAA. Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revisions and on EPA's proposal of a limited approval/limited disapproval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments received in writing by October 20, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rule action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be mailed to Linda M.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA or ``the Act''). EPA has published a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NOx Supplement to the General Preamble'')). EPA has also issued a draft guidance document describing the requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in this Notice entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also conducting a rulemaking process to modify part 40 of the CFR to reflect the requirements of the emission statement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Analysis of State Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Procedural Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires each state to observe certain procedural requirements in developing its SIP, of which the emission statement program will become a part. Section 110(l)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State under the CAA must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. EPA must at the outset determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of New Hampshire held a public hearing on June 18, 1992. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State on November 13, 1992 and submitted to EPA on December 21, 1992 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA and deemed complete on February 19, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Components of Emission Statement Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the State must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for reporting by the sources and the State. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance, and the specific source requirements detailed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. SIP Revision Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA requires States to submit their SIP revisions within 2 years of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) (November 15, 1990). New Hampshire submitted its SIP revision on January 12, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reporting Requirements for State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the program elements applying to sources, the SIP should include a provision that requires States to provide EPA the identifying information for the sources covered by the emission statement program, the value for rule effectiveness utilized by the State in its SIP calculations, the source data elements entered into AIRS, and quarterly emission statement status reports. The minimum source identification information should include the AIRS code, the AFS point number (ID), the AFS segment number (ID), and the Source Category Code (SCC) and descriptions for each segment. In addition, States should supply to EPA the current rule effectiveness (RE) factors at the SCC pollutant level, if applicable, and the RE method codes. The emission statement data submittal to AIRS should include all data obtained from the source and the State. These source-supplied data elements include source identification information (name, physical location, mailing address of the facility, latitude and longitude, and 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code(s)), operating schedule information (percentage annual throughput, days per week on the normal operating schedule, hours per day during the normal operating schedule, and hours per year on the normal operating schedule), process rate data (annual process rate (annual throughput) and peak ozone season daily process rate), control equipment information (current primary and secondary control equipment identification codes and current combined control equipment efficiency (%)), and emissions information (estimated actual VOC and NOx emissions at the segment level (in tons per year for an annual emission rate and pounds per day for a typical ozone season day), estimated emissions method code, calendar year for the emissions, and emission factor (if used)). EPA recommends that the States electronically submit emission statement data into the AIRS database no later than July 1 of each year, commencing in 1993. The quarterly reports should show the total number of facilities that met the State's emission statements program requirements and the number of facilities that failed to meet the requirements. Quarterly reports should be submitted commencing no later than July 1, 1993. New Hampshire has not committed to submitting emission statement data to EPA by July 1 of each year. EPA will negotiate with New Hampshire to include a submittal date and requirement for quarterly emission statement reports in future 105 grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Hampshire has not required source identification information, operating schedule information, control equipment information, process data information, and annual and typical ozone season day emissions from all potentially subject source categories. New Hampshire only requires source identification information and operating schedule information from surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c), gasoline storage and degreasing facilities under Env-A 901.05(b), and fuel combustion and incinerator sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(1) and 901.06(c)(3). Under Env-A 901.04(h), New Hampshire requires all facilities with add-on VOC control equipment to keep records of control equipment information, but not to report this information. Facilities with add-on NOx control equipment are required to record this information under Env-A 901.06(c)(6). New Hampshire only requires process data information from surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c)(5) and combustion sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(4). Recordkeeping, but not reporting, is required for gasoline storage sources under Env-A 901.04(e)(1) and degreasing facilities under Env-A 901.04(g)(2). New Hampshire only requires annual and typical ozone season day emissions from surface coating and printing sources under Env-A 901.04(c)(7), and combustion sources under Env-A 901.06(c)(5). This is also required from degreasing sources under Env-A 901.04(g)(4), however, sources are not required to report this information, only to keep records. No emissions reporting requirements were made for VOC/gasoline storage or for other types of sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Sources Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that States with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone require emission statement data from all sources of VOC or NOx in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all classified ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification (Marginal, Moderate, etc.). Section 184(b)(2) of the Act extends the requirements for major stationary sources in moderate ozone nonattainment areas to sources in the ozone transport region. Section 182(f) extends the requirements for major stationary sources of VOC in ozone transport regions to major sources of NOx. The emission statement requirement covers sources in attainment areas and nonattainment areas which are not classified within the ozone region which emit, or have the potential to emit, 100 tpy or more of NOx or 50 tpy or more of VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Hampshire is located in the ozone transport region. Emission statement regulations must apply State-wide, and cover all stationary sources which emit or have the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC or 100 tpy of NOx. In addition, New Hampshire has three classified ozone nonattainment areas and are therefore subject to the more stringent source threshold requirement of section 182(a)(3)(B). The area which includes all of Merrimack County, part of Hillsborough County, and part of Rockingham County, is classified Marginal. The second nonattainment area includes all of Strafford County and part of Rockingham County, and is classified as Serious. Finally, a portion of New Hampshire is in the Boston-Lawrence-Salem Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA), which is also classified as Serious. This includes a range of cities and towns from Nashua to Exeter in portions of Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties. For these classified ozone nonattainment areas, the States' emission statement regulations must cover all sources which emit VOC or NOx.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For classified ozone nonattainment areas, the States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NOx or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42) or other methods acceptable to EPA. New Hampshire does not waive the emission statement requirement for sources emitting less than 25 tons per year of NOx or VOC emissions. New Hampshire requires certain sources that have potential emissions of less than 25 tons per year to supply their data and information required for calendar year 1992 by April 15, 1993. In addition, these sources are required to submit emission statements for every third calendar year, beginning with 1995, by April 15 of the following year. All NOx emitting sources that are required to submit emission statement information under EPA's guidance are covered in New Hampshire's regulation. Under Env-A 901.07, fuel burning devices, as well as miscellaneous sources having theoretical potential NOx emissions of at least 25 tpy, are required to submit information on an annual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, New Hampshire's regulation does not address all VOC sources recommended in EPA's guidance. Since New Hampshire is located in the ozone transport region, emission statement regulations must apply State-wide and cover all sources which emit or have the potential to emit 50 tpy of VOC. In addition, New Hampshire has three classified ozone nonattainment areas and are therefore subject to the more stringent source threshold requirement of section 182(a)(3)(B). These classified nonattainment areas must require emission statement data from all sources of VOC in the nonattainment areas unless New Hampshire waives, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement for classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide VOC emissions in nonattainment areas. In Env-A 901.05(d), emission statements are required to be submitted for sources which are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Env-A 901.04 and the applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03. The applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03 cover sources subject to EPA's existing control technique guideline (CTG) documents and other miscellaneous sources that have the potential to emit more than 50 tpy of VOC. Env-A 901.04 covers the following sources: Any source required to be permitted under 603.02(g) (surface coating, metal cleaning, or printing); 601.02(h) (VOC storage tanks); 603.02(i) (gasoline terminal loading racks); or any other paragraph of 603.02 which pertains to VOC emitters, with the exception of sources exempted by Env-A 901.03(a)(4). Env-A 901.03(a)(4) excludes from recordkeeping requirements, those sources using No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, natural gas, or electrical energy. Under New Hampshire's rules, the requirements for emission statements do not apply to miscellaneous VOC source categories (i.e., non-CTG) unless those sources are covered by Env-A 603.02. Only non-CTG sources that are coating or printing sources subject to 603.02(g) are covered by New Hampshire's emission statement program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the applicability criteria of Env-A 1204.03 only cover graphic arts printing, and non-CTG sources with potential VOC emissions greater than 50 tpy. Therefore, if certain non-CTG sources have actual VOC emissions greater than 25 tpy, but potential emissions less than 50 tpy, they would not be covered by New Hampshire's program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, New Hampshire's emission statement rule specifically excludes sources with VOC emissions resulting from combustion of No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, or natural gas. As a result, New Hampshire has not required all sources that emit or have the potential to emit more than 50 tpy of VOC to submit emission statements. Additionally, if either VOC or NOx is emitted at or above the statutory reporting level, the other pollutant must be included in the emission statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs. New Hampshire did not include this requirement in its rule. New Hampshire's rule was proposed in May 1992 and EPA provided comments in June 1992. However, this requirement was not clearly stated in EPA's emission statement guidance until July 1992. Therefore, New Hampshire was unaware of this requirement at the time the regulation was proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Reporting Requirements for Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sources covered by the State emission statement program should submit, at a minimum, the data elements described under section II.B.2 of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The emission statement submitted by the source should contain a certification that the information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. EPA recommends that the State program require the submission of the data from the sources no later than April 15 of each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Env-A 901.05(d)(1) and 901.07(b)(1) require sources subject to the emission statement requirement to submit data for the calendar year 1992 by April 15, 1993. Furthermore, these sections require that information for each subsequent calendar year be submitted by April 15 of the following year. New Hampshire does require a certification of data accuracy under Env-A 901.04(b) and 901.06(b), however, this certification is not required to accompany the emission statement forms. In a June 24, 1992 comment letter, EPA commented ``the certificate of data accuracy shall state, at a minimum, that the records required by Env-A and maintained at the facility are true and accurate. Also, the certificate of data accuracy must be submitted with each emission statement.'' New Hampshire's rule only requires that the certification be kept on the premises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Reporting Forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although EPA has developed a proposed format for the emission statement reporting process in its guidance document, the Act allows States to develop their own format for emission statement reporting. New Hampshire has not specified a format in which facilities are to submit data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the above deficiencies, EPA cannot grant approval of New Hampshire's rule under section 110(k)(3) and part D. EPA may grant a limited approval of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval. In order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited approval of Chapter Env-A 900 ``Owner or Operator Obligations'' (Parts 901&hyph;903) under sections 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of this rule because it does not fully meet section 182(a)(3)(B) of part D of the Act. As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, the State will have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval before EPA is required to impose one of the two sanctions set forth in section 179(b) of the Act: either highway sanctions or new source review offsets. If the State has not corrected its deficiencies within 6 months after imposition of the first sanction, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the State has met the 1990 Amendments requirements. Note also that any final rulemaking disapproving the State's submission will trigger the requirement for EPA to impose a Federal implementation plan within two years of disapproval as provided under section 110(c)(1) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Request for Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on EPA's proposal of a limited approval/limited disapproval. Public comments received by October 20, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order (EO) 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989. 54 FR 2214&hyph;2225. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions, 54 FR 2222, from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state enforceability.

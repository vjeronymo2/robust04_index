			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Momcilo Cebalovic: "Two Consortia for One Gas </F> Line (2): Work for Stockholders Only"--first paragraph is  POLITIKA introduction]    [Text] The Russian partner will not finance the  gasification of Serbia until the sanctions are lifted; the new  consortium acknowledges the work of the old one, and money  previously invested by NIS [Petroleum Industry of Serbia] will  be included as an investment in the future joint-stock company;  the Pojate-Nis-Dimitrovgrad branch of the gas line will be a  joint-stock company; significance of the branch from  Bulgaria.    The blockade against our country has halted many projects,  including the gasification of Serbia south of Batajnica, which  has been dragging on for 10 years now. The biggest problem has  always been the lack of money. The question now is whether  Serbia will solve these problems as well, since there are two  consortia for the gasification of southeastern Serbia. The job  will probably be undertaken by the one with the stronger  political position in these times.    Only three days before the last elections, on 16 December, a  meeting took place at Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's  office between Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of  "Progres," and Stepan Romanovich Derezhev and Vladislav  Vladimirovich Pochinkin, the directors of "Gasprom" in Moscow.  The official announcement said that these men are  representatives of a consortium to construct the southern branch  of the gas line across Serbia. In the presence of the president  as well as Prime Minister Sainovic, it was reported that "a  contract was signed concerning this major job." Speaking of  former Prime Minister Sainovic, it must be noted that he has  long been acquainted with the cooperation between "Progres" and  "Gasprom." It is perhaps partially for that reason that insiders  say that he will be the FRY ambassador to Moscow.    The founders of the consortium, at least according to the  Serbian Government accord signed by Sainovic, are the mixed  Russo-Serbian enterprise "Progresgas-trejding," Belgrade, as  well as NIS, "SARTID 1913," and "Beobank," so that it was  logical to expect that these members would put their signatures  on the contract concerning joint financing and construction of  the gas line through which gas would one day arrive not only  from Hungary, but also from Bulgaria. But since the members of  the consortium existed only "on paper," without any mutually  arranged relations, without any agreement to govern this, it was  normal that only two "serious" firms would then emerge, which  are in fact the foundation of this consortium: "Progres" and  "Gasprom."  <H5>  Priority to Mixed Enterprise </H5>   Even that information about Russian financing of the Serbian  gas line under the blockade elicited reactions by IZVESTIYA, and  it was explained in Moscow that this job will get under way only  after the sanctions are lifted. A month ago, we too looked for  someone at "Progresgas-trejding" to explain this, but Toplica  Nedeljkovic, one of the directors of the mixed company,  considered it a bad time for anything to be written about that.  Thanks to Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of "Progres,"  we spoke to "Progresgas-trejding" about the new consortium only  a few days ago. We asked Filip Grujic, the assistant general  director of "Progres," and Toplica Nedeljkovic, the director of  "Progresgas-trejding," what has happened over the course of the  month and a half since the contract was signed in President  Milosevic's office.    They explained to us that the goal of creating the  consortium  is to gasify that part of Serbia and to ensure an alternative  and supplemental path of entry for gas, at Dimitrovgrad, in  addition to the existing one at Horgos. According to the  government accord, the job coordinator is "Progresgas-trejding."  <H5>  $190 Million From Stockholders?! </H5>   "We are a Russo-Serbian mixed enterprise, there will be  Russians involved in the job, so it is logical that we be the  exponents of the job," says Nedeljkovic, who before assuming  this post was in fact an assistant to Nikola Sainovic, then the  minister of energy at the very time when "Progres" was  intervening to cover the debts of importers and users of gas by  exporting our goods. At the time, "Progres's" entry into the gas  business created conflicts with NIS, but some sort of  compromise, about which nothing can be written at present, was  found to the satisfaction of all.    The role of the founders is to create the conditions for  realization of the job in the first phase. That would mean  finding money, providing projects.... The readiness of the  Russian firm to come in with money is not disputed. Will that be  only money, or equipment and labor as well? The people at  "Progresgas-trejding" with whom we spoke do not deny that an  investment program has been drawn up within NIS (while they do  not mention "Energogas, although it is known that it is behind  this), and that they have plenty of necessary projects (for the  Pojate-Nis-Dimitrovgrad line) from which the new consortium will  profit. Thus, they will also need what the old consortium, which  is still in existence, produced. The task of the new consortium  is to construct the line in question from Pojate to  Dimitrovgrad, as well as the Nis-Knjazevac-Bor-Prahovo,  Nis-Leskovac-Vranje, and Nis-Prokuplje-Kursumlija-Pristina  lines. It is estimated that between $180 and $190 million is  needed for all these lines.    We would add that "NIS Energogas" knows nothing about these  talks that you have had with NIS.    "That is a relationship problem at NIS," says Nedeljkovic.    "We are planning," Grujic continues, "to build the gas lines  with investments from future stockholders, who will be the  co-owners of the gas lines, who will run them and have the right  to share the profits that we expect. We intend to create a new  enterprise whose job will be the operation of the gas lines  constructed with stockholder investments."    Can this principle also apply perhaps to the long-distance  hot-water line from the thermoelectric power plant in Obrenovac  to Belgrade?    "Certainly. If that had been done, the job would have  already  progressed quite far," Grujic replies.  <H5>  Whoever Provides the Money Gets the Work </H5>   The officials with whom we spoke emphasize that firms that  are not among the founders but that accept the principles will  be allowed to join the project. It has been agreed that  everything that NIS has invested thus far in these lines will be  recognized as an investment in the new enterprise. For example,  the planner will be the same. Incomplete investments made within  the NIS context concerning gas will be completed by those who  began them. Our consortium will not interfere in this regard,  they say. They emphasize that "there is no controversy in  relation to the existing consortium. They themselves can finish  what they have begun, and if someone from that consortium wants  to participate in this one, they can join it."    "No one can be guaranteed work unless they provide money,"  says Grujic, in response to complaints from firms in Nis who are  afraid of losing business. If they do not have the money to  invest, then they can invest their labor as future co-ownership.    The capacity of this branch from Bulgaria is two billion  cubic meters of gas annually. Around seven billion cubic meters  can enter each year from the Hungarian line. This would allow  for a normal supply until 2011. However, Nedeljkovic says that  we have never taken more than 2.5 billion cubic meters from the  Hungarian line (plus a billion cubic meters of domestic gas).  Thus, with this branch, if there is enough consumption and users  that can pay for the gas in this country, it will be possible to  import around nine billion cubic meters annually. This branch  would close the "gas line ring" and reduce the dependence on  petroleum derivatives (and increase the dependence on imported  gas).... Gas is cheaper than petroleum, Grujic and Nedeljkovic  emphasize, stressing that the possibility of a "goods for gas"  arrangement is very great. Conditions will also be created for  getting gas to Montenegro one day.    Have the founders signed any mutual agreement that would  lend  legal status to the consortium?    "The principles have been agreed to, and an agreement is  being drawn up," says Toplica Nedeljkovic.</p>

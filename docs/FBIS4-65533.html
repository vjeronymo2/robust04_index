			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norbert Mayer: "Vranitzky Wants EU Help for </F> Eastern Reform States"]    [Text] Brussels -- "The European Union [EU] must help  promote the evolution toward democracy in the neighboring  reform states today," Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said  in a talk he gave before the renowned Paul Henri Spaak  Foundation in Brussels on Wednesday [18 May].    With all the criticism of the Community's pragmatic  step-by-step course, one tends to forget the economic and  political success of integration. A military confrontation in  Western Europe is unthinkable today. "The tragedy in  ex-Yugoslavia is dramatic evidence of this," the chancellor  emphasized.    Vranitzky said that Austria's specific contributions after  joining the EU will be its commitment for Central and Eastern  Europe, as well as some impulses in environmental policy. The  transit agreement is a milestone on the way toward an ecological  transport policy. Austria will also show a strong commitment in  social affairs.    The deepening of integration and enlargement do not  contradict each other; these are just two sides of the same  coin. "The challenges of the next few decades -- preserving  European competitiveness, protecting jobs, preventing  environmental disasters, stabilizing Eastern Europe, and  reacting jointly to the pressures of migration -- could hardly  have been tackled by the original six European Community members  alone."    The fear that in coping with these tasks, Austria is part of  a "North European bloc," is unfounded. "We have applied for  membership in a Union that represents all of Europe." Austria's  traditional role of mediator and its ability to reach a  consensus are helpful in this.</p>

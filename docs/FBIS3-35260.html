			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nabil 'Amr] </F>   [Text] The Palestinian factions that form the  Damascus-based alliance of Palestinian forces, the 10 factions,  are displeased with the actions of the Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas. Their dissatisfaction is based not only on  Hamas' lack of seriousness in coordinating with the other  factions in political and organizational contexts, but also on  its militant activities inside the occupied territories in  general, and the Gaza Strip in particular.    According to information made available to AL-DUSTUR on the  atmosphere at the meetings of the alliance forces in Damascus,  the doubts of these forces have risen to a level where they do  not hesitate to ask a suspicious question; namely: What does  Hamas wish to achieve with its policy, which seeks to impose  Hamas as a custodian of the other members of the alliance -- the  same members that suffered from Fatah's custodianship within the  framework of the PLO?    AL-DUSTUR telephoned sources close to the central command of  the alliance forces in Damascus. These sources told AL-DUSTUR  that Hamas is trying to polish its image and deliberately seeks  to complicate the dialogue with the other factions in the  alliance. It wants to avoid dialogue on one substantial issue --  Hamas' attempts to appoint itself an alternative to Fatah in the  new alliance, as well as an alternative to the PLO. These moves  are rejected by the other nine factions of the new alliance,  which sought, and still seek, to hold a dialogue with Hamas.  They want a dialogue in order to establish a political platform  for their movement and create flexibility on the basis of  participation, not through Hamas' political tutelage.    These sources said the recent meetings in Damascus on  Saturday [19 February] and Sunday went beyond the standard and  did not conceal the worries of some factions over Hamas'  rejected intentions. They raised the issue very frankly and  confronted Hamas representatives, who tried to evade and refute  these allegations, stressing that they do not wish to impose  hegemony or become an alternative to the PLO. A close source to  the alliance said the position of Hamas representatives reminds  one of the Egyptian proverb "I hear what you say, I like it; but  when I see your action, I wonder." A source who is very close  to the alliance command explains why he used that proverb. He  said Hamas is undermining the two most important tracks for the  alliance. Hamas refused to establish a unified command for the  intifadah inside the occupied territories, which would be open  to all Palestinian forces opposing the Oslo agreement signed by  the PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993 and to every Palestinian  who believes in the intifadah as the means to realize the  Palestinian people's national rights.    The source said that the second issue is that Hamas  rejected a matter already agreed upon; namely, mobilizing the  Palestinian people and the forces that oppose the agreement  through people's conferences. These conferences would lead to a  general Palestinian people's congress of representatives from  Palestinian groups, as nominated by the people's conferences.    The source said that although the Palestinian people are  coordinating to face the occupation and are working through the  intifadah with unprecedented coordination, Hamas is of the  opinion that coordination is better than establishing a  leadership center for the alliance. Hamas also proposes  people's rallies instead of organized people's conferences.  These conferences will lead to the formation of a political  framework for the alliance. The Palestinian people have lost  any interest in speech rallies.    The same official, who did not want to be identified, said  that the independent and historical Palestinian leaderships that  reject the Oslo agreement and want the alliance to appear as an  organized Palestinian opposition political force have expressed  indignation because four months have been lost in a "dialogue of  the deaf" among the alliance forces. Four months have gone by  without reaching an organized framework within which the  Palestinian forces that oppose the Oslo agreement and which  believe that the intifadah is the only way to respond to this  agreement can be grouped. Hamas wants to remind the Palestinian  people, political forces, and organizations who have lost  interest in the PLO's method of domination, of the old methods  of Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah organization, which used to impose  itself on the other Palestinian groups that formed the PLO.    While describing relations among the alliance's forces as  cold and paralyzed, the official said that the only agreement  was to effect a joint approach toward certain Arab and Islamic  states. He said that the Hamas representatives in the alliance  leadership denied any knowledge that Hamas groups on the Gaza  Strip abducted, tortured, and killed a Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] youth in Khan Yunus and claimed  that their policies are based on noninterference in the internal  affairs of others.    A DFLP official in Amman told us that reports available to  him confirm that a group from Hamas is behind the Khan Yunus  killing and that there are more than 15 youth abduction cases in  Gaza over the past two weeks of which nine youths were killed.  Our sources in Damascus say that the question of the lack of  law and order in Gaza took four hours of discussion in the  alliance meetings. The killing of the DFLP member prompted the  formation of a committee to investigate the killing under Talal  Naji of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine--General  Command with the membership of DFLP and Hamas representatives.</p>

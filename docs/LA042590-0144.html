			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-AUTO CYCLIST IS STRUCK BY CAR, WALKS TO HOSPITAL  </P> <P> California environmentalist John Francis, who has shunned the use of  automobiles for nearly 20 years, was struck and injured by one as he bicycled  across town on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Francis stuck with his avoidance of motor vehicles and refused to board an  ambulance summoned by passers-by.  </P> <P> After confused paramedics secured his injured left arm and shoulder with a  sling, he cautiously walked about 15 blocks to the emergency room at Howard  University Medical Center.  </P> <P> Doctors there said he had no broken bones, but was suffering from strained  ligaments in his back and left shoulder.  </P> <P> The 44-year-old activist grabbed nationwide attention last weekend when he  spoke on Earth Day, breaking the silence he had kept since 1973 as part of his  personal environmental crusade.  </P> <P> Washington police said they ticketed Ruth Dial, the driver of the car that  struck Francis, for failing to yield the right-of-way. She allegedly cut in  front of Francis, sending him hurtling into her car and onto the pavement.  </P></p>

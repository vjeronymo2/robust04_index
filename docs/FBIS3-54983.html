He stressed "the National Army units had to involve in  fierce  defensive fighting and have managed to force the enemy out from  the occupied populated localities".    "In the first days of the new year they deterred the enemy's  attack in the Adgam direction near the Agdam regional center  seized in summer 1993. Successful counter-actions have resulted  in the destruction of seven tanks and two apcs. More than 200  soldiers of the enemy were killed, several villages were taken  under the national army control. There are no Armenian units in  these villages, but they are under constant shelling which  prevents the local population from returning home", he said.    The defence minister estimated as protracted position  fighting combat operations in the Azeri west, where the national  army units have crossed the Murovdag Ridge between the Azeri  south-west and north-west and continue to move towards the  Kelbajar region occupied in April 1993. The situation in the  Beylagan direction in the republic's south-west remains  complicated, as the Azeris are holding the line against the  attacking Armenian units.    According to the recent reports, the situation has  aggravated  in the north-western border Kazakh region. The latter was put  under rocket-artillery shelling from the Armenian Noyemberyan  region on Monday, which resulted in considerable destructions  and losses amongst civilians. The Azeris responded with the  suppression of several fire nests on the adjoining territory.    The general reported the capture of a major military storage  of the enemy in the Geranboy region located outside  Nagorno-Karabakh. According to him, the Armenians planed to use  the storage's arms in another large-scale offensive inside  Azerbaijan.    The minister is convinced combat operations on Azeri  territory could have been stopped long ago if no additional  materiel and personnel were sent from Armenian territory almost  every day. In January the Armenians moved reserves to the Agdam  area, where they had had only advanced security element. As a  result, the situation was considerably aggravated.</p>

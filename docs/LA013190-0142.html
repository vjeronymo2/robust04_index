			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> STUDENT DISCOVERS PIPE BOMB ON LOARA HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD  </P> <P> Investigators are trying to determine the origin of a pipe bomb found on the  Loara High School football field, authorities said today.  </P> <P> The bomb was discovered Tuesday afternoon by a student as he was walking across  the field, Anaheim Police Lt. John Haradon said.  </P> <P> In what police described as a dangerous move, the student picked up the bomb  and carried it to the school's administration office, located on the 1700 block  of West Cerritos Avenue. School staff then notified authorities.  </P> <P> "We figured someone had tried to set it off the night before and had left it  there," said Loara Principal Dr. Jerry Glenn.  </P> <P> Orange County Sheriff's Department bomb squad investigators called to the scene  by police disposed of the device, Haradon said. Sheriff's Lt. Bill Francis  described the pipe bomb as "a can full of powder with wires leading from both  sides." Glenn said the bomb was about 4 inches long. He said the student picked  up the dangerous device because he didn't know what it was.  </P></p>

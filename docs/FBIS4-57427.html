			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 18 May (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican legislators  today condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal to create  a multinational force in Latin America and invade Haiti, to  expel the military who rule that country.    Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Ramon Mota  Sanchez, chairman of the National Defense Committee, said Mexico  remains firm in its foreign policy, which considers inviolate  the self-determination of nations and the principle or  nonintervention. "I totally and absolutely disagree with a  proposal of this magnitude because it only shows us a  manifestation of the policy traditionally maintained by that  country, which pretends to act as an older brother" in Latin  America. He demanded that the neighboring northern country's  attitude be stopped "once and for all," and he expressed his  confidence that the firm and invariable Mexican position will be  stated in Mexico and various international forums.    Gabriel Jimenez Remus, parliamentary coordinator of the  opposition National Action Party (PAN), said it was absurd that  Clinton issued a proposal of this magnitude and, worse yet, is  trying to get Mexico to support him." He emphasized that Mexico  "has a firm policy on this issue and, therefore, all PAN members  and federal deputies condemn this request, which only proves  that this country insists on becoming judge or arbitrator of  everything that occurs in the world, particularly in Latin  America."    Ricardo Valero Recio Becerra, coordinator of the opposition  Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said his party will in  no way support such a petition. Valero, who is also secretary  of the Lower Chamber's Foreign Affairs Committee, said the U.S.  policy "is no longer fit for our times." He added:  Nevertheless, it reminds us of the Inter-American Peace Force  that was created in the 1960's and whose activities were very  dangerous for the region. He considered it worrisome that the  United States make such a proposal given the situation of  uncertainty which prevails in Haiti and which shall undoubtedly  affect the region's stability.    The U.S. Government, through its Department of State, has  asked Latin American nations to endorse an armed action on the  Caribbean island, to replace the Haitian military government,  but apparently only Uruguay and Argentina have endorsed the  proposal.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Securitisation BRITAIN'S BANKS are showing strong interest in 'securitisation'. The process, common in the US, involves selling packages of mortgages, personal loans and the like to third-party investors in the form of bonds. Yesterday's Pounds 280m issue of securitised personal loans by Barclays Bank followed a Pounds 300m issue of mortgaged-backed loans by National Westminster Bank last week. It is easy to see the advantage to financial institutions of selling on their loans. Securitisation shifts the risk of default to the new investors, so freeing up capital which banks can use to make other loans. But is the process also beneficial to borrowers and the wider economy? Some borrowers may experience an initial queasiness at the thought that the ultimate owner of their mortgage is not the high street bank from which they originally borrowed but an anonymous Belgian dentist or multinational oil company. Could the new owners jack up interest rates or take a tougher line in the case of arrears? Such concerns are unfounded. Under a typical securitisation deal, the original lender continues to manage the relationship with the borrower, and commits itself to treating securitised loans in exactly the same way as ordinary loans. A Barclays or a NatWest would have no incentive to crack down especially hard on borrowers whose loans it had securitised as that would damage its reputation without enhancing profits. Another concern is that securitisation may simply be a clever piece of financial engineering, artificially driven by regulation. The reason for being suspicious is that the banks' main motive for securitisation is to get loans off their balance sheets and hence avoid onerous capital adequacy requirements imposed by the Bank of England. While it is impossible to dismiss this concern entirely, the Bank's capital adequacy requirements seems sufficiently flexible to avoid such capital market distortions. Moreover, securitisation could provide real macroeconomic benefits by promoting a more efficient capital market. Traditionally, banks both originate loans and carry the risks associated with them. Investors, on the other hand, have no way of investing directly in mortgages or other personal loans. The best alternative is to invest in a bank, but that carries all sorts of other risks they may not wish to bear. Securitisation allows banks to concentrate on originating loans and the ultimate investors to select more precisely the type of assets they wish to buy. The overall upshot could be lower capital costs and a greater pooling of risk.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Alexanders profits skid to Pounds 701,000 ALEXANDERS Holdings, the largest Ford main dealer in Scotland, finished the year to September 30 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 701,000, compared to Pounds 1.9m previously. As promised at the halfway stage, the dividend is held at 1p. Earnings per share have fallen from 3.56p to 1.18p. Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, chairwoman, said the year had been characterised by the deep recession and record bankruptcies, many in the motor sector. Group sales fell to Pounds 85.4m (Pounds 92.7m). However, the group continued to pursue a progressive medium term strategy. That was evidenced by the enhancement of facilities at Edinburgh and Kirkintilloch, and the provision of new premises at Greenock. She said additional directors would be appointed in 1992, and that would represent the next key phase in the business strategy and plan to optimise profit and growth as the economy recovers. Since almost doubling its profit to Pounds 1.73m in the year 1987-88 the group has shown a steady increase. The setback this year follows a Pounds 500,000 reduction at the halfway stage.</p>

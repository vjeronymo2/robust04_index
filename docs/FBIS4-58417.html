			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, 3 May (AFP)--The radical Islamic  Resistance Movement Hamas said Tuesday [3 May] it was not bound  by agreements between Israel and the PLO.    In a statement to AFP here, Hamas denounced the self-rule  deal for Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West  Bank town of Jericho, which is due to be signed Wednesday in  Cairo.    The accord was "contrary to the wishes of the Palestinian  people," the statement said.    Hamas, which has its stronghold within the occupied  territories, has claimed two recent suicide bombing attacks  within Israel in which 13 Israelis were killed.    The statement also rejected an accord on the future economic  relations between the two sides signed in Paris on April 29,  saying it was the start of "Zionist hegemony in the region."</p>

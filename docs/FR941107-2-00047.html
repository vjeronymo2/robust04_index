We preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.03 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the period January 1, 1992, through December 31, 1992. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 26960, May 6, 1993), the following events have occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 13, 1993, we issued a questionnaire to the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C., concerning the subsidy programs under review. We received a response from the Government of Brazil (GOB) on December 29, 1993, on behalf of itself and the respondent's companies. After reviewing the GOB's response, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to the GOB on January 28, 1994. We received a supplemental response from the GOB on February 23, 1994. From March 7 to 18, 1994, we verified the government and companies' responses in Brazil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Review <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The merchandise subject to this review is hydrogenated castor oil and 12-hydroxystearic acid. Imports of these products are currently classifiable under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS'') subheadings: 1516.20.90 and 1519.19.40. Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The review covers six companies, the period January 1 through December 31, 1992, and 12 programs: (1) Preferential Export Financing under Resolution 950/1009; (2) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings; (3) Preferential Export Financing Under CIC&hyph;OPCRE 6&hyph;2&hyph;6; (4) Preferential Financing for Industrial Enterprises by the Bank of Brazil; (5) Reduction of Industrial Products Tax (IPI) and Import Duties Under Decreto No. 77.065 through BEFIEX; (6) Preferential Financing for National Trading Companies under Resolution 883 of the Banco Central do Brasil; (7) Accelerated Depreciation for Brazilian-Made Capital Goods; (8) Preferential Financing under Resolution 68 through FINEX; (9) Preferential Financing under Resolution 578/83 through FUNPAR; (10) Preferential Financing under Resolution 579/83 through PROEX and PROSIM; (11) Preferential Financing for the Storage of Merchandise Destined for Export under Resolution 330/Portaria 130 of the Banco Central do Brasil; and (12) Green Yellow Drawback (Portaria 68/83). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Calculation Methodology for Assessment and Cash Deposit Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating the benefits received during the review period, we followed the methodology described in 19 CFR 355.20(d)(1) (53 FR 52325, December 27, 1988). Using this methodology we calculated a country-wide rate of 0.03 percent which is de minimis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this program, exporters of the subject merchandise were eligible for an exemption from income tax on the portion of their profits attributable to exports. On April 12, 1990, Decree Law 8,034 eliminated this exemption by establishing a 30 percent income tax rate for export profits, which equaled the normal corporate income tax rate. Boley, however, was authorized to use the income tax exemption on export earnings under the terms of a contract with the Commission for the Granting of Fiscal Benefits to Special Export Programs (BEFIEX) until its contract expired. Therefore, despite the fact that the income tax exemption for export earnings was eliminated, Boley received residual benefits from the program during the review period. No other company under review used this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To calculate the income tax savings realized by Boley during the review period, we multiplied the income tax deduction taken by the firm under this program by 30 percent, the corporate income tax rate during the review period. We then used the amount of Boley's income tax savings to calculate a country-wide rate. We calculated the country-wide rate by dividing the total income tax savings realized by Boley by the total exports of all products by all of the companies under review. On this basis, we calculated a subsidy rate of 0.03 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Programs Preliminarily Found To Be Terminated <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We examined the following programs and preliminarily determine these programs to be terminated. Further, we verified that the respondents did not receive any residual benefits under them during the period of review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a.

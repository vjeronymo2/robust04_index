			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The UN secretary general's  envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, arrived in Cairo this evening  for a visit as part of his consultations and efforts to stop the  fighting in Yemen.    President Husni Mubarak is scheduled to receive the UN envoy  to discuss the latest developments of the Yemeni crisis and the  tense situation there.    Brahimi will also meet Arab League Secretary General Dr.  'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to follow up his consultations on the  crisis.    In an arrival statement, Brahimi voiced his profound regret  at the continuation of fighting in Yemen and at not  consolidating Security Council Resolution 924 with a cease-fire  between the rival parties. He confirmed that his efforts are  continuing to achieve this goal.    He said that he submitted a proposal to the brothers in  north  and south Yemen yesterday and today that each side appoint its  representatives to discuss setting up a mechanism to consolidate  and supervise a cease-fire accord and that a meeting be held  between these parties in Cairo if they agree.    He explained that the proposal was the result of various  talks and counterproposals from the two sides during which they  accepted the idea of setting up this mechanism and agreed that  the meeting be held in one of the Arab capitals, including  Cairo. The mechanism, he added, should begin with a joint  military committee made up of representatives from Arab and  other countries.    He noted that the two parties' stances are still far apart  and that we are trying to establish an efficient groundwork to  start direct talks. He said his mission took 15 days because  the two sides engaged in proposals and counterproposals. He  added: We must sit and explore the possibility of reconciling  the two sides and reaching an agreement that might not be  implemented.    The UN envoy expressed his hope that firing will stop  immediately if the brothers in Yemen agree on this idea. He  said that if an agreement is not reached or if the brothers in  Yemen feel that such a meeting is not suitable at present, he  will move on to New York after completing his consultations in  Cairo.    Brahimi concluded his statement by saying that the brothers  in south Yemen informed him of their consent to the proposal and  that he is awaiting a response from the brothers in north Yemen,  which he expects to receive tonight or tomorrow morning,  Saturday.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSIDER ;  </P> <P> KEEPING THINGS UP TO DATE IN KENNEBUNKPORT;  </P> <P> WHEN THE PRESIDENT TRAVELS TO MAINE, AN AMAZING ARRAY OF COMMUNICATIONS  GADGETRY GOES WITH HIM.  </P> <P> This sleepy seacoast village may not seem like the sort of place where the  President of the United States can keep abreast of the crisis in the Middle  East, but during times like this it frequently serves as Command Central.  </P> <P> The "White House" -- as all of its modern-day occupants have found -- isn't  just a term to describe the Greek Revival mansion in which the President lives.  It is a bureaucratic, movable feast that the President takes with him wherever  he goes.  </P> <P> But whether it's the "Western White House" of Ronald Reagan or the  "Kennebunkport White House" of George Bush, the portable banquet comes with  secure telephones, secure faxes and aides who quietly say, "Mr. President, we  have the prime minister on the line. . . . "  </P> <P> In the case of President Bush, that dazzling array of electronic accouterments  gets the maximum test -- particularly in times of crisis.  </P> <P> "Haven't you seen the telephone in my golf cart? Or boat? Word of honor," Bush  said to reporters on his way up here as he sought to quell any concerns that he  might be out of touch far from Washington in the northeast corner of the  nation.  </P> <P> The President wasn't kidding.  </P> <P> Within hours after he arrived here on Aug. 10, the White House put out the word  that Bush had just finished going over an Arab League statement with his  national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, in Washington -- via a cellular  telephone aboard his speedboat, Fidelity.  </P> <P> At 5:30 a.m. each day, while most people are asleep -- or perhaps groping for  their morning coffee -- Bush says he is reaching for a telephone to call the  White House situation room in Washington for an early update on overnight  developments in Iraq.  </P> <P> Early one morning last week, Bush received his daily national security briefing  aboard the Coast Guard cutter Monomoy, bobbing on the Atlantic swells -- from  his deputy national security adviser, Robert M. Gates.  </P> <P> And especially during times of international crisis, the wires -- or telephone  circuits -- here are buzzing all day. "George Bush's first instinct is to get  on the phone and call around," says a former White House aide who has watched  the President closely.  </P> <P> Indeed, since arriving in Kennebunkport, the President has spoken by telephone  with about a dozen foreign leaders. And he has welcomed several others to his  stone-and-frame home here for lengthy conversations about the gulf.  </P> <P> The briefing on the Monomoy and the telephone calls on the Fidelity certainly  were attention-grabbers, but they reflected a point the White House has taken  considerable pains to make during the three weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait:  Although critics have contended that Bush should be shepherding the crisis from  Washington, aides say he is just as closely in touch in Kennebunkport as he  would be in the Oval Office or in the Situation Room.  </P> <P> Keeping the President in touch is the work of an obscure branch of the Army  Signal Corps known as the White House Communications Agency.  </P> <P> Somewhere in a rented home in Kennebunkport, the unit has set up a switchboard  that essentially parallels the communications facilities in the White House  both in its power and in its capability.  </P> <P> Whenever the President ventures beyond Walker's Point -- the 11-acre Bush  family compound that juts out into the Atlantic -- a ubiquitous black Chevy van  bedecked with high-powered antennas quietly follows, ready to send and receive  signals worldwide.  </P> <P> Here's the van, at the very end of a presidential motorcade, wending its way  from Walker's Point to the Cape Arundel Golf Club. There it is, engine at idle,  parked to the side of the road as the President jogs down a dirt path.  </P> <P> Thomas C. Griscom, a former assistant to Reagan, concedes that the notion that  a President can stay in touch when he's far away from Washington is difficult  for some people to swallow.  </P> <P> "A lot of people have a hard time accepting the fact you can take the White  House on the road," Griscom says.  </P> <P> But he insists that "it's not difficult at all to provide the logistic support"  outside Washington. Indeed, in recent years, White House technicians have set  up "fully functional" communications facilities in such unlikely places as  Moscow and Beijing.  </P> <P> It wasn't always that way. A few years ago, before the invention of secure  facsimile machines, the White House used to dispatch airplanes, laden with  packages of Very Important Papers for the Commander in Chief, whenever a  President went to places such as Kennebunkport.  </P> <P> Even during the Reagan and Richard M. Nixon years, such cross-country flights  were not uncommon.  </P> <P> But today, there is less need for such courier flights because fax machines can  transmit classified documents without danger that the equipment can be tapped.  </P> <P> Still, all is not perfect.  </P> <P> When it became clear that Bush would be spending a lot of time here, White  House advance personnel went looking for a nearby hotel to use for office  space. They settled on the Nonantum, which has broad picture windows  overlooking the Kennebunk River and the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Almost as soon as they had installed their communications gear, however, the  security experts discovered that their voices could be picked up by boats at  sea with microphones that are sensitive enough to translate the vibrations from  the window glass back into sound.  </P> <P> So, they're worried that while Bush may be staying in touch with his staff --  and with prime ministers around the globe -- the Kennebunkport White House may  also be inadvertently transmitting to sailors aboard a Soviet listening-vessel  just beyond the U.S. territorial limits.  </P> <P> Stay tuned.  </P></p>

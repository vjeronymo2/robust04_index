			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US, Japan 'dominate in Pacific' ASIA-PACIFIC trade issues will be dominated by the US and Japan, with other countries likely to be pawns in the struggle between the region's two economic superpowers, delegates said yesterday at the Indonesia, Asia-Pacific and the New World Order conference on the Indonesian island of Bali, reports William Keeling at Nusa Dua, Bali. Dr Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in the US, said Washington showed 'strong support' for the Asian Pacific Economic Community (Apec), which groups the US, Japan and most east Asian nations. But he backed the US government in accusing Japan of establishing 'very pervasive impediments to a lot of its markets. The global affect of Japan's market access problems. . . undercuts the prospects of maintaining an open trading system,' Dr Bergsten warned. In response, Japanese delegates criticised US insistence that Tokyo provide foreign companies a minimum market share in sectors such as that of semiconductors. 'It's a very dangerous situation where American regulators judge products to be competitive,' noted Mr Kazuo Nukazawa, managing director of the Japan Federation of Economic Organisations. Other Asian delegates viewed US support of Apec as an attempt to enlist Asian support in Washington's trade campaign against Tokyo. While remaining sceptical of US intentions, however, they noted any improvement in market access to Japan would benefit other east Asian countries. Most delegates backed the informal meeting of Apec heads of state proposed by President Bill Clinton for Seattle in September. But they argued strongly against the organisation, which established its secretariat in Singapore this year, having any supra-national powers. Delegates said it was premature for Asia-Pacific to be viewed as an homogeneous economic region. These divisions, however, have done little to calm the European Community's fears that Apec could emerge as a protectionist regional trade bloc. 'An Asian-Pacific preferential area would look like an American trade bloc aimed at the (European) Community,' said Mr Jim Rollo, director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in the UK. Some delegates argued that regional trade associations could provide the catalyst for freer international trade, but the history of the EC showed that, despite the best intentions, large regional trade groupings could drift toward protectionism, Mr Rollo said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Prytula: "They Would No Longer Give a </F> Wooden Coupon for Yevgeniy Saburov in the Crimea"]    [Text] Sevastopol--Although the new Crimean  authorities strive to keep all of their intrigues and conflicts  secret, the reverberations of palace quarrels have been sending  big ripples through the closed doors of offices, disturbing the  residents of the Crimea who are stupefied by solar and political  heat. There is ever more talk about the top personalities of the  Crimean Government, President Yuriy Meshkov and Prime Minister  Yevgeniy Saburov whom he brought in from Moscow, being at each  other's throats, and the Crimea getting a new government  soon.    The economist Yevgeniy Saburov from Moscow, who has not been  recognized or appreciated in his state, ended up in the Crimea  on a recommendation by Sergey Stankevich, a friend and adviser  of Yuriy Meshkov. To be sure, local observers believe that  Stankevich is a friend of the Republican Movement of the Crimea  chief, insofar as the latter needs a democratic image. Saburov  also was Meshkov's choice because he was born in Yalta. Having  just embarked on his career as a deputy prime minister of the  Crimean Government, Saburov felt major resistance from Meshkov's  most immediate entourage, and especially from Valeriy  Grishenkov, the chief of the president's staff, who jealously  and diligently protected the Crimean president against the  "pernicious" influence of the deputy prime minister. Besides,  Yevgeniy Saburov publicly proclaimed his loyalty to Kiev a few  times and stated that, despite his Russianness, he was against  the redrawing of borders.    On every occasion, the specialist from Moscow indicated that  he intends to carry out economic reforms. Within the framework  of these reformist efforts, Yevgeniy Saburov canceled bread  subsidies on the eve of an election and prepared an edict to the  effect that the Ukrainian karbovanets is the sole legal tender  in the territory of the Crimea, which was later signed by the  president of the autonomous republic. Of course, this is not by  any means in line with the pre-election promises of Yuriy  Meshkov about the prompt introduction of a ruble zone on the  peninsula. Differences and behind-the-scenes skirmishes between  Saburov's team and the president's staff headed by Viktor [as  published] Grishenkov, a former colonel of the USSR KGB, ended  in the disbandment of the entire staff and the dismissal of  almost all of his associates. Saburov's victory was complete:  Yet another Muscovite, Viktor Minin, was appointed to the  position of minister for the issues of state service (in fact,  the administration of the government and the president). At a  meeting with journalists, Minin stated that his main task is to  be a buffer between Meshkov and Saburov and to smooth over  differences between them. If nothing else, the fact of the  cancellation by Meshkov of the already mentioned directive of  the deputy prime minister to raise prices for bread and bread  products indicates that such differences do exist and are quite  serious. Saburov responded sharply to this action of the  president: "Populism never does any good, no matter by what  political motives it is guided."    For now, Yuriy Meshkov will tolerate Saburov for as long as  he and his team are needed. However, the Crimean president meets  and consults more readily and with greater pleasure with Oleg  Rumyantsev, the former head of the Constitutional Commission of  the Russian Federation and a deputy of the former Supreme Soviet  of Russia, who has promised to develop a concept for the state  and legal buildup of the Republic of Crimea. Commenting on these  contacts of the leader of the autonomous republic, Yevgeniy  Saburov jealously stated to journalists that as a politician,  Oleg Rumyantsev does not amount to anything and nobody reckons  with him in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that the  Russian advisers of the Crimean president have resolved to  transplant the infighting between liberals (Saburov) and  national-patriots (Rumyantsev) in Moscow to the Crimea.    Nonetheless, despite the dissimilarity of the views of  Meshkov and Saburov and the avowed loyalty of the Crimean deputy  prime minister to Kiev, we should not make him into some kind of  a Ukrainophile. It is just that he is much more sensible than  Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov combined. The Crimea now  finds itself at ground zero in a fight among Russian clans for  influence on the peninsula, and Saburov's main task is to ensure  the economic expansion and establishment of specifically his  clan (Luzhkov, Shokhin, Stankevich) in the Crimea. To this end,  political stability is needed first of all in the autonomous  republic. Meshkov's failure to understand this is what brings  about misunderstandings between him and his deputy prime  minister. Rumors to the effect that these differences will soon  be brought to an end are circulating in Simferopol. It appears  that the days of the semi-Crimean and semi-Muscovite government  of Yevgeniy Saburov are numbered, primarily because anti-Saburov  sentiment prevails among the members of the Russia ruling  faction of the Supreme Council of the Crimea. Who will come to  take his place--Rumyantsev or Baburin? Or is it Zhirinovskiy? To  be sure, they have enough such characters of their own here.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Opposition pens have been mobilized to criticize the  new law concerning village mayors and chiefs and to try to  depict this law to the public as backsliding from democracy,  because it has decided to shift from the system of mayoral  election to mayoral appointment.    These pens have expressed their apprehension that the new  method will open the door to favoritism in selection and will  lead to village isntability and that the appointed mayor will  owe his loyalty to the government alone because the government  is the party that appoints him.    These people who have become accustomed to shuffling the  cards are really amazing. The village mayor and chief are two  administrative officials serving security. Therefore, they have  no parliamentary capacity.    Because democracy means government of the people by the  people through their deputies and because the village mayor and  the village chief are two public employees, exactly like a  precinct commander or a police station chief, one is required to  make a complete distinction between democracy and a civil  service job whose main task is to preserve security and  stability.    There is absolutely no connection between village mayors and  chiefs (both of whom are civil servants) and democracy. If the  method of election had been embraced in the past, then a mistake  was made and this mistake must be corrected.    The village chief and mayor do not rule. The elected local  council does. The chief and mayor are civil servants appointed  by the Ministry of Interior to preserve public security. Is a  civil servant chosen by election?    Moreover, the mayoral election process itself has not been  taking place in a sound manner that reflects a village's wish.  Rather, the process has been governed by clannishness and by  strong influences, not to mention the rancors, disputes, and  conflicts to which mayoral elections have led and which pose a  threat to village security. Therefore, appointment will  certainly lead to stability and security, and not vice versa.    Besides, how can one say that appointment will lead to  favoritism and to the selection of favorites, and not the right  people? There are specific controls and rules that require that  those who seek the position of village mayor or village chief  meet certain general prerequisites. Furthermore, special  conditions are established to compare candidates and there are  three committees that participate in the selection process to  ensure that the best are selected. In addition, the opportunity  to contest an appointment is available.    Is it mpt strange that the opposition would criticize a  mayor's response to government demands and his cooperation with  the various government agencies? Are the village mayor and  village chief not public employees appointed by the government?  Does the government work for anything other than the masses'  interest?    The opposition seeks to depict the government as a party  that  always stands in the way of the people's wishes and interests.  This is untrue and illogical and it reflects illwill.    Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi has underlined  a noteworthy point in the new village mayors and chiefs law,  namely that the mayoral election system does not guarantee the  mayor's continued presence in his village in order to carry out  his duties. Most mayors have lived in provincial capitals,  contenting themselves with the honor of the position. Meanwhile,  villagers had to go to the mayors wherever the latter happened  to live. In addition, an elected mayor did not receive an  adequate monetary recompense to help him devote his time to the  duty of the mayoralty. This contrasts with the appointment  system which establishes a monthly recompense of 150 pounds  which, along with the minimum income he receives by law, will  help the mayor devote his full time to the duties of the job.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Taiwan tightens investment rules for foreigners TAIWAN is tightening its screening of foreign investment applications and bids for infrastructure contracts to block projects by companies with large mainland Chinese shareholdings, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'We are screening foreign investment applications prudently to prevent Communist Chinese capital from slipping through,' said Mr Chen Ming-pang, secretary-general of the government's Investment Commission. Foreign companies would be ordered to withdraw existing investments in Taiwan if they were found to have major Chinese shareholdings. Companies with big Chinese investments will also be blocked from bidding for contracts under Taiwan's six-year, Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn) development plan, economics ministry officials said. Taiwan has curbed economic contacts with China since the end of the civil war in 1949. Under a law passed in July, companies with combined Chinese shareholdings of more than 20 per cent are banned from investing on the island. Local newspapers have said Chinese capital is avoiding restrictions, entering Taiwan through Chinese-invested companies in third countries.</p>

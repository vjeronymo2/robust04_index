			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Gardening: Sweet dream on a philosopher's lawn - Robin Lane Fox asks if the riot of blooms in his garden is just a glorious illusion SEVERAL YEARS ago, I spent a long, hot summer examining the cream of Oxford's young intelligences with the help of two extremely respected philosophers. We sweated and agonised; we tried to turn Bs into As; meanwhile, outside the pseudo-Gothic windows, sunlight fell in patterns on those hallmarks of academic gardening, an immaculate sward of lawn and beds of modern roses with vermilion flowers. When at last we finished, I asked the philosophers the plain man's question: of all the dozens of questions which you have set, which was the hardest to answer? After six weeks' hard labour, they agreed with hardly a pause. The question: how can we be sure we are not dreaming? How not, O Socrates? I gave the plain man's response: that our non-dream world is more orderly and most of its events are effects of more or less obvious causes, even when people kick over the traces, fall in love, or lend far too much money to Olympia &amp; York. No, they corrected me, we might be dreaming orderly dreams, not just those dreams of tea with the royal family, which are supposed to be an English favourite, but dreams here and now of reading the FT. I have been haunted by this awful question. It surfaces in becalmed committee meetings, or during breakdowns on the London Underground, or when Britain's city councils start competing for the best in bloom. This week, it has returned with unanswerable force: am I living in accelerated time while a film of summer is being run too fast before my eyes? Gardens have been dreamy but the sequence has gone mad. Is it May, June, or time for Wimbledon, and why is everything happening here at once? There has never been a year like this, not in my horticultural memory, which goes back to 1956. Ten days ago, there were tulips and the buttercups were mildly premature; wallflowers were drawing to an early close; and narcissi were reassuring non-gardeners that they could grow something pretty to round off spring. In a rush, in a bound, summer has been rampant. Showers of roses have started to open before the lilacs have begun to fade; the dianthus of late June are showing colour. On May 20 I woke up, or re-entered dreamland, and found pale yellow day lilies in flower; sweet philadelphus became impatient and on the bank holiday joined them. Not until the last fortnight in June do I usually turn to the best of all pink roses, the old-fashioned Fantin Latour. Already, it is open, with spring's Blue-eyed Mary still out beneath it. Day by day, the sequence has become crazier, cramming six weeks into one with ominous warnings of a future climate change. Green observers have warned that we will know when the world starts to warm and we have punctured the atmosphere because the bluebell woods in Britain will be the first casualties, hating the new warmth. They have not gone, this year, but they have gone into fast-forward, flowering two weeks earlier than usual. After the first primeval sleep, so the poet Keats tells us, Adam awoke and found truth. On bank holiday, Lane Fox was dreaming and awoke to find it mid-summer. Portland roses seemed to be tumbling beside delphiniums; the lavender buds are showing a purple colour beside the greengage iris graminea, which is fighting for its usual place in the button-hole during the final week of May. Is it, perhaps, a personalised dream, and has something simply gone wrong with me? Here, great philosophers are helpful: private worlds, they tell us, cannot be communicated in language. Worried that I might be trapped in a private net, I have been cross-communicating and verifying sensations. Are you, too, seeing rivers of laburnum among rose Mme Alfred Carriere, and scenting orange blossom as the flowers fade on Solomon's Seal? If it is all a dream, it seems to be a public epidemic in which dandelions have remained a nightmare and there is always the harsh reality of mowing the grass twice weekly. Perhaps it looked this way in Paradise, but the garden owner then stopped the film. He froze it, perhaps, in just such a rush when the first fresh greens of the year were present. Does this sudden hint of Paradise matter in 1992? Sleep-walking, I am telling myself that I must absorb it at every moment, economise on work, see it all before the season has disappeared in seven days. It is so extraordinary that perhaps it can be forgiven; meanwhile, I am sowing a fresh round of annuals for late summer, tall white tobacco plants and the new white cosmos daisy called Sonata. Sweet dreams are fine but, when we come down to earth in mid-June, there will have to be some young plants coming on to carry us into October. Unless, that is, the Heavenly Director changes the score once more and sends a frost on Derby day to remind us we are British. There would be nothing better to wake us from this philosophic dreaminess than a short, sharp shock.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: SOAP AND SANDING HELP PAINT STICK TO CONCRETE  </P> <P> QUESTION: How can I get paint to stick to the high-traffic areas on our  concrete front porch?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Epoxy, polyurethane and acrylic paints wear much better than oil and  alkyd paints on concrete. Before applying a water-resistant paint, clean and  roughen the surface. Use a trisodium phosphate solution or strong detergent to  scrub the floor.  </P> <P> Sanding with coarse emery paper may be required to give the old surface a rough  texture for good paint bonding. Test-paint a small area to make sure the new  paint will adhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Check Out Plywood Before Reroofing  </P> <P> Q: My 25-year-old house needs reroofing and I plan to do the job myself. I  would like to lay new shingles over the old ones. However, the builder  apparently skimped on the roof sheathing. Instead of the usual one-half-inch  thick exterior grade plywood, he used three-eighth-inch sheets. Also, he nailed  the shingles directly to the sheathing without putting down a layer of building  paper.  </P> <P> Can I add a second layer of shingles? Or would this be too heavy for the  three-eighth-inch plywood, considering there can be a foot of snow on the roof  in the winter?  </P> <P> A: The builder didn't necessarily skimp on the roof sheathing. The required  thickness depends on the rafter spacing, the grade of the plywood and the  direction of its face grain.  </P> <P> Look for the APA stamp of the American Plywood Assn. on the exposed underside  of the plywood for the identification index. The index contains two numbers  such as 20-0 or 32-16.  </P> <P> The left-hand number represents the maximum recommended spacing in inches  between rafters when the face grain of the panel runs at right angles to the  rafters. If the rafter spacing is not greater than 24 inches, your sheathing is  adequate.  </P> <P> It would be sensible to check with your local building department about a  second layer. If your town allows only one layer, you'll have to tear off the  existing shingles.  </P> <P> The builder did skimp on building paper. The paper serves as a backup water  barrier between the shingles and the sheathing if shingles are lifted, damaged  or torn off by winds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Antifreeze Can Prevent Damage to Water Pipes  </P> <P> Q: I have a second home in Upstate New York and plan to put in an oil-fired  central heating system for my water. I am not there all the time, the water  pipes are drained and the traps filled with antifreeze. So, I was wondering if  I could protect the water-heating pipes by using the proper mixture of nontoxic  antifreeze and water. Can you think of any problems that may occur?  </P> <P> A: There are a few things you should do before adding antifreeze to the house's  plumbing system. First, if the house doesn't have one already, add a back-flow  preventer on the water feed line. This prevents the antifreeze from  contaminating the house's potable water supply.  </P> <P> Next, determine how much antifreeze to add to the system. To do this, estimate  the volume of water in the house's pipes and then add the correct ratio of  antifreeze.  </P> <P> A free booklet by the Hydronics Institute has information to help you determine  the pipe's volume and other useful tips. Send a letter with a self-addressed,  stamped envelope to: Hydronics Institute, 35 Russo Place, Berkeley Heights,  N.J. 07922. Ask for "Technical Topics Number 2A."  </P></p>

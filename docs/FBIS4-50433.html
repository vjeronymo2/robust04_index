			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 14 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Prices are  currently one of the greatest concerns of the Chinese people.  To further tighten price management, concerned departments are  planning to continue increasing the force of regulation and  control. Some relevant measures are expected to be unveiled  around June and July.    These measures are understood to include: First, strict  controls over the scale of fixed-asset investment, firmly  cutting and stopping a number of construction projects, no more  approval this year for large and medium-sized infrastructure  projects not listed in the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," and strict  controls over high-class office buildings, villas, and upmarket  entertainment facilities.    Second, strict control over the excessive growth of  consumption funds. There are plans to slow down the growth rate  of consumption funds by reducing corporate consumption power  with methods such as strengthening the finances of enterprises  and nonprofit-making institutions and taxation and controlling  and cutting back administrative expenditure, while turning the  purchasing power and consumption of urban and rural residents  into savings and mid and long-term investment.    Third, make great efforts to pursue agriculture and "food  basket" projects, increase the cultivated area for major  agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, and ensure  that materials and funds supporting agriculture reach their  destination.    Fourth, make further efforts at building and perfecting  means  to regulate and control prices and markets, including reserve  systems for several key commodities and a risk fund system in  order to increase the state's regulatory and control powers.    Fifth, arrange well this year's production and supply of key  commodities. To stabilize grain and oil prices, the state will,  if necessary, release quantities of reserve grain and oil.    Furthermore, the State Planning Commission is drafting rules  and regulations against profiteering.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / 'Talking shop' for industry AN ARRAY OF leading bankers, civil servants and industrialists gathered at Mansion House in the City yesterday to launch a new foundation for the study of manufacturing and industry. Sir Trevor Holdsworth, its chairman, said the foundation was a self-confessed talking shop 'because the future of Britain's manufacturing industry is a subject which deserves to be talked about'. He likened the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry to similar bodies studying foreign policy, defence and social issues. But he said that, while they were concerned with spending money, the foundation would focus on the basics of wealth creation. Launching the foundation, Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said it could be 'a unique source of debate and a valued sponsor of research' on the future of Britain's manufacturing industry. The foundation has attracted more than Pounds 200,000 in funding including Pounds 150,000 from founding corporate sponsors and Pounds 50,000 a year for three years from the Comino Foundation, an educational charity. It plans to hold monthly meetings, lectures and seminars. The inaugural lecture will be in mid November. Four principal areas of research have been highlighted: culture; managerial and economic policy; the role of industry in society; and the fostering of common objectives between industry, the City, government and universities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- The Czech Parliamentary  Agricultural Committee sent a letter to its Slovak counterpart  body today requesting that it push for the cancellation of the  requirement that food products imported into Slovakia carry a  Slovak quality certificate.    Slovakia introduced the requirement unilaterally and with  only one day's notice on February 11.    In the letter chairman of the Czech Parliamentary  Agricultural Committee Jan Cerny told Pavel Koncos that the new  measure "quite clearly discriminates against Czech exporters of  food products."    The move also seriously interfered with the functioning of  the customs union between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, he  said, because the quality norms of both countries were the same  and because the basis of any customs union was mutual  recognition of the other state's laboratory analysis and  certification.    Cerny stated that he hoped the Slovak Parliamentary  Agricultural Committee would contribute to the requirement being  revoked or to the drawing up of an agreement in the interests of  preserving the customs union.</p>

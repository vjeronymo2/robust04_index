			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Theme park convictions upheld Three businessmen jailed for fraud after the longest criminal trial in English legal history failed yesterday in appeals against their convictions. The Court of Appeal rejected argument that the 253-day Brittania Park trial was so long and complex that the jury must have been unable to concentrate sufficiently to reach a safe and satisfactory verdict. Mr Peter Kellard, Mr Edward Dwyer and Mr John Wright, former chairman of the Derbyshire theme park, were convicted in 1992 of offences including fraudulent trading.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHING THAT BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL;  </P> <P> FEMALES SUFFER MORE IN MOSTLY WHITE SOCIAL SETTINGS  </P> <P> Lenora Terrance has spent considerable time worrying about her oldest  daughter's senior prom.  </P> <P> She thinks about what type of dress 16-year-old Misty will wear next year,  questions just how it will fit and envisions the perfect hairstyle for that  special night.  </P> <P> But most of all, she worries whether her daughter will even have a date.  </P> <P> Misty is one of only 20 black students who attend Brea-Olinda High School, and  as one of 14 black girls in comparison to six black males, she faces the  difficult situation of rarely getting asked out on dates.  </P> <P> "In a way I am grateful she's not dating that much with so many things  happening," Terrance said. "But I worry she's missing out on some of the  wonderful things about growing up."  </P> <P> Counselors and psychologists both agree that black females often suffer the  most socially when they are in a predominantly white environment.  </P> <P> "Black women as a rule are not typically considered beautiful by the American  public," said Phyl Robinson, an Anaheim-based psychologist. "Long blond hair  and blues eyes are posted everywhere in magazines and television as an example  of what beautiful should look like. Black women don't fit that image."  </P> <P> Though the current Miss America and Miss USA are both black, Robinson said they  are the exception rather than the rule. She added that ebony skin and medium to  short hair for the most part isn't attractive to men of other racial groups and  many times not even to black men.  </P> <P> "Some black males tend to also buy into the blond-hair stereotype that is  everywhere for all to see, despite the fact their mothers and sisters are  black," Robinson said. "And in addition to that it has always been more  acceptable for a black man to date a white woman. For many black men, it gives  them a feeling that they've accomplished something grand by going outside the  race for a mate."  </P> <P> Misty, who is in her junior year at Brea, says she is frustrated because the  few black boys at her school mostly date white girls, leaving her at home most  Saturday nights.  </P> <P> "I am bothered by it a lot," she said. "Black guys seem to think white girls  have more going for them or something and white guys hardly notice me."  </P> <P> From time to time, the family has considered moving from their comfortable Brea  home to a more ethnically mixed neighborhood. "It's something we considered  because we want our kids to get the best experience possible in everything,"  said Chris Terrance Jr., an insurance claims adjuster who was transferred here  from Washington state. "They are getting a good education here but there is  more to high school than that. I'd like for Misty and our younger daughter to  have an opportunity to meet and see a variety of people."  </P> <P> In an effort to rectify the problem, the family recently became involved with a  variety of Orange County black organizations, including the Orange County Black  Actors Theater and a black church in Santa Ana where they hope Misty will meet  a young man her age.  </P> <P> "Prom is a very important occasion in a young lady's life," said Lenora  Terrance. "Our daughters shouldn't have to miss out on that just because some  people don't realize how beautiful black is."  </P></p>

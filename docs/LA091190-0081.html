			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELMS PUTS STAMP ON TROOP BILL  </P> <P> The Senate voted Monday to give free mailing privileges to U.S. troops in Saudi  Arabia, but only after Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) edged out plans by Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) to sponsor the legislation.  </P> <P> Cranston had announced in a press release that he planned to offer such a  measure today, after returning from a trip to the Middle East and a stopover in  California.  </P> <P> The senator said he had been asked by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of  U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, for "help in getting this morale boost for his  troops."  </P> <P> But Helms, who also was on the trip with Cranston, beat the Californian to the  punch in a classic display of congressional one-upmanship.  </P> <P> Helms offered his free-mail amendment to the Postal Service appropriations bill  shortly after Cranston's press release went out. He said that he had talked to  Schwarzkopf's superior, President Bush, about the matter "and he wants to do  something about it."  </P> <P> While he had found morale "very high," Helms said, the troops repeatedly  complained that "they could not get stamps and, if by some chance some stamps  came their way, they were soon stuck together by the humidity and the sweat."  </P> <P> The bill, passed on a voice vote, still must be approved by the House. It would  grant troops the privilege that soldiers in the Vietnam War had: simply writing  their name in the corner of the envelope.  </P> <P> It is the same free mailing privilege -- called the frank -- that members of  Congress enjoy.  </P></p>

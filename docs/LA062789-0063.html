			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: IT ALL COMES OUT AT THE CARWASH  </P> <P> From time to time, California will spontaneously produce an event that seems to  perpetuate the worst myths about life here. You can always tell when this has  happened because the people back East will let us know. The episode pops up on  the network news, gets sprinkled around the big newspapers. Invariably these  stories are told in the way of a joke.  </P> <P> We have one of these events playing itself out right now. In the San Fernando  Valley, a group of citizens has nominated a Unocal gas station and carwash for  landmark status. The outpouring of affection for these artifacts of the '50s  was aroused when a developer announced plans to demolish both, along with a  neighboring Tiny Naylor's, and replace them with a mini-mall.  </P> <P> This story plugged into the California myth immediately, and it got the full  treatment. Here was another bunch of goofy Angelenos, people who already have  to chew their air before they breathe it, flying to the aid of car culture. The  press conferences have been packed, and even a West German television crew  showed up at the nominated landmark to film the cars going through the suds.  </P> <P> It turns out that the carwash episode does, indeed, tell us something about  California. But it has nothing to do with cars and there's little lighthearted  about it. This is really a story about a small community pushed to the wall by  the California boom. It's about builders and developers who have taken control  of the neighborhoods and about the deep anger that's been left in their wake.  And it's about revolt.  </P> <P> I know these things because I happen to live in Studio City. The carwash is  located at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards, just about half  a mile from my house. I moved here about four years ago at the beginning of the  boom. Let me tell you what it is like.  </P> <P> Every day since I moved here I have listened to the engines of progress tear up  the hills facing my house. This is a process known as "filling in." Builders  find the odd-shaped lots or the very steep lots or the lots without a real  street, then build on these lots houses that would have satisfied William  Randolph Hearst. The castle-like affairs loom over the old houses like warlords  and every month a new one is started. The current house is being built on a lot  so steep it required conveyor belts to get the dirt out.  </P> <P> But the real action is down on Ventura Boulevard. This particular stretch of  Ventura, unlike some other sections, has remained a neighborly place with  shopkeepers who know your name and operate their establishments in their own,  occasionally eccentric, fashion. Now they are being steadily bulldozed and  replaced with multitiered buildings all painted terra-cotta and turquoise, the  rented spaces filled with yogurt stands and one-hour photo finishers.  </P> <P> In Studio City we now have half a dozen of these places, including one with the  baffling name of Times Square. At the entrance the owners have stationed a  security guard who scrutinizes each car entering the parking lot to make sure  the occupants who disembark actually shop at Times Square. A homey touch, and I  have been gratified to observe Times Square's slow progress in filling its  rental space.  </P> <P> There have been other episodes, such as the 95-foot-tall office building that  was constructed in a zone limited to 45-foot buildings, all with the city's  blessing. Or the case of the order of nuns who wanted to make $9 million by  tearing down their Catholic girls school and building condos.  </P> <P> And then came Ira Smedra. Certainly his timing was bad, not to mention his  choice of targets. Smedra announced he was about to tear down the carwash, the  Unocal station and Tiny Naylor's so he could throw up one more mini-mall.  Somehow, with this project, Smedra pushed Studio City beyond a threshold.  </P> <P> The fact is, that carwash has become something of an institution in Studio  City. For 28 years it has functioned as the center of the biggest intersection  in town, an outrageously ugly leftover from the days before anyone had dreamed  up the first mini-mall. You can see your neighbors there each weekend, and  somehow that's reassuring.  </P> <P> And so the carwash became a cause here. To be sure, people of Studio City want  to save the carwash, but they also want something more. They want to stand  their ground, they want their turf back.  </P> <P> The final outcome is still unknown, but the situation looks good before the  city's Cultural Heritage Commission. The carwash may be a landmark yet. If the  folks back East find that titillating, so be it. In Studio City it is enough to  fight over, and the fight is serious.  </P></p>

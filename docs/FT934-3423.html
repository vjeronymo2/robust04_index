			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Rate rise likely, warns NZ bank The New Zealand Reserve Bank warned yesterday that some increase in exchange and interest rates may be needed late next year due to strong growth in demand. However it said it was 'currently comfortable' with monetary conditions, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. In its six-monthly statement, the central bank said its latest forecasts indicated that inflation was likely to dip 'somewhat' over the next year, before rising through 1995 and early 1996.</p>

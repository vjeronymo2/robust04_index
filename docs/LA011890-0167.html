			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA ERRS WITH FEES FOR ANIMAL DISPOSALS  </P> <P> Pomona's dead dogs and cats will join its dead sofas and stoves in the streets  and parks, now that the City Council has agreed to charging citizens fees to  dispose of deceased pets and strays.  </P> <P> The city's officials have their heads up and locked.  </P> <P> The costs to take trash to the only disposal site in the Pomona Valley has to  be part of the reason our streets and alleys are littered with castoffs. If the  city fathers would only wake up to realize that fees directed at those using  the services are a compelling force to violate the law.  </P> <P> The real bottom line to negotiations with the Pomona Valley Humane Society is  that the city will pay the $66,000 -- it claims it saved in clever bargaining  -- in added street cleaning costs.  </P> <P> LOUIS ST. MARTIN  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wall Street welcomes Bell-TCI merger SHARES in Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone group, soared to record levels yester day as Wall Street continued to register its delight over Bell's bid for Tele-Communications Inc, the biggest US cable television company. Bell Atlantic closed up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 67 5/8 - on top of a Dollars 5 7/8 rise on Wednesday when the deal was announced. TCI's A shares closed at Dollars 32 7/8 , up Dollars 1 1/2 , on top of Wednesday's Dollars 3 rise. It is unusual for the shares of both bidding and target company to rise by such a large amount following the announcement of a deal. Wall Street likes the industrial logic, does not feel Bell Atlantic is paying an excessive premium for TCI, and is relieved that the deal is a stock swap, which does not involve the issuance of additional debt. The terms of the deal are complex and depend in part on just how much Bell Atlantic is allowed to buy of TCI and of Liberty Media, a spun-off programming subsidiary of TCI which the cable company is in the process of re-acquiring. It could experience delays in acquiring TCI's and Liberty's programming assets, since these use the long-distance phone network and Bell Atlantic will need a court waiver from regulations barring the Baby Bell companies from the long-distance business. It also plans to sell or spin off TCI's cable service operations, which overlap with the area where it provides telephone services, since to acquire them would be illegal. Bell Atlantic is to pay 11.75 annualised cash flow for the cable properties it is buying, while the programming and other assets would be valued at public market value at closing. Bell Atlantic will accomplish the merger by issuing new Class B common stock, valued at Dollars 54 each, which is not expected to pay dividends for five years. After that, it would pay the same dividend as Bell Atlantic's current common stock, to be renamed Class A. The class B stock would be convertible into class A stock after five years. There would be a 10 per cent premium for holders of TCI's class B shares (each of which command 10 votes) over class A shareholders. The two companies estimate that if the acquisition of the cable assets were completed now, Bell Atlantic would issue some 220m class B shares, worth Dollars 11.8bn, or some Dollars 19 a TCI A share, and it would also assume some Dollars 9.6bn of debt. The holder of each TCI A-share would receive around 0.35 of a Bell Atlantic share. However, if the deal is not completed until the end of next year, this could rise to 0.40 and the value of the deal to some Dollars 13bn. If Bell Atlantic was permitted to buy all of the Liberty-TCI assets it wants when the deal closes, it estimates that each TCI-LIberty class A shareholder would receive around 0.65 of class B Bell Atlantic share, pushing the total value of the deal to Dollars 22bn to Dollars 23bn, and the value of each TCI A share to around Dollars 35. Bell Atlantic said it expected earnings per share dilution in the first year after closing of around 30 per cent to 35 per cent from the initial cable properties. Growth in earnings per share is expected to be well above 10 per cent a year for the five-year period after closing the deal. If there are delays in the transfer of the programming assets, Bell Atlantic will distribute these, along with the in-region cable assets, to shareholders in TCI-Liberty in the form of a separately traded company.</p>

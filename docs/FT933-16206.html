			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / UK Company News: The omnipresence of the water regulator - Ofwat's annual price review will restrict the water companies' expansion plans AFTER reporting profits and dividend increases in line with expectations, and well ahead of other industries, the privatised UK water companies may feel aggrieved that their share prices failed to respond. Since March the sector has fallen about 15 per cent, sometimes amid unusual levels of volatility. The water reporting season, which with the exception of Welsh Water ended last month, also failed to inspire its traditional rally. Unfortunately for shareholders, the predictability of the water utilities has been overshadowed by a process over which the companies have less control - the 1994 periodic review by regulator, Ofwat. Ofwat took care not to comment on companies' performance before the results, but the regulator's presence could be felt at all the presentations. Companies are starting work on strategic business plans, which will be submitted to Ofwat next March and will form the basis of negotiation for price rises until the end of the decade. Companies were only quizzed on the initial assumptions which lay behind their plans. Many areas of discussion, such as future environmental standards on urban waste water and pesticides, have yet to be decided. Ofwat is also yet to announce its views on complex matters such as levels of return that companies, and therefore shareholders, can expect from investment. This is also known as the 'cost of capital' debate. While attention will focus on subjects like the cost of capital, companies and their regulator are likely to agree that a simpler benchmark should be interest cover covenants. Since the companies were privatised debt free, their interest cover has remained high compared to the market. For example, North West Water still has interest cover of over seven times, even though borrowings have mounted as the company's investment programme gathered pace. Companies say their banking covenants require them to keep interest cover at two times or greater. They further argue the need for some degree of comfort as their capital expenditure programmes mount up. For some companies, this means interest cover should not fall below four times. Ofwat is unlikely to risk pushing companies too close to their borrowing limits because a breached banking facility would be embarrasing for the regulator as well as the company. But there are a number of areas for potential disagreement. Companies are not forecasting rights issues, which Ofwat may assume. This would allow price rises to be kept lower and would at least delay the moment companies reached their minimum interest cover 'troughs'. Also, it is difficult to see why companies with very different spending plans say they need the same 'K', the amount companies can increase prices above the rate of inflation. For example, Anglian Water has one of the highest spending plans to the end of the decade, partly because of spending on beaches. Severn Trent, which has a much lower investment profile, and no beaches, forecast a K of 6 per cent in its market plan, the same as Anglian. According to one analyst, the K requirements now being discussed are partly designed as 'customer conditioning', to stress to the public that raising water standards is very expensive. With some companies, the requests should also be seen as opening gambits with the regulator. Mr Ian Byatt, director general of Ofwat, has indicated that he would be unhappy with real price rises of more than 2 per cent in the second half of the decade, suggesting the companies are heading for some hard negotiating. Aside from the regulatory questions, results for the companies' unregulated businesses continued to disappoint. Companies have often argued that unregulated earnings have suffered from recession and will only become significant after the periodic review when regulation is likely to be tougher. As expected, Severn Trent's waste management company, Biffa, remained loss making after interest costs. More surprisingly, Northumbrian Water's unregulated businesses also lost money after interest costs. Northumbrian had been seen as small enough to generate a reasonable proportion of profits - perhaps more than a quarter - outside its core, regulated business. Last year's results, and a setback at Amtec Europe, a pipeline maintenance company, suggested Northumbrian is several years away from its goal. Thames Water's unregulated businesses did manage to record pre-tax profits, but the total was disappointing. Excluding inter-company transactions, the unregulated businesses made profits of Pounds 2.2m on sales of Pounds 234.4m. Thames blamed weak overseas markets, although one environmental services subsidiary lost Pounds 2m due to poor management. An expected run of enhanced scrip dividend alternatives failed to materialise. North West, the first to announce profits, did offer an enhanced scheme and said the money saved would be used towards its unregulated business. But the issue was poorly received by institutional shareholders, who complained the issue was effectively a mini-rights issue. Several other water companies later admitted they had looked at offering enhanced scrips but changed their minds after learning of the reaction to North West. Another area of controversy was infrastructure renewals, the annual charge made to cover spending on maintainance of underground assets like pipework. Northumbrian indicated in advance that its renewals charge was being lowered to reflect over-provisioning in prior years. Severn Trent, however, announced a change of policy with its results, helping to boost profits by Pounds 15.9m. The company was criticised for its move, which was seen by analysts as a form of profits massage. But it also raised the question of the accounting treatment of renewals, which Ofwat is reviewing ahead of the periodic review. The confusion was highlighted by figures from Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell at NatWest Securities. These show Yorkshire Water's infrastructure renewals charge last year represented nearly 15 per cent of its utility revenues, while Southern Water's charge was only 5 per cent. Although some of the difference can be explained by relative ages of the assets, it also shows that valuing underground pipework remains an inexact science.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION FUNDING LEGISLATION VETOED BY BUSH;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: REP. DORNAN SUGGESTS THAT A MORE STRINGENT BILL COULD HELP LEAD TO  A COMPROMISE.  </P> <P> President Bush vetoed legislation Saturday authorizing federal abortion funding  for rape and incest victims, but one of the leaders of the anti-abortion  movement in Congress said he sees a subsequent compromise in the cards.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who is involved in congressional  discussions with the White House, said that if an attempt to override the veto  fails, even the most strident opponents of abortion in Congress are likely to  join Bush in accepting a law providing funds to end pregnancies in rape or  incest cases under certain conditions.  </P> <P> First, Dornan said, a sexual assault would have to be reported to law  enforcement officials. The landmark abortion legislation that Bush vetoed  Saturday would have allowed reporting to health clinics in addition to law  enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Dornan said that a rape victim would be required to report the attack to police  within 48 hours, and an incest victim would have to name her assailant. The  legislation Congress had approved called only for "prompt" reporting and  required no identification in incest cases.  </P> <P> The Orange County conservative said the new provisions would prevent women who  are not victims of rape or incest from fraudulently using the law to obtain  abortions financed by Medicaid or other federal funds.  </P> <P> It also would rule out use of federal funds in all but a handful of abortions,  perhaps as few as 100 each year, he said.  </P> <P> "I can live with this," Dornan said. "We're a pluralistic government here with  lots of viewpoints, and if they (pro-choice forces) are willing to give us  tight laws . . . (to prevent) fraud and abuse, and we start putting fathers in  jail who are . . . drunken rapists, and we get more rapes reported, we've  accomplished a goal that all of us, liberals and conservatives, can agree on.  </P> <P> "Our position is, it's still taking a human life," Dornan said. "I'm not  conceding anything . . . (but) I'm trying to tell the pro-lifers who are  single-issue people, God bless them, I love them, but they don't have to sit  here and make a government run."  </P> <P> Dornan's comments are significant because he and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.)  and a handful of others have been the point men for the national anti-abortion  movement in the House of Representatives. Both Hyde and Dornan have huddled  regularly on the issue in recent weeks with White House Chief of Staff John H.  Sununu.  </P> <P> After Saturday's veto, Bush issued a statement from the presidential retreat at  Camp David, Md., saying: "I have informed Congress on numerous occasions that I  would veto legislation if it permitted the use of appropriated funds to pay for  abortions other than those in which the life of the mother would be in danger  of a fetus carried to term."  </P> <P> Asked earlier Saturday about Dornan's assessment of the prospects for a  compromise, a White House spokesman said: "We will have no comment at this  time."  </P> <P> But Dornan said the White House is open to considering another measure  authorizing funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest under restricted  provisions. "I think they're expecting that language to come back (in a new  bill)," Dornan said. "And if it does, this (controversy) will disappear  overnight."  </P> <P> The bill vetoed by Bush contains 1990 fiscal year funding for the Labor  Department as well as the Department of Health and Human Services. The funding  for both departments will continue temporarily under a continuing resolution  that keeps current law in effect.  </P> <P> An amendment providing for expanded federal funding of abortions had been added  to the appropriations measure by Congress. In every previous year since 1981,  Congress had adopted an amendment offered by Hyde that bans federal funding of  any abortions except those to save the life of the mother.  </P> <P> The national debate over abortion heated up after the Supreme Court earlier  this year chipped away at the landmark 1972 case, Roe vs. Wade, that legalized  abortions through the first three months of pregnancy. In a Missouri case, the  high court held that states have the right to restrict abortions.  </P> <P> The ruling was hailed by abortion opponents and denounced by pro-choice groups  and feminist organizations.  </P> <P> Partisans on both sides of the current debate have said that they expect the  Senate and House to attempt to override the President's veto, which requires a  two-thirds vote. The fight is expected to be close in the Senate, but Dornan  said an override would fail in the House.  </P> <P> "Those 206 votes are solid," he said, referring to the House members who voted  against expanded funding.  </P> <P> Even Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), who led the House fight to permit  federal funding of rape and incest abortions, conceded that the override  attempt in the House "very well may" fail.  </P> <P> "Then we'll decide what we're going to do," she said.  </P> <P> She said she was surprised by Dornan's suggestion that conservative  anti-abortionists are willing to accept some type of federal funding for  abortions for victims of rape and incest.  </P> <P> "That's news," she said.  </P> <P> But Boxer said she believes that pro-choice forces already have compromised  enough. "For . . . years, the Hyde amendment stood in that bill, and for as  many years I voted for the bill even though it had the Hyde amendment in it.  </P> <P> "I say to my friends who may not agree with me on this issue, to do what I did.  Swallow your pride, and accept the fact that it is the will of the House that  there be an exception for rape and incest, and vote for the bill the way it  is."  </P> <P> But Dornan said he believes liberals like Boxer who back federal funding for  rape and incest abortions will be under increasing pressure from constituents  to tighten the bill's language to make it acceptable to conservatives.  </P> <P> White House officials have told some in the anti-abortion movement that after  initially considering the possibility of a compromise, Bush decided to veto the  measure, in part, because Boxer and others had painted him as indecisive on the  issue, Dornan said.  </P> <P> "Barbara Boxer went on one or two (television) shows too many, and pushed her  line: 'He (Bush) has more positions on this issue than Imelda Marcos (former  Philippines First Lady) has shoes.' Somebody down at the White House told a  pro-lifer, 'We're sick of hearing that line.'  </P> <P> "It was being shoved in his face that he was all over the place," Dornan said.  "So they said, 'OK, that's it. We veto. And we'll build after that.' "  </P> <P> Dornan said he counseled a veto, based on the current language of the bill.  </P> <P> Dornan, a Roman Catholic, allowed that he has another trick up his sleeve to  ensure that the current language does not survive. He said he has compiled a  list of Roman Catholic representatives who voted against him on the abortion  issue.  </P> <P> When Roman Catholic bishops from across the country gather in Washington next  month for their annual meeting, Dornan said he will make a suggestion to the  group.  </P> <P> Individual bishops should invite for dinner those Roman Catholic  representatives who voted for the current language in the HHS bill, Dornan  said.  </P> <P> "I don't know a Catholic who is worthy of the name who would ever turn down his  bishop," Dornan said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> In an attempt to capture a piece of the state budget windfall, San Diego Mayor  Maureen O'Connor and the City Council declared a "state of emergency" over the  city's recent spate of drug- and gang-related shootings and asked Gov. George  Deukmejian to give the city $34 million to help quell the violence. Deukmejian  press secretary Kevin Brett, questioning whether O'Connor's unusual gambit was  a publicity stunt, said that such declarations are traditionally reserved for  natural disasters and predicted that the governor would reject the request out  of hand. O'Connor, flanked by City Manager John Lockwood and an impassioned  Police Chief Bob Burgreen, insisted that their call for 1.3% of the state's  new-found $2.5-billion surplus is a genuine plea for help. "This is not a  frivolous publicity stunt," the mayor said. "We are very serious in San Diego  that we have a problem and we would like our state government to help us."  </P></p>

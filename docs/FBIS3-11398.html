Bolivia was the first country visited by Gore on his tour to  these three countries. Aranibar met with the U.S. vice  president during the eight hours he was in Bolivia yesterday  before traveling to Buenos Aires, where he finds himself today.    Aranibar told EFE that Gore had expressed his wish to  receive  from the Latin American leaders "topics for the future  inter-American dialogue," an initiative that demands appropriate  preparation.    Gore also discussed drug enforcement with Bolivian President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and other Bolivian personalities,  although it was "not the central subject" of conversation,  Aranibar said.    Following his visit to Bolivia, Gore is currently in Buenos  Aires, from where he will travel to Brasilia, the last leg of  his Latin American tour. He will stay in Brasilia for six hours.    The Bolivian foreign minister arrived today on an official  flight from La Paz to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers  of the Rio Group. The Rio Group is made up of 13 members:  Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela,  Paraguay, Uruguay, Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala (representing  Central America), and Trinidad and Tobago (representing the  Caribbean).    The 48-hour Rio Group meeting began today at Itamaraty  Palace, and is being held precisely to discuss positions for the  summit organized by Clinton, and for a preliminary document  prepared by experts from several governments and the Economic  Commission for Latin America, ECLA, on "poverty, the neglected  sectors, and unemployment."    Regarding the summit in Miami, Aranibar said that the  countries of the continent must prepare "an agenda for the new  world" which must include the main subjects that will dominate  the inter-American dialogue in the next few years.    He also said that certain subjects connected with economic  and social development, as well as regional integration --  including the possible membership of other Latin American  countries to the North American Free Trade Agreement among the  United States, Canada, and Mexico -- must also be included in  the agenda.    According to Aranibar, the inter-American subjects for the  Miami summit must include participative democracy, the struggle  against corruption, the stability and solidness of the  democratic institutions, and rational development.</p>

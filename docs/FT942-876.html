			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: London With no significant UK economic data due this week, international factors are set to play a key role in the gilt markets. In the aftermath of the Fed's apparently unsuccessful attempt to defend the dollar on Friday, the international bond climate seems set to remain both bearish and volatile. This is expected to have a knock-on effect on gilts, not least because UK bonds are currently closely reflecting developments in continental European bond markets such as Germany. On the domestic front, the main event of the week will be the Bank of England's Pounds 2bn auction on Wednesday of a floating-rate Treasury 1999 issue. With the size slightly lower than the Pounds 2.5bn of the last FRG issue, some analysts, like Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International, argue that this indicates the Treasury is revising down its expectation for the public sector borrowing requirement. Other traders disagree. and argue that it is too early in the financial year to forecast a change in the level of government borrowing. Either way, the release of the Treasury forecast on Tuesday, which will include a PSBR prediction for this year, will be scrutinised by the gilts market. The forecast is expected to show that expectations of inflation have been revised down and those of growth rates up.</p>

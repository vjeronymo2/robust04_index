According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, the  Federal Government has received indications that another  application for entry by Zhirinovskiy can be expected on the  occasion of a "European Congress," which is to take place in  Cologne at the beginning of February. On 29 December 1993  Zhirinovskiy was refused an entry visa.    According to findings by the Federal Office for the  Protection of the Constitution, the "European Congress" is being  prepared by rightist German deputies of the European Parliament.  According to findings by intelligence services, Zhirinovskiy  intends to try to get intentional approval for his policy in  Europe and to use his contacts with rightist German politicians  for this purpose. At a joint press conference in Moscow this  week, Zhirinovskiy assured DVU Chairman Gerhard Frey of "eternal  friendship." On the same day, the Moscow public prosecutor's  office initiated proceedings against Zhirinovskiy for war  agitation.</p>

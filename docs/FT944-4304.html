			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / EU clears aid for Eko Stahl The European Union yesterday cleared a DM910m (Pounds 371.4m) aid package for Eko Stahl, former east Germany's biggest steel plant, opening the way for Cockerill-Sambre of Belgium to take over, modernise and eventually privatise the loss-making enterprise. An initial package involving capital injections of more than DM1bn was cut after other EU countries objected, in particular the UK, which did not think sufficient capacity reductions were accompanying the aid. Under yesterday's deal, Germany will cut 41,000 tons of steel capacity at two other east German steel mills to justify the subsidies. The deal should come into effect on January 1, when Cockerill-Sambre will take an initial 60 per cent stake, with the option of taking the remainder from the Treuhand privatisation agency by 1999. The aid will be used to modernise the plant's cold-rolling mill and blast furnace, but also to build a new hot-rolling facility.</p>

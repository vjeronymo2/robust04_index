			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool prices have continued to move steadily against the buyer, with finer Merinos in particularly strong demand. Overall, price increases are gradual, and the Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached 457 cents a kg. on October 20, which compared with 450 a week before. When the selling season opened in July the indicator was 459 cents, and subsequently declined to a low of 411. Clearances at auction remain very good, business in wool using markets has been better, and forecasts of a continuing gradual firmer tendency for wool are multiplying.</p>

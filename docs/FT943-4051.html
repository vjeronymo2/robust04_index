			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Thumbs up for disclosure - More insurers are accepting the new rules There are signs that life companies are beginning to accept, however reluctantly, that they should introduce the new disclosure rules for the financial services industry before January 1 - the mandatory deadline for the first tranche of changes. All of them must be in place by June. The rules, which require sales agents to provide customers with more information about products and charges, have been resisted fiercely by the industry but are now seen as inevitable. The TSB group has just become the first mass market life insurer to announce that it will introduce the full system from November 1. Until then, Equitable Life had been the only life insurer to break ranks and implement the rules ahead of deadline. Now Scottish Widows, a mutual life insurer, plans to join in. Over the autumn, it will introduce disclosure for one product range at a time. The first, probably from October, is likely to be a mortgage endowment policy with critical illness cover. The TSB announcement is particularly significant because it is accompanied by other changes which also will affect customers who go to the bank for financial services. First, financial services staff who have been paid commission only will get a mix of commission and salary. John Elbourne, TSB's head of retail banking, says this shift will be accompanied by an integration of the bank and financial services staff into a single sales force divided into four tiers. Staff at the first level will be paid a basic salary of Pounds 9,000 to Pounds 9,500 while those at the most highly-qualified level - who will be able to advise on anything from personal pensions to offshore funds - will get a basic Pounds 17,000 to Pounds 25,000. Only staff at the top two levels will be authorised to sell financial services products. Beyond the salaries, there will be bonuses for branches which meet certain customer service standards and attain certain sales' levels. Individual bonuses also will be paid for staff who sell more than a certain figure over a quarter. Although payment by commission has been attacked widely as encouraging sales of inappropriate products, Elbourne denies that customers would have been sold unsuitable policies by staff because of the existing pay arrangements. He says the alteration in pay structures will not make much difference to the figures provided to customers in terms of the incentive to sell and the charges which must be disclosed. In a further shift, TSB is to introduce new product ranges, also to coincide with the start of its financial year at the beginning of November. The emphasis will be on making them simple and straightforward, and one possibility would be a move towards 'unbundling' - the separation into two distinct, but complementary, products of the protection and investment elements that make up packaged life insurance products.</p>

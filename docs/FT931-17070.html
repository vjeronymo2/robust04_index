			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Pit jobs worried cabinet in 1962: The contrasts over mine plans CABINET papers released yesterday show a sharp contrast between the attitude to pit closures of the Macmillan administration 30 years ago and the closure programme announced by the government in October. The Conservative leadership of 1962, which included one-nation Tories such as Rab Butler and Iain Macleod, gave only qualified support to a plan to close uneconomic pits. It urged the National Coal Board to consider fully the social implications of closures. In contrast, Mr Michael Hesel-tine, trade and industry secretary, said on October 13 last year that 31 of Britain's 50 pits were to close with the loss of 30,000 jobs. His announcement led to widespread claims of insensitivity and a failure to grasp the human dimensions of the recession. On July 5 1962, the cabinet discussed a memorandum by the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Selwyn Lloyd - now released under the 30-year rule - which disclosed a plan by the NCB to break even over the five-year period 1963-67. Demand for coal was estimated at 190m tons a year for several years ahead, and the closure of uneconomic pits would have been necessary to meet financial targets. In the previous year the board had maintained 162 collieries classed as 'gross losers' in the sense that their operating costs exceeded the income from coal produced. According to the chancellor, this strategy was 'economically sound, though it would give rise to some social and political difficulties'. After a long debate which showed widespread concern for the impact of pit closures on mining communities, the cabinet agreed that the board's policy on closures should receive qualified support. It was proposed that in indicating the government's general approval, Richard Wood, minister of power, should inform the NCB of ministers' assumption 'that the board would, so far as possible, time their closures to minimise the social difficulties which would result from them'. It was added that the NCB's attention should be drawn to parts of the country where these difficulties would be most acute. The cabinet decided to maintain the policy of not allowing imports of US coal. It agreed that any protests from the US administration over inconsistencies between this policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could be met by an assurance that the policy would be re-examined a year later.

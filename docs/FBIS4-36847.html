			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, </F> member of the Council of Guardians and acting Friday prayers  leader, in Tehran on 10 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] The first sermon on this Friday,  because of the issue of the pilgrimage and the events which took  place in Mecca and Medina, is naturally about that subject. I  shall talk to you dear ones briefly about it.    The first is the issue of that of disavowal. We believe --  and his holiness the imam [Khomeyni], God be satisfied with him,  and the esteemed leader [Khamene'i] have also recommended --  that disavowal must be carried out, that the disavowal ritual  cannot be cancelled and is a duty, and that efforts should be  made for that duty to be performed in the best manner.    This year the House of Al Sa'ud treated the honorable  Iranian  pilgrims and the esteemed leader's mission roughly and harshly.  They kept the mission under siege a few days up to 17 May. The  siege was ugly. The Saudi forces were in three rows and in  emplacements; they had brought military hardware, machine guns,  cannons and tanks; riot squads were there with their riot gear  and water cannons and such were at hand here and there.    It was foreseen from the start that an unpleasant situation  was imminent. But we said, perhaps we will be able to carry out  our duty. Then, closer to the mission, we got a tighter circle  of the besieging troops and stricter traffic restrictions to and  from the mission.    A sister of one of the faithful who lived in an Arab country  and who had come to visit him was stopped on her return and was  interrogated for an hour. She was asked: Where were you and  what was your business. Her address was obtained. There was  such harsh and dreadful behavior. There was a police state and  martial law around the mission.    Under those circumstances, the question was what to do,  since  preserving the sanctity and security of the shrine is a must for  everyone. That action of the House of Al Sa'ud undermined  security. Security means pilgrims to the holy house of God must  be safe. Stationing armed troops and creating a police state and  an emergency situation would deprive everybody of their  security. That means everyone would be in fear, lest they are  arrested, beaten or molested.    That action was breaking the security of the shrine. But it  was clearly foreseen that if we were to hold the ceremony, there  would be clashes and the desecration of the shrine would be much  greater; moreover, the lives of pilgrims to the holy house of  God would be endangered.    Under these circumstances it was decided that this year's  disavowal of infidels ceremonies should not take place. Our  duty was in fact nothing but to obey what we had been ordered.  God has ordered that if a pilgrim, who wants to go to Mecca in  order to carry out the pilgrimage, finds himself impeded -- that  is, he faces a closed route -- even though he has committed  himself to the rites by putting on his special hajj attire, he  is authorized to perform merely the part to do with slaughtering  sheep, and then remove his hajj attire and return home. He is  authorized to do the same if, for instance, he becomes ill  during the pilgrimage. This is Islam's decree. The same decree  obviously applies to other pilgrimage obligations, such as the  disavowal of infidels ceremonies. We had no other choice, as we  did not seek to have caused the violation of the sanctity of the  holy shrine.    This was what I had to say about the disavowal of infidels  ceremonies. There are, however, numerous issues to do with the  pilgrimage and the Al Sa'ud government. In sum, one can say  that it has become the Americans' nest of corruption, in that  they have brought everything under their control. They have  imposed their control over political, economic and religious  issues.    On the one hand, they became present in a sacred Islamic  land. This was unprecedented, as the infidels should not be  present in that land. However, the Americans came and found a  foothold there. On the other hand, they invariably interfere in  different issues. With a single telephone call to Fahd about  the purchase of passenger planes, Clinton tells him to buy  Boeing; otherwise, relations are going to be affected. Just by  this threat, a $6 million aircraft purchase deal is suddenly  made. Clinton receives his commission from the companies  concerned, while at the same time about 300,000 jobs are created  in the American aircraft industry, which is saved from  bankruptcy for at least several years. This is all done by one  single telephone call.    This is what the situation is like. When we say that Muslims  should not be abject, this is what we mean. What abjectness can  be greater that what I just described? What I said merely  concerned intervention in economic issues.    We have, moreover, their intervention in large and small  issues. I have a guess, which I consider as very close to  reality, that in respect of the cancellation of the disavowal of  infidels ceremonies, the support and the insistence of the  Americans must certainly be taken into account, alongside the  fact that the Wahhabi clerics and the Al Sa'ud rulers are not  very keen on the staging of such events anyway.    Another issue is that a strange situation has been created  there, in that a group of Najd clerics, who are in fact the most  reactionary clerics Islam has seen, seek to impose their ideas,  with the support of the Saudi leaders, on about 1.2 billion  Muslims and deprive them of freedom of action. They want  everyone to follow what they consider as Islam and refrain from  what they term non-Islamic. This does not follow any logic,  given what Islam says about the two holy shrines.    According to Islam's point of view, these shrines are  international Islamic centers. [passage omitted] Instead of  belonging to one single group, these shrines belong to all  Muslims. If a government rules that land, it should only serve  the Muslims. It is not authorized to interfere in the way that  the Muslims fulfill their obligations and perform their rituals  and worship. That state is there merely to serve Muslims.    Despite this Islamic point of view, they prevent Muslims  from  performing what in their opinion constitutes a diversion, an  innovation, and an act of infidelity. This does not only affect  the Shiites, as the majority of Muslims believe in the principle  of the blessings which are induced by the act of visiting  shrines and offering prayers at sacred tombs. They, however,  oppose all these. This a tragedy, and something must be done  about it. If these clerics had been anything but extremely  reactionary and fanatic, then we could have invited them to an  Islamic congress to discuss these issues in the presence of all  Islamic scholars. However, they are not prepared to say even  one word about these issues, as they claim that whatever they  say is the absolute truth. [passage omitted]    The other issue concerns the Saudi leaders' incompetence in  managing the affairs of the holy shrines. One aspect of this  concerns safeguarding people's lives. It is not a small matter  when a pilgrim, who has travelled thousands of kilometers from  Africa or east Asia to have his one chance of a lifetime to go  on pilgrimage, is suddenly killed under the crowd stampede. How  can one justify that? What I saw with my own two eyes smacked of  mismanagement. Imagine the situation where there are about a  million people around, half of whom are going towards Jamarat  while the other half are returning from the site. The two  crowds suddenly collide, while cars and their escorts are also  trying to get by. People wonder what they do as they are being  pushed around. The volume of the crowd naturally causes people  to fall, and once they fall, they cannot get up, until their  corpses are evacuated. [passage omitted]    What judgment are the people of the world going to pass when  they witness all these scenes in a center where Islam and its  culture is manifesting itself? This can be called by no other  term but mismanagement.    Another issue, which is of paramount importance, is the  widespread corruption of the Saudi ruling class. The whole  world, except the extremely ignorant, knows that they indulge in  the most grand debauchery and spend the greatest amount of money  to satisfy their carnal desires. The scandals are numerous, but  it is not right for me, as the preacher present at Friday  prayers sermon premises, to talk about them. I leave these to  the press. Perhaps when the flow of their money to the Zionist  press stops, these newspapers will then disclose more of these  matters.    On the basis of these clear issues, one must ask whether  these people are suitable for managing the affairs of the two  holy shrines. [passage omitted]    It is the pious who should manage the holy shrines. Not  everyone can take up such a duty. This is the place for the  pious, for holy Abraham and for worshipping one single God.  [passage omitted]    God, then, ordered Abraham to keep the shrines pure and  clean. What impurity can be worse than the fact that a number of  corrupt and profligate individuals, who have built themselves  places for debauchery and vice all over the world, are ruling  that sacred land? That is also one such tragedy that we face  there.    Another issue is that of the minorities in Saudi Arabia who  are mainly Shiite. Some have been expelled from Iraq, and the  Saudis themselves put them in such a miserable situation. There  are also Shiites who live in Sharqiyah, living in very bad  conditions indeed. Extraordinary restrictions are imposed on  them. They are not allowed to publish or obtain books. Their  bookshop has been closed down. What kind of logic is it, that a  group of people are not allowed to write religious books and  write about their religious duties in order to give them to  their children to read?. Which part of the world accepts that?  But, if we make a wrong move -- and sometimes even if we do not  -- they raise a hue and cry and blow their horns that human  rights are being violated here, but that it does not matter if  they are violated there -- even when it concern a cultural or  religious issue.    The minorities cannot establish a seminary; they are not  allowed to build a mosque; they are not allowed to have a  bookshop. Those are some of the ugly and shameful restrictions  imposed on cultural and religious matters. What can be done?  Why do they behave so badly towards them? What is the offense  of those refugees? Some of those refugees who are seeking  asylum are told they should become a Wahhabi first.    The first condition is that a person should become a Wahhabi  before seeking asylum. Where in the world could you find such  words or the imposition of such ideas, such weak-minded ideas?  But the world has shut up because Saudi Arabia is where the  dollar is and is the center of oil money, and it is giving it  away to shut them up. Therefore, to the West, everything Saudi  Arabia does conforms to human rights.    Another issue, which constitutes my final remarks in this  sermon, is the speech of Fahd on 'Id al-'Adha this year. Each  year heads of various pilgrimage groups from different countries  are invited to go and see Fahd on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha.  This was done very simply in previous years and nothing was  mentioned. But this year, all of a sudden, his excellency made  a long speech, which newspapers also reported, on various issues  and services in Medina and Mecca. One part of the speech was  about the services and another dealt with political issues in  Somalia, Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina and also one part was  about Iran.    On the issue of Iran, he mentioned the issue of the three  islands and said that Iran should observe international  agreements and human rights and so on. Very well, our first  question is: you have always condemned us and placed a cordon  around us saying that political issues should not be raised here  during the pilgrimage. What was your speech about then? Was it  not a political speech? Why are you raising political issues?  [passage omitted]    Then on the Iranian affairs, always when those Saudi  gentlemen are under pressure, in order to make a payoff to their  masters, they immediately raise certain issues headed by the  issue of the three islands. They think when they say a few  words then all problems are solved. They themselves know that  the issue of the islands is nothing that could be solved with a  speech or a statement. Basically there is no problem to be  solved. They are stirring trouble. They want to blackmail us.  They want to blackmail us that if you do not do this or that,  then we will raise the issue of the three islands. That is the  issue; otherwise, the UAE itself is not so persistent on this  and they themselves are perhaps conscious that we are right.  But the Saudis are stirring up trouble. They have become the  region's agent provocateur now. They bully Yemen, they bully  Qatar, they bully the UAE, and they also intend to bully us.    In any case, those are some of the issues, and we hope that  one day a pious government rules that holy land so that the  Muslim people who go to holy Mecca could perform their religious  duties as God wishes.

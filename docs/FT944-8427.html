			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Saving and Borrowing): Persistence pays off The days when choosing a mortgage was a simple matter of either repayment or endowment are long gone. House-buyers now have dozens of options, complicated by tempting offers of discounts and cashbacks. Earlier this year, when there was uncertainty about which way interest rates were going, fixed-rate mortgage offers were sometimes being introduced and withdrawn within 24 hours. In such an atmosphere, it is difficult enough for ordinary people to negotiate the maze. Sometimes, it seems bank and building society staff are not clear, either. When Weekend Money reader Gillian Turner and her family were planning to move house in April, she researched the mortgage market thoroughly. After calling the Abbey National's national telephone help-line, she thought she had found the perfect combination: a four-year, fixed-rate mortgage with a cashback arrangement to cover her valuation fee and solicitor's costs. On three occasions, she spoke to Abbey National staff over the telephone to check the details. She then applied for the mortgage through her financial adviser. He was surprised that a cashback was available on a fixed-rate mortgage so he called the Abbey National himself to check - and was told it was. So, the application went ahead and purchase of the house was completed on June 14. The Turners moved in - but no cheque arrived from Abbey National. She made numerous phone calls and wrote several letters to find out what had happened to the Pounds 689.40 she felt she was owed. It was not until August 4 that Abbey National told her the mortgage she had chosen had never been eligible for a cashback. The offer to reimburse borrowers for their mortgage valuations and conveyancing costs applied only to variable-rate mortgages. Turner persisted. 'My argument throughout has been that the product I was sold is not the product I now have, and that I want what I bought.' More letters and 'phone calls followed. Abbey National offered her an ex gratia payment of Pounds 100, then Pounds 150, then Pounds 350, all of which were refused. Finally, late last month - and 4 1/2 months after moving into her new home - she received a cheque for Pounds 689.40. Yet, Abbey National still did not admit liability. 'We are not convinced we were at fault but, because she had become an Abbey National customer and was clearly unhappy, we felt it was appropriate to make an ex gratia payment,' a company representative said. Clearly, it is difficult to determine who said what to whom in conversations months ago, but a few precautions might help house-buyers avoid this sort of problem. If you discuss any financial product over the 'phone, note the name of the person to whom you are talking and the time of the conversation. Ask for written details to check that all the conditions are as you understood them. As well as checking your eligibility for cashbacks and discounts, ask about other conditions. If you feel you have been misled or misinformed about a product, but your initial complaint is rejected by the company responsible, do not give up. Turner's experience shows that persistence can pay.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Russia energy deals gather pace The Dollars 10bn oil and gas agreement between Russia and a western consortium is the latest in a string of large deals to develop energy reserves around the Russian periphery. The agreement, signed in Washington late on Wednesday, covers the development of two oil and gas fields off Russia's Sakhalin Island by a consortium led by Marathon Oil of the US. Other partners include Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Royal Dutch/Shell and McDermott. The fields - Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lunskoye - contain an estimated 750m barrels of oil and natural gas liquids, and 14,000bn cubic feet of gas. Marathon says peak production of 180,000 barrels a day of liquids and 1.5bn cubic feet a day of gas is expected four years after the go-ahead is given for full-scale development. That, however, must await passage by the Russian parliament of an oil and gas law to govern production-sharing agreements such as the one signed this week. Some western oil companies are demanding additional assurances in the form of separate legislation covering specific projects before they commit substantial funds in Russia. Marathon says Russia would receive more than 50 per cent of the production revenues from the project, which is one of a number envisaged for Sakhalin in spite of the harsh operating conditions in the area. Much of the work in the area can only be done between May and mid-October, when winter storms make construction impossible. Many big western oil companies have chosen to pursue technically difficult but self-contained projects on the Russian periphery rather than rely on the Russian oil export transportation system, which is plagued by bottlenecks. The Marathon-led consortium plans to liquefy the gas for direct sale to fast-growing Asian markets such as Taiwan or Korea. The oil will be piped ashore before being exported by tanker. The Russian government has supported such schemes because neither it nor any Russian oil companies have the financial resources to develop them.</p>

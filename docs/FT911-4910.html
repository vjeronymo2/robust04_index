			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Bank hopes five-year stock will set benchmark THE Bank of England announced that it would offer a Pounds 1.2bn tranche of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996 for auction on April 24 which it hopes will create a five-year benchmark. The auction will increase the amount available of 10 per cent conversion stock due 1996 to Pounds 3bn. A representative of the Bank said that it would help to create a needed five-year benchmark against which investors could compare foreign bonds such as five-year French government securities and German five-year bunds. The tranche will also provide liquidity for the interest-rate swaps market, in which five-year maturities are considered the most important. Swaps between floating rates and fixed rates require a steady flow of fixed-interest payments. The fixed-rate payments are provided by gilts over a range of maturities, although five-year gilts are the most commonly used. However, the Bank has been buying gilts during the last three years and has only recently announced a regular programme of issuing large amounts of gilts to allow the government to meet its borrowing requirements. Hence the amount of stock available for swaps has decreased. The Bank said that applicants whose competitive bids were accepted would be allotted stock at their bid price. The issue is partly paid at issue, with 50 per cent payable on May 28. Traders said that if the gilts market strengthened in the next few days, investors might be attracted by the issue being partly paid as this provides them with the opportunity to gear up. The gilts market has been weak recently, however, and traders pointed out that the flood of rights issues and sterling Eurobonds in recent days might mean that the market has difficulty digesting the new tranche. The auction will be the first that the Bank of England has held since August 1988, when it auctioned 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 1994. During 1987-88, the Bank held what it called an 'experimental series' of four auctions combined with gilts issues. The dividend dates on the new tranche are May 15 and November 15. The gilt matures on November 15 1996.</p>

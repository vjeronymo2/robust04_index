			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Union seeks MPs' support over pits THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday asked all non-Labour MPs to oppose the government's forthcoming white paper on the future of the mining industry if it endorses any pit closures. In a letter to MPs, Mr Neil Greatrex, the UDM president, asked them to support 'in its entirety' the Commons trade and industry committee report to keep all 31 pits open. The union intends to organise private meetings with up to 55 MPs, most of them Conservatives, over the next few days to urge them to reject any government measures that would mean closing any of the 31 threatened pits.</p>

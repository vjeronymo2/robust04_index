			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Fuller Smith hits out over beer excise duty Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman of London-based brewer Fuller Smith &amp; Turner, yesterday attacked the chancellor over the levels of duty on beer, unchanged in the recent Budget proposals. 'It is extremely disappointing that he failed to consider properly the stark facts put before him on the dangers to the British brewing industry of maintaining such a high rate of beer tax. 'We are put at a severe disadvantage by the disparity between UK excise duty and that of other European countries, and sales across the (company's) estate are being affected by the enormous volumes of beer being imported both legally and more disturbingly, illegally, ' he said. The statement accompanied the USM-traded group's results for the six months to October 2 which showed pre-tax profits little changed at Pounds 3.76m after an exceptional loss of Pounds 191,000 on property disposals. Turnover was also static, at Pounds 41m, reflecting, Mr Fuller said, difficult trading conditions in the south-east. 'Much has been made of the recession ending but we have not seen this coming through in our pubs.' The group's own beer brands showed a volume increase of 7 per cent, helped by increased sales of London Pride bitter. Free trade sales improved 14 per cent, although sales in the group's estate were lower. Earnings per share, under FRS 3, edged ahead to 10.62p (10.13p). The interim dividend is raised to 2.52p (2.4p).</p>

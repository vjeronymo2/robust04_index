			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), the previously approved information collection and recordkeeping requirements concerning applications for inspection services, including official commodity laboratory testing services, have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0580&hyph;0013. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fees for commodity laboratory testing services were last increased August 1, 1984, (49 FR 26547). Subsequent adjustments were made on April 17, 1991, (56 FR 15483), adding several new laboratory test services and consolidating others for clarity and efficiency. Currently, these fees appear in section 68.90, Table 4 of the regulations (7 CFR 68.90, Table 4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGIS is adding a vomitoxin laboratory testing service to the current list of fees, 7 CFR 68.90, Table 4. The new test is required to accommodate frequent grain and food industry requests for this service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FGIS continually strives to contain operating costs through program efficiencies and streamlining. In fiscal year 1992, FGIS took specific action to reduce chemical disposal costs by implementing new technology. FGIS further enhanced laboratory procedures to improve overall efficiency. While these changes proved successful in reducing certain costs, the overall cost of operating the laboratory increased between FY 92 and 93 by more than 8 percentum. This cost increase occurred simultaneously with a more than 17 percentum downturn in revenue due to fewer service requests. Revenue of $1,035,441 did not cover the operating cost of $1,192,669 for fiscal year 1993, resulting in a 1-year operating loss of $157,228. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given fiscal year 1993 volume, the proposed fee increase will generate revenue of $1,394,577 or an increase of $355,224. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 203(h) of the AMA (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)) provides for the establishment and collection of fees that are reasonable, and as nearly as practicable, to cover the costs of the services rendered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These fees cover the FGIS administrative and supervisory costs for the performance of official services. FGIS costs include personnel compensation, personnel benefits, travel, rent, communications, utilities, contractual services, supplies, and equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 68.90, Table 4 (as currently shown in section 68.90, Table 4 of the regulations) is revised to provide for the increase in laboratory commodity testing fees and the addition of the vomitoxin laboratory testing as outlined in the background. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The increased fees for laboratory tests are: Aflatoxin test (other than TLC or Minicolumn), Aflatoxin (TLC), Aflatoxin (Minicolumn), Appearance &amp; Odor, Ash, Bacteria count, Baking test (cookies), Bostwick (uncooked/cook test/dispersibility), Brix, Calcium, Carotenoid Color, Cold test (oil), Cooking test (other than corn soy blend), Crude fat, Crude fiber, Dough handling (baking), E. coli, Falling number, Fat (acid hydrolysis), Fat-stability (A.O.M.), Flash point (point &amp; closed cup), Free fatty acid, Hydrogen ion activity (pH), Iron enrichment, Linolenic acid (fatty acid profile), Lovibond color, Moisture, Moisture &amp; volatile matter, Performance test (prepared bakery mix), Peroxide value, Pesticide residue (carbon tetrachloride, methyl bromide, ethylene dibromide), Phosphorus, Popcorn kernels (total defects), Popping ratio/value popcorn, Potassium bromate, Protein, Salmonella, Salt or sodium content, Sanitation (light filth), Sieve test, Smoke point, Solid fat index, Unsaponifiable matter, Urease activity, Visual exam (hops pellet), Visual exam (insoluble impurities, oils, and shortening), Visual exam (pasta), Visual exam (processed grain products), Vitamin enrichment, and Water activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 68 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Agriculture commodities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

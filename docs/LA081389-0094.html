TOWERS ARE EVACUATED  </P> <P> A rupture in a natural gas pipeline forced a brief evacuation of several  hundred people from seven high-rise buildings in San Francisco's downtown  financial district, police said. A worker digging a trench apparently struck a  16-inch gas line on California Street between Sansome and Battery streets, said  Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Ron Rutkowski. About 70 guests were  evacuated from the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco Hotel at about 8:30 p.m. but  were allowed to return to their rooms shortly after midnight.  </P></p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Dollar rise checked DEALERS will focus on US and German economic data this week, as they try to work out whether short-term interest rates in both countries will converge, writes James Blitz. Since the US presidential election, the market has been divided over whether the dollar can break through the DM1.60 level before the end of the year. Those who felt that it would have started to revise their views in recent days. On Friday, the US currency suffered a sharp set back, falling nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading, and closing at DM1.5660. One reason for the downward move is that the market is coming to believe that there will be no further easing in official German rates this year. The Bundesbank is unwilling to ease policy because of inflationary pressures. Friday's rise in October retail sales by 0.9 per cent has given the central bank a further reason not to change view. Both the October producer prices figure due out today and the figure for M3 money supply growth, due out on Thursday, will give clearer indications of inflationary pressures in the economy. The dollar could retrace its steps because of continuing sluggish growth in the US economy. Last Friday's indicators did show some signs of an economic recovery. But some analysts suggested that they were 'dollar-negative,' because a recovery would give President-elect Bill Clinton a reason to scale back the size of his fiscal stimulus, implying no tightening of US monetary policy. It will be interesting to see how the market responds to today's industrial production figures for October, to the September trade balance due on Wednesday, and to the October housing starts, which are due the following day.</p>

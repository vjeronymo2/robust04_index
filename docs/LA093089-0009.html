			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SONGWRITER IRVING BERLIN DIES  </P> <P> Music, real music, is the perfect alternate life style to the death style of  drugs.  </P> <P> When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, it was music that helped bring America  back from deep depression, fear and a sense of hopelessness. Today we're being  murdered by drugs.  </P> <P> Irving Berlin is dead. So is Beethoven, Brahms and Benny Goodman. They're all  in heaven because of their music. And we're in heaven when we listen to what  they left us. Their music can change the world for the better.  </P> <P> Let's pass along the beautiful, inspiring news to our children and our  grandchildren regarding the golden treasure that Berlin and other musical  geniuses created for us to enjoy.  </P> <P> This can be done by demanding that music appreciation classes be returned to  our schools. To do so will bring immediate happiness, hope and courage to  thousands. What better way to honor Berlin?  </P> <P> DUKE RUSSELL  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

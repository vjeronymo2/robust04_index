			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party </F> presidential candidate, at the Tequendama Hotel in Santa Fe de  Bogota on 29 May -- recorded]    [Text] The change started today. [applause] We will  complete this work in the next three weeks. The same policy was  applied today. The people won. In the next three weeks,  Colombia will return to the hands of all Colombians. [applause]  The Colombian people have spoken with a strong, convincing  voice. Today, you voted for a change. No more of the old  promises and the old politics. You have voted for a new  leadership above the old political machinery. Millions of  Colombians have voted for the future, not for the past.    Throughout the country, this wonderful nation, there is a  strong desire for change. We have seen our fellow countrymen on  the streets. We have heard this in your voices, which have  demanded a change, on the street and in your homes. We have  felt it in the thousands of hands we have shaken, the many  Colombians who have supported us with their hearts. Colombia's  time is up. The time has arrived to give the people a better  life. The time for a change is at hand. Today, our people sent  a message to the guardians of the old politics. [Words  indistinct] not along the old, eroded road. We will outline a  new course. The vote of the humblest of our fellow countrymen  has the same value as that of the most powerful and privileged.  The message [applause] is that we are the masters of our own  destiny.    The message is clear. Do not let yourselves be guided by the  great but empty rhetoric. [Words indistinct] because it is  backed by a specific, serious, and consistent program to create  new and better jobs, stimulate investment and industry, rescue  the rural areas and peasants from neglect, lend to those who  wish to start their own business, give the benefit of potable  water to more than 10 million Colombians, [applause] build  360,000 new social interest homes, carry out the great  educational reforms that will give all Colombians an opportunity  to prepare themselves and succeed in the difficult and  competitive world that awaits them at the turn of the 21st  century.    [Words indistinct] material welfare but with the soul and  our  nation. We oppose the legalization of drugs in any form.  [applause] This has been, is, and will continue to be my  position; the same position I have maintained for 15 years, the  one I will continue to maintain as president of all Colombians.  [applause] We must set one goal: not to tolerate drugs, drug  trafficking, the consumption of drugs, or narcoterrorism. This  will not happen overnight or in a couple of months. But this is  the path we must take and the one we must seek.</p>

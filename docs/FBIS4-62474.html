			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuliy Semenenko "Pertinent Remarks": "Who Is My Militia </F> Protecting?"]    [Text] Krasnodar Kray -- The people of the Kuban will  recall seeing in early March an abundance of people in militia  uniform, and also civilians, who had been drilled to precision.  They filled the streets, squares, and highways of the kray  center and environs. "Some VIP's have come, evidently," the  shrewdest onlookers decided, glancing around apprehensively.    The ordinary people of Kransodar were clairvoyant. In fact,  Internal Affairs Minister V.F. Yerin had flown into the kray to  attend a session of the kray administration collegium to discuss  the crime situation, which has become critical. Our big chiefs  are automatically kept away from the people, given the kid glove  treatment. Because the people are a multitudinous mass, there  is no need to be particularly protective toward them. If  someone is killed or goes missing he will immmediately be  replaced by several law-abiding or not very law-abiding  citizens. At least, that was the case before the reforms, when  Russia's women, without shirking and without delving into  politics, would unfailingly keep the population topped up.    Now they are clearly falling down on the job. Are they on  strike, perhaps, or are they too politicized? The more we  democratize, in fact, the more noticeably thin our ranks become.  Well, what of it? Some people would say there are too many  people in the country anyway. So they fire pistols,  submachineguns, and tank guns at the people and at their elected  representatives. They have crack units on the ready, so that  the people know their place. While their leaders, not fearing  and not made to feel awkward by the "common folk," confidently  drove wherever they needed to go -- toward the yawning heights  of capitalism.    So it is probably no accident that Viktor Fedorovich paid  such keen attention to the actions of "Cobra" -- a crack subunit  of the special purpose militia detachment -- during his visit to  the kray. And there was certainly something to see. These  Russian equivalents of the U.S. supermen were expertly  restraining and blocking the "mob" and stopping the  "toublemakers" operating.    On this occasion the special militia was showing off its  combat training in a demonstration exercise. The guys acted in  the proper manner -- swiftly, vigorously, resolutely, without a  moment's hesitation. So they would not let anyone down in  future incidents. The minister liked the militia subunits'  combat equipment, although the fact that the kray does not have  a mounted militia is in his view a major deficiency.    Anyway, while the bosses were inspecting their subordinates  and having their meeting, life went on as usual in the Kuban.  The criminals, who, despite the constant swelling of the law  enforcement ranks, still outnumber the militia and who were  ignorant of Mr. Yerin's visit, carried on their business as  usual -- robbing, killing, raping, thieving, stealing cars. Yet  another remarkable fact now from the life of your  coprrespondent. At the very moment when Yerin arrived in our  crime-infested kray, the head of a Krasnodar organization which  leases rooms to various offices, including the firm for which  the aforesaid journalist's wife works, was visited by two  racketeers with a business proposal -- without causing a fuss  and without needlessly bothering the militia (we have our people  working in the militia, they said) he must come up with 6  million by such and such a day, or else...    The boss was somewhat flabbergasted and tried to show that,  in the first place, he did not have that kind of money, because  he lived on his modest pay, and second, he was already paying a  regular amount through the proper channels, and he gave the name  of a specific representative of the "Kuban business world." No  dice! The uninvited guests were insistent. Where it will all  end no one knows....    To round off, I would like to borrow the words of the poet,  paraphrase them somewhat, and ask the question: "Who is my  militia protecting?"</p>

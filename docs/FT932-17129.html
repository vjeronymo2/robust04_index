			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Japanese swords far exceed estimates: Saleroom A SMALL but choice collection of Japanese swords belonging to the late Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing, the only non-Japanese to be made a member of the Japanese Sword Society, fetched prices far exceeding estimates at Sotheby's in London yesterday. The top price of Pounds 265,500 was paid by a Japanese dealer for a long sword blade (katana) by Yamaura Tamaki Masayuki, dated 1839 but made using 13th century techniques. Trade bidding from Japan, Europe and the US secured most of the 38 lots, in many cases for private clients. The collection, one of the finest outside Japan, realised Pounds 754,373, with 98 per cent sold by value. At Wednesday's sale of the Swedlow collection of Japanese works of art, oriental art dealers Eskenazi encountered little competition from trade or private bidders, securing five out of the six top lots. The London firm paid Pounds 52,100 for a highly unusual black lacquer inro (small box) inlaid with black metal alloy and gold, signed by the 19th-century craftsmen Hara Yoyusai and Haruaki Hogen. The Swedlow collection of inro was one of the finest to come on the market in the past 20 years. Many of the more important pieces were bought in against high estimates. The Swedlow netsuke (carved ivory) fared better, with only 14 per cent unsold. Sotheby's had expected the collection to realise Pounds 1.2m. It made Pounds 380,080 with only 41 per cent sold by value.</p>

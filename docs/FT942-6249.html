			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Warning to Berlusconi on inflation Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday warned the new Berlusconi government against introducing inflationary policies to stimulate economic recovery after two years of harsh recession. Mr Fazio made it clear the bank would raise interest rates if the recovery encouraged excessive consumer demand and began to ignore the continuing need to reduce Italy's large public sector deficit. 'A recovery which is too rapid and too heavily weighted towards consumption would require immediate corrective action,' he said. 'While the central bank will continue to provide support for the present state of the economy and for employment, it is also alert to any pressure on costs and prices. The moment the recovery ceases to be non-inflationary, monetary policy must be aimed at halting price increases by resorting to a rise in interest rates.' The warning was the central point the governor's annual economic statement - regarded as the bank's single most important economic analysis during the year. The Berlusconi government is less than three weeks old and has spelled out few details of its committment to stimulate the current timid recovery. But Mr Fazio's comments are likely to become the benchmark against which government policy will be judged. The bank is clearly concerned that Mr Berlusconi's rhetorical electoral promise of creating 1m jobs and encouraging business confidence through fiscal incentives risks being inflationary. Italy's inflation, annualised at 4.1 percent, still remains well above the average despite a sharp drop in domestic demand and a drop in real earnings over the past two years. He gave cautious endorsement to the cabinet's decision last Friday to unfreeze public works blocked by the two-year-old corruption scandals and moves by the previous Ciampi government to introduce new laws on bidding and awarding contracts. Public works investments fell last year by 16 per cent, he said. Renewed investment could help job creation and the recovery, as well as raise the standard of Italy's poor infrastructure. But Mr Fazio insisted old habits of wastage and corruption had to be avoioded. In the context of public works projects, Mr Fazio backed the Delors White Paper on job creation through infrastructure projects. By emphasising this and almost ignoring the issue of moves towards monetary union, this suggests the bank will continue to adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards developments over implementation of the Maastricht Treaty. Mr Fazio was careful to stick to technical advice and thus avoid an early confrontation with the new government, several of whose members are anxious to curb the 100-year-old institution's autonomy. On public spending he threw his weight behind the new government's desire to reduce the excessive benefits of the state pensions scheme. He made no mention of a successor to Mr Lamberto Dini, who left from being the governor's deputy to become treasury minister on May 18. Instead he paid fullsome tribute to Mr Dini's role especially on the international scene and looked forward to 'intense collaboration' between the treasury and the Bank of Italy. But he also concluded with a reminder of the bank's ultimate role. 'Acting in the exclusive interests of the country with the aim of contributing to stable development, the Bank of Italy will be careful to prevent any brusque movement in the value of the currency,' he said.</p>

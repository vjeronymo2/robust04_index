"The new looks taken on by Pyongyang and  many miracles wrought in all parts of the country are a  brilliant fruition of his wise guidance," the ambassador stated.    "All the moves of the imperialists against the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea," he said, "will be frustrated by the  might of the Korean people united in one mind behind the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il."    The ambassador further said:    "As they have great parties and great peoples and, notably,  as they are guided by Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Fidel  Castro Ruz, great leaders, Cuba and Korea will win surely."    He said the party, government and people of Cuba fully  support the Korean people's just cause of the independent and  peaceful reunification of the country, adding: "This support  will be expressed continuously till the 70 million Korean people  have raised stormy cheers of reunification at the Kim Il-song  square."    Kang Song-san, Politburo member of the Central Committee of  the Workers' Party of Korea and premier of the Administration  Council, in his speech said the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  has performed undying feats for the country and the nation, the  times and mankind with his outstanding ideological and  theoretical activities and wise guidance.    "Seeing the complicated and tragic developments in the  international arena in recent years, the Korean and the Cuban  people felt more keenly than anyone else the national pride and  honor of making revolution under the guidance of great and  illustrious leaders," he said, and continued:    "We express firm solidarity with the Cuban people, noting  with high appreciation that they, rallied close around Comrade  Fidel Castro, the supreme leader of their revolution, invariably  abide by the revolutionary principle and advance along the road  of socialism, courageously overcoming difficulties and trials.    "The Cuban people's cause of defending the motherland and  revolution and socialism will certainly end in victory.    "We will make every effort to further deepen the bonds of  friendship, solidarity and unity with the Cuban people, true to  the instructions of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il that  the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries  should be held dear."

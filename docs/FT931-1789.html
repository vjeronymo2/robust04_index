			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: USAir says BA ties may strengthen MR SETH Schofield, chief executive of USAir, said yesterday the alliance with British Airways could extend well beyond the two carriers' code-sharing agreement. This was regardless of whether further investment by the British carrier in his airline was approved by the US government. BA has invested Dollars 300m for a potential 19.9 per cent stake in the US airline. Mr Schofield was speaking before a meeting between 20 senior executives of both airlines - the first such gathering since the US Department of Transportation formally approved the code-sharing arrangement and a wet-lease agreement, on a one-year basis, two weeks ago. The meeting, he said, was designed to set the agenda and tone for the relationship between the two airlines, and to assign tasks for exploring joint business opportunities. There is a four-man task force, made up of two representatives from each carrier, studying the operational opportunities. Mr Schofield said the code-sharing agreement aimed to encompass 38 cities, and involve four USAir hubs, by January 1994. Under the arrangement, BA would operate the transatlantic portion of a flight and USAir the internal US element, but the flight would carry a common designator code in computer reservation systems. The USAir chief executive said there was scope for extending the alliance. This could involve connecting flights more broadly and rescheduling flight times. Another possibility would be to combine the two carriers buying power - for example, over fuel or even aircraft - and to blend operationally in areas such as ground handling. Mr Schofield said he was fairly confident there was little threat of anti-trust litigation - a concern which Northwest Airlines claimed hampered any significant operational integration with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. 'I think we're fine with the Justice Department,' he said, adding that the BA-USAir arrangement had been structured differently from Northwest-KLM. In the case of joint buying, Mr Schofield stressed such action would have to benefit both carriers' business, and might have to be handled by a joint venture. The link-up between BA and USAir has been contentious with the big three US carriers arguing that BA was essentially gaining access to the US domestic market without the British government giving them additional entry to the UK and continental Europe. A Dollars 750m plan which envisaged full integration of BA and USAir and common branding was withdrawn by BA last December when the US transportation secretary indicated he would not approve it.</p>

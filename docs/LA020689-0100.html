			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DESKTOP COMPUTER PRICE CUT $200  </P> <P> Compaq Computer Corp. said today it has cut the suggested retail prices of its  Deskpro 386S desktop computers by $200, sending its share price lower.  </P> <P> Compaq was down $1.75 at $72.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Traders said there is concern among investors that the price cuts may hurt the  Houston-based personal computer maker's earnings or signal a weakness in sales  of the 386S models.  </P> <P> But Compaq spokesman Bob Beach said demand remains strong for the 386S line,  which uses Intel Corp.'s 80386SX microprocessor. The line was introduced in  June, 1988, and supplies just recently caught up with demand, he said.  </P> <P> Compaq said the new price of the Deskpro 386 Model I was $3,599, while the  Model 20 and Model 40 machines were priced at $4,299 and $4,999 respectively.  </P> <P> Beach said the timing of the price cuts followed Compaq's normal pattern for  lowering prices over the course of a product's life. "This is pretty much in  line with time lines for other products," he said. He said the reductions also  reflect lower costs for the Intel chip.  </P></p>

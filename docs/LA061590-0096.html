			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF: BURBANK;  </P> <P> PANEL OKS PURCHASE OF TRAIN DEPOT  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Transportation Commission committee on Thursday approved  the city of Burbank's proposed purchase of the Burbank Train Depot for $3.5  million to be used as a transit center and commuter rail station. The  commission's Planning and Mobility Improvement Committee voted to recommend  that the commission at its June 27 meeting release the funds to the city to buy  the depot from the Southern Pacific railroad.  </P> <P> The money would be taken from the city's share of the proceeds of the extra  half-cent sales tax that county voters approved in 1980. The city hopes to  connect the depot, located west of the Golden State Freeway, to its downtown  shopping area by a pedestrian bridge over the railroad tracks and the freeway.  In addition to serving passengers from commuter trains from downtown to the  Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura, the depot would be a center for bus service  in Burbank, commission staff members said.  </P></p>

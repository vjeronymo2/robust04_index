			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with First Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki </F> by SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program on  15 May -- live]    [Text] [Mashokwe] A very warm welcome to this Sunday  edition of Newsline. Tonight the spotlight falls on the future  of the new government -- how it intends solving some of the long  outstanding problems and how it hopes to bring everlasting peace  and prosperity in this country. The long-awaited dream of a  democratically elected government in South Africa has finally  been realized.    This week's festivities, among others, saw the inauguration  of the president and his two deputy presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki  and Mr. F.W. de Klerk. Now that this time is over, a rough and  tough road is awaiting this new government. Among the problems  which need to be addressed is the aspirations of blacks and the  fears that still exist in some of our white compatriots. With  me in the studio to discuss the road ahead is the deputy  president of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Good evening to  you, sir, and welcome.    [Mbeki] Good evening, Leslie.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, are you settling in?    [Mbeki] Yes, we are in the process of settling in Leslie. We  ... [pauses] Everybody is moving into new offices and finding  staff and discovering where the dining rooms are and where the  toilets are and things like this. Yes, yes, I think everybody  is in the process of doing that.    [Mashokwe] Let us into the last cabinet meeting you had. We  are talking about a government of national unity, a potpourri of  people from different backgrounds. Is it working? Will it  work? Are there problems?    [Mbeki] It will work. It will work. I think the ... we are  all of us proceeding, I think from the same basis, that there  are certain things that need to be done in the country. People  need jobs and I don't think any of the parties represented in  the cabinet would disagree with that. We need to ensure that  the standard of living of the people throughout the country is  raised and I think everybody would agree with that. All of us  agree that we need to attend to the matter of violence, whether  political or criminal. That has to be attended to. We need to  ensure that we have proper relations with the rest of the world.  I think all of these matters are agreed, so we are starting,  maybe broadly speaking, from the same base, and I think that  that's what will assist in making this cabinet -- never mind  that it's got three parties in it -- a cohesive unit. I'm sure  about that.    [Mashokwe] Are there problems?    [Mbeki] Well, the ...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Insurmountable -- insurmountable  problems.    [Mbeki] You mean within the cabinet? Sure, I would imagine  that there would be tensions. We are all coming from different  points. We've got different histories. We've just come out of  an election campaign that was vigorously fought and people need  to get to know one another better. Yes, I would imagine that  there would be tensions, but as I say that there's a broad  vision which we all of us share and that fact ought to help in  terms of overcoming whatever problems there might be in terms of  people getting used to one another.    [Mashokwe] The big expectation out there is that of nation  building and reconciliation. What would you regard as  priorities as you step into this? The party's over and  government has got to start operating now.    [Mbeki] Well, the ... Parliament resumes Leslie on the 24th  of this month, and the president will give a state of the nation  address, and we expect that that nation, or that state of the  nation address will reflect the opinion of the cabinet as a  whole. I think that will be an important moment when this new  government says: We are speaking with one voice with regard to  various matters, and that ought to translate in terms of the  constituencies of the various parties in the cabinet, that at  that level -- that process of national reconciliation, of  building one country, of determining priorities and programs --  that it is possible to do all of that despite the fact that you  are dealing with different parties, so I think that's going to  be an important moment, because at that point, as I say, the  cabinet will speak with one voice, I hope, and that ought to  send the message to the country that we can and must, as  different political entities, act together.    We want, also, to ensure that in the preparation of that  presentation by the president, that the president would have  consulted further, further than the parties represented in the  cabinet -- the unions, the business community, the civic  organizations, the traditional leaders and so on, so that you  ... what you should then get coming across on the 24th of May,  is a national vision.    [Mashokwe] But that doesn't answer my question on what you  as  deputy president will regard as priorities.    [Mbeki] Sure, the priorities. I thought you were asking a  question about what needs to be done to convey an image, a  message of reconciliation and of acting together. With regard  to priorities, surely the priority, the basic priority, must be  to -- as quickly as is possible -- to change the conditions of  life of the people. That has to be basic, whether it relates to  jobs or housing or health or education or land or any of these  questions. That has to be fundamental priority. The people  have won their democratic rights. They voted -- exercised that  right, elected government of their choice. The next step in the  emancipation of the people must be to address the issues of  freedom from hunger, freedom from poverty, from want -- all of  those sorts of questions. That must be priority.    Of course there must be detailed programs -- when ... what  do  you do with housing? What do you do with job creation,  provision of water in the countryside and all these questions?  But I think that that's a priority that must underpin this.    I was saying earlier that one of the questions again that is  critically important is the matter of violence. Just now, on  Friday, 12 people got killed at Thokoza. We ought not to have  anything of that kind. More than 400 people have been killed in  Natal since the state of emergency was declared. That must be  priority. It's both political and criminal violence -- but that  must be priority in terms of the programs that this new  government must engage in.    [Mashokwe] Let's go back to the issue of reconciliation if  we  may. Sir, the point is people were murdered, maimed, killed in  the past and you talk ... [pauses] The ANC talks of a commission  of truth. At one point we have amnesty for security generals --  people, and the question is: Are you going to come up with a  blanket amnesty for political killings at the expense of people  who probably still have that pain in their heart, who were  killed, maimed, during those days?    [Mbeki] Leslie, this new government of national unity has  not  yet discussed this question, so I couldn't speak for that  government on this issue. It is clearly a matter that must be  addressed. Our own view with regard to this is that if we took  the route of amnesty, indemnity, whatever, it would be important  that anybody affected -- it doesn't matter from where they come  -- whether they come from the ANC or from anywhere else, that  they must say what it is they want to be indemnified for. If I  ask for indemnity, I need to say: These are the things that I  did for which I require indemnity, but as I say, the matter has  not been discussed. It clearly is one of the issues that will  be discussed by this new government, but I am reflecting on a  discussion which I think goes beyond the ANC. Even the legal  community in the country is raising the point, that if there is  to be amnesty for anybody it needs to be known what it is that  they are applying for.    [Mashokwe] But will that not open up wounds?    [Mbeki] No, the intention is not to open up wounds. The  intention is to solve an existing problem, and as you are  saying, there are many problems that have not been solved. I've  got a first cousin of mine who disappeared. We don't know -- as  a family we have looked. We have asked questions. We don't  know where he is. He has disappeared. It's possible that  somebody out there knows, and it will be good for the family  that they know -- not for purposes of retribution -- so that at  least we know that this person is gone forever. No, it's not  for purposes of retribution. We are not after Nuremberg trials.  We are ... [pauses] It's necessary to clean the slate, to solve  these outstanding questions -- answer them, and so that we can  at least know what it is that we should never repeat again, in  future.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, I need to ask you this one. It's very  important. You are deputy president and reports reaching us  here indicate that in the next two years or so Mr. Mandela might  be handing over the reins of power to you. Is that the plan?    [Mbeki] No Leslie, the ... [pauses] I heard today that a  London newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, carried some report that  Nelson Mandela is going to retire after two years or something  -- absolutely no truth to this. In fact we ... I found it  rather reprehensible that you could get a newspaper like that  and whoever writes for it, writing a thing like that. They ...  [pauses] I'm quite certain. They didn't even have the courtesy  to ask Nelson Mandela is this true. I know they certainly  didn't come to me. No substance of any truth at all to this,  and dealing with this particular newspaper it's not the first  time that they floated all sorts of funny ideas which, you know,  seem to us clearly intended to destabilize the ANC, in this  instance to destabilize the new government, the presidency.  There's no substance. Nelson Mandela has been elected to lead  this country for five years when we'll have the next election,  and it will be up to the ANC and Mandela to decide whether he  stands for a second term of office. There's no truth whatsoever  to the story and as I say I think it's rather reprehensible. I  think it's ... [pauses] You are a journalist. You are part of  the media. I think it is bad ethics for the media to handle  matters in the way that this particular newspaper has handled  this matter.    [Mashokwe] But you are the national chairman. You are the  deputy president. It is not ludicrous, anyway, for people to  speculate in that direction. Is it?    [Mbeki] Well, you see, sure -- I suppose there's no law  against speculation. That's perfectly alright, but to assert  this matter in the way as I understand that this particular  newspaper asserted it, that highly-placed sources in the ANC,  whatever phrase was used. I think that's bad, particularly  that, I mean, if this was serious I would have expected that  your fellow journalists would try and seek Nelson Mandela's  opinion to say: Mr. President, I understand the following --  what's your view? But they don't, and the intention can't be  honorable. The intention can't be to inform. I think the  intention is something else.    [Mashokwe] Okay, let's look at other issues -- death  penalty. Some right-wingers were given the death sentence very  recently. There are question marks around the ANC's policy on  death penalty, some say the official one ... [pauses] line is --  now, you don't like -- the ANC does not like the death penalty.  Are you going to institute death penalties? Is the ANC  government going to move away from death penalties? What is the  thinking?    [Mbeki] We are against the death penalty, and I'm quite  certain that when the matter gets discussed that's the position  that the ANC will present. We don't think its correct for  ordinary persons like ourselves to take into our hands the power  to take away other people's lives. The matter will be discussed  surely, but as I say, our own view remains that it would not be  correct for the government to give itself such power. The right  to life -- the right to life as South Africans -- I think we  need to be very sensitive to that because too many people have  died in this country, in criminal violence, in political  violence. People continue to die, and I think you want to  create a society which has a sense of revulsion at the fact of  murder, of taking away of people's lives, whether it's done by  elected organs of state or by individuals.    [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, let's think a bit about the Hani  murder, for instance. It occurred during the days of the old  government and the sentence passed, in people's eyes, befitted  the action. Are you going to be standing in the way of the  carrying out of that action?    [Mbeki] Well, as I say Leslie, as I say, talking about the  ANC -- we want to say no. Sure, the commission of crime, of any  crime, must receive the necessary response from the judicial  organs of the country, but we do not believe that this  particular retribution, this particular punishment, death,  solves anything. It perpetuates a notion which is unhealthy,  that people can take other people's lives.    [Mashokwe] Let's move over to matters financial. A lot has  been written in the papers about the pay raises that the new  government has earned itself, or what the Melamet Commission has  recommended. A lot of people say in the days of electioneering,  the ANC, particularly, was vocal on the need to cut on  government expenditure, salaries for that matter. The question  is: What action are you going to be taking now that you are in  government?    [Mbeki] Well, we would like to have the recommendations of  the Melamet Commission discussed by parliament, in the first  instance. There may be some technical problems about payments.  You've got members of parliament sitting there, you've got  ministers sitting there, and there may not be any particular  framework to deal with the matter of their salaries at the end  of this month. That's got to be addressed somehow. But no, we  would want to -- parliament, and society in general -- to  participate in the debate as to ... about this particular  matters, so there hasn't been a decision, certainly not on the  part of the ANC and certainly not on the part of Parliament, to  say that we accept the recommendations of the Melamet Commission.    We would want all those matters discussed openly and  criteria, rules, principles and all of that, discussed and  agreed, but I think we also need to say this Leslie, that it's  important not to set up a salary structure for elected officials  such that you expose those elected officials to bribery, and  that's important. If you take an elected official and you pay  them at rates which are clearly inadequate you expose them to  temptation. You also clearly don't need to pay those elected  officials at rates that are far above what people in equivalent  positions are earning, because you are creating a different  problem.    So I'm saying that we need to find a balanced solution to  this question, but certainly, if you said you want to have your  elected officials living as though in monasteries or nunneries,  what's going to happen? You are going to call them back here to  say: Why did you accept this money from here or there, because  in the end, in terms of maintaining families and leading  ordinary lives, if you expose them to poverty, they will ...  they will be susceptible to bribes.    [Mashokwe] Today's newspapers indicate that a national debt  of 60 billion rand has been accumulated and you are receiving  this in your hands as you move into office. Is that a priority?  Is that a problem?    [Mbeki] The size of the national debt is a problem. It's  been a very ... [pauses] It's become a very high-ranking element  in terms of public expenditure. The servicing of that public  debt -- it has been -- last year it was, I understood, second  after education -- I hear ... I see in the press now that it's  likely to become the first element. Yes it is a worrying factor  because it means that you tax the public, raise public revenues  in order to service, to pay the banks. It's something that must  be addressed very seriously and it's part of the constraint.  It's part of the constraint in terms of the handling of public  finances, that you couldn't act in a way which once more raises  that public debt, because I say in the end you have national  resources being consumed by servicing that. It's a real  situation. It's unfortunate that it happened, but we inherited  it and we've got to deal with it as best as we can.    [Mashokwe] You referred earlier on to violence that has been  rearing its head here and there in the country. The question  is: Are we going to see you being able to cut on defense and  security in the coming years, as it was envisaged by the ANC --  we will cut money on defense, use it for other things. What is  the situation now as you move into real government.    [Mbeki] Yes, we do believe it's a -- if you are talking  about defense -- it should be possible to keep those defense  figures low, because, in the first instance, you know we've got  to read the situation. What is the threat to this democratic  South Africa? We are talking about the defense forces. Does  Swaziland threaten us, or Lesotho, or Botswana, whatever,  meriting whatever expenditure -- or do we have a naval threat  from India so that we must buy many naval ships and all that? I  would imagine that that kind of threat is not really there.  That should help to address the issue of what source of  expenditure we should have on defense.    With regard to the maintenance of law and order, hopefully  the situation is going to change, the situation with regard to  the relationship between the police and the public. I know for  a fact that the new minister of safety and security is very  concerned about this matter, senior police officers are  concerned about this matter, because I do believe that once you  change that relationship between the police and the people, the  capacity of the police to prevent crime and to catch wrongdoers  will be much increased. It may not need more policemen, it will  certainly need better cooperation between the people and the  police.    [Mashokwe] Millions of rands have been pledged to the  country  by foreign governments over the past few days. America spoke of  600 million dollars and we say, where is this money going to?    [Mbeki] That money ought to go into reconstruction and  development. It ought to go directly into projects that are  targeted at improving the conditions of life of the people,  whether it's housing or health, clean water in the rural areas,  roads so that people have got access -- that's where it ought to  go.    [Mashokwe] But if past experiences are anything to go by,  many of these monies have ended up in bureaucracies, and this  brings me to the question of civil service. A smaller,  efficient civil service is what the ANC was taking about. Does  this mean people are going to lose their jobs?    [Mbeki] Well, we don't have past experience Leslie in this  country [laughter] because there has never been a democratic  government.    [Mashokwe] Eh, but there was a government [words  indistinct].    [Mbeki] Yeah, not a democratic one anyway. No, with regard  to the public service. We have said, indeed, that we are not  after sacking anybody. We -- job security is guaranteed,  questions of pensions are not going to be affected, but clearly  we have got to keep public expenditure down with regards to that  kind of expenditure. I am not talking about capital  expenditure, public works programs, and so on. We have got to  keep recurrent expenditure down, so the ANC certainly does not  have any intention of a radical increase in numbers of people  within the public service, who are -- without offending anybody  -- who are pen-pushers, and I think it will be possible. There  are many structures of government that are being established in  terms of the new constitution, which structures of government we  will probably need the civil servants that are already employed.  We might have to increase, somewhat, but I am saying that we  are not looking forward to a radical rise in recurrent  expenditure because clearly it would have a negative impact.    [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, how then are you going to be  implementing affirmative actions? People who voted for the ANC  believed that their lot would be changed come an ANC government?    [Mbeki] Well, yes, sure, change must happen. Change must  happen. Change does not happen necessarily because you increase  the number of people in an office from five to 20. Change can  happen in many ways. You see, for instance the South African  economy, the South African economy needs very many skilled  people, whether they are technicians or engineers or whatever.  So I mean, it ought not to be that we proceed from the position  that to create employment take them into the public service.  Why don't we say, in the context of a growing economy you are  going to need all the skills?    [Mashokwe] Is it out of question, Mr. Mbeki -- I have to  butt  in here -- to say there are people who were advantaged by the  apartheid government then, who ascended to positions like that  of a general, and somebody who voted for you would want to say,  I have been in civil service and I hope to be able to move up  there because the government has changed, and I have the  qualifications. I was denied this in the past?    [Mbeki] Sure, very legitimate, and I would believe that the  public service commission for instance would look very favorably  at that. We want to remove racism, we want to remove  discrimination, whether gender or race. We need to remove that  discrimination from the system, and indeed you are quite right,  you might find that there are people who have the competence,  the experience, the qualifications, but who were kept down  because there was apartheid, and that those matters certainly  need to be addressed.    [Mashokwe] Is South Africa rejoining the world -- the OAU,  SADC [Southern African Development Community], PTA [Preferential  Trade Area], AFD [expansion unknown]?    [Mbeki] The new South Africa will be admitted by the OAU  when  it meets at summit level during the month of June. We certainly  will be looking for an early meeting with the SADC to look at --  there has been prior discussion with them about this -- but to  look at what happens, how South Africa joins this grouping, and  many groups like this, the African Development Bank...    [Mashokwe, interrupting] Commonwealth?    [Mbeki] Commonwealth, yes. In our own view South Africa  should go back into the Commonwealth, but again this is a  decision that the new government will have to take.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki thanks for your time, and thanks for  talking to us.    [Mbeki] Thanks.</p>

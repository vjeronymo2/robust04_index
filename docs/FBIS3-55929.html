			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Ovcharenko and Leonid Timofeyev under the </F> "Ambassadorial Rumors" rubric: "How Diplomats Are Packaged"]    [Text] The resignation request from Russian First Deputy  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin was submitted to President  Yeltsin even before the New Year holiday. The reason for this  was his election to the State Duma as a representative of the  Yabloko bloc.    And he will be replaced as deputy minister by the current  Russian ambassador to Spain, Igor Ivanov. He is well-known in  the Foreign Ministry, as he headed that department's general  secretariat for a long time.    An additional two ambassadors will occupy offices in the  skyscraper on Smolensk Square. They are Aleksandr Panov,  ambassador to South Korea; and Albert Chernyshev, who has  represented Russia in Turkey for six years now.    The Russian Foreign Ministry has made it known that all  these  reshuffles are of planned nature and are in line with the  principle of staff rotation. They do not hide their  satisfaction there that leading posts will be occupied by career  diplomats.    The fate of the ambassador in London, Boris Pankin, will  probably be different. For the time being he remains there, but  the decision to replace him was made long ago.    According to our information, the Tetrapak company, which  intends to pool its efforts in the near future with the French  company, Alfa-Laval, on learning that Boris Pankin was about to  leave his post, immediately offered him a job as a consultant in  "any country" of his choice. He has supposedly opted for  Sweden, where, we remind you, he was once ambassador. Tetrapak  produces packaging, including cartons for milk.    Some are moving into commerce, others returning to big-time  politics. When we rang Washington, [Ambassador] Vladimir  Petrovich Lukin was upbeat. In masterly fashion he parried our  probing question, "Is it true that you are down to be deputy  speaker?" "I am ready for anything? Let's see when we get  there. Incidentally, the job is not that attractive, it's pure  anxiety and turmoil, particularly if they decide to turn the  speaker into a lightning rod." Vladimir Petrovich said. "I  don't envy the speaker--he will have a tough job."    While observing that he knew several suitable people who  could occupy the vacant ambassadorial posts, Lukin was reluctant  to give their names so as to avoid, as we understood it,  inadvertently doing them an ill turn. On the other hand, he  gladly told us about the attributes which they, according to the  diplomat, should possess. In Washington he would like to see  someone with considerable experience and knowledge of both the  language and the country.    The Washington Embassy throughtout has been a source of  alternative information for the president, the government, and  the Foreign Ministry. A valuable quality for those who know how  to avoid being in thrall to "convenient" assessments.</p>

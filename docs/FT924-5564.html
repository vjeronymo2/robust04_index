			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Bloodstock VAT change 'threatens jobs' THOUSANDS of jobs could be lost in the British horsebreeding industry under a value added tax regime to be introduced on January 1, a cross-party committee of MPs heard yesterday. Mr Christopher Haines, chief executive of the Jockey Club, told the Commons employment committee the VAT charges were the reason why Tattersalls, the UK's largest bloodstock auctioneer, was moving its most prestigious sales to Ireland, where VAT is almost 15 percentage points lower than in the UK. Tattersalls said yesterday it had previously believed that horses brought from Ireland or France for sale at Newmarket would be liable for VAT at rates applying in their country of origin, but it now appears that VAT will be charged at the full UK rate. The racing world has been warning for some time that the UK was in danger of losing its position as a centre for horse breeding and sales. Racing trade organisations say the UK's high level of VAT, at 17.5 per cent, is driving buyers to Ireland, where VAT is 2.7 per cent, and to France, with its 5.5 per cent rate. The government has refused a request from horsebreeders to impose a lower rate of VAT or to register them for VAT - as occurs in France - which would mean they would get the VAT they pay back. Horsebreeders claim they will be at a disadvantage with competitors including France, which Mr Haines said was more flexible. He said: 'We are playing Marquess of Queensberry rules with people who are not doing so.' The British government had been slow to heed the threat to an industry that provided employment for 30,000 people directly and 100,000 indirectly. Tattersalls said most of its auctions would still be held at its headquarters in Newmarket. The move to Ireland applies only to the top-of-the-market Houghton yearlings sale, where prices are over Pounds 20,000, and the tax differential has hit particularly hard. Houghton sales account for about a third of Tattersalls' turnover, which was Pounds 53m last year and is expected to fall to Pounds 35m this year. The absence of Arab buyers - previously big spenders at Newmarket - from October's Houghton sale was blamed on the high tax levels. They were well represented at the Irish sales soon after. Britain's betting industry is pressing the government to relax restrictions that prevent betting shops opening in the evening. A Gallup survey sponsored by the Betting Office Licensees Association shows that most customers want betting shops, which at present must shut at 6.30pm, to remain open to cover evening racing in the summer and satellite televised races at other times of the year. It is argued that the exchequer, which at present collects Pounds 500m a year in duty from the betting industry, would be a big beneficiary as turnover would increase by at least 10 per cent if evening opening were allowed, bringing in an additional Pounds 50m or more in tax. Evening opening would also secure current employment and create a substantial number of jobs.</p>

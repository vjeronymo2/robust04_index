			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Two cheers for Howard's way IT WAS never going to be easy to reform police pay and conditions. Rooting out restrictive practices in the UK police service is essential to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. Yet these objectives will not be achieved if change unnecessarily antagonises those in the front line of the government's battle against crime. Nor will it command the support of the general public who have only recently been reminded of the special nature of police work with the murder in London of PC Dunne. So Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has probably done as much as was possible to preserve the thrust of the Sheehy report against the fierce - often ruthless - opposition of the police staff associations. Yesterday he announced his acceptance of several contentious elements in the package recommended by Sir Patrick Sheehy's inquiry. These include the elimination of three management levels and the simplification of the pay structure by abolishing most allowances. The new pay formula should stop police pay surging ahead as it has done over the past 15 years. The home secretary has also endorsed the principle of performance-related pay for the police, though in a simpler form than that recommended by Sheehy. And while he has rightly rejected the controversial proposal for fixed-term contracts for all ranks, the new disciplinary procedures he announced last month will make it easier to get rid of poor performers. Chief constables will have much greater flexibility to run their forces in line with local needs. On the other hand, Mr Howard has rejected Sheehy's call for police starting pay to be cut. He says that he is anxious to attract older recruits, a worthwhile ambition. Yet this could be achieved without having to pay younger recruits salaries which the Sheehy inquiry found to be 'well above the market'. The home secretary has also passed on to others much of the detailed discussion over the Sheehy recommendations. The police pension scheme is to be further reviewed, though the proposal that police officers should work for 40 years to get a full pension has been rejected. Overtime for inspectors is to be abolished, but for other ranks the issue will be passed to the Police Negotiations Board, along with other detailed work. While this tripartite body should be consulted on such matters, it will find it hard to take unpopular decisions. The early welcome for the government's decisions from the chief police officers is a good omen from the point of view of morale. Without the backing of senior management, such reforms are unlikely to achieve their ends. But there remains an uncomfortable suspicion that Mr Howard has been bounced into conceding more than is necessary by the skilled campaigning of the well-organised police staff associations. With the government lacking confidence in its ability to carry a parliamentary majority, it is perhaps the best that could have been achieved.</p>

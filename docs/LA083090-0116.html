			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT AGAINST MOBIL SET FOR TRIAL  </P> <P> The trial of the lawsuit filed against Mobil Oil Corp. by the city of Torrance  is set to begin Nov. 5, and the city attorney predicts it could last six to  eight weeks.  </P> <P> The date was set by Superior Court Judge Gary Hastings at a Tuesday conference  of attorneys in the case.  </P> <P> The suit is part of a continuing controversy over the safety of Mobil's  refinery in northeast Torrance. Public attention was focused on the refinery  after a series of accidents, including a massive explosion in November, 1987.  </P> <P> The city sued Mobil in April, 1989, claiming the refinery is a public nuisance  and seeking the power to regulate it.  </P> <P> City Atty. Kenneth L. Nelson said Wednesday that although the parties have  discussed a settlement, "We're still pretty far apart." Mobil attorneys were  not available for comment.  </P></p>

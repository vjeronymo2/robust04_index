Security Council to adopt an effective resolution  in order to ensure security on the Israeli-held territories,  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin said.    Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Demurin  said that the world community should pay attention to the idea  of international protection of civilians in the West Bank and  Gaza Strip. The alarming situation following the barbaric crime  committed by an Israeli extremist in Hebron forces Russia to  take further active steps in order to help overcome the current  crisis in the endangered peace process.    The lack of progress in the Middle East talks shows that  there is the need to give the process of reconciliation between  the Arabs and Israelis a new international impetus, Demurin  said. "The second plenary session of the Madrid conference on  the Middle East at the foreign minister level could become such  an impulse. As for the immediate future, Russia stands for the  continuation of bilateral talks which could be held where it is  convenient for their participants," the spokesman said.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Dairy Farm advances 11% despite currency movement Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday reported an 11 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 197.5m for 1993, up from Dollars 177.8m the year before. Mr Tim Westinghouse, finance director, said earnings were hit by currency fluctuations, especially in Australia and the UK, combined with a competitive retail climate and low inflation in many of the countries in which the group operates. Nonetheless, the results were ahead of market expectations. Earnings per share climbed 4 per cent to 11.28 cents, following last year's Dollars 202m rights issue of convertible preference shares. Shareholders will receive a final dividend of 4.1 cents, up from 3.9 cents a year ago. Profits before interest fell 15 per cent to Dollars 64.6m in Australia, where the group operates 238 Franklins stores and three Big Fresh outlets, partially due to the fall in currency but also because of increased overheads prompted by Sunday trading and the move into Big Fresh. Contributions from the UK, where Dairy Farm owns 29 per cent of Kwik Save, were lifted by record earnings at the discount store; but the Spanish retail chain Simago continued to make a loss. The chain, acquired in 1990, is expected to turn into the black this year. Asia produced Dollars 93.6m of profits before interest, with Wellcome supermarkets in Taiwan making their first full-year profit. In Hong Kong, the supermarkets performed satisfactorily in spite of spiralling wage and rental costs. Dairy Farm also announced its intention to buy up 'odd lots' of shares from Hong Kong and Singapore small investors - some 30 per cent of the firm's shareholders hold fewer than the 1,000 shares which make up a board lot - at a 5 per cent premium to the market price: a move which could potentially cost the group Dollars 1.8m if fully taken up. It affects just 0.06 per cent of Dairy Farm's issued share capital.</p>

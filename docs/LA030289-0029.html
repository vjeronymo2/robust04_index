			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> KENDALL HOPES SWITCH WON'T CHANGE HIS LUCK  </P> <P> The last time Tom Kendall made a switch, he had just won his second straight  International Motor Sports Assn. GTU championship driving a Mazda. But the  switch didn't hurt him. He moved into an untried Chevrolet Beretta -- and won a  third championship.  </P> <P> Now the 22-year-old UCLA senior from La Canada Flintridge is switching again,  but not his make of car. He is leaving IMSA's GTU class -- for grand touring  cars with engine displacement under two liters -- to drive a C&amp;C Beretta in  the Sports Car Club of America's Trans-Am series.  </P> <P> Making the move with Kendall, a member of the 1988 racing writers All-American  team, will be his long-time teammate, Max Jones of Long Beach. Jones, the 1987  SCCA race truck champion, finished third in GTU last season.  </P> <P> The Trans-Am season will begin April 15 as part of the Long Beach Grand Prix  weekend, featuring Indy cars on the following day.  </P> <P> This weekend, Kendall will take a trial run in the Beretta in an IMSA GTO race  at the Grand Prix of Miami, a street race along the shores of Biscayne Bay.  </P> <P> "It will be pretty much last year's car with a new (and larger) engine plugged  in," Kendall said before leaving for Florida. "It's mainly to give us an idea  what to expect from the larger engine."  </P> <P> The Beretta, which was powered by a three-liter Chevrolet V-6 last year when  Kendall and Jones won seven of 11 races and the GTU manufacturer's  championship, will have a 4.5-liter V-6 engine for the Miami race and the  Trans-Am. Last year's win was the first for a domestic car maker in IMSA's  18-year history.  </P> <P> "We'll be the underdogs in Trans-Am, but we were the underdogs at the start of  last year, too," Kendall said. "We really thought it would take a couple of  years before we could win in GTU, but when we accomplished our goal the first  year, C&amp;C decided to take another step up."  </P> <P> Audi Quatrro won the Trans-Am manufacturer's championship last year, with  Hurley Haywood, an Audi dealer from Ponte Vedra, Fla., winning the individual  crown. The veteran Haywood, who has won four 24-hour races at Daytona and two  at Le Mans, won only two of the 100-mile sprints but he finished in the top  four in nine of 13 races. So far this year, however, Audi has not announced  plans to defend its championship.  </P> <P> "For me, personally, Trans-Am is another step toward my ultimate goal, getting  into an Indy car program," Kendall said. "Five of the Trans-Am races will be  run with CART Indy cars, so I'll get plenty of exposure, and with the way  Chevrolet motors performed last year, I can't help but feel good."  </P> <P> Chevrolet-powered cars won 14 of 15 Indy car races last season.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that if an engine does well in one  series, it should do well in the next one," Kendall said. "This year will be  important for me because I will get some higher horsepower experience. The  other thing I need is some oval track experience. I need to get a feel for it  if I want to get an Indy car ride."  </P> <P> Kendall has driven in only two oval races, both in Formula Russell in 1985,  when he was only 18.  </P> <P> Although Kendall will drive the '88 model Beretta in the Miami race, he and  Jones will have new models for the Trans-Am, along with full technical support  from Chevrolet.  </P> <P> Kendall also is taking 16 units of economics at UCLA en route to graduation  next year. He has a 2.9 grade-point average.  </P> <P> "I'll make it, sooner or later, but it's getting tougher and tougher to make  classes, take my exams, and still get to all the races and tests that we have  scheduled," he said.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- The California Racing Assn. season will open this weekend at  Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix with the Walt James Classic, a pair of 30-lap  main events Friday and Saturday nights. Walt James was president of the CRA for  21 years. Ron Shuman, of nearby Tempe, Ariz., will open defense of his Parnelli  Jones Firestone/CRA championship in a new car. Shuman, who was left without a  ride when his car owner, Ed Ulyate, decided not to campaign a car this season,  has signed to drive the famous Tamale Wagon, owned by Alex Morales, Inc.  </P> <P> The CRA will race March 11 at Raven Speedway in Tucson before opening Ascot  Park's 1989 season March 18. The non-winged sprinters will compete on 12  different tracks in six states in a 56-race season that will last nine months.  Thirty of the races will be at Ascot.  </P> <P> MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's Jolly Rancher Candies Western States  regional championship series will make its 1989 dirt track debut Saturday night  and Sunday afternoon at the Imperial Fairgrounds, near El Centro. The races are  part of the California Midwinter Fair.  </P> <P> Indianapolis 500 veterans Rich Vogler and Johnny Parsons are scheduled to  compete on the 3/8-mile oval. Vogler set a track record of 17.09 seconds last  November, breaking Parsons' year-old record. The California contingent will be  led by Sleepy Tripp, a two-time national champion who has won four regional  championships, including last year's. He won 19 main events last season. Also  entered are P.J. Jones, Robby Flock, Wally Pankratz and 1988 Turkey Night Grand  Prix winner Chuck Gurney.  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLES -- Speedway racers open their season Saturday night in the Coors  Extra Gold Spring Series at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. National champion  Steve Lucero will face a host of British League veterans, led by Sam Ermolenko.  The two-race series will end March 10 at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa  Mesa.  </P> <P> VINTAGE CARS -- The fourth annual La Carrera Classic, for cars 10 years old or  older, will be held Saturday in Baja California on Highway 3, between Ensenada  and San Felipe. Former stuntman Hal Needham set the record of 52 minutes for  the 120-mile course last year while driving his NASCAR stock car.  </P></p>

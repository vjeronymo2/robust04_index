"I would like to break the news to you that there is no  trace  of any disease," the Regent said at a meeting held at the  al-Salt Community College attended by notables and deputies from  al-Balqa' Governorate and heads of local government departments.    The Regent said King Husayn had reassured him in a telephone  conversation about his health and conveyed his best greetings to  the Jordanian people. [passage omitted]</p>

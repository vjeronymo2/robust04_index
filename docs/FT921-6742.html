			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Employment Department to cut 800 jobs THE GOVERNMENT department charged with the task of getting more people into jobs is to cut about 800 of its own posts, it was announced yesterday. The posts in the Training, Enterprise and Education Directorate (Teed), part of the Department of Employment, will be lost after July following a review. Five hundred of the jobs will be shed in Teed's nine regional offices, which administer the Training and Enterprise Councils, and about 300 will go at the central directorate in Sheffield. Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said yesterday there was 'every likelihood' that the cut would be achieved through voluntary measures. He admitted the figures were significant but said it included 150 personnel jobs being transferred from the regions to the Employment Service, which is responsible for initiatives including JobClubs. The Civil and Public Services Union, which with the NUCPS represents the majority of civil servants, said it was appalled at the job cuts. Mr Geoff Lewtas, the union's employment service officer, said: 'They are particularly bad coming at a time of extremely high unemployment. It bodes ill for the department's work in ensuring that Tecs succeed and are properly controlled.' The Department of Employment is one of the government's biggest departments, with 57,000 employees. The directorate employs about 4,500 people. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said yesterday he had written to Mr Howard demanding assurances that the job cuts would not affect training. The Union of Communication Workers, the main postal union, is set to survive after delegates at a special conference yesterday cleared the way for vital structural and strategic reforms. Delegates voted by more than 2-1 not to reject a new industrial agreement being demanded by Royal Mail. The conference will consider amendments for the next three days. Rejection of the agreement could mean financial collapse for the union.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An Encanto man was convicted Friday of premeditated attempted murder in the  shooting of a driver who had given the defendant a ride.  </P> <P> The San Diego Superior Court jury deliberated for only two hours before  convicting Michael Manuel Brito, 26, of attempted murder, which carries a  penalty of life in state prison.  </P> <P> The victim, Eugene Smith, 27, who was shot in the back, identified Brito in  court as the man who shot him Aug. 12. Smith, who worked for the San Diego Park  and Recreation Department, said he stopped on California 94 after seeing the  defendant with a gas can. The assailant pointed a gun at him while getting into  his car, Smith testified, then shot him.  </P> <P> The gunman drove off in Smith's 1981 Cadillac, which was later found stripped  at the end of the street Brito lived on.  </P> <P> The jury also convicted Brito of assault with a deadly weapon and robbery, and  ruled that the victim suffered great bodily injuries, which adds three years to  the sentence.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek said Brito faces a probable life sentence, plus a  consecutive term of 11 years in prison.  </P> <P> Judge Ross Tharp set sentencing for April 7.  </P> <P> After the conviction, the judge ruled that Brito had been convicted of grand  theft and burglary several years ago, a finding that adds six years to the  sentence, said Dusek.  </P> <P> Brito, a mechanic, was arrested Aug. 22 after a tip to the Crime Stoppers  program.  </P></p>

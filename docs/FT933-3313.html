			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (9): 'Keep at it' is Parnaby's prescription - Profile of an industry guru / Paul Cheeseright learns about competitiveness from a leading figure at Lucas Industries JOHN PARNABY is a patient man. His job has demanded that. Now managing director of the applied technology sector at Lucas Industries, he joined the engineering group in 1983 with the brief of making its manufacturing systems competitive. For that he has needed an eye for detail without losing the shape of the big picture. He has long believed that for British industry to be competitive, companies require a new manufacturing strategy which opens the way towards flexible production, the rapid introduction of new products and the maintenance of exact quality. This is as much a matter of organising people as introducing new technology, although the first may lead to the second. He is accepted as an industry guru as well as a practical manager. He embodies the drive towards the introduction of Japanese manufacturing organisation in UK companies, not because it is Japanese particularly but because it has worked. In 1989, just as the first signs of recession appeared, Dr Parnaby thought that Lucas, in its search for competitiveness, was about '40 per cent there'. Now, he suggests, 'we are just more than 50 per cent there because 'there' has moved.' This is not only because of the recession but also because customers are making increasingly heavy demands, such as a 30 per cent cut in prices over three years or a demand that component makers like Lucas shoulder more front-end research spending. 'It all adds up to the fact that we've just got to keep at it.' It is the inability to keep at it, to apply the detail with regard to the large picture, that Dr Parnaby believes is a weakness of British manufacturing. Beating the competition can only be done systematically and it can take a long time: 'the classical British approach is doing some of the things some of the time but not all of the things all of the time.' The length of the recession and pressure from customers have shown manufacturing companies that quick cuts here and there, an attack on development spending or an embargo on capital spending do not ensure future prosperity. Rather, they jeopardise it. 'You can't do a piecemeal job,' warns Dr Parnaby. 'You've got to put in place structured programmes.' He divides UK companies into three. 'There are some good companies which are making good progress; there are others which don't understand the problem; and there's a group in the middle which is having a go but hasn't quite got its act together.' This state of affairs leads him to conclude that is 'why we need an industrial strategy', by which he does not mean the government telling companies what to make, setting the price and so on but, rather, 'the government should be looking for what elements of infrastructure they should put in.' It should be 'helping people to find out what to do and getting them to do it.' He cites enviously the policies of Germany, Japan and Singapore and looks admiringly at the networks of technological universities surrounded by technical institutes where small companies can get work done cheaply. The reference to the importance of universities and research institutes is not surprising. Throughout his career, Dr Parnaby has moved between industry and academia. Indeed, he became an apprentice before he became a student. Over the years he has published a series of learned papers about manufacturing organisation and taken a leading role in the technical bodies of the engineering profession. Even now, he retains a visiting professorship in manufacturing systems engineering at Birmingham University. A key influence on his thinking was when he spent lengthy periods in Japan, trying to arrange for manufacturing under licence of the textile machinery made by the company he then worked for. He appreciated that the Japanese success in creating and sustaining competitive manufacturing companies springs from 'a systematic attention to detail - handling the strategy and detail together.' The problem for British managers is not finding out about the management and organisational techniques but the application of them within a company. The Lucas system, adds Dr Parnaby, has been strongly influenced by Toyota, the Japanese carmaker, with whose production system he began to come to terms in the 1970s. Although, in general, he believes that Japanese companies collectively have been the best in the world at systems manufacturing, judged in terms of measurements like output per employee, he notes that the recession is causing them problems. The market in the high volume consumer products which are the speciality of Japanese manufacturers seems to be saturated. Frequently these products trade on low margins and it does not take a large fall in market demand for problems to appear, says Dr Parnaby. 'But they are underpinned by the team structure and a culture based on training,' and they will respond quickly.</p>

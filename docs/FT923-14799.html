			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Saab chief named to be head of Adam Opel MR DAVID HERMAN, who has overseen the start of a revival at Swedish car maker Saab since it became a joint venture company with General Motors in 1990, has been named as chairman and managing director of Adam Opel, GM's German car subsidiary. Mr Herman, a 46-year-old New Yorker who quickly became a widely liked and respected figure as president and chief executive of Saab Automobile, succeeds Mr Louis Hughes, 43. In April Mr Hughes was named to take over as president of Zurich-based General Motors Europe, the umbrella company for all GM's activities in Europe. The shuffle represents the knock-on effects of the abrupt departure in March of Mr Hughes' predecessor, Mr Robert Eaton, to become chairman-elect of Chrysler, the third largest of the big three US vehicle makers. Mr Herman has been leading Saab through a difficult period of rationalisation, which is expected to cut the company's payroll by a third over three years. He has also been overseeing an intense new model programme which will see a succession of wholly new cars being launched, starting next year. In May, Saab Automobile announced losses of SKr293m (Dollars 49.8m) for the first quarter of this year - a 69 per cent improvement on the SKr953m deficit in the first three months of 1991, although it was a larger loss than the SKr134m sustained in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales rose to SKr3.9bn, compared with SKr3.37bn for the year earlier period. Opel expects a further drop in profits during this year after a 19 per cent decline in net income last year to DM1.1bn (Dollars 720m), reflecting a shift in business away from the domestic market, where the post-unification car sales boom has tailed off, to export markets where margins are lower.</p>

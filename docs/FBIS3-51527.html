The residents of the community are officers and civilian  workers who, by residing there along with their relatives,  contribute to raising the combat readiness of their unit.    Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central  Committee  of the Communist Party of Cuba, asked about the living  conditions of the residents of (El Jobero), who have, among  other facilities, a Family Doctor Program physician and other  services nearby.    Also, in Cumanayagua, the FAR minister visited the Barajagua  People's Council, one of Cienfuegos' most outstanding; and, at  the special troops regiment, heard a report from Colonel Jose  Antonio Marrero on the unit's preparation and combat readiness.    Upon taking his leave, Raul reiterated that we can be proud  of our four armies -- the Central, the Western, the Eastern, and  the Youth Labor Army; of our Revolutionary Armed Forces; of our  heroic people; and of our commander in chief, Fidel Castro.</p>

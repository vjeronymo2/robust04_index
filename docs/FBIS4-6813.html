			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri  told reporters that he received a phone call from Cambodian  Foreign Minister Samdech Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut this morning  to inform him that the Cambodian Government plans to organize a  roundtable meeting with representatives of all Cambodian  factions on 2 May. The Cambodian foreign minister said that the  Cambodian Government, with its intention to clear up any  skepticism regarding Thailand and create mutual better  understanding between the two countries, one of the issues to be  raised for discussion during the meeting will be the alleged  Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge.    Touching on the plight of some 1,000 displaced Cambodians  who  fled the fighting in Cambodia to take refuge in Ta Phraya  District of Sakeo Province, the Cambodian foreign minister said  that Cambodian officials in collaboration with the Office of the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees will take care of them. In  this regard, Squadron Prasong Sunsiri informed his Cambodian  counterpart that Thailand has not pushed any displaced people  out of the country. However, if they return to Cambodia, they do  so on a voluntary basis.</p>

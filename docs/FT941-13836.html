			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Cautious optimism on PLO talks Intensive diplomatic activity yesterday injected momentum into the Middle East peace process as Israel and the PLO expressed cautious optimism about progress in stalled peace negotiations and Jerusalem renewed an offer for unconditional talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. The signs of progress came on the eve of the resumption of suspended peace talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours, due to begin in Washington today. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel was 'pretty close' to reaching agreement with the PLO after he met Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Oslo on Saturday. Mr Peres said Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a) of the PLO and Mr Yoel Singer, an Israeli legal adviser, would meet in Paris during the week to summarise points of agreement and exchange documents. Mr Peres said there was a more than 50 per cent chance a final agreement could be reached when he meets Mr Arafat again at the Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland next Sunday. In Cairo Mr Arafat said: 'There are some points we haven't agreed on but there are some obstacles we managed to overcome.' Neither Mr Peres nor Mr Arafat confirmed the details of the progress reached in Oslo. Mr Arafat yesterday briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the Oslo talks. Officials said Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, would visit Jerusalem today to help consolidate any achievements. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, endorsed the view that progress had been made in Oslo. 'I believe an Israeli clarification and its position in principal matters of security has begun to bear results.' Mr Rabin also said he was ready to meet President Assad without any prior conditions in order to advance the peace process. Following the meetings in Cairo, Mr Arafat was scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia for the first time since the kingdom severed ties with the PLO for siding with Iraq in the Gulf war.</p>

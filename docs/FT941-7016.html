			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Tories' European allies insist on federal stance : Manifesto will highlight divisions in the party Mr John Major's difficulties over Europe worsened yesterday as the Conservative party's allies in the European parliament insisted that the party would be committed to federalism after the European elections in June. Conservative leaders have distanced the party from the federalist manifesto of the European People's party since its contents were disclosed in the Financial Times on Thursday. The manifesto, published in Brussels yesterday, calls for economic and monetary union (Emu), supports the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty and commits the EPP to European integration under a single constitution. Sir Christopher Prout, leader of the 32 Conservative MEPs, said in a letter to the FT today the Tory party had 'no formal links' with the EPP and did not negotiate the text of the manifesto. However, the minutes of the EPP meeting which approved the manifesto on February 3 show that Sir Christopher and other Conservative MEPs were present. Mr Thomas Jansen, EPP secretary-general, said they were present as observers because they were members of the EPP parliamentary group, which whips its members on Westminster lines and has common spokesmen on departmental issues. He said the British MEPs did not vote, but added: 'Between the EPP and the EPP parliamentary group there is no difference. We consider the parliamentary group as an active part of the EPP, and all the senior officers of the EPP parliamentary group participate in our business.' Mr Jansen said the EPP would not insist on British acceptance of those elements of the Maastricht treaty from which Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured an opt-out. This means that Conservative MEPs will not be committed after the election to support the group's position on the social chapter or Emu. But Mr Jansen and Mr Wilfried Martens, EPP leader, said the rest of the document would be binding on elected MEPs, including the federal and constitutional provisions. 'It will form the framework on which the EPP and EPP (parliamentary) group will operate after the European election,' Mr Jansen said. Mr Martens said he understood the difficulties facing British Conservatives, and insisted that the EPP commitment to federalism was intended to protect national diversity. However, the manifesto will further irritate Conservative Euro-sceptics at Westminster, who dislike the link with the EPP. The Bruges group, which has close links with Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, urged Conservative candidates to distance themselves from the EPP. It said the manifesto was an 'obvious attempt to establish political union.' The divisions will also be exploited by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the June 9 elections. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said the manifesto 'has obviously been kept under wraps for several weeks to avoid embarrassment to the Conservative party. It clearly shows that the Tories are not just divided over Europe, they are divided from Europe'. Tories' battlegrounds to be tax and councils, Page 6 Letters, Page 11</p>

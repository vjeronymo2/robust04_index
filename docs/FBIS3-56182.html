Citing the  irresponsible, profascist statements made during the election  campaign, certain observers have been predicting a strengthening  of Moscow's "imperial aspirations."    I have already stated my attitude to such statements. I  would like to reemphasize that Russia's line in the foreign  policy and security sphere is determined by the Russian  Federation president. This situation, which is enshrined in the  new democratic Constitution, reliably protects that line from  the influence of national extremism. The policy basically  remains the same -- both in terms of being geared to the  development of good-neighborly relations of partnership with the  outside world and in terms of being open and predictable.    Another guarantee of the stability and consistency of the  country's foreign and military policy is the Russian Federation  military doctrine approved by the Russian president in early  November. Together with the foreign policy concept ratified in  April, it is an integral part of the emergent concept for the  country's security.    The distinctive features of our military doctrine are its  defensive thrust and the strict account it takes of the  country's actual requirements as regards ensuring national  security. In terms of its content it is entirely comparable  with the doctrinal provisions of most democratic states. I am  referring above all to the similarities in the assessment of the  military-political situation and the prospects for its  development both globally and regionally. A key factor is the  absence of any potential military enemy for Russia. According  to the doctrine, the main threat to the country's security is  posed by local conflicts and the spread of nuclear and other  weapons of mass destruction.    The Russian military doctrine is an obstacle in the way of  any attempts to abuse military force. While using the full  panoply of means available to it to safeguard its security,  Russia will at the same time give priority to peaceful -- above  all, political and diplomatic -- means. Military force can only  be used for self-defense purposes, in order to rebuff aggression.    The Russian Armed Forces will be shaped to take account of  the major changes in the world and the country's actual economic  potential. By the end of this century, after the transition to  the mixed principle of manpower acquisition, they will be  substantially smaller, but more mobile and equipped with  effective weapons systems and military hardware in sufficient  quantities to ensure the defense of the country and its allies.    This provision of the doctrine can be illustrated by the  Navy. It will fully retain its role as a factor determining  Russia's might as a great power. Moreover, given the cuts  envisaged by the Russian-U.S. START II Treaty, the naval  component of our strategic "triad" will have increased. The  decommissioning of obsolete ships will be combined with efforts  to equip the Navy with modern hardware. The ships flying the  St. Andrew's ensign should embody the most advanced achievements  of Russian science and technology.    The fact that all this is not only necessary but possible  was something I saw for myself at Severomorsk in Murmansk  Oblast, where the electoral district, which I represent in the  State Duma, is located. An immense potential is concentrated  there -- the flower of Russia's Navy. This was also attested by  my visit to Russia's naval outposts in the Far East and to the  ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The Navy is traditionally one of  the most flexible foreign policy tools at the disposal of the  Russian state, whose interests naval seamen and diplomats have  defended and will continue to defend together. I am therefore  all the more aware of the social needs -- requiring state  support -- of those who serve the motherland on its ocean and  maritime borders.    Our view of nuclear weapons is becoming more realistic  compared to that that prevailed in the Soviet period. The aim  of the Russian Federation's policy is to remove the threat of  nuclear war and the use of nuclear weapons by deterring a  potential aggressor. In other words, Russia sees its nuclear  forces first and foremost as a means of preventing war. This  view is also conditioned by the fact that Russia does not intend  to recreate massive Soviet-style general-purpose forces.    It would be a mistake to make out that our new approach to  nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear war. The fact  that we do not intend to be the first to use any weapons, and  see nuclear weapons as a last resort, is of fundamental  importance.    The military doctrine's provisions take full account of CIS  collective security interests and are geared to strengthening  defense cooperation among the CIS states on a multilateral and  bilateral basis. The prerequisites for this are shared national  security interests, a standard [odnotipnyy] armed forces  structure and standardized weapons systems, and an interest in  maintaining the former Union's defense infrastructure within  your own territory.    The main provisions of Russian military doctrine have been  brought to the attention of Russian and foreign public opinion.  The international community has thereby been able to get a  clearer idea of the aims and content of our policy in the  security sphere. Our numerous contacts show that the world is  satisfied with its defensive thrust and the way in which it  corresponds to the norms of international law. This creates  favorable prerequisites for strengthening Russia's cooperation  with other countries in maintaining international peace and  security. In particular, there is growing potential for  cooperation among the nuclear powers. I am referring to the  ending of nuclear weapons tests, given the ultimate goal of a  comprehensive test ban, and to further reductions in nuclear  forces to a minimum level and, in the distant historical future,  the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.    Russia is ready to cooperate with all states in preventing  the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and  the latest military production technologies. Safeguarding  [obespecheniye] the unlimited-duration Nonproliferation Treaty  is on the agenda. The clarification [konkretizatsiya] in the  doctrine of the cases in which Russia will not use its nuclear  weapons against parties to that treaty will serve as an added  incentive for nonnuclear states, which have hitherto remained  outside the treaty to sign it.    The new view on the nature of a possible war, which  recognizes the minimal likelihood of the unleashing of world  nuclear and conventional war along with the increased risk of  local wars, including those on the territory of the former USSR,  orients our diplomacy toward more active cooperation with other  states with regard to peacemaking. The CSCE declaration  condemning aggressive nationalism, which underlies many local  conflicts -- a declaration adopted on Russia's initiative -- is  of great significance.    In accordance with the doctrine the Russian Federation Armed  Forces acquire a new function: participation in carrying out  peacemaking operations. These are implemented by decision of  the UN Security Council and other collective security organs or  in accordance with international agreements, primarily within  the CIS context. It is a matter of Russia's fulfilling not some  sort of gendarme functions, but a mission fully consonant with  its status and duties as a permanent member of the UN Security  Council. The Russian troops taking part in such operations  strictly respect the sovereignty of the sides involved in the  conflict and act with their consent and in accordance with a  clearly defined mandate.    In fulfilling peacemaking functions on the territory of the  former USSR, the Russian Federation is prepared to cooperate  closely with all interested countries and international  organizations, primarily the United Nations and the CSCE. We  are entitled to expect the world community to provide material  support for this activity. We are raising the question of  creating an international voluntary fund for these purposes.    The military doctrine envisages completing before 1996 the  withdrawal to Russian territory of the Russian units stationed  outside Russia. We will seek to ensure that the agreements  being elaborated with a number of countries regarding this  properly take into account Russia's security interests and also  the interests of the Russian-speaking population in these  countries.    At the same time the doctrine realistically proceeds from  the  premise that the interests of the security of the Russian  Federation and other CIS members may necessitate the stationing  of Russian Federation forces outside its territory. But, of  course, this will be done only on the basis of appropriate  international legal documents and with the consent of the states  on whose territory our Armed Forces will be stationed.    In outlining the main directions for the development of  Russia's cooperation with other countries in the  military-technical sphere, the doctrine officially sets the  relevant departments, the Foreign Ministry included, tasks which  we effectively began to work on from the first months of 1992.  On the one hand, there is a need to maintain the country's  export potential in the sphere of conventional arms at the  proper level, partly so the hard currency proceeds can be used  for the needs of military production and for purposes of  conversion. On the other hand, we cannot allow deliveries of  arms and military equipment to lead to the spread of technology  making it possible to create weapons of mass destruction and  delivery systems for them, to the undermining of regional  stability, or to the breaking of embargoes or other  international accords to which Russia is a party.    The potential for strengthening mutual trust and developing  cooperation with the NATO member countries, including within the  framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, is  expanding substantially with the adoption of the military  doctrine. This is a weighty and, most important, practical  alternative to the idea of the faster expansion of NATO to bring  in new members.    The fundamental shifts toward greater transparency and trust  are shown, in particular, by the joint naval exercises which  Russia has held recently with Norway, Kuwait, and NATO countries  in the Baltic Sea. Joint exercises by the Russian and NATO  navies in the Barents Sea are planned.    The adoption of the basic principles of the foreign policy  concept and military doctrine marks an important milestone in  the development of democratic Russia's political and military  thought. They graphically reflect the profound changes in the  life of our state and society. Free from ideological rhetoric  and claims to superpower status, these documents are called upon  to help form in the world an image of democratic Russia as a  peace-loving state with natural national interests. Not  regarding any state as its enemies, Russia is prepared to see as  partners all states whose policy is not detrimental to its  interests and does not contravene the UN Charter.    Only thus will we be able to reliable ensure the security of  the motherland.</p>

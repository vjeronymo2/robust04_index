			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: Apple shares dive as results for quarter dismay Wall St APPLE COMPUTER'S share price fell by more than Dollars 10 yesterday to Dollars 61 1/2 at midday from a Friday close of Dollars 71 3/4 when the personal computer manufacturer reported disappointing second-quarter results. Net income declined slightly to Dollars 131.1m from Dollars 131.8m in the second quarter a year ago, while per-share earnings increased to Dollars 1.07 from Dollars 1.04. Analysts had been predicting per-share income of about Dollars 1.17. Net revenues for the quarter grew to Dollars 1.6bn, up 23 per cent from Dollars 1.3bn last year. Apple said that shipments of its popular Macintosh personal computers rose about 85 per cent compared with the same quarter a year ago. International revenues accounted for 52 per cent of total revenues, marking the first time Apple has raised more than half of its revenues outside the US. It was, however, the decline in Apple's much vaunted gross margins - to 48.8 per cent from 54.7 per cent - that raised alarm among financial analysts. The decline brings into question Apple's strategy of increasing its share of the personal computer market by offering lower-priced versions of its Macintosh personal computers, albeit at lower profit margins. Apple maintained, however, that the decline in profit margins was expected. 'Our operating results demonstrate our ability to effectively manage the changing economics of our business. 'Our selling expenses grew just one third as fast as revenues, and we reduced our total operating expenses as a percentage of sales,'said Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive. 'We are very pleased with our second-quarter results. We saw strong demand for our new lower-priced products, and as a result, we experienced renewed growth in our US business and continued strength in our international sales.' Apple is expected to launch a new range of 'notebook' portable computers this year. For the six-month period, Apple's net income was Dollars 281.7m, or Dollars 2.35 per share, up from Dollars 256.7m or Dollars 2.00 last time. Revenues rose to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 2.8bn.</p>

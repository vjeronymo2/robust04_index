			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- A joint statement  denouncing the anti-DPRK campaign of the United States and its  followers was published on March 30 by the Canadian regional  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon), the Council for the Promotion of  Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, the Korean Women's  Society for the Country's Reunification in Canada and the  Canadian regional headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth  and Students for the Country's Reunification (Homchonghakryon),  Tokyo-based Korean News Service reported.    The statement expressed indignation at the United States who  is bringing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink  of war, kicking up a nuclear row against the DPRK, and urged the  United States to cancel at once the planned resumption of the  "Team Spirit" and deployment of Patriot missiles and make  sincere preparations for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks.    The statement also urged that Japan, too, should stop making  mischief between the South and the North, and bury the hatchet  for peace, deeply mindful of the lessons of the past history.    It denounced, in the name of the nation, the towering crimes  of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, who as a servant of the  United States, has been conspiring to do harm to the fellow  countrymen, crying for "cooperation in taking sanctions".</p>

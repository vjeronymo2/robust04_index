			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: A 'STANDARD CONTRACT' DOESN'T EXIST  </P> <P> There is no such thing as a standard contract.  </P> <P> That may not be entirely true -- it is a bit exaggerated -- but it's worth  saying, just to get a basic point across: All contracts are open to  negotiation.  </P> <P> So, when someone asks you to sign a written agreement, whether it is used for  the purchase and financing of a new car or to rent an apartment, don't blithely  sign it without reading it simply because someone tells you it is a "standard"  or "boilerplate" contract.  </P> <P> Certainly, there are form agreements. You can walk into almost any stationary  store and find any number of them, from promissory notes to commercial leases.  And many industry associations have developed form contracts for particular  purposes.  </P> <P> For example, the American Institute of Architects has a form agreement between  a property owner and the contractor who is going to build a structure on the  property. And many apartment owner associations have standardized agreements  for their members to use with tenants. Even health club associations have form  contracts.  </P> <P> Some of the provisions in form contracts are required by specific laws. There  are a whole batch of provisions required in contracts for the sale of  residential property. Health club agreements are regulated by state statute and  must contain specific terms and warnings. In certain consumer contracts, state  law even provides how large the type should be.  </P> <P> But that doesn't mean that standard or form contracts are inviolable. Just  because they appear on a printed form doesn't mean they can't be amended,  revised or even thrown away and rewritten from scratch. After all, they are  drafted by lawyers, and lawyers are in the business of negotiating and revising  contracts to suit client objectives.  </P> <P> Remember, form agreements are usually drafted by lawyers with a particular  purpose in mind. A form rental lease agreement drafted by a lawyer for an  apartment owners' group would look mighty different from one prepared by a  lawyer for a tenants' rights group. They both would probably be perfectly  legal, but they would be biased in favor of one side over the other. So, if you  are signing a form agreement, you should try to find out who commissioned it in  the first place, and which side they were on.  </P> <P> And if you don't like the form agreement, you should try to change it. If the  other party agrees, just scratch out the objectionable language and write it  your way. Then each of you should initial the change. If there isn't space on  the document, write the language you want on an attached piece of paper and say  so on the printed form.  </P> <P> But, whatever you do, even if you don't make changes, be sure to read the  entire document, even if a salesperson keeps whispering in your ear: "Don't  worry. It's all standard. Go ahead and sign."  </P></p>

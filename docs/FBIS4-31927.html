			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marek Wielgo: "Reprivatization--Bone of </F> Contention"]    [Text] There is probably no political party that  would officially reject the idea of reprivatization. Still,  this is the fourth government and the third parliament to be  deliberating the issue. As usual, the problem of who to return  property to and in what form is a bone of contention.    A draft reprivatization law coming from some Sejm deputies  was submitted to the Sejm in December; it satisfies former  owners but does not suit the government. Under the government's  auspices, a counterproposal was prepared by the Ownership  Transformations Ministry, but the former owners say it is  unacceptable.    According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister  Andrzej Zebrowski, the state cannot afford the kind of  wide-sweeping reprivatization that is being suggested by the  Sejm deputies. "Our assessment is that claims by former owners  amount to about 350 trillion zlotys [Z]," Zebrowski says. "To  meet the claims, companies subject to privatization must devote  5 percent of their shares to this every year. That means that,  this year, the former owners could expect Z400 billion worth of  shares."    "But we want the property to be returned to us in its  natural  form," reply those harmed. "Only in cases where that would be  impossible,could the state offer substitute property or  securities. Then, reprivatization would not have a damaging  effect on the state budget."    "To return property in its natural form? That would create  conflicts," counters Deputy Minister Zebrowski. "Take the  ill-fated Warsaw apartment houses, for instance. About 4,500  former owners or heirs are seeking to have the houses returned  to them. If we were to do that, the current residents of the  houses would object."    So the government proposes reprivatization coupons [bony  reprywatyzacyjne], with which one could buy real estate being  sold by the State Treasury or by gminas [small administrative  units]. But only those people whose property was seized  illegally by the state in the 1944-58 period would receive the  coupons.    This would decrease the amount of claims from Z350 trillion  to Z150 trillion, but that is still too much. Those harmed  would not receive as much as their real estate is worth--they  would receive 63-percent less.    The former owners do not understand the need for the new law  because they can seek judicial remedies even now. "The  government wants to legalize the barbarian laws of the Polish  People's Republic," they say. "But the decrees through which  the state took the property away from the people were contrary  to the constitutional order."    Those harmed do not want the coupons, which may turn out to  be just a pile of worthless paper if gminas are not obliged to  sell real estate to people holding the coupons. Their view is  that the coupons will be a way to get rich for those who will  buy them very cheaply, and then, through personal connections  with the gmina authorities, they will be buying real estate with  the coupons.</p>

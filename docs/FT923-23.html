			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (5): Taxpayer faces bill - Problems of the banks THE FINNISH banking system continues to face severe problems as it wrestles with huge credit losses. Last year they amounted to 1.6 per cent of total loans compared with only 0.5 per cent in 1990. The banks suffered a total operating deficit of around FM5bn in 1991 and credit losses soared to FM7.6bn while non-performing loans totalled FM40bn. Earlier this year, there was a serious danger of a weakening in the capital adequacy of the banks with a resulting restriction in the supply of credit available to customers which would have deepened the recession. From 1993, all banks involved in international operations must maintain an 8 per cent capital ratio. Many of the troubles facing Finland's banks were due to their own mistakes. The picture is similar to that of the other Nordic regions with over-extended use of credit at excessively low rates of interest and inadequate collateral, a lax system of checking customer creditworthiness, risky investments in real estate and a wasteful use of resources. But the position was made worse by the last government's loose fiscal policy at the end of the 1980s and the reckless atmosphere caused by sudden financial deregulation. Finnish companies and households were swept up in a free-wheeling spree. The severity of the bank crisis has forced the Finnish public authorities to intervene increasingly since the central bank rode to the rescue of Skopbank, the country's fourth largest commercial bank in September 1991. It was helped through a FM2bn capital injection and a radical restructuring of the bank that involved creation of three separate holding companies to cover industry, shareholdings and real estate. Outstanding loans valued at FM2bn were written off. In March this year an attempt was made by the government to try to restore confidence in the financial system as a whole. This involved both a plan for government investments totalling FM8bn in certificates issued by the banks and the creation of a government bank guarantee fund on Norwegian lines with maximum liabilities totalling FM20bn. At the same time the government has been actively encouraging a substantial consolidation of Finland's banking sector through mergers and amalgamations. Forty-one of the country's regional savings banks were brought together in one organisation to be called the Savings Bank of Finland. The future of Skopbank is under discussion at the moment between the government guarantee fund and the leading commercial banks, most notably the Union Bank of Finland. Ministers remain concerned about the further demands that are likely to be made on the state by the ailing financial sector in the months ahead which could add substantially to the budget deficit. The government has made it clear that it will underpin the system. No bank is going to collapse. But the total cost to the taxpayer of saving the financial sector from the follies of the late 1980s remains uncertain. Clearly, this vague further demand on budget resources will add to the government's debt burden and make it even harder and more painful to make the cuts designed to calm the uneasy markets. 'Additional resources will be needed,' admits Dr Sirkka Hamalainen, the central bank governor. Mr Aho, the prime minister, also emphasises the troubles of Finland's banking sector along with the cost of unemployment and falling tax revenues to explain Finland's budget deficit. It will take a long time for Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's largest commercial bank, to recover from its financial troubles. Last month KOP had to accept a FM1.73bn capital injection from the government to strengthen its capital base and improve its capital requirement ratio by 1.5 per cent to 8.8 per cent. 'The bank's troubles are much worse than I expected when I arrived here,' admits Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP's chief executive officer since last February. Since he took over, Mr Voutilainen has halved the size of the executive board and pushed through a 10 per cent cut in the number of staff employed which will be completed this year. Above all, he has launched a strategy designed to focus KOP's activities on basic banking services through a relocation of its resources. There is less concentration now on real estate management and the equity portfolio. KOP has decided to concentrate its international activities on customers directly involved with Scandinavia. 'We are going to do what we can do best,' explains Mr Voutilainen. But the troubles at KOP are deep-seated and they look like persisting for the time being. The Union Bank of Finland, the country's other leading commercial bank, also has problems. In August it issued a maximum FM950m convertible bond loan to strengthen its capital base by improving its lending ability to the tune of FM10bn. With a capital adequacy of 10.7 per cent and a 7.4 per cent for its tier one capital, the bank has a strong position by international standards. But, like others, it has gone through substantial restructuring. This month the group's new organisation came into force when Unitas became a holding company with subsidiaries for commercial banking and strategic holdings. In June it moved its investment banking operations to a separate company, called Mandatum. All Union Bank's merchant banking activities were transferred to the company, which does not form part of the Unitas Group but became a partnership. 'This reorganisation will re-enforce the Chinese walls between commercial and merchant banking operations,' says Mr Vesa Vainio, Union Bank president. Last year the bank suffered an operating deficit before extraordinary items, appropriations and taxes of FM128m compared with a FM480m profit in 1990 and this year the loss will be higher. The bank expects a further loss in 1993.</p>

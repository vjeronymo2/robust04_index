			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 11 (TANJUG) -- Many casualties have  been reported in Wednesday's heavy clashes in western  Bosnia-Herzegovina between Moslem units loyal to the Moslem  leadership in Sarajevo and that of the Autonomous Province of  Western Bosnia (APZB), Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio reported.    The radio, controlled by the authorities loyal to Moslem  leader Alija Izetbegovic, said that the APZB forces continued  for a third day in a row their "savage attacks on the Cazin  border regions, Todorovo and the area of Buzim." The radio  reported major damage to civilian facilities.    The APZB was proclaimed in a referendum of the Moslem  population in the region in September 1993 and local businessman  and former Bosnian presidency member Fikret Abdic became its  president. Abdic, a political opponent to Izetbegovic, has in  the meantime concluded peace agreements with the Serb Republic,  the state of the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

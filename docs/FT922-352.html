			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / FBI finds body of kidnapped Exxon man THE body of Mr Sidney Reso, president of Exxon's international division, was found at the weekend, ending the highest profile kidnapping case in the US in nearly 20 years. The FBI yesterday confirmed that officers had positively identified the corpse of Mr Reso, 57, who was abducted two months ago. The law enforcement agency said Mr Reso's body was found on Saturday in a wooded section of Southern New Jersey. The discovery of Mr Reso's corpse, which confirmed the worst fears of law enforcement officials, came eight days after the FBI arrested a former Exxon security guard and his wife. They were indicted last week on kidnapping and extortion charges. The FBI declined to say whether the two, who had initially refused to co-operate with investigators after being captured, supplied the information that led police to find Mr Reso's body. They are alleged to have participated in the abduction of Mr Reso on April 29, when the Exxon executive's empty car was found at the foot of the driveway to his New Jersey home. Mr Michael Murphy, a New Jersey county prosecutor, yesterday said that state murder charges would be filed against one or both either today or tomorrow. The detailed circumstances of Mr Reso's death are not yet known, but the FBI said an autopsy was being performed last night. The FBI, which at the height of the search for Mr Reso had deployed 250 agents, said it had conducted the most exhaustive kidnapping investigation since the 1974 abduction of Patty Hearst, a member of the Hearst publishing family. Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman of Exxon, yesterday said he was deeply distressed to learn of 'the tragic and senseless death' of Mr Reso, who had worked for Exxon for 35 years. The former security guard and his wife, both 45 years old, were arrested in the early hours of June 19 after allegedly sending a series of messages to Exxon, demanding Dollars 18.5m (Pounds 10m) of ransom money for Mr Reso.</p>

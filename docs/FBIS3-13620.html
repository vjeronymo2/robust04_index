In a statement to AL-HAYAH Sha'th pointed out that delaying  the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre "has created a negative atmosphere." He said  that "it is unimaginable that the Palestinians should pay the  price for the Israeli crime."    He added that the U.S. Administration's insistence on  ignoring the Jerusalem issue and delaying the Security Council  resolution is considered a negative change in the U.S.  Administration's position.    He wondered: "How can the Americans link tackling the  massacre to excluding Jerusalem from a resolution representing  international legitimacy?"    He pointed out that the Palestinians have not taken any  decision to pull out of the negotiation process...and that the  main issue is ways of providing protection for the Palestinian  people in the occupied territories.    He described the measures taken by the Israeli Government  regarding the Hebron massacre as insufficient. He said: "The  decision to classify Kakh and Kahana Hay as terrorist  organizations has not been complied with." Indicative of this,  he said, is that action has been confined to arresting a few  people and confiscating 80 rifles, 13 pistols, and two bullets.  He pointed out that the instructions the Israeli Army had  received were not to fire on settlers.    He added: "The Palestinian leadership is demanding that  protection be provided, the Palestinian position has not  changed, and we will not go to the negotiations before minimum  Palestinian demands are met and practical measures are taken in  this connection."    Sha'th said that numerous scenarios are being discussed in  Tunis for the resumption of the peace negotiations. He pointed  out in this context that the contacts made recently in Tunis  have produced no agreement. The Palestinian leadership is  waiting to see what practical measures Israel can take after the  Security Council adopts a resolution on the massacre.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Motorola lifted by record fourth term MOTOROLA'S share price rose sharply yesterday on record fourth-quarter sales and earnings, driven by strong growth in the US electronics manufacturer's communications and semiconductor businesses. The share price was Dollars 6 5/8 higher at Dollars 119 before the close in New York. Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 181m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, compared with Dollars 126m, or 96 cents, a year ago. Revenues were Dollars 3.71bn, up 22 per cent from Dollars 3.04bn in the corresponding period a year ago. Net earnings for the year were Dollars 453m, or Dollars 3.39, after a Dollars 123m charge for accounting changes related to retirement benefits, compared with Dollars 454m, or Dollars 3.44, last time. Sales increased 17 per cent to Dollars 13.3bn from Dollars 11.3bn in 1991. Worldwide demand for Motorola's products and services continued to grow in the fourth quarter said Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive. 'While economic conditions remain uncertain in Europe and Japan, robust growth should continue in Asia Pacific markets. 'We expect North America to continue the modest recovery from the 1990-91 recession.' Motorola said its semiconductor sales increased 22 per cent to Dollars 4.48bn in 1992. In communications, sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 4.14bn. The Government Electronics Group's sales fell 8 per cent to Dollars 650m. The group recorded an operating loss, compared with a profit a year ago which stemmed from increased investments in the proposed Iridium global communications system.

The group posted an operating profit, compared with a loss a year ago.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Markets: Oil for industry's lamps, but at what price? - The Bottom Line Oil executives have argued for years that investors need to take a long-term view of such a cyclical, commodity-based business. But they may be surprised that the message apparently has been embraced at a time when a chorus of caution about the uncertain short-term outlook for the industry is coming from oil company boardrooms. Crude oil prices, as measured by the benchmark Brent Blend, regained some ground this week but, at around Dollars 14-15 a barrel, are still about Dollars 4 down on last year, Yet, shares in the big, integrated companies such as British Petroleum, Shell and Exxon have proved remarkably resilient. The UK integrated oil sector outperformed the FT-Actuaries All-Share index by 9.42 per cent last year. Analysts expect to hear a similar message from British Petroleum when it reports next Thursday, and from Shell Transport and Trading/Royal Dutch Shell later in the month. The rehabilitation of BP shares in the eyes of UK investors is a theme which has carried over from last year. The company's troubled period following the sudden departure in 1992 of chairman Robert Horton left UK investors wary until well into 1993 when the twin themes of improved marketing margins and successful cost-cutting led to a reversal of sympathy. But are such themes durable and powerful enough to underpin the performance of BP and the other oil majors if crude prices do not rise substantially? BP officials told City analysts before Christmas that they were confident of meeting their financial goals - based on average oil prices of Dollars 18 - even if average prices slipped to Dollars 16. A report from Natwest Securities this week suggested that BP was likely to exceed its target of reducing costs by Dollars 1bn a year, with Dollars 700m accumulated in the first three quarters of 1993. Fergus Macleod, Natwest's oil analyst in Edinburgh, believes BP has been particularly successful in squeezing suppliers, thus keeping capital costs lower. But Paul Spedding, at Kleinwort Benson, the London broker, wonders if cost-cutting can be maintained. 'After all, cost-cutting opportunities have not got any greater,' he says. Analysts believe BP's final results also will be clouded by a large exceptional item of up to Pounds 200m after tax for restructuring its troubled European chemical division, and the City will be looking additionally for any erosion of marketing margins. That would certainly send a warning signal to investors but Jeremy Hudson, energy analyst at the London office of Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, believes longer-term factors may be shaping investor perceptions of the sector. 'The present weak upstream results are not completely offset by the improved refining and marketing margins,' he says. 'Yet, the shares have outperformed their markets. That must indicate a change in the time horizon of investors. We believe investors are sniffing a long-term recovery.' This is based on the likelihood that the petrochemicals and metals divisions of the integrated companies will move towards a new cyclical peak in 1998. Nick Antill, at broker Hoare Govett, says an optimistic case for the industry can even be made on the basis of oil prices as long as investors took a 'very long-term view.' He notes that crude prices have declined over 12 years and that a long-term investor could probably expect more 'upside than downside.' Antill feels the general state of the world economy will be critical to the sector's performance in coming months. But he is wary of dismissing the possibility of even lower prices - and the shockwaves that could produce.</p>

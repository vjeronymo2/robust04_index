			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reports received from Baghdad in the past few days  speak of widespread marches and protests, in which the citizens  expressed their anger and rejection of the dictatorial ruling  regime in Baghdad. The reports say that demonstrators hoisted  banners denouncing the regime and calling for its overthrow.  The demonstrators also called for an improvement in living  standards. Demonstrations are reported to have taken place in  al-Qanah, Madinat al-Thawrah, Hayy Jamilah, and other Baghdad  neighborhoods. Iraqis from all walks of life took part in the  protests, openly declaring their discontent with the general  situation and particularly with economic conditions.    The dictatorial regime answered the masses with its  customary  iron fist. Its forces used all types of weapons against the  demonstrators, killing, and wounding many.    In its 4 March Issue, the AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper  reports the eruption of widespread protests. It says that more  than 1,600 Iraqi and Arab students took part in demonstrations  in Baghdad, protesting the regime's closure of the Arab College  for Science and Technology, a school founded by the Arab Food  Industry Association.    AL-MU'TAMAR [paper of the United National Iraqi Congress],  in  today's issue, Monday, cites the Iraqi Broadcasting  Corporation's correspondent in Baghdad as saying that a strong  explosion occurred a few days ago in front of the main gate of  al-Mustansiriyah University. The explosion rocked Baghdad and  partially wrecked a large mural of Saddam Husayn. Security  forces rushed to the scene. The main gate of al-Mustansiriyah  University is now closed until the damage is repaired.    This explosion follows a spate of attacks against patrols of  security forces and police in all Baghdad areas during the past  few weeks. Baghdad was also the scene of a wave of bombings.  Gas stations in al-Thawrah and Abu Ghurayb were bombed in late  February. The storage tanks of both stations caught fire,  leading to explosions that were heard miles away.    In another development, reports from Baghdad cite  well-informed sources as saying that the dictator's son-in law  [Industry and Minerals Minister] Husayn Kamil is currently  undergoing treatment in an Amman hospital for a gunshot wound to  the head, not a head illness as earlier reported.    In Karkuk, the regime is reinforcing its forces in fear of a  popular uprising that may jeopardize its hold on the city. Fear  and panic are common among circles in the repressive regime.  The local authorities are employing a variety of intimidation  tactics to terrorize the population into submission.    Karkuk military commanders have instructed army patrols to  prevent young men from al-Sulaymaniyah from travelling to Karkuk  and Baghdad.    The regime has massed many troops in the Khalid barracks, as  well as in Andik and (Naylan). On 5 March, 60 tanks arrived  from Tikrit at the Khalid barraks near Karkuk. Infantry and a  number of tanks have been dispatched to Jabal Bur in  anticipation of a popular uprising in Karkuk.    The regime has also begun dismantling the big prefab  installations on the side of Karkuk-Irbil road and sending them  to (Hamuwir) and other cities under its control.    Reports from Karkuk also indicate that the regime arrested a  number of retired Kurdish officers in the city. No information  is yet available about their fate.    A senior official in the ruling party, during a recent visit  to (al-Hawijah), expressed concern that a popular uprising is  brewing in Karkuk. The air is rife with tension and uncertainty  in that city, and regime forces have assumed positions at key  junctures as well as hilltops. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk  has been evacuated and a curfew is in force in the areas of  Azabi, al-Sharja, and al-Iskan. Many citizens have been  arrested.    In another development, many of the regime's servicemen in  Mosul are reportedly afraid of the possibility of a popular  uprising erupting in that city. To confront the situation, the  regime sent troops armed with field artillery to al-Nu'maniyah  and Ba'shiqah.</p>

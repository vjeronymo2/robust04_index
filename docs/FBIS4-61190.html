			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Rustam Arifdzhanov report: "Moscow Trader Leaves the </F> Street"]    [Text] By means of the Moscow government's decree "On  Additional Measures To Regulate Free (Street) Trading and  Organize Flea Markets in Moscow" the capital's authorities are  ending their love affair with garish market conditions and  making the switch to regulation and administrative control,  which are so customary and comprehensible to city officialdom.    Street traders, who have become a kind of symbol of the new  times and new mores, are being driven from their trading pitches  selected over the past few years. The strict decree prescribes  the complete cessation of any unorganized trading from hand to  hand and from stands, carts, or vehicles. Mindful of the fact  that a similar merciless decree was also adopted by the city  leadership of St. Petersburg last month, it is possible to speak  of the end of the mass venture into the trading business by the  working masses and pensioners. Grandmothers with packets of  cigarette, loaves of bread, and mayonnaise are ending their  labor exploit and returning to their grandchildren, to benches  outside their entrances, and to [live on] their wretched  pensions.    It is possible to understand the authorities. They are  pretty fed up with being accused of turning the squares and  streets entrusted to them into speculators' "bazaars" which do  little to embellish the city. At the same time unorganized  trade has produced no income for the city budgets. On the other  hand, there has been an easing of pressure from the street  market "kings," who have had time to accumulate proper capital,  to gain respectability, and to lose interest in the business in  which they themselves started.    What is proposed in exchange? Small-scale trade is being  driven into commercial kiosks and stalls, a sharp reduction in  the numbers of which has, nevertheless, been prescribed. The  kiosks that remain will be permitted to trade only in the  traditional "Soviet" range of goods -- tobacco, nonalcoholic  beverages, flowers, souvenirs, newspapers. Industrial  commodities and food will be prohibited. An exception has been  made only for fruit. So pineapples will stay. But no hazel  hens.    Everything else must without fail be shifted in the  direction  of flea markets. The 70 Moscow municipal markets that already  exist will be added to by a further eight this year. There will  be free entry to the markets for customers. Anyone who pays  will be permitted to trade. Commercial bus routes will be  organized for traders. The lease periods for plots of land for  flea markets will be increased. Prohibitions cover trade in  weapons, military commodities, precious metals, animals, plants,  children's goods, currency, and securities.    We will still have to experience some inconveniences. You  will no longer be able to buy the commodity you need right next  to your apartment block. But this can be endured for the sake  of cleanliness and order. Things will be appreciably worse only  for the grandmothers, but they, who have not yet forgotten  Soviet reality, cannot get into the habit.</p>

It is expected that the awards will range from $75,000 to $125,000. Awards are funded for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 2 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the program is to assist public health agencies in conducting site-specific health activities recommended by HARP to assess the public health impact of human exposure to hazardous substances in communities located near hazardous waste sites or releases. A current list of sites in the applicant's State rated as Urgent Public Health Hazard, Public Health Hazard, and Indeterminate Public Health Hazard may be obtained from Wendell Webb, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Practice Coordination Group, telephone (404) 639&hyph;0566.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> must <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  specify the type of award for which they are applying, either grant or cooperative agreement. These two types of Federal assistance are explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a grant, the applicant will be required to conduct the proposed study without substantial programmatic involvement from the funding agency. Therefore, the grantee's application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to conduct the study. Applications should include a protocol which will undergo scientific peer review as required by ATSDR. The applicant's protocol should contain consent forms and questionnaires, baseline morbidity and mortality information, procedures for collecting biologic and environmental specimens and for conducting laboratory analysis of the test specimens, statistical and epidemiologic analysis of the study information, and a description of the safeguards for protecting the confidentiality of individuals on whom data are collected. The applicant must include in the application a methodology for ongoing community interaction/involvement. By comparison, the activities of the recipient and the ATSDR relating to a cooperative agreement are different and are described in paragraph B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Cooperative Agreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a cooperative agreement, the funding agency will assist the collaborator in conducting the study. The application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the health study in a collaborative manner with the funding agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cooperative activities of the recipient agency and the funding agency are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Ethnic Bias Claim: An Iranian industrial engineer sued Entenmann's Inc.,  claiming that he was dismissed from the company's Montebello facility because  of ethnic discrimination.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Superior Court case, filed by Mohsen Khosrowshani, alleges  breach of contract and seeks more than $2 million. Khosrowshani was hired by  Entenmann's/Orowheat Food Co. in July, 1987. His suit said that, despite praise  from his immediate supervisor, he was laid off 18 months ago -- after the  division general manager, among other things, called him "camel head."  Khosrowshani charges that his layoff was actually a termination "resulting from  prejudice and discrimination." The case also names parent Kraft General Foods  and its owner, Philip Morris Cos. (Filed July 12, 1990. Case No. BC005580)  </P></p>

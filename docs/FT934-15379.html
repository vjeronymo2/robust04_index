			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke brushes off allegations over debt LADBROKE GROUP yesterday dismissed as 'misleading and misconceived' a weekend press article querying how much of its Pounds 1.34bn debt was secured against assets. The article in the Mail on Sunday alleged that Pounds 90m of Ladbroke's debt had been secured on specific assets. The newspaper said ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, had taken a charge on a Ladbroke guilder deposit worth about Pounds 90m. The company said last week that only Pounds 21m of its debt was secured. An injunction by Ladbroke against the Mail on Sunday was lifted last week after the newspaper agreed not to make allegations about Ladbroke's debt without providing written notice. The company said yesterday: 'The charge in favour of ABN Amro Bank is a short term banking arrangement on a back-to-back basis. 'It was entered into as part of the company's international tax planning arrangements, whereby a temporary loan was granted in Dutch guilders at one branch of the bank and matched on a back-to-back basis by a company deposit in guilders at another branch, the latter being available for off-set. 'Aside from this one arrangement, the company's position in relation to unsecured debt has not changed.' Ladbroke said yesterday that the arrangement was a common one, which provided benefits to both the bank and the company. The bank had a deposit to match the loan it had made. The company could earn interest on the deposit which could be set against losses for taxation purposes - reducing the tax paid on interest earned. The group also denied that Mr Cyril Stein's recent announcement that he would retire as chairman, followed pressure from institutional investors.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper leads rally at LME The London Metal Exchange copper market ended the week in a more constructive mood as speculative buying repaired some of the damage done by earlier heavy selling. US investment funds were again the driving force behind a Dollars 100-plus plunge that took the three months delivery price below Dollars 2,400 a tonne at one point on Wednesday. The later recovery, which was capped by resistance at Dollars 2,450, left the price Dollars 72 down on the week at Dollars 2,442.50 a tonne. Dealers told the Reuters news agency that this reflected an 'unsurprising' technical correction. Copper's rally helped to stiffen other LME contracts, notably aluminium, which was also aided by another big drawdown from exchange warehouse stocks. The 16,525-tonne fall to 2,523,950 tonnes took the total stocks decline from the mid-June peak to 137,575 tonnes. The three months price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,478.50 a tonne, still Dollars 31.50 down on the week but Dollars 54.50 above Wednesday's low. Other base metals also moved off their lows, but only Lead and nickel ended the week with net gains. In contrast, the platinum price was in retreat on Thursday and yesterday from 3 1/2 -year highs reached earlier in the week. The surge to Dollars 427.50 a troy ounce was prompted by comments made in Tokyo by Mr Michael Steel, market research director of Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. In a Reuter interview he suggested that Japan might this year import record quantities of platinum and its sister metal palladium (both are used in motor exhaust catalysts) and that the world platinum supply surplus might disappear by 1995. That also helped to lift the palladium price to a five-year high. Platinum had become overbought, however, and by yesterday's afternoon 'fixing' at the London bullion market the price was back to Dollars 419.50 an ounce, up Dollars 8 on the week. Gold had been towed along in the wake of the platinum group metals but the dollar's late strength brought a reaction in the price, which ended 80 cents lower on balance at Dollars 383.90 an ounce, Dollars 5.45 off its midweek peak. Coffee remained the most volatile of the commodity markets with it's prices fluctuating in the wide trading range created by the spectacular gains that followed recent Brazilian frosts. The September futures price at the London Commodity Exchange touched bottom on Monday at Dollars 3,362 a tonne as traders awaited publication of the official assessment of the damage done by the frosts and analysts reduced their damage estimates. When the official assessment came on Tuesday night it showed a coffee bean loss at the top end of the range of analysts' estimates and future's prices recovered somewhat. But the sellers were soon back in the driving seat and, with no more frost thought likely this weekend, the September futures position closed yesterday at Dollars 3,415 a tonne, down Dollars 43 on the day and Dollars 213 on the week. The Brazilian industry and commerce ministry put the frost losses from the 1995-96 coffee crop, which had previously been projected at 26.5m bags (60kg each) at nearly 11m bags, or 40 per cent. Analysts revised estimates had mostly been between 6m and 9m bags. Industry and commerce minister Frederico Robalinho said the official figures were preliminary, but added 'they will only change a little'.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium          -16,325  to  2,523,950 Aluminium alloy       -800  to     26,880 Copper                -225  to    338,650 Lead                -1,075  to    356,925 Nickel                +384  to    133,344 Zinc                +1,950  to  1,214,075 Tin                   +110  to     30,690  ----------------------------------------</p>

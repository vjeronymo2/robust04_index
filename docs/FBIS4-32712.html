			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- The leadership of the new  Parliament would like to establish good ties with the press and  reconsider, together with media members, what should be changed  in the methods for dispersing parliamentary information, Speaker  of Parliament Zoltan Gal told a news conference after the first  plenary session of Parliament today.    The new speaker and the three deputy speakers of Parliament  have confidence in the present parliamentary officials and will  not change the composition of the efficient staff, he said.    In reply to a question, Gal said it is essential to modify  the house rules as soon as possible so that some long and  needless procedures should be a thing of the past. The bulk of  work should be carried out in the parliamentary committees, he  added.    The Speaker also said the opposition should be given a wider  scope of control in the government.    In a bid to improve discipline, Gal held out the prospect of  sanctions to be imposed on deputies who are absent without  justification. He added that he would like to see a more  efficient and less costly Parliament, and he will thus initiate  a revision of entertainment expenses.    The Speaker expressed the view that the plenary sessions  should invariably be broadcast by Hungarian Television, because  many viewers are interested in them. The concrete conditions,  he added, should be discussed in autumn with the new leaders of  Hungarian Television.</p>

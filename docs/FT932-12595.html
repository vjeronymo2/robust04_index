			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Yemenis enthuse over first election YEMENI voters embraced their first general elections enthusiastically and largely peaceably yesterday, with officials in the capital Sanaa saying that more than 95 per cent of the country's 2.7m registered voters may have turned out to vote, write Mark Nicholson and Eric Watkins in Sanaa. Armed troops were abundant at most polling stations, part of a deployment of 37,000 countrywide, and one candidate was reported killed. Shooting, disturbances or irregularities were reported in at least six other constituencies. But in general, orderly lines of men - and, for the first time in any Arabian Peninsula election, women - voted calmly. International observers said they had noted some irregularities. The Financial Times saw two occasions on which individuals managed to vote twice. The international observers are due to report their findings tomorrow.</p>

The new CS6400 systems are available  with four to 64 Sparc processors and have a United States list  price beginning at under ECU350,000. In Europe, two sales have  already been announced.    In Europe, there are already two announced sales. The  research division of Electricite de France (EDF), the world's  largest electrical utility, based in Clamart, will be an early  customer. A 16-processor system with two Gbytes of central  memory will be shipped during November and the system will be  upgraded to 32 processors and four Gbytes of memory in 1994.  Terms were not disclosed.    EDF, a long-time Cray Research customer, has plans to use  the  CS6400 for scientific, engineering and data management  applications serving users of EDF's extensive computer network.    "We will use the Cray Superserver 6400 system to provide  enterprise level general computing services to various  organisations within EDF," said Michel Pavard, head of EDF's  data processing and applied mathematics unit. "We were looking  for a high-performance Unix server to support a variety of  applications and a large number of users, and the Cray  Superserver 6400 system was our choice. With its data centre  capabilities, scalability and excellent price/performance the  system fits nicely into our existing network."    The German electronics firm SICAN has also ordered a CS6400  system.    The German electronics firm SICAN, based in Hannover, has  also ordered, and is scheduled to receive, a CS6400 system in  the first quarter of 1994. SICAN will initially receive a  20-processor system that will be upgraded later in 1994 to a  48-processor system. Again, terms were not disclosed.    SICAN provides design services for German and United States  based industries that use Applications Specific Integrate  Circuits (ASICS) and full custom designs. The CS6400 system  will be used for highly scalar Electronic Computer-Aided Design  (ECAD) applications, as well as for data management.    "We are targeting the CS6400 for a number of electronic  design codes including commercially available programs and those  we've developed in-house," said Hans Weinerth, chairman and CEO  for SICAN. "The CS6400 is an outstanding option for us since  most of our codes now run on our more than 50 Sun systems. We  know that these same codes will run without recompilation on the  CS6400, which will provide a central, powerful and  cost-effective resource for our many desktop Sun users. In  effect, the CS6400 allows us to upgrade each of our workstations  with one single purchase."</p>

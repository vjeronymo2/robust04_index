Officials said Hosokawa and Kim, who arrived in Japan  earlier  in the day for a three-day official visit, expressed concern  over the issue in which North Korea has refused to allow  unimpeded inspections of its controversial nuclear facilities by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The two leaders also agreed that Japan and South Korea  should  construct a future-oriented bilateral relationship, while  keeping in mind the dark episodes in their past history. The  reference was to the Japanese colonization of the Korean  peninsula from 1910-45.    Hosokawa and Kim discussed their respective experiences in  implementing political reforms in their countries, the officials  said.    Kim reportedly said if North Korea tries to buy time on the  nuclear issue, there will be a limit to South Korean patience  and it will be unavoidable for the international community to  take a tough stance.    South Korea has prepared thorough security measures and will  start this year's joint military exercises with the United  States, code-named "Team Spirit," if Pyongyang does not change  its stance, Kim said. He said he will make a concrete decision  after his visit to China, which he leaves for from Japan on  Saturday.    Hosokawa said it is imperative to leave open an avenue for  dialogue with North Korea and to respond step by step.</p>

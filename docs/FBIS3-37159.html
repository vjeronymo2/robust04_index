Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Monday [14  February], Fedorov said that the government adopts political  decisions but has no means to carry them out.    Fedorov described the figures in the proposed budget for  1994  as unrealistic and accused the government of lack of political  will in order to reduce unjustified expenses.    He also criticised the government for making concessions to  coal miners and blasted the agrarian lobby for extorting state  subsidies for the agro-industrial complex. Fedorov warned that  this will only fuel inflation.    He denied that he delayed the payment of state debts in  December 1993 in order to curb inflation.</p>

Behind the  crumbling facade, there is the headquarters of the man who  scares the world with his fascist statements: Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy.    The elevator does not work, and the garbage is piling up on  the staircase. Only a small store on the first floor is clean  where the "Liberal Democratic Party" (LDP) offers black leather  jackets and flashy T-shirts.    The party office beneath the roof is a meeting place for  strange figures. A man on a shabby sofa stared fixedly at  nothing and moved the upper part his body steadily forward and  backward. He is a former member of the Soviet Army who presents  his "plan for the free construction of millions of apartments"  to visitors. Because of this and other inventions he is worth  "$1 billion per day" -- but nobody wants to pay.    According to the press spokesman and director of the party  newspaper, "ZHIRINOVSKIY'S TRUTH," Viktor Novosyeltsev, Vladimir  Volfovich -- his code name is "locomotive" -- is "nice,  friendly, and a good husband." Moreover, he is a "vigorous  politician and not a shouting man as he likes to present  himself. And he is by no means the man depicted by the hostile  media.    Asked about the number of members, the shy party spokesman  mentions "about 100,000." They have to pay 1 percent of their  monthly salaries and send their applications to the LDP address,  marked for Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attention. These are the rules  according to the party program.    Some extra money can be earned through interviews. For  $1,000, a date can be fixed, and if the party leader is in a  good mood, the journalists even get a receipt. "This is common  practice all over the world," Novosyeltsev explained. He does  not know anything about funds from the KGB and the Socialist  Unity Party of Germany.    The party's structure as a one-man show "corresponds to the  Russian mentality." To solve Russia's problems, "surgery and  not therapy is required," a strong man "who spreads our ideas."  Novosyeltsev did not know how to answer the question about what  the LDP would do if it assumed power. "That is difficult to  say." After a longer pause, he added: "The first thing would be  an amnesty for political prisoners and prisoners who committed  economic crimes." He continued: "Radical democrats and radical  communists should be allowed to exist -- but not within the  government."</p>

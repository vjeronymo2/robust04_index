			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development have decided to  revamp, rather than rescind, the troubled mortgage coinsurance program for  multifamily housing that resulted in $700 million in defaulted mortgages and  sparked a criminal investigation into one participant, the Washington Post  reported. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's announcement, expected today, will follow a  four-month review of the program. HUD will create a new Office of Coinsurance  and set stricter eligibility requirements for lenders who want to do business  with the government, sources said.  </P></p>

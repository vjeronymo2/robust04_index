			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BRENDA LEE HAS FAN -- MADONNA  </P> <P> For 43 high school students, Brenda Lee didn't make much of an impression --  until they learned that Madonna is one of her fans.  </P> <P> The veteran singer told students Friday that she recorded two songs for the  soundtrack of the upcoming "Dick Tracy" movie.  </P> <P> "Madonna asked specifically that I sing the songs -- which are brand-new  numbers," Lee told the students. "I had no idea she was a fan of my singing,  but I'm delighted she is."  </P> <P> Lee is appearing at the Opryland USA theme park for her third straight year. A  hit country and pop singer since she was in her teens, she is known for such  songs as "I'm Sorry," "Fool No. 1" and "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."  </P></p>

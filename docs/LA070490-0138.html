			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RENNY HARLIN FINDS PLENTY OF ACTION IN HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> MOVIES: WITH 'DIE HARD 2' AND 'FORD FAIRLANE' OPENING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY,  THE FINNISH DIRECTOR OF ADVENTURE FILMS IS TAKING THE INDUSTRY BY STORM.  </P> <P> Director Renny Harlin wants to make one thing perfectly clear.  </P> <P> "I don't know what you've read," he said with the trace of an accent, "but I  never told anybody that I'm the Finnish Steven Spielberg." He faintly glowered  at the thought of this presumption on his lips. "That's following me, that  curse. I don't know where it started. I've never said anything that silly."  </P> <P> Others may have suggested it if he hasn't, or they soon will. Harlin is hardly  an American household name yet, but with two major-studio films coincidentally  opening a scant week apart -- the sure blockbuster "Die Hard 2" today, followed  by a gamble, "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," next Wednesday -- he will soon  benefit from name repetition.  </P> <P> Not that either picture is likely to inspire a Renny Harlin retrospective at  Cannes or the Museum of Modern Art. "Ford Fairlane," featuring the film debut  of shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay as a private eye who looks and talks like  shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay, is particularly lowbrow fare. "Die Hard 2" is  just what it is, a slick, expensive action film that is high on thrills and low  on logic.  </P> <P> But both show the sure-handedness of a director seemingly far more experienced  than Harlin. Some are predicting that "Die Hard 2" may even turn out to be the  biggest box-office hit of the summer -- making this 31-year-old immigrant the  hottest Hollywood property that no one has heard of yet.  </P> <P> Hottest and most expensive. Harlin is earning $3 million to direct his next  film, "Gale Force," a suspense thriller to be produced later this year from a  Joe Eszter has screenplay.  </P> <P> Perhaps more impressive than the movies themselves is the fact that they were  made back-to-back, with no breathing room between them, by Harlin and much of  the same crew under the aegis of producer Joel Silver. The young director tends  to come off as cool and collected as Silver is notoriously loud and agitated.  It's easy to envision them complementing each other in comic tag-team fashion.  And when Silver approached him with the unthinkable last fall, Harlin didn't  flinch.  </P> <P> "Near the end of shooting 'Fairlane,' Joel gave me a script," said Harlin in  his office on the 20th Century Fox lot. "It was called '58 Minutes.' I read it  and liked it a lot, so I asked, 'What is this?' And he said it was 'Die Hard  2.' I said, 'Oh, who's directing it?' And he said 'You.' And I said, 'Really?  Like, next year?' He said, 'Well, next week, basically.' He was very strong in  his will about it."  </P> <P> The story behind the story is that Joe Roth, the new production boss at Fox,  had decided to order a sequel for this summer, and production needed to begin  immediately to meet that deadline. Luckily, the studio had optioned Walter  Wager's short novel, "58 Minutes," and a script that was already on hand was  rapidly rehauled into a sequel that fit the Bruce Willis character.  </P> <P> Indeed, a week after wrapping up production on one film, Harlin was filming his  next. Not only did he work on editing "Fairlane" at night and on weekends while  filming "Die Hard," but he also started editing the latter, he says, from the  first day of shooting.  </P> <P> "It was funny sometimes, going back and forth from one editing room to the  other. I would sit down and look at the material and say, 'oh god, this is  really too silly. I don't know if this is going to work.' And then I would  realize it was 'Ford Fairlane' that I was looking at, not 'Die Hard,' and  (comedy) was appropriate. . . . It was a tough year."  </P> <P> It got tougher. "Die Hard 2," which takes place at Christmas, was supposed to  be filmed at an airport in Denver, but the weather looked more like spring when  the crew arrived, setting off a frantic and often fruitless search for snowier  climes.  </P> <P> "The end sequence is set in one place in the movie, but it was shot in eight  locations," noted Harlin. "We started in Denver, lost the snow; went to Moses  Lake, Washington, lost the snow in one day; went to Michigan, lost the snow in  a few days; went to the border of Canada, lost the snow in two days.  </P> <P> "So we came to L.A. and refrigerated three stages, brought the airplanes and  helicopters inside, rebuilt the entire church -- which was originally a  location in Denver -- on the set. But we didn't get everything; I needed wider  shots. Went to Lake Tahoe, the only place left with snow at that point, and  shot there for two nights."  </P> <P> Harlin oversaw a crew of 350, about 70 of whom were employed to create a white  Christmas -- using plastic snow indoors, and biodegradable soap flakes and  potato flakes outside.  </P> <P> Despite all the delays and cost overruns from moving that crew from state to  state -- with final budget estimates as high as $60 million, though Harlin  claims it was lower -- he says he never thought too much about the prospect of  fumbling the project and being remembered as the man who killed the "Die Hard"  franchise.  </P> <P> "It was intimidating in the beginning. But I never thought, 'This is too big, I  can't do this.' I'm fairly experienced with effects and opticals and stunts,  because every one of my pictures has had those elements. I realized that now,  with a budget, I can really show what I can do -- and if I screw up, I'll be  killed. I'll be thrown into movie jail and never let out."  </P> <P> Harlin remembers being a movie buff at age 5 back in Finland, creating  cinematic realms in his imagination and pretending his parents and friends were  supporting characters to his leading role. At the age of 15, he told pals he  wanted to be a director -- not just any kind of director, but an American movie  director.  </P> <P> After a stint in a Finnish film school, all 12 of his feature-length scripts  were turned down by the all-important Finnish Film Foundation. The rejections  gave him just the impetus he needed to come to the States, where he managed to  put together financing for an ill-inspired 1986 action picture called "Born  American."  </P> <P> Producer Irwin Yablans subsequently hired him to direct "Prison," and in what  he considers his biggest break, New Line President Robert Shea brought him on  board for "A Nightmare on Elm Street IV," which proved to be the most  profitable sequel in the series.  </P> <P> Producer Walter Hill was impressed enough by that to sign Harlin for Fox's  "Alien III," on which he labored for a year. Having abandoned that project,  which is still in search of a workable script, he was quickly landed by Fox for  "Ford Fairlane."  </P> <P> If Harlin seems to have suddenly become the golden boy of studio directing, his  conscience continues to nudge him toward more significant work, he says. Does  the Finnish Spielberg -- so far typecast as an action-oriented director -- have  a "Color Purple" or "Empire of the Sun" in his future?  </P> <P> "I've gotten to the point now where I can choose what I'm going to do. I want  to use my talent for something that has a purpose, that somehow justifies my  existence and my right to use money and be part of the biggest mass media in  the world. . . . One of the projects that I'm developing to direct is about the  environment and the ozone layer and about nuclear weapons and whales and  dolphins and everything. I want to do movies that say something."  </P></p>

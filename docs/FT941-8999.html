			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japan's trade surplus widens in dollar terms Japan's contentious trade surplus rose by 17 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn last month, compared to January 1993. Shifts in currency values have masked an underlying shift in the balance. The widening in the trade balance came despite a 3.6 per cent decline in export volumes in yen terms. Export volumes have now fallen for eight of the past nine months. Imports also fell, by 6 per cent in yen terms, so breaking an 11-month rise in import volumes. Measured dollars exports rose by 7.5 per cent to Dollars 25.9bn, inflated by the rise in the yen's value, while imports rose less steeply by 4.8 per cent to Dollars 19.8bn, said the finance ministry. The weak growth in imports reflects the sluggishness of domestic demand, an important feature of Japan's inability to satisfy US demands for a reduction in the trade surplus. Personal consumption is broadly sluggish and has weakened slightly over the past month, according to a report by the Regional Banks' Association of Japan yesterday.</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A better display from liquid crystals Today's portable computers with flat liquid crystal displays need the screens to be lit from behind in order for text and graphics to be visible. One of the big drawbacks is that this drains the limited battery power. Now the Japanese electronics company Sharp has combined several technologies to produce a prototype thin film transistor screen which does not require a backlight. Each of the picture elements, or pixels, which make up the screen is coated with an organic dielectric film which is highly reflective. Filters in cyan and red are also incorporated in the screen to help make the text clearer. Sharp: Japan, 06 625 3007.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State-Owned Property  Administrative Bureau recently issued an urgent circular on  state shares and share allocation, emphasizing that listed  companies must uphold the rights and interests of  state-shareholders during the new share allocation.    It is reported that some listed companies recently gave  different treatments to state-shareholders,  corporate-shareholders, and individual-shareholders with respect  to new share allocation. Some companies ask state-shareholders  to give up their right to new share allocation and let  individual-shareholders enjoy the right exclusively. Other  companies give state-shareholders cash dividends while  allocating dividend shares to other shareholders. Such  different treatments to shareholders hurt the legitimate rights  and interests of state-shareholders. Besides, they do not  conform to standards and international practices.    For this reason, the State-Owned Property Administrative  Bureau, after consulting the China Securities Supervision and  Administration Committee, issued the urgent circular calling on  state-shareholders to effectively exercise their shareholder's  rights and protect the interests of state shares at  shareholders' meeting with respect to new share allocation.  State-shareholders are urged not to blindly approve of new  share allocations unless the company indeed needs more capital,  unless issuing shares is the best way to raise the capital,  unless the shares are issued at shareholders' request so as to  maintain proper shareholding ratio, and unless  state-shareholders have the ability to buy additional shares.  Only under these conditions should state-shareholders agree to  the allocation of new shares by listed companies.    The state-shareholders should use their veto power to stop  new share allocations if the purpose of the capital fund-raising  is unclear, if share allocation is not the best option, or if  the state-shareholders do not want to make additional  investments. If they are unable to stop the new share  allocation, they should manage to buy the allocated shares, or  sell their share allocation rights. Under no circumstances  should they give up their share allocation rights. If the  listed company is subject to the control of state- shareholders,  the sale of the share allocation rights should not affect the  controlling status of the state-shareholders.    The urgent circular emphasized: Presently the best way to  sell the state-shareholders' share allocation rights is through  negotiation, unless the securities supervision organ has other  stipulations.    The urgent circular unequivocally demanded: At the  shareholders' meeting, the state-shareholders should oppose the  practice of giving state-shareholders cash dividends while  giving other shareholders dividend shares, and stress the  principle of same treatment to all shareholders. If the  shareholders' meeting of a listed company decides to turn the  common reserve funds belonging to all shareholders into new  shares, it should allocate the new shares to all shareholders in  proportion to the number of shares they are holding. Failure to  allocate new shares to state-shareholders will violate their  right to the common reserve funds and reduce the proportion of  state shares. For this reason, state-shareholders should  clearly and definitely oppose such a practice at the  shareholders' meeting, and should not agree to the unilateral  reduction of the proportion of state shares under any pretext.    The urgent circular emphasized: Local state-owned property  administrative departments and the State Council's functional  departments, if without proper authorization, are not permitted  to approve the request of state-shareholders for giving up the  new share allocation right, accepting unequal share and dividend  distribution plan, or unilaterally reducing the proportion of  state shares.    The person in charge of a relevant department of the  State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau pointed out during an  interview with this reporter that the urgent circular was issued  to protect the rights and interests of state-shareholders and to  promote a healthy development of the stock market and those  enterprises selected for experiment on the shareholding system.  He said: The permission given to transfer of  state-shareholders' new share allocation rights through  negotiation does not mean the right may be sold in open market.  Its sole purpose is to correct the old practice which does not  conform to standards and international practices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Alfred Felder and his  colleagues have developed a fast chip that breaks the  microelectronics sound barrier: Their silicon chip, which  measures less than a square millimeter, can process 40 billion  bits per second, the quantity of data that would be generated if  each of the million-plus inhabitants of a city the size of  Munich were to make phone calls simultaneously. The Siemens  researchers have set a world record with their 40  Gigabit-per-second microchip: It had previously been considered  impossible for a silicon-based circuit to reach processing  speeds of this magnitude, with the result that many  manufacturers had turned to gallium arsenide, which is costlier  and more complicated to work with. Three different processes,  applied to the best advantage, brought about this success:  transistor technology, circuit design, and metrology. The  latest production methods give controlled deposition of  extremely thin films precisely where required. Single-crystal  semiconductor and insulating films 1 billionth of a millimeter  thick can be accurately positioned using this process, which  goes hand in hand with transistor technology developments that  create high-performance, purpose-structured transistors by  depositing microscopically thin semiconductor materials. The  transistor technology is complemented by an optimized circuit:  "We did not have to reinvent the wheel by any means, as the  circuitry principles are not new, but we succeeded in scaling  and arranging the components in such a way as to achieve maximum  performance," says Felder.    The scientist, who received the 20,000-German mark Philipp  Reis Prize for his work, took advantage of his know-how as a  qualified high-frequency engineer when developing his high-speed  circuit technology. "There are technical sound barriers that  you have to know. Once you exceed speeds of a few Gigahertz,  the structural and measuring techniques have a major impact," he  explains.    The chip is still a prototype and is only a part of the  complete 40-Gigabit transmission system. Felder and his  colleagues are continuing work on the other key electronic  components required for data rates of this magnitude. These  include circuits capable of converting parallel data stream  inputs into a serial data stream. These "multiplex circuits" are  a must for feeding large volumes of data into a glass fiber  cable.    There are already trial glass fiber network lines capable of  transmitting 10 billion bits per second. The expansion of these  networks renders high-performance circuits in the switching  stations indispensable. The Siemens researchers expect an early  breakthrough for ultra-high-speed transmission technology,  particularly in data systems and communications.    This means that future circuits and integrated network  concepts will have to handle billions of bits per second if they  are to be able to transmit this data together -- for  high-definition television, digital radio, and mobile phones,  for instance.</p>

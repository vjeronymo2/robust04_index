			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Karpenko under the "Editor in Chief's </F> Column" rubric: "They Promise Too Much"]    [Text] The trilateral statement of the presidents of  Ukraine, the United States, and Russia is being discussed by  everybody. It is no wonder -- nuclear disarmament is the only  way for humanity to survive. Either all nuclear states will  dismantle this most terrible weapons of mass destruction, or the  threat of wiping out every living being on the face of the earth  will loom over civilization like the sword of Damocles.  However, for some reason, the first step was not made by  Russia, China, or even France, or by any other country  possessing nuclear weapons, but by much-suffering Ukraine.  Besides, the most vociferous and heated appraisals of the  thanks-to-secret-diplomacy agreement are being voiced by  officials of those states which belong to the nuclear club.  This is understandable: We would embrace with the same clamor  and degree of concern the disarmament of the United States or,  even more so, Russia. However, I am afraid that we will not  live that long. Now we are being assured that Ukraine will gain  a lot after it hands over its nuclear warheads to our northern  neighbor, which will turn around and sell the enriched uranium  to the United States; these assurances are voiced by our  president, as well as our ministers and generals, who  unanimously assert that Ukraine will reap many profits on the  path to unilateral nuclear disarmament. State mass media organs  furiously advocate the same claim and voice the same opinion,  and such uniformity and unanimity makes one to recall the former  times of ideological adherence to the party line.    Normal people, however, are lost in doubts. It is true that  Ukraine has declared itself to be a nonnuclear state; it is also  true that, having suffered from Chernobyl, Ukraine does not need  any nuclear warheads. However, the disarmament should be  accomplished step by step, along with other nuclear states.    Yes, the statements that the liquid-fuel rockets are  dangerous to the environment sound convincing; besides, the  rocket's guarantee service term is coming to a close. But is  there any reason to hand over the solid-fuel rockets? Even  pro-Russian Mr. Kuchma has not consented to such a move.    Yes, there is no disagreement as to the statement that we do  not need strategic nuclear weapons which we are not able to use  (it is a logical point of view, because tactical rockets were  given to Russia for free). However, let us recall Margaret  Thatcher who, notwithstanding her being a woman, had strongly  defended the English right to possess nuclear weapons as a means  of deterrence, even though nobody threatened the territorial  integrity of Great Britain and nobody exerted shameless economic  pressure upon that country.    Yes, the lack of specialists capable of providing technical  service to nuclear warheads is a serious reason to get rid of  them. However, how many of our countrymen and compatriots are  providing technical service to those weapons on Russian  territory?!    Now President Clinton states joyously: Strategic missiles  on Ukrainian territory will no longer be aimed at the United  States. However, not a word in the statement about strategic  missiles on U.S. territory not being aimed at Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, or Belarus...    Well, Ukraine's unilateral nuclear disarmament is a noble  and  moral step. We are being assured that this step is economically  profitable as well. However, doubts are natural among men. To  disperse doubts and to become assured of Ukraine's profits, we  need to have clear and distinct answers to some questions.    First. Why have the three presidents preferred  the form of a statement as opposed to a trilateral agreement, as  is usually used with important international issues? As a rule,  statements are not subject to parliamentary ratification.  Maybe, the adoption of the statement was intended to preclude  ratification by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, even though the  council, according to Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk], can  grow wiser. If the statement is not subject to  ratification, are its provisions subject to implementation?    Second. What specific compensation is  provided for Ukraine for the transfer of the nuclear warheads to  Russia?    Third. For what price is Russia going  to sell enriched uranium from Ukrainian warheads to the United  States? Why cannot Ukraine sell that uranium to America or some  other nuclear state without an intermediary?    Fourth. How many, in what stage of  preparedness, and for what price does  Ukraine sell uranium rods to Russian nuclear power plants, which  are prepared from Ukrainian raw materials mined and enriched by  our citizens? At the same time, it would be interesting to know  the price of the completely prepared uranium rods which are  being resold to Ukrainian nuclear power plants by Russia.    Fifth. What specific security guarantees are  granted to Ukraine by the United States and the Russian  Federation for dismantling strategic nuclear weapons, in  addition to the provisions of the statement, which repeat the  principles of the CSCE Final Act? The CSCE Final Act was signed  by these states some time ago, but it did not exclude Russian  territorial claims and economic pressure with regard to Ukraine  -- a member and one of the founders of the United Nations.    Sixth. The last question repeats the doubt that  was already expressed above: Why are we discussing the full  nuclear disarmament of Ukraine only, not taking into  account a step-by-step simultaneous disarmament by  all other nuclear states?    As we see, these questions are not difficult to answer.  However, without these answers, it is impossible to evaluate  the Moscow trilateral agreement and determine what Ukraine  will gain for transferring strategic nuclear weapons --  will these gains be the same as with the tactical missiles  transfer, or will there be something more?    Anticipating my opponents' criticism, I admit that I am not  a  nuclear specialist, and the above questions may be those of a  dilettante. However, it makes it easier for specialists to  answer them precisely and clearly. VECHIRNIY KYYIV  is ready to publish such answers to dissipate the disbelief of  many Ukrainian people in the great victories of our young  diplomacy.</p>

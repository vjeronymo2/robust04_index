			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev will fly to Brussels on April 21 to sign a  framework agreement on the country's participation in the NATO's  "partnership for peace" program.    Kozyrev's Deputy Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference  today that while Russia will sign the document of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, the plan is not supposed to deal  with all issues relating to European security or to replace the  existing security structure.    Russia's participation in the program does not mean it will  abandon its own concept about European security, he said.  Rather its participation is intended to ensure that the NATO  plan reconciles with Russia's conception of European security.    Russia hopes that the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE) will be transformed into an effective  all-European organization for closer cooperation between Europe  and the former Soviet republics, he said.    Such a transformation also requires close coordination among  the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS).    At the same time, Russia also wants to strengthen its  cooperation with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council so that  the institution can become an effective instrument for  coordination.    The "partnership for peace" plan is not a new international  agreement, Churkin emphasized. Therefore it can not ask its  signatories to assume new obligations. Russia and the NATO  should not be legally bound to each other under the plan, he  added.    Russia's participation in the plan has been a hot topic  among  the Russian leadership.    Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov announced  five days ago that Russia needed consultations of six to seven  months to achieve a public consensus on the issue.    However, Foreign Minister Kostikov said the next day that  Russia would sign the plan in April as scheduled [sentence as  received].    Sergei Shakhray, a deputy of the State Duma (lower house of  parliament) and minister of nationalities and regional policy,  also joined the debate today. He told reporters that Russia's  participation should not be decided unilaterally by the  government. Instead, the government should first consult the  legislature.    Moreover, he added, it remains unclear whether Russia's  participation will affect its relations with other CIS member  states and its eastern neighbors, especially China.</p>

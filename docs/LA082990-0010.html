			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GREENWELL BACK IN SWING, RED SOX WIN, 6-5  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell still hasn't regained his best home run swing, but he is  wielding a timely bat in behalf of the Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> Greenwell had three hits, including a two-run triple in the ninth inning  Tuesday night at Cleveland that brought the Red Sox from behind to a 6-5  victory.  </P> <P> Boston's fifth victory in a row and the collapse of the Toronto Blue Jays has  all but wiped out the race in the American League East. As recently as last  Thursday, the Blue Jays were only a game behind and talking about taking over  the top spot.  </P> <P> But the Red Sox won three in a row at Toronto to take charge and, with the Blue  Jays losing five in a row, have stretched their lead to six games.  </P> <P> The Indians built leads of 3-1 and 4-3 and had their outstanding relief  pitcher, Doug Jones, on the mound. He worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the  eighth.  </P> <P> But he opened the ninth by walking Carlos Quintana and Wade Boggs. Ellis Burks  popped out, but Greenwell drilled a pitch into the gap in right center to score  both runners. Greenwell scored on Dwight Evans' single and it turned out to be  the important run.  </P> <P> Jeff Gray, who made 10 consecutive appearances covering 14 2/3 innings without  giving up a run, finally hit a wild streak and barely survived the bottom of  the ninth.  </P> <P> Gray, who has become the closer the Red Sox didn't think they had after Jeff  Reardon had to have surgery, earned his fifth save in the last seven Boston  victories.  </P> <P> He walked only two batters in the 10 appearances. But he gave up a single and a  walk to the first two batters he faced, wild pitched in a run after a  sacrifice, and, had the potential tying run on third with one out.  </P> <P> Gray struck out Chris James, then got Candy Maldonado on a forceout to save the  victory.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how fast we've moved out," Greenwell said. "We're definitely  peaking now. We feel we can win every time out."  </P> <P> Greenwell, who has only nine home runs this season, is 17 for 44 (.386) in his  last 10 games.  </P> <P> Oakland 3, Kansas City 2 -- The Athletics finally took advantage of the White  Sox slump and moved in front by 6 1/2 games in the West.  </P> <P> Danny Tartabull hit a home run in the ninth inning at Oakland to give Kansas  City a 2-1 lead.  </P> <P> The A's had the bases loaded with one out in the bottom of the ninth, but Mark  McGwire struck out. On a 1-and-2 count, Terry Steinbach, a solid clutch hitter,  looped a single into right-center to score two runs and win the game.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (11-12) pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game. Tom Gordon  missed the victory when Jeff Montgomery blew his lead.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 6, Toronto 2 -- Even Dave Stieb, their best pitcher, couldn't stop  the Blue Jays' skid.  </P> <P> Dave Parker tagged the veteran right-hander for two home runs at Toronto and  the Blue Jays lost their fifth in a row.  </P> <P> While Stieb (16-5) was struggling, Jaime Navarro (5-5) was another pitcher who  enjoyed the Blue Jays' slump.  </P> <P> Navarro went the distance, giving up eight hits. In their five defeats, the  Blue Jays have scored only four runs.  </P> <P> At the age of 39, Parker doesn't concede anything to the younger players.  </P> <P> "I've been doing this for 18 years," Parker said after driving in three runs  with Nos. 19 and 20. "The key is staying mentally tough."  </P> <P> Minnesota 12, Chicago 6 -- The White Sox are also in a slump. Kent Hrbek hit a  two-run home run into the upper deck in the fifth inning at Minneapolis to put  the Twins ahead to stay.  </P> <P> The White Sox, who have lost four in a row, have been hammered in the last two  by the Twins. They have been outscored, 19-6.  </P> <P> Hrbek was one of four Twins who had two hits in a game that became a rout with  a five-run eighth.  </P> <P> New York 11, Baltimore 3 -- The best cure for one of Jesse Barfield's slumps is  to face Oriole pitching.  </P> <P> Barfield went four for four at Baltimore, including a two-run, tiebreaking home  run in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Barfield has hit five of his 20 home runs in 26 at-bats against the Orioles  this season.  </P> <P> Seattle 4, Detroit 3 -- Edgar Martinez hit a two-run home run with one out in  the ninth at Seattle to give the Mariners the victory.  </P> <P> All the runs came on home runs. Ken Griffey Jr. hit a two-run smash for  Seattle, and Lou Whitaker hit a three-run homer to put the Tigers ahead. DAN  HAFNER  </P></p>

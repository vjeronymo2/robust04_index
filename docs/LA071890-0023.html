			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTING  </P> <P> Your editorial on 2-year-old Brandon Lott was gut wrenching (July 7).  </P> <P> Little Brandon's tragedy marks another ugly link in the life-cheapening chain  that goes back farther than the Dred Scott U.S. Supreme Court decision which  said that blacks were non-persons.  </P> <P> Slavery was legal because blacks were considered "property" not people.  </P> <P> The chain continued with Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood.  Her Negro Project in the 1940s was tragically successful with its sterilization  crusades and birth control clinics targeted for low-income black communities.  Today, black babies constitute the largest number of victims of the monster we  call abortion.  </P> <P> Segregation in the 1960s, racial tensions in the 1970s and all-out gang warfare  in the 1980s and 1990s show the progression of white oppression of black  America. Brandon should be the poster boy for the devaluation of blacks life  expressed so drastically in our society.  </P> <P> MARIANNE NAPOLES  </P> <P> Chino Hills  </P></p>

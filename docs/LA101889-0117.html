			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS FOR ANTI-CRIME DNA TESTS  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to make the county  Sheriff's Department the first law enforcement agency in California and only  the third in the nation to have a genetic testing laboratory.  </P> <P> Supervisors voted 4 to 0 to spend $200,000 for equipment and technicians and  construction of the facilities in the county morgue building in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The laboratory will make possible DNA -- or deoxyribonucleic acid -- profiles  of unique genetic codes in everything from hair and skin samples to blood and  other body fluids, helping prosecutors tie evidence to a crime suspect.  </P> <P> The lab will be in operation by late December and two chemists should be ready  to take their first case by January, 1990, coroner's office spokesman Larry  Ragle said. The lab will include $80,000 in special equipment, the most  expensive being a video-imaging system, an environmental incubator, a genetic  evaluation system, scales and a chromatography refrigerator.  </P> <P> "I believe that this DNA lab will make a wonderful present for the people of  Orange County to have under their Christmas trees for 1989," Supervisor Don R.  Roth said. "And let the word go out into the criminal world that Orange County  will have the most modern crime-fighting tools in our arsenal -- a DNA lab," he  added.  </P> <P> The county also will include a genetic testing laboratory as part of the  county's planned new forensics building that will be built in two years.  Because the Sheriff's Department has been training the two employees in genetic  research, Orange County is perhaps more than a year ahead of Los Angeles or the  state in operating a genetic testing laboratory, Ragle said. The state plans to  build its main DNA lab at Berkeley.  </P> <P> Some staff members said they could not remember when an issue was dealt with so  quickly by Orange County supervisors. Questions on financing the lab surfaced a  little more than two weeks ago, and since then, county administrators prepared  a lengthy report on the feasibility of such a laboratory. That report was  approved Tuesday by the supervisors.  </P> <P> The latest push for the DNA lab followed the recent rape of a 12-year-old girl  in a gated community in Huntington Beach. It was learned that the suspect  arrested in that case earlier had been acquitted of a rape charge after  prosecutors were late in receiving DNA evidence from an outside lab.  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who stirred some hard feelings when she said at  the earlier board meeting that she identified more with rape victims than the  four male supervisors, was absent for the vote Tuesday because she was in  Washington on county business. But in a prepared statement, Wieder said the lab  approval "will go a long way toward ensuring that residents of Orange County  receive the best law enforcement services available."  </P> <P> Roth, who called for the study on how to fund the DNA lab without using general  fund money, praised the district attorney's office, the county counsel's office  and the Sheriff's Department for completing the report in "record time." The  report said the lab could be self-sufficient in the future, especially if it is  designated a regional facility by the state.  </P> <P> None of the start-up funds will come from the county's general fund. About  $120,000 of the needed amount will come from Neighborhood Development and  Preservation funds, raised from county property taxes and designated for  redevelopment projects, along with $80,000 raised by the Sheriff's Advisory  Council from private sources in the county. The county counsel has determined  that use of redevelopment funds for the lab is legal.  </P> <P> There remains some uncertainty, however, about the admissibility of such  evidence.  </P> <P> According to Orange County's lawyers, the highest appeals court in Virginia has  ruled that DNA evidence is admissible, and DNA evidence has been admitted in  trial courts in 32 states, including a case in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp approved use of so-called  "genetic fingerprinting" evidence in criminal cases. But there have not yet  been any California appellate cases or any California statute on the  admissibility of DNA testing evidence in California Courts, said Barbara L.  Stocker, deputy county counsel.  </P></p>

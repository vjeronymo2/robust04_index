			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Newspapers Until Wednesday, the stock market viewed newspaper publishing companies as attractive investments. Such businesses were considered highly cash generative with predictable income streams and a geared exposure to the advertising cycle. Yet price wars have turned such thinking upside down with more than Pounds 1bn being wiped off the value of newspaper shares. That may smack of hysteria. But if middle-market news-papers are sucked into the price-cutting vortex, then it may yet be seen as a fair reflection of the industry's prospects. Unless that price cutting expands total newspaper sales - which is doubtful  -the industry's profitability will be savaged. Total profits could perhaps fall by 30 per cent over the next few years. Rising paper prices already threaten to squeeze margins. By emphasising their cheapness, newspapers may also lay themselves open to VAT. Newspaper shares will need a higher risk premium since they appear so vulnerable to the antics of Mr Rupert Murdoch. It is not only the daily national newspapers that will suffer. Competition may escalate further on Sundays. Big regional newspapers, too, may fear they will lose sales unless they respond. Price wars in any industry tend to reflect surplus capacity. Mr Murdoch may simply believe this is true of newspapers too. By dragging down the margin structure he perhaps hopes to hasten consolidation. Only then will the industry return to healthier economics.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Companies face tougher rules on defining shares COMPANIES will be required to comply with much tougher definitions of capital instruments in their accounts under a draft financial reporting standard issued yesterday. The third financial reporting exposure draft (Fred 3) issued by the Accounting Standards Board demands more consistent treatment, adequate disclosure and a true reflection of the costs of capital instruments such as shares, debentures and loans. The draft is likely to become a mandatory standard by late next year. Among the most radical proposals is that convertible debt should be separately disclosed and included in liabilities until it is actually converted into equity. Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, said: 'The main problem with capital instruments was the diversity of treatment. 'Neither the profit-and-loss account nor balance sheet were comparable. This will make them comparable.' Capital instruments will be classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer cash or other resources. Liabilities will be split between convertible and non-convertible instruments. Shareholders' funds will appear in accounts divided between equity and non-equity interests. Non-equity will include any shares that have a restricted right to dividends or are redeemable. Minority interests will appear between equity interests in subsidiaries and non-equity interests in subsidiaries. The finance costs of liabilities - such as interest costs, dividends or premiums payable on redemption - should be allocated to accounting periods to achieve a constant rate on the amount outstanding. The board said the discussion draft on capital instruments issued a year ago was favourably received. Changes as a result of comments include a redefinition of short and long-term debt. Short-term borrowings will be permitted to be reported as long-term if they are under a long-term financing facility. Short-term commercial paper cannot be reported as long-term. Fred 3.

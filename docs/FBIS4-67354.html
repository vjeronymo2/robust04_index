			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Government has acted to help  eradicate the use of substances harmful to the ozone layer by  1996 and support this through massive reforestation activities.  Spearheading these activities are the Departments of  Environment and Natural Resources and Finance and the Land Bank  of the Philippines. The campaign is in compliance with the  Montreal Protocol of 1987, wherein signatory countries --  including the Philippines -- are mandated to do away with  harmful substances.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Bosses stand firm on political gifts BRITISH COMPANIES helping to bankroll the Conservative party appear unlikely to alter their attitudes towards political donations in the wake of the frenzy over party funding which has hit Westminster. The latest allegations involving Mr Asil Nadir do not seem to have shaken the resolve of Britain's big corporate battalions, many of which continue unquestioningly to support the Tories with hard cash. According to a poll yesterday among 40 of Britain's largest contributors to the Conservative Party, attitudes to the issue of political contributions do not appear about to change. The message from corporate donors was that their freedom to contribute - last year business gave Pounds 19m to Conservative Central Office - and the accompanying rules, are quite clear. Companies say that if attitudes change it will be because they no longer believe in the values and virtues of the Tories. It is up to the Tory party, say many of the biggest contributors, to devise a system which leaves the organisation and its fund-raising activities well above suspicion. But the provision of shareholders' funds in return for unquantified but presumed corporate - or even personal - reward may now be heading for a radical overhaul, whatever party grandees may say. Little-publicised moves to improve not only the efficiency but the transparency of the Tory party's funding activities are under way and should be complete in time for the party conference in the autumn. Many companies yesterday stressed that the statutory obligations on them to declare political donations were clear. They acknowledged that the motivation for offering support varied and some believed that the controversy would remain until state-funding enabled parties to turn their back on other sources of funds. While the Confederation of British Industry says the issue of contributions is for members only and 'not something on which we have taken a view or are likely to', the Institute of Directors emphasises that the 'law on company disclosure is as watertight as you can get. We are not looking for any changes'. The view is shared by Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, a Labour supporter but whose company makes no party contributions. He says the law already makes company contributions transparent but would favour a mandatory requirement on political parties to disclose contributions above Pounds 10,000 to catch gifts by individuals, foreigners and private concerns. The idea that cash contributions directly assisted the donors was, predictably, rejected by all the companies. Some said they expected other contributors might believe that to be the case but their own motives were usually a matter of supporting a philosophy. One of the largest insurance groups said: 'We stopped contributions last year. They were a hangover from the days when we feared nationalisation, which is now a non-runner.' Mowlem, the construction group, said donations might improve access to government but did not offer any more influence. 'Neither is there any evidence that honours follow contributions.' One of Britain's biggest drinks companies, however, said that big donors probably expected honours to follow. Companies, it said, should be compelled to reveal all indirect contributions. P&amp;O, the transport and shipping group headed by Lord Sterling, said its own contributions to the Tories - Pounds 100,000 last year - had failed to influence government policy. It cited the case of fines imposed for carrying illegal immigrants on its ferries when it had not been given the authority to inspect passports. Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits, summed up the view of most chief executives in saying his company - which paid Pounds 130,000 to the Tories last year - had continued to help the party because it offered the best economic climate. He would, however, strongly support state-funding for parties. Central Office's plans for changing its fund-raising approach include the establishment of a board of treasurers, working alongside the existing board of finance, charged with overseeing fund-raising. It will be chaired by Mr Charles Hambro, whose 10-strong team - drawing heavily on volunteer chief executives from the private sector - is expected to be at work 'very soon'. More detailed party accounts - though they will not include details of donors - are expected before the party conference in October. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, has already laid the ground-rules for fund-raising, telling Mr Hambro that the exercise must ensure donors are exclusively motivated by their wish to sustain a party championing free enterprise. Mr Paul Judge, the party's new director general, said recently the new system was to ensure 'there are no nooks and crannies unchecked in terms of finding those people who might want to support us'.</p>

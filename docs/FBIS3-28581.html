			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Aim at </F> Expanded Equilibrium and Work for a Trade Agreement"]    [Text] The economic framework talks are still deadlocked  even with the Japan-U.S. summit meeting close at hand. If Japan  and the United States collide, not only will both nations be  losers in a trade war, but the post-Cold War world economy will  also fall into confusion. There is no other way but for both  countries to look at the problem from a global viewpoint, aim at  expanded equilibrium, and seek a solution to the impasse.    U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor, who came to  Japan amid the political confusion within the Hosokawa  administration caused by the economic stimulation plan, stated  before he left for home that "If we see no actual results, we  might have to consider other options." He indicated the  possibility of sanctions against Japan. Kantor thought that  stubborn Japanese bureaucrats were obstructing any progress in  the framework talks, and he attempted to effect a breakthrough  through political consultations with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi  Kumagai. However, he did not succeed.    The United States demands the setting of numerical targets  to  promote market opening in automobiles and auto parts, insurance,  and government procurement. In response, Japan firmly maintains  its position of rejecting such numerical targets.    It is common sense in world economics that the setting of  numerical targets will lead to "managed trade." Last fall, a  group of key U.S. economists, including Nobel Prize awardees,  issued a statement urging Japan to say "no" to U.S. demands.  Recently, a group of Japanese economists also suggested that  "numerical targets will promote government-guided managed trade,  and constitute a basis for the theory of Japanese heresy [nihon  ishitsu ron]."    Numerical targets also run counter to the Hosokawa  administration's goal of economic system reform. Furthermore,  if Japan-U.S. trade, which ought to serve as the model in world  trade, were to be managed by the government, this would negate  the principles of free trade. In the final phase of the  framework talks, Japan and the United States should reaffirm the  principles of free trade, more than anything else.    Nevertheless, it will not be good for the arguments between  the two countries to just continue to go round and round in  circles. Due to the gap in economic conditions, there is a  strong possibility that the bilateral trade imbalance will  expand even further. While the Japanese Government has indeed  worked on liberalizing its market, we can hardly say the  Japanese market is sufficiently open. As a nation enjoying a  huge trade surplus, Japan should strive, at least, to avoid  accusations that its market is closed.    A number of U.S. negotiators lamented that "it is like  talking to the wall." Japanese negotiators should not only  argue back at U.S. demands, but should also heed the call for  market liberalization humbly.    Japan should come up with market opening proposals in each  sector to the extent of not involving any numerical targets.  For instance, a framework for private sector consultations  between Japanese and U.S. automobile makers on marketing, parts  supply, environmental measures, and so forth can be established.    Economic stimulation measures to break out of the recession  also hold the key to negotiations with the United States.  Measures to expand domestic demand, such as a large-scale  income tax reduction, can do much to expand the world economy  and correct the trade imbalance. It is high time for the  Hosokawa administration to decide on bold pump-priming measures  as the trump card to correct the imbalance between Japan and  foreign countries.    If Japan is unable to open its market, and unable to come up  with economic stimulation measures, thus leading to an expansion  in the trade imbalance, this will only aggravate the pressure to  appreciate the yen. This may also bring about legislation in  the U.S. Congress calling for retaliation against Japan.</p>

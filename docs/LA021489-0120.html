			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOW THE OTIS/PARSONS SCHOOL DESIGNS THE COMPLETE STUDENT  </P> <P> Francisco Guttierez, a sophomore in the Environmental Design course at the  Otis/Parsons School of Design, struggled with a problem of conscience: How do  you design a podium for a politician if you distrust the entire business of  politics?  </P> <P> The balsa model Guttierez had built to explore the problem reflected his  confusions. A cross between a Sunset Boulevard billboard and a stick-like  electronic media construction, Guttierez's podium for a politician seemed gawky  and muddled to Fred Fisher, chairman of the school's Environmental Design  Department.  </P> <P> Fisher and Guttierez put their heads together to puzzle out the conflict, which  Guttierez described, saying, "I have many doubts about encouraging politicians  to spread their lies in public. So how do I express this while also creating a  functional platform for speeches?"  </P> <P> Fisher replied: "It's a real-life tension only the individual designer can work  through on his own. Follow your intuition, but be informed. Find out what you  really feel about politicians, and present a design that is resolved, not  confused. That's the object of the exercise."  </P> <P> It also defines the objectives of the innovative environmental design course,  which in Fisher's words seeks "to deal with all aspects of the human context,  from furniture through interiors, buildings, landscape and urban design. In  essence, you need to know how you want to make people feel in the environments  you contrive. . . ."  </P> <P> To open their minds and hearts, students "pursue some projects that are  consciously designed to instill calm, and others meant to instill anxiety."  Whether they go on to become artists or architects, set designers or furniture  makers, "our students will approach their tasks not as narrow specialists but  as generalists aware of the whole human condition," Fisher said.  </P> <P> He says the Otis/Parsons course is unmatched in Los Angeles for training design  generalists, serving as a basis for graduates to choose a range of options from  pursuing post-graduate architectural degrees to designing movie sets or  studying landscape architecture.  </P> <P> The three-year bachelor of fine arts course was named "Interior Architecture  and Design" in 1986 when Fisher replaced architect David Meckel as department  chairman. Under Meckel, the part-time faculty had been almost all architects.  </P> <P> But Fisher said, "I chose the designation 'environmental design' because it  encompasses a wider range than 'interior architecture.' I almost totally  reconstituted the faculty to reflect this change, and brought in a spectrum of  specialists, from artist Sheila Klein to environmental psychologist Dru  Sherrod, furniture designer Judith Wachsmann and historian Charles Calvo."  </P> <P> An architect with degrees in fine arts and art history, Fisher is very aware of  the need to broaden the background and training of designers. The projects that  emerge from his busy Santa Monica practice are noted for their strong  connection with other visual arts and the influence of artists in the design  process.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laying a Foundation  </P> <P> As outlined in Fisher's term, the environmental design course begins with a  yearlong foundation of general and liberal arts courses, which all Otis/Parsons  students must complete.  </P> <P> After their first sophomore semester in environmental design, students undergo  a faculty review and those that do not seem suited to advance are encouraged to  change departments.  </P> <P> "We work them hard the first year, and if they don't respond to the way we  approach design, we tell them to drop it," Fisher said. "We're looking to  graduate well-rounded visual artists who can turn their talents to any field."  </P> <P> With only 45 students in the course, the studios are small and intimate;  faculty and students collaborate closely.  </P> <P> The environmental design students also work with those in other departments. In  their "Fabricated Image" project, for example, they team with fashion, fine  arts and photography students to produce a life-size model of a "real-world  scale environment," replete with the clothes or costumes for its supposed  inhabitants.  </P> <P> "Every artist and designer is in the business of fabricating images," faculty  member Klein said. "Painters, sculptors, architects, landscape architects,  fashion photographers and art photographers and set designers -- even people  who create shop window displays -- are filling the environment with new imagery  intended to evoke a particular mood or response. This is the powerful common  ground we all share."  </P> <P> Fisher agreed, adding, "We're constantly pushing students out into the real  world. We feel all environmental ideas have to be tested in a real-life  situation, and at full scale. Models and drawings can only take you so far."  </P> <P> Janice Beckenbach, a junior in the program, chose it "because it connects me  with a wide variety of things out there in the real world, and because I'm  interested in so many things."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Flexible Approach  </P> <P> She already works after school in the woodworking department of an  architectural timber mill, which turns out furniture details. She also designs  window displays for local department stores. Because of its flexible, open  approach, she chose Otis/Parsons over its sister school, Parsons School of  Design in New York; the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena; and the  prestigious Rhode Island School of Design.  </P> <P> "Otis-P gives me a unique range of choices," she said. "I love its rare  combination of looseness and rigor, of freedom of ideas along with disciplined  work habits. It's a mix you seldom find in more conventional design courses."  </P> <P> Not that all is absolutely ideal at the school. Fisher has a major battle on  his hands with "sheer ignorance" -- his students' generally poor cultural and  educational background, especially in arts history and literature.  </P> <P> "Contemporary art students are seldom in love with the past or the word," he  lamented. "They feel that artists need exist only on the plane of a visually  based intuition. They have no sense of history, even in the the arts, and tend  to think they've invented the world from scratch. This is a grievous  limitation. . . ."  </P> <P> As an intellectual Easterner educated at Oberlin College and the University of  Pennsylvania, he suspects he is "out of sync with the lazy-minded West Coast  ethos."  </P> <P> Despite that, he insists that a liberal-arts component is vital in designers'  education. He argues passionately that literacy matters when artists and  architects think about the man-made environment they hope to enrich.  </P> <P> "The images we fabricate have to have a potent cultural resonance, if they are  to have a real impact and improve our environment at every level of endeavor,"  he said. "That can only happen if designers know their culture and are  responsible to its history."  </P></p>

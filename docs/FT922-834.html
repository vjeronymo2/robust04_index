			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Observer: Postman wanted This week's rather good results from the Post Office cannot diguise the fact that the government still has the problem of finding a new boss for its biggest nationalised industry. Chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson goes part-time in October and will bow out next March and there has not been a whisper of his replacement. Bill Cockburn, boss of Royal Mail at 49, and John Roberts, the 47-year-old head of PO Counters, are the obvious internal candidates. However, as all the previous chairman have been imported, there's a good chance the private sector will be tapped again. But if the government is going to lure the right replacement it is going to have to do something about the starting salary. Even after his latest rise Nicholson gets only Pounds 170,000 a year - a mere pittance compared with the BT chairman's earnings.</p>

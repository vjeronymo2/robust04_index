			<p>BFN     [Text] Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, rejects the U.S. [peace plan] proposal. Monde points  out that the lower chamber is sticking to the resolution passed  on 3 March. Frantz Robert Monde had invited the U.S. ambassador  to meet with him on Tuesday, 29 March, to inform the ambassador  on the position of the Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to  Monde, interviewed after his meeting with U.S. Ambassador  William Lacy Swing:    [Begin recording] [Monde] I explained to the American  ambassador that I was a legislator. I took a position on a  crisis concerning my country, and it is out of the question for  the Haitian parliament to submit to a plan presented by certain  American lawmakers.    The ambassador tried to explain to me that it is the concept  of democracy in this country that prompted lawmakers to work on  a plan. I gave him to understand that I too had worked on a  plan, and the parliament will not accept any pressure from any  other parliament or other legislators; we have learned that a  country can not live in isolation, but I have also learned that  a country's sovereignty can not be trampled underfoot,  particularly the prestige and dignity of the Haitian parliament.    As for another plan, it is a Black Caucus affair. It does  not  concern the Haitian legislators. I even told Senator Dodd  yesterday that if Father Aristide elicits such admiration from  so many great men within the U.S. Congress, they can just elect  him to be the president of the U.S. Congress.    [Unidentified reporter] This other plan is allegedly being  prepared by the State Department?    [Monde] That is the State Department's concern, not the  Haitians' concern. The State Department has already conceived  other plans for Haiti. The plans did not succeed. The [Haitian]  legislators took the matter in hand. We prepared a plan; we are  sticking to it, and this plan, its conception, was not  influenced by either Aristide or the Army. This plan must be  implemented, or what must be done will be done.

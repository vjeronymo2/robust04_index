			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of FDP [Free  Democratic Party] Chairman Klaus Kinkel, the decision by the  liberals to support new Federal President Roman Herzog is  important for the strategic orientation of the FDP in the 1994  election year. The liberals have proved themselves to be a  reliable factor, Kinkel said following a group meeting of his  party in the Berlin Reichstag today. The FDP acted responsibly  in its key role in the election of the federal president.    The SPD [Social Democratic Party] candidate, Rau, enjoyed  his  high regard, Kinkel continued. At the same time, he strongly  criticized SPD comments suggesting the FDP was no longer needed.  "I do not like aggressive noises of this kind; we will not let  ourselves be blackmailed by the SPD." The FDP was free to  decide for whom it wanted to vote.    Asked to comment on the discussion about a direct election  of  the head of state, Kinkel said this could be discussed.  However, it had to be considered whether this should also apply  to other representatives. Kinkel admitted that he was  personally opposed to direct election by the people.    Asked whether the FDP has a favorite candidate for the new  president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Kinkel said he  did not wish to comment but already has a favorite.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chilean Foreign Ministry reported that the  French and Chilean Governments have signed a joint agreement on  the protection of investments, which the Chilean Congress  approved on 22 December 1992.    Roger Romani, minister delegate of relations with the  Senate,  noted the agreement's significance. He said that it represents  an important change for Chilean international economic relations  and an unusual agreement for France compared with those signed  by any other Latin American countries.    Romani also commented on the new Chilean economic policy's  guidelines during the Senate session in which the agreement was  analyzed. He said: This economic policy "had significant  results," such as controlled inflation, strong growth, and the  renewed confidence of international financial organizations.    The Chilean Foreign Ministry also reported that (Andre  Guaier), French defense and Armed Forces Foreign Affairs  Committee coordinator, also pointed out the Chilean economy's  success. Commenting on Chilean-French relations, (Guaier) said  they are based on an active cooperation and development policy,  a very open policy on credit guarantees, and the programming of  investments through privileged financial cooperation.</p>

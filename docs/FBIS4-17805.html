			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Apr -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of  the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] today demanded the  resignation of the entire government and of State Duma chairman  Ivan Rybkin.    Speaking at an impromptu news conference in connection with  the killing yesterday of State Duma deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis,  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy announced that the LDPR faction now  demanded the resignation of the entire government and not just  several ministers, as it had done earlier, and that it was ready  to propose its own candidates for the vacant posts. "So far we  are not demanding the resignation of the president; we are  offering him a compromise option," the LDPR leader added.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy poured particular scorn on State Duma  speaker Ivan Rybkin, who in his view was "pushing the Duma  towards a crisis." The faction leader condemned "Ivan Rybkin's  defeatist stance on every issue" and said the Duma would not  empower him to sign the treaty on public accord. He proposed to  postpone the signing of the document till 12 May to allow time  to make changes in the government and to suspend privatization.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Yeltsin changes finance minister to fend off critics MR Boris Yeltsin yesterday sought to placate critics of his government's tough economic policies by relieving Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian first deputy prime minister in charge of economic reform, of his post as finance minister. News of the change came as Mr Gaidar was giving an interview to the Financial Times. He conceded he had been forced to quit partly to placate the fierce critics of his economic reform policy. He announced a softening of the policy on credits, with credits of about Rbs100bn being ex-tended to deeply indebted enterprises now warning of closures and soaring unemployment. The position of finance minister is taken by Mr Vasily Barchuk, a deputy finance minister and long-time finance official. Mr Gaidar stressed, however, that he would stay on as first deputy prime minister, adding: 'I will be able to concentrate more on the general problems of the economy', from the standpoint of both reform and policy. Mr Gaidar's economic programme has won support from western aid donors. It was considered an important factor be-hind a promise of Dollars 24bn (Pounds 14bn) in assistance from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries announced this week. International financial officials in Moscow took the news calmly. A World Bank official said: 'We will have to hold judgment until we see what it means for the programme,' but added that it seemed to suggest a lessening in the intensity of the programme. Another expert pointed out that the IMF resources would remain tied to rigorous conditions, whatever government took over. Mr Gaidar said Mr Yeltsin would remain as head of the cabinet in a more extensive reshuffle which may be announced today or at the weekend in advance of a session of the Russian Congress of Peoples Deputies which is likely to be hostile towards the government. Mr Gaidar would not confirm that Mr Gennady Burbulis, his fellow first deputy prime minister, would retain his post. Mr Burbulis, a close confidant of Mr Yeltsin, is unpopular with the Russian deputies. Mr Gaidar said 'we will survive' the Congress of Peoples Deputies. He conceded, however, that he expected fierce criticism. 'The easy thing to do would have been to drastically loosen our monetary policy. We are not going to do that, but we will have to ease it a little,' he said. The softening in credit policy and the shuffling of the ministers point to a deal between Mr Yeltsin and the leading critics in the Russian parliament. Mr Gaidar said he no longer held to the goal of balancing the Russian budget by the year end. Burdened but unbowed, Page 14</p>

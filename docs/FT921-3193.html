			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / International Company News: Air Liquide plant move AIR Liquide, the French technical gases group, plans to invest DM267m (Dollars 162.80m) in a large air dispersion plant to be built in Bohlen in east Germany. It bought the 110,000 sq metre site for the factory from the Treuhand agency last week. The property previously was part of Sachsische Olefinwerke. The plant will employ 185 people and supply the chemicals industry in Saxony. Mr Pierre Solente, a director of Air Liquide, said it planned to invest a total of DM400m in east Germany. The company previously bought the Tega technical gases plant in east Berlin, as well as several other factories and transfer points. Nearly 200 east German companies sell the company's products. Air Liquide is also considering the construction of gas pipelines in east Germany, Mr Solente said. French companies were among the leading foreign investors in east Germany, buying 44 companies and pledging investments of DM2.3bn by the end of last year. British companies bought 26 companies and committed themselves to invest DM1.3bn.</p>

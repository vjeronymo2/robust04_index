			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Ex-Reagan adviser steps in over BCCI MR WILLIAM CLARK, a former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, has been retained by the UK committee of creditors of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) to try to persuade the Abu Dhabi government to improve terms of the Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) settlement payment agreed with BCCI's liquidators. In an affidavit filed recently in the High Court in London, Mr Clark said he was hired on May 23, 1992, and met senior Abu Dhabi officials on May 26 and 27 to discuss the settlement. Abu Dhabi was the majority shareholder of BCCI. The Clark mission included a meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahayyan, a son of Sheikh Zayed, the Abu Dhabi ruler, who had been asked by his father to deal with the BCCI affair. Mr Clark said in his affidavit that, prior to meeting Sheikh Mohammed, he conferred with Mr Richard Walker, US ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, and Mr Graham Burton, the British envoy. It has also been learned that Mr Clark consulted senior officials of the Bush administration before undertaking his trip to Abu Dhabi. The hiring of Mr Clark, one of former President Reagan's closest associates, appears to be an attempt by the UK creditors to bring an authoritative figure into their struggle for a better pay-out than is on offer. The UK creditors have argued the BCCI settlement is inadequate. The High Court in London has approved the BCCI settlement and a Luxembourg court may issue its ruling tomorrow, but it is understood Mr Clark plans to pursue his effort whether or not Luxembourg agrees the BCCI creditors' accord. Included in Mr Clark's efforts may be a visit to Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East for consultations. Isle of Man depositors with BCCI are pressing their government to improve the amount and terms of compensation. The matter will be raised in the House of Keys today. Under the present plan, any money received from Abu Dhabi would be set against payments from the island's scheme.</p>

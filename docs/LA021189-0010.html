			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT WON'T HALT ABORTION ON N.Y. WOMAN IN COMA  </P> <P> New York's highest court refused Friday to hear an appeal by two anti-abortion  activists seeking to block a man from having an abortion performed on his  comatose and brain-damaged wife.  </P> <P> The abortion opponents immediately filed a motion for a stay with U.S. Supreme  Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, but he turned down their request late Friday.  Marshall did not comment on his decision, a court spokesman said from  Washington.  </P> <P> "I hope this will finally be the end to this nightmare," Martin Klein said  after the seven judges of the state Court of Appeals, without comment, declined  to review a lower court's ruling making Klein his wife's guardian.  </P> <P> Nancy Klein, 32, is 17 weeks pregnant. She has been in a coma at North Shore  University Hospital on Long Island since a Dec. 13 car accident. Klein, of  Upper Brookville, said doctors told him an abortion might save her life. The  couple have a 3-year-old daughter.  </P> <P> Doctors late Friday began preparing Nancy Klein for the abortion procedure, and  the abortion opponents, John Short and John Broderick, said their lawyers would  ask Justice Antonin Scalia to have the full court consider a stay of the  operation.  </P> <P> The five-member Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in Brooklyn,  calling Short and Broderick "absolute strangers," had ruled Thursday that they  "have no place in the midst of this family tragedy."  </P> <P> Nancy Klein's parents support her husband's decision to seek an abortion,  officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Air France to reveal buyer for hotel chain - Other companies Air France will today end weeks of uncertainty by announcing the identity of the new owner of Meridien, its luxury hotel chain. Meridien is being courted by competing bids from France's Accor and the UK's Forte. Air France says it will sell Meridien to the highest bidder which means Forte could win as it has bid FFr1.8bn (Dollars 330m) against Accor's FFr1.6bn. However, the French group has lobbied hard behind the scenes trying to swing the deal through its political influence and commercial clout as one of Air France's partners.</p>

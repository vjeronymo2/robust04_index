			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / French want new PM, poll shows A MAJORITY of French voters wants a new prime minister and a new government. Nearly half of them want a new president. A Liberation poll yesterday said 60 per cent of voters surveyed want Edith Cresson, the prime minister, to go, 61 per cent want early general elections and 49 per cent want President Francois Mitterrand to resign. The poll reinforced the message of popular rejection which emerged in regional elections 10 days ago in which the ruling Socialist party suffered humiliating losses. The party's fortunes were further battered in departmental elections on Sunday. Most commentators predict that Mrs Cresson is likely to be the first casualty of a government shake-out expected in the next few days. Further opinion polls indicate growing disenchantment with the government. A poll in the weekly Le Point showed that three-quarters of the electorate regard the regional election result as a condemnation of Mr Mitterrand as well as of Mrs Cresson. The Socialists lost control of five departments in Sunday's elections, leaving them in control of 20 - less than half the number they ruled in 1979. The conservative domination of local government is now overwhelming, with 75 departments. Detailed results of Sunday's voting indicate that large numbers of potential National Front voters swung behind the conservatives, who appear to have stuck to their undertaking to do no deals with the extreme rightwing party. Only one NF candidate was elected, as its share of the vote shrank to under 7 per cent, compared with almost 14 per cent in the regional elections a week earlier. Mr Jacques Delors, often tipped as the frontrunner to head a new French government, wants to stay on as European Commission president, at least until the end of his current term this December, David Buchan reports from Brussels. An official said Mr Delors felt it 'his first duty to stay and finish the work already started' - ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union by EC parliaments, agreement on Community financing over the next five years and decisions on admitting new member states into the EC.

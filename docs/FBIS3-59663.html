Expanding the use of national research facilities can benefit  corporations.    The world is looking for international contributions such as  original research from Japan. Cooperation between the industrial  world, academia, and national laboratories is one element that  is lacking. A survey conducted by the Science and Technology  Agency pointed out the lack of progress in shared use of  advanced research equipment and facilities owned by government  laboratories. The needs of industry and academia which would  like more use of the advanced facilities at national  laboratories have increased. If plans are devised to maintain  the research environment to address this need, major  contributions would be made to the development of leading-edge  basic technologies along with the acceleration of basic  research. Revised plans based on these survey results must be  quickly reflected in policy.    Many of the latest facilities and human resources are needed  to advance the frontiers of basic technological development and  basic research required in the rapid development of society.  However, the facilities are expensive and too risky economically  and in terms of research for corporations to individually  acquire this equipment. If shared use is advanced in government  laboratories, in addition to preventing duplicate investments of  research funds, we could expect more activity in research  exchanges with the government laboratories, in effect, killing  two birds with one stone. However, the connection has only been  opened between university and government lab as in Tsukuba City  in Ibaraki prefecture.    According to the survey, the need for various types of high  performance analysis equipment and special test facilities has  increased. This is because they can be used as tools in a wide  range of research from basic to applied. Corporations, in  particular, wish to use non-destructive test equipment, wind  tunnels, earthquake-proof test equipment, while universities  would like to use radiation test equipment and accelerators.    According to a survey conducted around the beginning of July  by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun Ltd. of leading corporations (189  responses received), the total amount of investment in research  and development for fiscal year 1993 was &yen;6.3 trillion, a  &yen;3.1 billion increase over the previous year. Although the  investment in equipment has decreased significantly due to the  depressed economy, maintenance of R&amp;D funds at a high level  was  reported. R&amp;D funds, however, are only squeezed out of sales,  thus affect research and development for discovering the seeds  for future businesses given the protracted stagnation, and are  not connected to the provision of an uninterrupted research  environment. Neglecting the provision of research environment  misses the chance of launching new businesses or frustrates the  establishment of basic technology.    The objective is the shared use of government laboratory  facilities. The obstacles to joint research uncovered by the  Science and Technology Agency survey were access difficulty by  corporations, such as "difficulty in finding research partners"  and "not obtaining information on research themes," as well as  problems associated with handling the results, such as reverting  patents. Although solutions and obstacles were summarized, their  reflection in specific policies is the first manifestation of  the report's significance. Cooperation between industry,  academia, and government has already been established in the  Research Exchange Act and must be promoted in the current  stagnant economy. The fiscal year 1994 opening of the  large-scale radiation facility in Hyogo prefecture currently  under construction by the Science and Technology Agency is a  facility planned in the Act and the provision of research  environment for industry, academia, and government has been  decided.</p>

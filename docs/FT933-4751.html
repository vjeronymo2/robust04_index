			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Mixture of responses to absence of Wall St EUROPEAN bourses traded moderately in the absence of Wall Street yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. STOCKHOLM saw Volvo Bs fall SKr7 to SKr483 after the announcement of its merger with Renault, the French car group. The shares had been suspended for most of the day ahead of the long-awaited announcement and were only traded in the last 45 minutes of the session and initially gained ground to SKr500, a year's high. The Affarsvarlden general index closed up 8.00 at 1,290.7 in turnover of SKr1bn. FRANKFURT lost a lot of ground on the weaker dollar, with the DAX index shedding 14.88 to 1,910.28 in turnover down to DM5.3bn from Friday's DM8.6bn. Among those sectors suffering were cars, chemicals, and steel. Volkswagen, lost DM7.70 or 2 per cent to DM372.00 in reaction to weekend news of losses at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary. Banks remained resilient to deeper weakness: Deutsche off DM4.50 at DM783.00, Commerzbank down DM2.50 at DM316.50 and Dresdner off 50 pfgs at DM419. Daiwa's research team has recently rated the European banking sector a hold given good double digit profit growth in 1993 and further improvement expected in 1994. PARIS closed slightly higher in subdued trading. The CAC-40 index added 1.87 to 2,157.96 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Among the day's gainers was Carrefour up FFr55 at FFr3,080 as the group, reporting first half figures, said that it expected a rise in full year profits. MILAN was dominated by profit-taking pressure on Fiat and the Comit index shed 12.05 or 1.9 per cent to 616.90. Fiat fell L338 or 4.9 per cent to L6,587. Analysts attributed the decline to futures-related trading ahead of Friday's options expiry, continuing speculation of a large capital rise, and disappointment at the absence of an announcement by the end of August to resolve the long running speculation about an international alliance or asset sale. Mediobanca shed L617 to L17,298 with news of its call to investors for fresh funds coming late in the day. Against the trend Ferruzzi rose L34 to L374.5 amid talk of stake building ahead of the announcement, expected later this month, of a rescue package being put together by creditors. ZURICH succumbed to a round of profit-taking which left the SMI index 42.6 or 1.9 per cent lower at 2,392.2. Virtually all the recent strong performers were affected. Roche certificates shed SFr115 to SFr4,490 while Nestle ended SFr14 lower at SFr1,063. Bank shares were lower but off their worst for the day. UBS fell SFr28 to SFr1,127, CS Holding SFr65 to SFr2,830 and SBC SFr10 to SFr452. Smith New Court in London notes that while the stocks have performed strongly in recent months, they are currently no more expensive than they were a year ago following recent result-led earnings upgrades. BRUSSELS fell back on profit-taking after strong gains on Friday when the market gained ground on expectations of an imminent devaluation of the currency. The Bel-20 index closed down 9.12 at 1,341.52 in turnover estimate at BFr1.6bn. AMSTERDAM closed moderately lower, the CBS Tendency index off 0.4 at 127.3 with Ahold down Fl 1.50 at Fl 93.00 ahead of today's second quarter figures. WARSAW stocks leapt by their daily 10 per cent limit as the WIG index jumped 667.2 or 9.7 per cent to 7,561 in record turnover of 1,350bn zloty.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 6  THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open     10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1285.07   1283.79   1282.80  1282.23 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1376.51   1374.38   1372.48  1371.67                         13.00     14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1283.23   1282.92   1283.86  1284.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1373.43   1370.93   1371.65  1371.90  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Sep 3     Sep 2     Sep 1    Aug 31    Aug 27 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1293.60   1302.75   1305.63   1319.96   1308.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1384.27   1385.48   1385.51   1396.45   1397.66  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1285.07; 200 - 1377.06 Low/day: 100 - 1281.49  200 - 1370.53.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The court will continue to hear the counsel for the defence  tomorrow morning.    The argument of the defence counsel was that differences  between religious groups and the systems of government have  existed for a long time since the French expedition came to  Egypt.    Representative of the state prosecution said one of the  accused who had been at large has been apprehended and was  behind bars at today's hearing.</p>

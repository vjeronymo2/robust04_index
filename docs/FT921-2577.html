			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (4): Fears of new restrictions - A cloud hangs over derivatives in Japan INVESTORS IN Japan's stock futures are awaiting the outcome of the authorities' review of the effects of derivatives trading on the underlying cash stock market. The Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges have blamed the derivatives market for the current weakness of Japanese share prices. Moves to tighten restrictions in the futures and options markets have prompted criticism from many participants, who see a threat to these markets' further growth. The Nikkei 225 futures contract, which was listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE), has become one of the largest stock futures markets in the world. Last year, turnover in the Nikkei 225 futures trading was 35 per cent up on the previous year, at Y536,729.9bn (Dollars 4,142bn). In contrast, trading in the underlying cash market, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), has been hurt by deteriorating investor confidence. Last year, activity on the first section of the TSE fell 39 per cent to a nine-year low of Y107,108bn. The Nikkei index, which reached a high of 38,915.87 in late 1989, has plunged over 45 per cent as higher interest rates have squeezed speculation out of the market. Last year's stock market scandals, involving Japanese brokers who had favoured larger corporate clients by compensating them for trading losses, have also shaken individuals, and the cash market is in its third year of weakness. Price fluctuations in the futures markets are reflected in the cash market through arbitrage, profiting from the price differences between cash and futures markets. Stock exchange officials blame the abnormal surge in derivatives trading and speculative price movements on the futures markets for intimidating individual investors. 'We have no proof that trading on the futures market has adverse effects on the cash market, but if additional restrictions are going to alleviate the fears of the individual investor, the futures market has to be sacrificed,' says Mr Takao Tsutsumi, executive governor of the OSE. The TSE increased margin rates for arbitrage trading three times last year, to curb activity. Last month, the OSE implemented emergency measures to enhance the transparency of the futures and options market by disclosing trading of futures and options by brokers. The OSE also shortened the trading hours of the futures market; and the exercise of option contracts, also blamed for creating volatility, will be moved from the current once a week to once a month with the June contract. Frustration over derivatives trading has been heightened by the deteriorating earnings of Japanese brokers against large increases in profits at foreign houses, which booked profits due to their expertise in derivatives trading. Smaller Japanese brokers have also pointed to larger brokers, who have increased their presence in the futures and options markets. 'The concept of profiting from dealing rather than from broking is still seen as a sin,' points out one analyst. The popularity of the OSE's Nikkei futures has also led to tensions between the two exchanges. Trading in the Nikkei 225 futures index accounted for 56.2 per cent of trading revenue earned by the OSE, while futures trading in Tokyo on the TSE's Topix index only accounted for 2.6 per cent of its trading income. Thanks to futures trading, the OSE managed to make a profit for the interim period to last September, while the TSE, hurt by the sharp fall in trading volume, fell into the red. Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director of Nomura Securities, is critical of 'speculation' in the futures markets. 'A futures market cannot exist without the underlying cash market. The stock market's initial purpose is for companies to raise funds, not speculation,' he adds. However, Mr Kiyoshi Nikami, researcher at Japan Securities Research Institute, points out it was originally the brokerages and corporations which drove investors from the cash market. 'The cash market's appeal to investors has deteriorated due to focus on the underwriting business by brokerages and the equity financing frenzy by companies,' observes Mr Nikami. Apart from the decline in liquidity in the cash market, investors are attracted to the futures and options market as derivatives offer an exposure to the equity market at lower costs due to lower commissions and tax-saving benefits. The OSE and TSE have started to tighten the grip on derivatives trading, and are still working on further long- and short-term reforms. The two exchanges have announced that, from next Monday, they will double commissions for futures and options trading - the first increase of futures and options contracts in Japan. There is speculation in the market that Tokyo could impose a ceiling on brokers' arbitrage positions, and place tighter limits on price movements on illiquid stocks of the Nikkei 225. Critics of futures trading point out the volatility can be created by manipulating the price movements of illiquid shares within the price-based Nikkei 225 average. Meanwhile, derivatives traders claim that adverse feeling against derivatives trading is driving business to offshore markets such as the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where Nikkei 225 futures are traded. 'If derivatives traders see an opportunity on a price basis, they will move to that market,' says Mr Alex Woodthorpe, derivatives analyst at SG Warburg Securities. With margins for futures contracts higher on the OSE, an increasing number of investors are moving to Simex, which is in the same time zone. The Simex Nikkei futures contract, launched in 1986, was the first futures contract on the Japanese stock market. Trading volume on the Simex has been boosted by the OSE's listing of its Nikkei futures. Daily volume, which average 3,045 contracts last year, surged to 6,789 contracts in February. Starting with the June contract, the last trading day and final settlement price of the Simex Nikkei futures will be made identical to the OSE Nikkei futures contracts. Simex will also list Nikkei stock options from today. Traders point out that the Simex Nikkei contract offers more liquidity, because it is traded on open bidding and offering on the trading floor, as opposed to OSE's screen-based trading. Japanese regulators are already concerned about the trading outflow. Mr Mitsuo Sato, TSE vice-president, says that a 'level playing field' is necessary, and adds that, if trading on offshore markets undermines investor confidence in Japan, the TSE and the OSE will request implementation of similar trading rules to overseas exchanges.</p>

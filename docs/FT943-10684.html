			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico rises sharply on prospects for election Mexican shares rose sharply on optimism that the ruling party would win the general election later this month. Analysts said prices were also boosted by expectations of lower domestic interest rates. The IPC index gained 64.98, or 2.6 per cent, at 2,538.52. Volume was a heavy 129.8m shares. There was strong demand from foreigners, and foreign exchange traders said the new peso ended higher against the dollar on demand for Mexican currency with which to buy on the Mexican bolsa. Salomon Brothers said it had increased the weighting of Mexican equities in its Latin American portfolio to 40 per cent from 38 per cent, based on a positive economic and political outlook for the country. Salomon added that it had maintained its 3,100 estimate for the Mexican bolsa's IPC index by the year-end, up by some 22 per cent from the current level. Following a recent visit to Mexico, Salomon said it was confident that the ruling party candidate Mr Ernesto Zedillo would win the August 21 presidential election with between 43 per cent and slightly more than 50 per cent of the vote.</p>

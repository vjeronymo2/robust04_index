He added, however, that  socioeconomic programs are two sides of the same coin as one  cannot be separated from the other. He reiterated that during  his administration important [word indistinct] will be made for  the agriculture sector, as well as for small and medium  producers, who will grow stronger as they are given the  necessary resources.    Women will also play a leading role in the policies of the  coming National Liberation Party administration. Figueres  stated that his government will continue its efforts in the  health and education sectors. He also reiterated his support  for private education but added that public education must be  improved to keep it at the same level as private education  [words indistinct].    Figueres said very significant trade relations will be  generated with various nations with which current relations are  maintained. Figueres said he will respect international  financial organizations and international economic policies.  However, he reiterated that his government does not approve of  the (?third) structural adjustment program in its current form  and said it must undergo several changes so it does not harm the  country's less fortunate sectors.    Here is an excerpt of Jose Maria Figueres' statements at the  Hotel Costa Rica:    [Begin Figueres recording] I am happy and very grateful for  the trust and affection expressed by the Costa Rican people, a  majority of whom voted for the National Liberation Party and  allowed us to win the elections and to win in Congress. I am  certain they will allow us to win a majority in the  municipalities throughout the nation.    I think there were certain factors that could have caused  objections to the final election results. Starting early in the  afternoon I perceived an air of triumph among the National  Liberation Party family when party members were saying we had  won all across the nation. Some started to celebrate before the  final results were in. You are the best witnesses that  throughout the afternoon we used the media many times to urge  people not to celebrate in advance and to work until 1800 or  until we obtained [words indistinct].    In any case, I want to reiterate my appreciation for the  trust placed in us to fulfill the commitments we made during the  campaign. It is time to leave differences aside, to unite the  Costa Rican family, and to meet the goals we have set. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: Shaky sterling is stretched to limit - London Markets CANCEL THAT golfing holiday in the Algarve. Do not follow John Major to a Spanish villa. If you have to go abroad, go to Italy - but you must not spend very much. Spending money abroad is unpatriotic. Every time a holiday maker swaps his pounds for escudos or pesetas, the Bank of England will have to buy them back. The prime minister might just be displaying a 'crisis, what crisis?' nonchalance by heading for the sun this weekend. It follows a report last Sunday of a (rather unconvincing) view he holds that sterling will one day be the strongest currency in the European exchange rate mechanism. Readers with longer memories will recall that, after the 1967 sterling devaluation, travellers were limited to taking Pounds 50 abroad in any one year - although you could get a lot further on Pounds 50 in those days than now. For a start, even after that devaluation Pounds 1 was worth Dm 9.60. On Wednesday this week, sterling closed at its lowest level against the D-Mark - 2.825 - since joining the ERM in October 1990. While that is still well above the pound's theoretical floor against the D-Mark, sterling was stretched to the limit against the escudo in the ERM. Only central bank intervention kept the pound within its limits. So, a sterling devaluation is again up for debate. August would seem an unlikely time to pick for a realignment. And, at the moment, the central banks appear able to see off sellers of the pound. But the autumn could well see the argument raging once more, especially if the French vote against the Maastricht treaty on European unity in their referendum in September. Sterling can probably hang on until after the summer holidays, but then some hard decisions will have to be taken. At the moment, each solution seems to lead to higher, not lower, UK interest rates. There are three simple routes: Sterling is devalued within the ERM, but then credibility is lost and interest rates are forced up. Sterling is held where it is within the ERM, but that might mean putting interest rates up, as the Italians did. Sterling leaves the ERM, interest rates are cut, the economy surges, inflation bounds ahead, and Britain is back in exactly the same mess it was before the pound joined the ERM. Then interest rates go up. The concern over sterling is one of the reasons for the black mood this week in the stock market, which fell 49.5 points to 2350.1 on the Footsie index. Another, related, one is the debate over how to get the economy moving. Since slashing interest rates is not really an option, the latest fashion is to dream up a scheme to revitalise the housing market. Another three were put forward this week and, strangely enough, all came from people who have lent a lot of money to home-buyers: the Abbey National, the National Westminster Bank and the Woolwich Building Society. Even more strange, they think the government - for which read 'taxpayer' - should pay. So far, only the National Savings investor has paid anything, as interest rates were cut this week on a range of products in another attempt to stave off a mortgage rate rise. There is a grain of moral force to the argument that the government should pay. After all, whose idea was it that the nation should become a property-owning democracy? Even so, the mortgage lenders' pleas sound remarkably like the whingeing in which banks indulged when the Third World debt crisis broke and, again, when loans to companies began to be re-financed. At least Sir John Quinton, the chairman of Barclays bank - which, on Thursday, announced a Pounds 1.1bn bad debt provision in its first-half results - had the honesty to admit that a fair chunk of that was down to poor lending decisions. It is apparent now that there was a lot of that going on in the housing market late in the 1980s. And, to that extent, the pain might reasonably be borne as much by the lenders as the borrowers, who seemed to regard a house as a kind of inflation-linked pension fund that could also be lived-in. Perhaps schemes to sort out the negative-equity housing problem should borrow some ideas and terminology from the Third World debt and corporate re-structuring experience. Did the banks repossess Brazil? How about debt-for-equity swaps? Sir John managed to upset the stock market with another remark on Thursday when he suggested that economic recovery might not start until well into 1993, or even 1994. Add that to British Petroleum halving its dividend the same day - the last time it cut its dividend, it had the First World War as an excuse - and the market has a lot to worry about. BP's shares fell 10p on Thursday and another 11p yesterday, closing at 186p. It is all the more depressing when a company announces good results and still suffers a share price fall. On Wednesday, GKN, the car components group, lifted its interim profits 37 per cent to Pounds 65.1m - better than most expected - but still saw its shares fall 12p to 383p that day and another 10p since, ending the week at 373p. The problem is that however effective cost-cutting and productivity drives are, there is no real substitute for economic growth. And, in common with most other companies, GKN cannot see that coming yet. So, cyclical stocks are out of favour once more and it is back to the defensive sectors. Thursday was the bad day for news, but Friday was the worst day in the stock market with a fall of 27.5 points. The week ended with Footsie clinging desperately to the 2,350 benchmark.</p>

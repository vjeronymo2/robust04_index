He said group order inflows had risen by 'around 4 per cent', and that order backlogs as of September 30 were 12 per cent higher than those of a year earlier. He attributed the gain in orders to growth at Preussag's shipbuilding and plant-engineering operations. He added that restructuring at the group's troubled Hagenuk telecommunications unit should be completed by the end of fiscal 1994-95.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer P&amp;P ahead sharply at Pounds 4.1m - Withdrawal from low margin computer distribution business behind advance P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services group which has pulled out of the low margin, high volume computer distribution business over the past 12 months, yesterday reported sharply higher full-year pre-tax profits. Profits of Pounds 4.1m in the 12 months to November 30 compared with a pre-FRS 3 outcome of Pounds 2m last time. The adoption of new accounting rules resulted in a restatement of the prior year results to show a Pounds 7.87m pre-tax loss after Pounds 9.88m of exceptional charges. Turnover remained relatively stable at Pounds 217.3m (Pounds 222.8m) despite the con-tinued downward movement in unit product prices throughout the year and the dis-posal of the high volume dis-tribution businesses in the UK and Belgium, which contributed Pounds 32.6m to total turnover. However, the flat turnover masked a substantial change in the business mix as the group withdrew from the lower margin distribution business to focus on higher margin computing services and higher value computer product sales. Overall gross margins, including the discontinued operations, improved to 19.1 per cent from 18.3 per cent, while the gross margin on continuing operations was 20.7 per cent. At the operating level profits grew to Pounds 4.53m (Pounds 3.14m) in-cluding Pounds 174,000 from the discontinued businesses. Mr David Southworth, group managing director, said P&amp;P was targeting a 5 per cent net margin. He said 1993 had been a transition year for the group. 'These results are very pleasing and reflect the substantial progress we have made during the year against the background of a difficult market, and the refocusing of our activities.' The pre-tax profits were struck after Pounds 4.63m of losses on the disposal of discontinued operations, offset by a Pounds 4.74m utilisation of 1992 provisions, and Pounds 535,000 (Pounds 1.13m) of net interest costs. The group ended the year with Pounds 7.5m of net cash, up from Pounds 3m a year earlier. Earnings per share of 4.3p compare with fully diluted earnings of 1.9p before the FRS 3 restatement and a 14p a share losses after restatement. The final dividend is increased by 71 per cent to 1.2p, making a total for the year of 2p (1.4p). COMMENT P&amp;P's management has successfully disengaged the group from the high vol-ume distribution busi-ness where gross margins were a paltry 10 per cent to concentrate on higher margin services and pro-ducts - including the desk-top communications market. Meanwhile costs have been brought under control, and in future the group will be targeting profit rather than turnover. Pre-tax pro-fits should reach Pounds 5.2m this year, producing earnings of about 5.6p. The shares, which shed 1p to close at 82p yesterday, are trading on a prospective p/e multiple of 14.6 and, despite a recent run-up, still have recovery potential.</p>

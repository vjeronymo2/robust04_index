			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Young hits at Europe 'obsession': IoD convention opens to poor attendance; Regulation causes despair British society is being divided by a futile obsession with Europe while its industrial advantage evaporates, Lord Young warned the Institute of Directors annual convention yesterday. The IoD president said the European Union was wasting its time 'in inward-looking arguments about lost causes' while the economies of Asia were set to become larger than those of Europe and North America within six years. 'By the millennium, the number of Asian households with an income of Dollars 30,000 or more will rise to 50m. How many homes in the UK have an income that high? Perhaps 3m and not more than 4m. Out there is a fast-growing market, perhaps 15 times greater than our own home market, for luxury and quality goods.' Yet the EU was 'fiddling whilst the Treaty of Rome burned', worrying over causes such as single currencies and political union. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, echoed Lord Young's sentiments in an attack on the German social market and French economic nationalism. Mr Morgan said Europe needed to change its wasteful regional, agricultural and industrial policies radically if it was to meet the challenges of the emerging markets. Both speakers emphasised the need for de-regulation in Europe, but Lord Young was particularly concerned over failure to remove trade barriers. Reflecting the feeling among many of the Institute's members that Europe was marginalising itself through over-regulation, Lord Young said the EU intergovernmental conference in 1996 was 'probably our last chance to wake up before the world passes us by'. 'It could take an axe to the institutions of the union and let in the spirit of enterprise. It could make a bonfire of directives and give real meaning to subsidiarity,' he said. 'Even the IMF has woken up to what we now have to do. Last week, they called for the EU to reverse two decades of rising unemployment by reforming employment protections, minimum wage laws, and unemployment insurance schemes,' said Lord Young. 'We are now at a crossroads,' he said. With Asia emerging as the new centre of gravity for commerce, it was 'high time' for British business to capture markets. Lord Young also appeared confident about the future of relations with Hong Kong. 'I met the president of China less than two weeks ago and he told me that nothing would affect business relationships with the UK,' he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov, Dmitriy </F> Gorokhov]    [Excerpt] Murmansk March 27 TASS -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev believes that the improvement of  legislature and the creation of a favorable investment climate  all over the country is a way out of the difficult economic  situation. This was declared during Kozyrev's meeting with  electors of the Murmansk region who elected Kozyrev to represent  their interests in the State Duma.    In Kozyrev's opinion, the process of transition of Russia's  northern regions to the market economy is going on slowly.  During Kozyrev's meeting with electors it was pointed out that  a canned fish factory and another plant were stopped in the  region because of economic difficulties. Metal works of the  Murmansk region and the Kolar nuclear power station have been  operating to half of their design capacity. It may seem a  paradox, but Murmansk, a traditional supplier of fish products  for all Russia, is currently facing serious shortages of marine  products.    The situation on the labour market has worsened as well.  Every six adult resident of the region is expected to look for  a job this year. Young people are abandoning northern areas  which face an increasingly difficult problem of financing.    Kozyrev believes that a way out of the critical situation  can  be found by improving the legislature which can be applied to  all northern regions of the country. He calls for better use of  the regional potential of the Kolar peninsula. [passage omitted]</p>

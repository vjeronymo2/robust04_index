			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshito Komatsu, Tokyo Economic Department </F> reporter: "Admitting Investment Advisers Into Public Pension  Business"]    [Text] The financial services sector has been added to the  demands for deregulation under the Japan-U.S. framework talks.  The demands encompasse a total of 12 items including  deregulation of pension fund and off-shore markets and  consolidation of licensing for advisors handling investment  trusts and other regular investments. The question is, will such  external pressure succeed in opening a way into Japanese  financial markets which are considered closed in nature compared  to those of other advanced nations and where the Ministry of  Finance (MOF) is said to exercise immense authority? This short  series of articles examines the nature of the U.S. demands,  problem areas of the Japanese systems, and the outlook for  deregulation.    The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan (ACCJ) presented a  report to the Japanese and U.S. governments which stated, "The  interests of many Japanese citizens are being compromised in the  management of pension funds." The ACCJ has prepared several  documents of this nature since last year distributing them not  only to agencies in Japan such as the MOF and Ministry of Health  and Welfare (MHW), but to the U.S. Treasury and influential  members of Congress in a stepped-up effort to open the Japanese  pension fund market.    The foremost issue presented in these documents is the  demand  that investment advisers be allowed to participate in the  management of public pension funds. The ACCJ assertion is  concise. Presently, Japanese public pension funds can be managed  only by trust banks and life insurance companies, but the  documents assert that investment advisory firms which specialize  in the management of stocks can manage such funds in a manner  which provides a higher rate of return. Fiscal year 1992 returns  on the welfare pension fund came were 5.86 percent (return on  designated pension based on current market value) when managed  by trust banks and 5.5 percent (return based on dividends paid  on general accounts) when managed by life insurance companies.  In contrast, investment advisers produced an average return of  6.65 percent.    A portion of the public pension reserves of the national  pension fund and welfare pension fund are managed by the Pension  Welfare Service Public Corporation (PWSC). The PWSC borrows  funds from the Funds Management Division of the MOF and  contracts with life insurance companies and trust banks for the  management of the funds. The total funds to be managed in fiscal  year 1994 is roughly $23 trillion yen. If the rate of return  were to improve one percent, assets would be enhanced by 230  billion yen.    There are three ways to secure funds to stabilize long-term  fiscal administration of pension funds. They include reductions  in benefits, increases in insurance premiums and enhancement of  returns through better management of funds. ACCJ stresses,  "Enhancement of returns through better management by using  investment advisers benefits the public, but revision of  benefits or insurance premiums will not be in the interests of  the public."    An official of the MHW obliquely glared at the deregulation  request from the U.S. side and cynically remarked, "I can't  imagine that the MOF will cave into the request to allow  participation by investment advisors in the management of  pension funds." The MHW had requested approval to contract with  investment advisors in connection with this fiscal year's budget  request, but the MOF rejected the request. The MHW asserts that  it would be illogical to approve the request under external  pressure, in view of the disapproval in connection with the  budget request.    The excuse used by the MOF in rejecting the request was,  "There is the question of maintaining safety in view of any  absence of guarantee on the principal." Officials at the MHW  were dissatisfied with the explanation saying, "It lacks  persuasiveness." The reason is that although provisions do exist  for inclusion of guarantees on principal in contracts with trust  banks, such provisions are not included.    The PWSC calculated the results of long-term management in  order to demonstrate the ability to safeguard principal even  when it is not guaranteed. The basis for calculating the  returns from FY73 to FY93 was to devide dividends by the value  of all stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange during the  period. The average annual rate of return for the 20 years was  9.65 percent and the assumption is that such a rate provides for  coverage of any short-term risk. During the 20-year period,  there were three years in which year-to-year declines in returns  were suffered, with the largest decline being at 27.4 percent,  but the long-term effects of such declines were minimal. If  rates of return are calculated in five-year cycles, only two  declines were found to have taken place and the rate of the  decline was minimal at 7.1 percent.    One informed official leaked behind-the-scenes information  when he said, "It appears MOF officials reached the conclusion  that pension fund markets may be opened in connection with the  Japan-U.S. summit held in February." Reportedly, a memorandum  had been prepared listing the assertions of the Japanese and  U.S. governments to clarify the disputed points concerning the  opening of pension fund markets. Suspension of the negotiations  has resulted in a postponement, but it appears that the  intention was for both governments to discuss the issue on the  basis of the memorandum and for the prime minister to arrive at  some sort of agreement during his visit to the United States.    U.S. sources say, "The United States has prepared  retaliatory  legislation for the financial services sector and the European  Union is ready to take coordinated action." They also point out  that unlike the automotive issue, very few people would be  injured as a result of the participation of investment advisors.  The question now posed is, what actions should be taken to  increase the source of pension benefits in the face of an aging  society? It appears the MOF faces some difficult options.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH IRVINE'S REAL LOCAL ISSUES  </P> <P> I must write in response to the Aug. 9 Newswatch item where Sally Anne  Sheridan, Irvine's mayor, is quoted as saying she had to move her business  office from Irvine to Newport Beach.  </P> <P> She states her reason for the move to be that Irvine residents kept coming into  her office and complaining about trees and dog poop in the parkways.  </P> <P> In fact, according to the quote, it was so horrendous with all the people  coming in to see the mayor that she couldn't get anything done.  </P> <P> Isn't Mrs. Sheridan the person who recently ran for the office of mayor saying  that she would concentrate on local issues and accused then-Mayor Larry Agran  of spending too much time on global issues?  </P> <P> In my opinion, what's more local than trees and dog poop in the parkways, Mayor  Sheridan?  </P> <P> MARILYN J. VASSOS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

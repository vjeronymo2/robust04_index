			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF COASTS, NOT SABATINI; NOW THEY'LL CLASH AT OPEN  </P> <P> Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini, last year's finalists, took divergent routes  into the U.S. Open semifinals today.  </P> <P> Graf, the top seed and defending champion, needed only 44 minutes to rout No. 8  Helena Sukova, 6-1, 6-1. It was the 11th straight victory over Sukova for Graf,  winner of six of the last seven Grand Slam events.  </P> <P> Sabatini, seeded third, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario went more than 44 minutes  in the first set alone. The baseliners played extended points throughout their  2-hour, 17-minute match, won by Sabatini 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Graf and Sabatini, who are doubles partners and have reached the semifinals  here, will meet in Friday's singles semis. No. 2 Martina Navratilova and her  conqueror in last year's Open, No. 5 Zina Garrison, are in the other semifinal.  Garrison ended Chris Evert's Grand Slam career on Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Am a Machine'  </P> <P> For Graf, it was business as usual. The West German star has lost only 14 games  in five matches, and she never allowed Sukova to get into their match.  </P> <P> "I am a machine, you know," she joked. "I tried to do my best. If this is the  outcome against Helena Sukova, 6-1, 6-1, then I should do all right.  </P> <P> "I'm happy about the way that I was playing. That's more important than any  score or time."  </P> <P> Sukova said she was looking for perfection, which was the wrong approach.  </P> <P> "I really didn't have to play the perfect shot, as I tried to do all of the  time," she said. "It puts so much pressure on your serve to do that.  </P> <P> "You know, it doesn't have to be on the line, it can be a meter from the line,  and I was certainly pushing it too much, to be a perfect shot, and it didn't  work."  </P> <P> Sabatini had to work hard against Sanchez, the 17-year-old French Open champion  from Spain. Sabatini's serve was broken four times in the first set. She also  broke Sanchez twice in the sloppy set.  </P> <P> "I think I started playing a little slow," said Sabatini, who lost to Sanchez  in their last meeting, at the Canadian Open in August. "I was not moving my  legs very much. I knew I had to keep in the match with a better forehand and  attack a little more."  </P> <P> Sabatini had 34 unforced errors and only 22 winners.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our Cabinda correspondent reports that UNITA's  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] armed  forces in that province will not tolerate provocations by the  government army. The correspondent says since mid-May,  government forces have been involved in an offensive against  positions of UNITA and the Front for the Liberation of the  Cabinda Enclave [FLEC] in the northern part of the territory.  The offensive has already claimed many innocent lives.    In a counteroffensive launched on 1 June, the Armed Forces  for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] overran a People's Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] convoy moving from  (Nicuma) to Buco Zau. At the end a four-hour fierce clash,  FAPLA troops fled, leaving seven dead behind. Large quantities  of war materiel, including four RPG-7's and three PKM machine  guns were captured. In a separate incident, FALA destroyed a  FAPLA motorized column moving from (Choa) in support of  government forces in northern Cabinda. Nine FAPLA soldiers were  killed and six vehicles burned. The survivors fled in disarray.    Meanwhile, latest reports from the city of Bie [Cuito] say  artillery fire was exchanged last night. Light weapons were  heard near government positions this morning.    No changes had been reported yesterday. MPLA-PT [Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] fighter  aircraft continued to bomb civilian targets, while FAPLA  infantry units shelled wards controlled by UNITA in a failed  attempt to break through UNITA defensive lines. Our  correspondent reports that decomposed corpses of government  soldiers are scattered on the roads of Bie. MPLA-PT troops are  using UN relief food earmarked for civilians.</p>

The petitioner proposes to use a portable hydraulic unit to supply power to the necessary functions of disabled equipment in order to move it safely. The petitioner states that proper training would be provided to every miner responsible for using this equipment. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

No. 36&hyph;08454) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because of steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternate, when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

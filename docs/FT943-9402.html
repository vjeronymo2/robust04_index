			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: WPP defers research float WPP, the marketing services company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 36.2m for the half year to June 30 - up 50 per cent and in line with expectations - and put the flotation of part of its market research business onto the back burner. In March WPP said the flotation, intended to help cut debt, was likely this year and would yield up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m). The group had been saying more recently that adverse market conditions meant that the timing was being kept under review. Yesterday the board said it was continuing to consider various forms of financing and ways of strengthening the capital structure, but 'the improvement in profitability and cashflow and the achievement of the group's financial objectives so far this year has lessened the need to examine these alternatives'. Revenue fell by 1.3 per cent to Pounds 690.5m (Pounds 699.7m), mainly because of disposals. However, on a like-for-like and constant currency basis, revenues rose by more than 4 per cent. Operating margins improved from 6.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent. Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, said that margins were ahead of the group's financial objectives, but still below the benchmark of 10 to 11 per cent achieved by WPP's best-performing competitors. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose to 2.6p (1.7p). An interim dividend of 0.385p (0.35p) is declared. A statement on future prospects was cautious: the group said May and June had been the best two consecutive months for two-and-a-half years, but overall the first six months had been 'patchy and inconsistent'. The uncertain pattern of activity 'may reflect tax increases on both sides of the Atlantic and continued concern about job security among consumers and management'. Plans, budgets and forecasts of revenues were being made on a 'conservative basis'. Net debt averaged Pounds 280m in the first half, down 25 per cent from Pounds 372m. The group benefited from a Pounds 85m rights issue in March 1993. The beginning of next month will see the banks, which bailed WPP out two years ago in a Dollars 271.6m debt-for-equity swap, free to sell their 190m shares, which represent 26.5 per cent of the enlarged share capital.

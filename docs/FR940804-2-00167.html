			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall be made known promptly and in writing to all Participating Insurance Companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract owners so long as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for Contract owners. Accordingly, the Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their Accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their Accounts calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Accounts will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing their participation in the Funds. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares for which it has not received voting instructions as well as shares attributable to it in the same proportion as it votes shares for which it has received instructions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. All reports received by the Board of potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to: (a) determining the existence of a conflict; (b) notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict; and (c) determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other appropriate records. Such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Each Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that separate account prospectus disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. Each Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that: (a) shares of the Fund are offered in connection with mixed and shared funding; (b) material conflicts may arise from mixed and shared funding arrangements; and (c) the Board will monitor for the existence of any material conflicts and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Each Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, and, in particular, each Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section 16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, (although the Funds are not within the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act) as well as with Section 16(a), and, if applicable, Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, each Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. If and to the extent that Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) are amended (or if Rule 6e&hyph;3 under the 1940 Act is adopted) to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed and shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested by Applicants, then the Funds and the Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T), as amended, and Rule 6e&hyph;3, as adopted, to the extent applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. No less than annually, the Participating Insurance Companies and/or MFS (or any other investment advisor of a Fund) shall submit to the Boards such reports, materials, or data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Boards may carry out fully the obligations imposed by the conditions contained in the application. Such reports, materials, and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Boards. The obligations of the Participating Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Boards shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. If a Plan should become an owner of 10% or more of the assets of a Fund, such Plan will execute a fund participation agreement with the applicable Fund. A Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgment of this condition upon such Plan's initial purchase of shares of any Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards of Section 6(c), are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Quality Care static at Pounds 1.52m - Fall in occupancy rates blamed on Community Care Act Shares in Quality Care Homes fell 23p to 290p yesterday after the nursing homes group announced flat profits in the six months to April 30 and failed to increase its interim dividend. The slowdown was blamed partly on increased competition and on a fall in occupancy rates following the implementation of the Community Care Act last year. Pre-tax profits rose just 2.3 per cent to Pounds 1.52m (Pounds 1.49m) despite a 30 per cent rise in turnover from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 5.34m. The company had warned that profits growth would slow this year due to the opening of several new homes which take some months to become profitable. But the impact has been greater than the market expected because of lower occupancy rates. Mr Duncan Bannatyne, chairman and chief executive, said: 'New homes are taking longer to fill and profits from existing homes were down.' At the end of April the group had 699 'established' beds - in homes open for more than eight months - with an occupancy level of 91.7 per cent, down from 96.2 per cent a year earlier. It had a further 242 new beds, of which 162 were filled, giving a total occupancy rate of only 85 per cent. In the established homes costs increased faster than fees with the group reacting to greater competition by, for example, abolishing charges for physiotherapy and chiropody. However, a 3.5 per cent fee increase in April would improve the second half performance, the company said. Operating profits rose to Pounds 1.65m (Pounds 1.49m) but the net interest bill jumped to Pounds 128,000 (Pounds 54,000). Although earnings per share rose to 7.99p (7.67p), Mr Bannatyne said that given the slowing cash flow from operations, which fell slightly to Pounds 1.61m, it would be wrong to increase the interim dividend. It is held at 1.5p. The group now has 1,250 beds in operation or under construction and has agreement in principle for bank facilities of over Pounds 20m which would allow it to develop up to 2,000 beds. Gearing, which was 29 per cent at the end of the first half, is expected to rise to about 45 per cent at the year end. Mr Bannatyne said he expected the Community Care changes to lead to permanent reduction in occupancy rates of 1 to 2 per cent.</p>

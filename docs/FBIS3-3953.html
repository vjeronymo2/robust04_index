"The reason we stand for seeking a solution through dialogue  is that we believe this issue can be solved through it," a  Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    Spokesman Wu Jianmin told journalists at his weekly  briefing,  "We oppose exerting pressure as this will only serve to sharpen  the conflict," he said when asked if China would veto UN  Security Council sanctions.    "Exerting pressure is not helpful for carrying out dialogue,  and we do not wish to see the issue referred to the UN Security  Council," he said.    Wu did not respond to questions on whether Beijing and  Pyongyang are presently holding consultations.    He said despite present difficulties, previous talks had  progressed and he called on all sides to show patience.</p>

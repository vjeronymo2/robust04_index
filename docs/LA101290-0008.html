			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COP  </P> <P> Help me understand. Officer Carl McGill has been such a fine cop that he's  gained national recognition -- but now faces suspension for being loud and  boisterous and disrespectful ("Officer Asks: Can Good Cop Excel in L.A.?" Sept.  29, Metro).  </P> <P> It sounds like charges of being uppity to me, and it shouldn't be so -- when I  need help, I kind of like my protector being a little rough and loud!  </P> <P> Punitive fault-finding destroys morale, and McGill already sounds affected. He  speaks as if he hinges his praiseworthy efforts on being a member of the Police  Department, and one gets the feeling such fine work will end if he feels  compelled to retire. This is not good -- communities need their McGills whether  they're cops or not!  </P> <P> EDWARD T. BAGLEY, La Puente  </P></p>

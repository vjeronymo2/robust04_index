			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOARING DAVID PARSONS DANCERS SEEM TO DEFY GRAVITY IN PERFORMANCE AT UCSD  </P> <P> David Parsons has an easy musicality, an active funny bone,and some interesting  ideas in his bag of choreographic tricks.  </P> <P> Sunday night in San Diego, under blinking strobe lights that created a  marvelous illusion of flight, Parsons awed the crowd in "Caught," his  most-celebrated solo. The whistles and screams of approval began as soon as the  dancer took flight on this exciting airborne romp across the Mandeville  Auditorium stage.  </P> <P> Parsons came down to earth regularly during the course of the dance, but you  couldn't prove it by what you saw on stage. Every time the lights flashed on to  capture the nimble dancer in action, he was hurtling through space in  gravity-defying, mid-air maneuvers.  </P> <P> But Parsons was at his best in "The Envelope," where he revealed a great gift  for parody; complex, lightning-quick encounters, and quirky motor patterns.  </P> <P> Parsons' inventive signature piece, "The Envelope" takes plenty of shots at the  dance world's sacred cows, and it hit the bull's-eye Sunday night with its wry  moves and clever theatrical trickery. A black-hooded ensemble meandered through  the zany eccentricities of its bent-backed moves with gleeful abandon, and made  it a splendid curtain-raiser. It's unfortunate that the sound system was  slightly out of control for this piece.  </P> <P> For years, Parsons danced as a stellar attraction with the world-class Paul  Taylor Dance Company. This trip, though, he was resident choreographer of his  own troupe, the Parsons Dance Company, which has drawn itself a spot on the  international dance map in just two short years.  </P> <P> The eight-member troupe was bogged down with injuries when it made its Los  Angeles debut last spring (even the boss was sidelined by knee surgery). On  Sunday, only Dianne Howarth was out, with a herniated disk, and some hasty  reshuffling was necessary.  </P> <P> Parsons danced four of the five works on the program. He even filled in for the  ailing Howarth in one dance. The other six who joined Parsons for the company's  premiere performance in San Diego were all nicely in tune with his mercurial  style of movement.  </P> <P> Parsons chose a representative sampling of his wares, including two of his  best-known works -- "The Envelope" (1984) and "Caught" (1982), the dazzling  solo that owes as much to high-tech theatrical wizardry as to Parsons' prowess  as dancer/choreographer.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, some Tayloresque trademarks were apparent in Parsons' work.  The Taylor veteran honed his skills with the master for nine years. And at  times (particularly in the hard-driving dance designs for "Elysian Fields,"  which bombarded the senses with endless outbursts of physical force), Parsons  ran out of ideas before the dance wound down to a close. "Sleep Study" offered  a complete catalogue of mattress-based moves -- everything but resting, that  is. Parsons, like Taylor, has an active comic imagination, and he put it to  good use in this delightful bit of whimsy. Unfortunately, the poor rake at  Mandeville makes it next to impossible to discern the floor-bound moves from  most of the seats.  </P> <P> The weakest offering was "Elysian Fields," which was designed as an outraged  response to gratuitous violence but ended up as just another confusing example  of it. The sword-wielding Parsons looked self-righteous as he engaged the  ensemble with dangerous-looking swordplay. However, it was a case of sound and  fury signifying nothing. In the end, the message was muddled.  </P> <P> "Scrutiny" had its genesis in a personal experience for Parsons -- a cover  story in Dance magazine that turned his company debut into a media event.  Apparently, emotions got the better of Parsons here, because his motional  patterns never quite caught up with the thematic content, and the dance quickly  grew as tiresome as the music.  </P> <P> Lighting designer Howell Binkley (who lit the entire program so artfully)  bathed the dancers in cloudy cones of colored light and provided a suitably  murky ambience for "Scrutiny," but there were too many overworked images in the  dance designs (many looking like warmed-over Taylorisms). If the piece were  half as long, it might have been twice as good.  </P> <P> But Parsons seems to be closing in on what he wants. With a little shaping, his  choreography career could turn out to be as bright as his dancing days.  </P></p>

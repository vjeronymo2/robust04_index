			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the Center [Tsentr] deputy group held  its regular meeting at which an appeal to Supreme Council deputy  factions was adopted. The appeal, in particular, states the  following:    We, the Ukrainian people's deputies united in the Center  group, propose to other deputy groups and party factions to  create a parliamentary bloc of centrist orientation. We believe  that a union of forces taking realistic constructive stands is  quite possible since the majority of deputies, including those  from political parties, participated in the elections with close  or similar programs. People hope that the new Supreme Council  body will be able to consolidate itself around creative and  constructive tasks, as well as take hold of the situation in  advance and turn it around for the better. We have no right to  disappoint them. We see the primary task of the bloc as the  prevention of a crisis of power. We have to form working and  permanent Supreme Council bodies and a government in an  efficient and civilized way; without losing time and effort, to  begin legislative work; to subject our influence to the  processes of state development; and to establish reliable  parliamentary control over all sectors under the powers which  were granted to the Supreme Council by Ukraine's Constitution.    The first great accomplishment of the new Supreme Council  could be the quick completion and adoption of a new Ukrainian  constitution -- a clear determination of what kind of state we  are building and where we are headed.    Second: It is very [word indistinct] to find ways out of the  economic crisis and to immediately begin the implementation of  balanced market reforms which can be understood and supported by  society. Our urgent need is to accomplish economic  restructuring, fundamentally revise and liberalize tax policies,  and reform monetary and credit policies, as well as the banking  system. It is necessary to take resolute steps toward the quick  overcoming of the payment crisis and the prevention of a  threatened halt in production. In particular, the active  support of basic industries is necessary.    Third: [Word indistinct] correctives have to be introduced  in the state's social policy. People cannot suffer any longer  from the striking inconsistency between prices, on the one hand,  and the level of wages, pensions, stipends, and other payments  on the other. It is necessary that every able-bodied man be able  to secure a decent standard of living for himself and his family  by way of his own work, while the state should take care of  pensioners, invalids, large families, and the other most  vulnerable sectors of society.    Finally, fourth: It is a task of extreme importance to  strengthen the peace and accord between different segments of  society, regions, and people of different nationalities and  beliefs. It is the patriotic task of all political forces to  preserve Ukraine's territorial integrity and the inviolability  of its borders. A particular urgency has been acquired by the  problems connected with the course of events in Crimea and the  situation surrounding the Black Sea Fleet. They are to be  resolved on the basis of Ukraine's Constitution and current laws.    The above considerations can become the basis for unifying  deputy groups of centrist orientation in a parliamentary bloc.  Understandably, they can be specified in the process of agreeing  on positions. They can be the basis for working out a concrete  course of action.</p>

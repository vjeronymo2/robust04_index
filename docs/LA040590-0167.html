			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GUARDS SUE TO EASE CROWDING AT PRISON  </P> <P> Guards at Graterford State Prison have sued the state, claiming they are  endangered by overcrowding in the nation's fifth largest prison.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Commonwealth Court, asks the court to order the  state to reduce the prison's population to "safer, more manageable levels."  </P> <P> It also asks for improvements in the prison's sewage, water and electrical  facilities.  </P> <P> The lawsuit is believed to be the nation's first by prison guards seeking to  relieve prison crowding, said Michael Fox, of Council 13 of the American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  </P> <P> The maximum-security prison northwest of Philadelphia has a capacity of 2,734  inmates. It held 4,212 inmates on Tuesday, including 510 serving life sentences  and 24 on Death Row, prison spokesman Alan J. LeFebvre said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BRONCOS' EZOR PLEADS GUILTY  </P> <P> Denver Broncos running back Blake Ezor pleaded guilty today to attempted retail  fraud and was sentenced to 24 hours of community service.  </P> <P> Ezor said he agreed to the plea bargain to get the case over and to ensure he  wouldn't be sentenced to any jail time.  </P> <P> He originally was charged with second-degree retail fraud in the June 6  incident at a Meridian Township store in Ingham County.  </P> <P> The former Michigan State football standout said it actually was his brother,  Burt, who switched price tags on a compact disc player and portable stereo. But  he told the judge he knew what was going on, and abetted the crime by placing  one of the items back on the store shelf.  </P> <P> "I was not going to turn my brother in," Ezor said. "I told him I wanted no  part in it and went to sit in the car."  </P> <P> He said that after a store employee came running out of the store, "I could  have drove off. I could have even outrun him. I did comply because I felt I was  innocent. I know now it is wrong that I did not turn my brother in."  </P></p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Thai government warned on underground railway cost Tanayong, the Bangkok-based property developer, has warned the Thai government that moving its planned 23km elevated railway underground will be expensive, disruptive and throw its scheme three years behind schedule. The Thai cabinet last week strongly requested contractors for all three overhead rail projects to consider moving underground within the 25 sq km of the city centre. This followed growing public concern that an obtrusive infrastructure spaghetti would wreck the environment and exacerbate the already appalling traffic jams. The government has promised to defray the extra costs of going underground. But it will not force Tanayong, nor the Hong Kong group Hopewell Holdings, which plans an ambitious 60km network, even partially underground because 30-year build-and-operate franchises have already been signed. The property company Bangkok Land is still negotiating for the franchise to a third railway. Mr Kasame Chatikavanij, chairman of Tanayong's wholly owned subsidiary, Bangkok Transit System Corporation, said subterranean railways were two or three times more expensive than their elevated equivalents; certainly much more than the 30 per cent premium frequently quoted in the local press. He challenged anyone able to build an underground at no more than a 30 per cent premium - Dollars 26m (Pounds 17m) a kilometre - to identify themselves. 'BTSC,' he said, 'is ready to sign a contract with them.' Mr Colin Weir, Hopewell's operations manager in Bangkok, said the government may not have 'thought through' the implications of trying to run any of its planned elevated 'sandwich' of roads, railways and property underground. 'If they want the whole thing underground (in the city centre), then that is a huge thing they are asking for,' he said. Tanayong has so far failed to reach agreement with its 'preferred contractor' - a consortium led by the Anglo-French group GEC Alsthom and the Bangkok developer Italian-Thai - probably perhaps because it is difficult to show how it can generate sufficient revenues from a privately run railway alone. Mr Bob Kevorkian, managing director of Metro 2000, a consortium led by Germany's Philipp Holzmann, which has campaigned for an underground as 'the only real solution,' yesterday reiterated that 'we stand firm - we can build an underground for a total cost, excluding financing, of Bt1.5bn (Pounds 39.5m) per kilometre. That's not so very different from BTSC's figures of Bt1.05bn for costs excluding financing.'</p>

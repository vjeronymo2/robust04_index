			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cathay in Hong Kong air freight deal CATHAY Pacific Airways yesterday said it had agreed provisionally with Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) to buy 10 per cent of the colony's monopoly handler of air freight for HKDollars 95m (Dollars 12.31m). Cathay said the deal was subject to HACTL being awarded an air cargo handling licence for Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok. If it goes through, the Swire Group, which already owns 30 per cent of the company, will increase its stake to 40 per cent. Two weeks ago, China National Aviation Corporation (Canc) paid HKDollars 106m for the Hong Kong government's 10 per cent stake in HACTL. Its purchase was not conditional upon HACTL's success in winning a licence to operate at the new airport. Cathay will acquire HKDollars 4m of shareholder's loans to the company. If the loan facilities are fully exercised Cathay's commitment could be as high as HKDollars 30m. If the deal, which is due on or before January 1995, goes through, Jardine Matheson will sell Cathay a 5 per cent stake, of its 30 per cent shareholding, and Wharf and Hutchison Whampoa Docks will each sell it a 2.5 per cent stake of their 15 per cent shareholdings. Mr Peter Sutch, Cathay chairman, said cargo handling was one of the fastest-growing aspects of Cathay's business. 'This agreement demonstrates our intention to continue to be a major force in Hong Kong's air freight industry,' he said.</p>

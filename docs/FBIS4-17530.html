			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Ashkhabad 22 April TASS -- Turkmenistan will export  its gas with China's and Japan's help. A preliminary agreement  was reached on this score here today between the Turkmenian  Ministry for Petroleum and Gas and officials of the Chinese  National Oil Corporation, accompanying Li Peng, premier of the  PRC State Council, in his 12-day tour of four Central Asian  countries-members of the Commonwealth of Independent States  (CIS).    China undertakes to build the necessary pipeline, says the  bilateral protocol of intent. A commission, including  Turkmenian, Chinese and Japanese experts, will be set up shortly  to draw up the project, the document notes.    The question of building an Asian super-pipeline was raised  during Turkmenian President Saparmurad Niyazov's visit to China  in November 1992.    Representatives of Turkmenian and Chinese business circles  have also concluded an agreement to deliver 20,000 tonnes of  cotton to China, to promote contacts between the Chambers of  Commerce of the two countries, to supply to Turkmenistan  Chinese-made electrical household appliances, and to build  steel-smelting and aluminium plants.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Court will  render a final decision on Rep. Pak Chol-on's last appeal on  June 28.    Should the court dismiss Rep. Park's final appeal, the  original decision will be upheld and his application for bail  automatically rejected. But if the court reverses the original  decision, it is likely that he may be released immediately since  his prison term ends in less than six months.    Rep. Pak was convicted of bribery and sentenced to one and a  half years in prison and fined 600 million won (about 743,500  U.S. dollars) in an appeal hearing held on March 14. He then  appealed to the Supreme Court and asked to be released on bail.    Park, once called the "crown prince" during the days of the  No Tae-u government, was arrested in May last year on charges of  taking bribes totaling 600 million won in three installments  from slot-machine kingpin Chong Tok-il in October and November  1990.    If Pak is found guilty, he will lose his parliamentary seat  and the right to run for parliament or other public office for  the coming five years. A special election to replace him would  be held within 90 days in the Susong-a Electoral District of  Taegu City.</p>

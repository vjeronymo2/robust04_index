			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHWESTERN DINING: NEW MEXICO STYLE  </P> <P> No matter where you travel in the Southwest, you can count on two truisms. One:  the weather will not be what you expect and two: wherever you are is the only  place you can sample genuinely authentic Southwestern food.  </P> <P> I had these facts confirmed once again when I joined a group of fellow food  writers on a recent study tour of Southwestern foods in New Mexico. Expecting  the blazing hot days and semi-cool nights of late July, most of us packed  accordingly. Big mistake. We should have packed sweaters and hip boots, as we  were inundated during all but the last day of the New Mexican portion of our  trip with heavy-duty, gully-washing downpours. Considering California's  near-drought condition, I kept wishing I could figure a way to blow the  constant deluge our way.  </P> <P> The food was something else again. Although we did eat in some of New Mexico's  better restaurants, such as Andre's in Albuquerque and Coyote Cafe and La Casa  Sena in Santa Fe, we were looking more for the historical background of  Southwestern food, New Mexico-style.  </P> <P> We wanted to identify the ingredients and food preparation techniques that  differentiate New Mexican cuisine from those of other Southwestern states,  including California. So, rather than spending most of our time investigating  New Mexico's contemporary food scene, we visited a number of Indian pueblos and  talked with American Indians and museum and university authorities to learn  more about the origins of this chile-spiced cuisine.  </P> <P> What we discovered is that traditional ingredients have remained popular  throughout the centuries. Some methods of preparation have been modernized but  many haven't. Those that have really have affected the end result very little.  </P> <P> Although basically American Indian rather than Spanish (Mexican) in origin, New  Mexican home-style menus show great similarity to the foods of other  Southwestern states. But seasonings, some ingredients and many of the food  presentations and preparation techniques are different.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Dominant Ingredients  </P> <P> Chiles and corn are two ingredients that dominated nearly every menu we  sampled. That's hardly surprising considering that chiles are the No. 1  vegetable crop in the state, according to Paul W. Bosland, assistant professor  in the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at New Mexico State University  in Las Cruces.  </P> <P> Bosland, a recognized authority on chiles, told us with a great deal of pride  that New Mexico grows more chiles than Texas and California combined. New  Mexicans take their chiles very seriously. They know the best places to find  the hottest -- around Hatch, N.M. -- and as far as most New Mexicans are  concerned, the hotter the chile, the better.  </P> <P> A traveler unfamiliar with the local penchant for spiciness will survive a New  Mexican visit better if he or she approaches any bowl of green chile stew  offered with caution. I personally ran afoul of one such offering at the Santa  Ana Pueblo north of Albuquerque when a gracious American Indian hostess allowed  me to sample some of her green chile stew. I thought my palate was geared to  hot foods since I adore spicy curries and good Sichuan dishes. One bite of her  stew, however, paralyzed my vocal chords, and I broke out in a sweat. That  stuff was just plain hot. But, once the shock of that first taste was over, I  realized it also was very good.  </P> <P> The No. 1 chile grown in New Mexico is the somewhat mild Anaheim, or long green  chile, so familiar to fans of California-style Southwestern cuisine. But where  we usually find locally grown Anaheims in the fresh green state, in New Mexico  they often are allowed to mature to a ripe red color before picking. The  dehydrated red pod usually is crushed into powder and used as a flavoring or to  add color to prepared dishes.  </P> <P> There is one other marked difference between the Anaheims grown here and those  cultivated in New Mexico. The higher temperatures and different soil in New  Mexico produce chiles that are hotter than the same variety of chiles grown  elsewhere.  </P> <P> The major difficulty facing chile growers at present, according to Bosland, is  that there is almost no way to grow chiles of this type with a predictable,  uniform heat factor. "Right now we're working on that problem," Bosland said,  "but we haven't solved it yet. One chile may be hotter than blazes while the  one next to it is mild."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Spiritual Significance  </P> <P> As with most of the ingredients used in the New Mexican Indian cuisine, corn  has a deep spiritual significance for the cook. In her small but definitive  cookbook on Pueblo and Navajo foods and culture, "Southwest Indian Cookbook,"  (Clear Light Publications, Weehawken, N.J., $9.95) photojournalist Marcia  Keegan quotes Agnes Dill, a prominent American Indian leader from the Isleta  Pueblo. According to Dill, corn, the most important of all American Indian  foods, comes in six colors. Each represents a direction. White is the east, red  south, blue west and yellow north. Black is up and speckled is down.  </P> <P> Yellow and white corn products are certainly familiar to most modern cooks, and  blue corn has developed into a trendy food in recent years. Most of the other  colored corns, however, tend to be used simply for decoration outside of the  Southwest heartland. Blue corn products are generally in limited supply in the  Los Angeles area, but you can find them in many health food stores and some  upscale food shops.  </P> <P> Still other ways in which New Mexican foods, both traditional and contemporary,  differ from similar foods in other Southwestern areas lie in the types of  seasonings used and the techniques of preparation.  </P> <P> Over and over again, New Mexicans assured us that "the use of sour cream on  these foods is Californian. We don't use it as a topping for enchiladas,  tostadas and the like." Mexican oregano is a popular herb and ground comino  (cumin) is often used in New Mexican cuisine and cilantro is not. In fact,  except for salt, chiles, garlic and the aforementioned oregano, few spices and  herbs are used in basic New Mexican cookery. Juniper berries and pinon nuts are  frequently used for flavoring in stews and heartier dishes.  </P> <P> Although contemporary New Mexicans utilize a much broader array of spices,  herbs and other ingredients that are to be found in the historical foods native  to the area, they prepare many recipes familiar to Cal-Mex food lovers quite  differently.  </P> <P> Enchiladas more often are made by stacking the filled tortillas rather than  rolling them. And it's de rigueur for New Mexican cooks to top off the stack  with a fried egg. Also, while Margaritas, served over ice rather than frapped,  are often the drink choice of diners out for a night on the town, many  traditional homes serve the modern counterpart of an earlier era's favorite  fruit drink, none other than cherry-flavored Kool-Aid.  </P> <P> Two menus, sampled a day apart in Santa Fe, turned out to be excellent examples  of the types of foods readily available to hungry diners in search of real New  Mexican food.  </P> <P> Former Santa Fe resident Jane Butel, a cookbook author and cooking teacher who  now lives in New York, demonstrated how to prepare chiles rellenos, carne  adobada, enchiladas, sopaipillas and several other traditional foods for one of  the meals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Upscale Version  </P> <P> In contrast, the second menu was a delightful upscale creation prepared by  Culinary Institute of America graduate Kip McClerin, now chef at the historic  La Casa Sena restaurant on Palace Avenue in the Sena Plaza.  </P> <P> Butel's menu was based on recipes from her book, "Jane Butel's Tex-Mex  Cookbook" ($14.95, Harmony Books). Although the book's title may lead you to  believe that it is devoted solely to Texas-type Southwestern foods, it isn't.  The book really covers a wide variety of Southwestern foods, many of them  decidely New Mexican.  </P> <P> McClerin chose to serve what he termed "home spun food," but it was far from  the earthier, more traditional fare we had been sampling up to that time. He  used local products, yes -- blue corn, nopales, poblano and chipotle chiles  (dried, smoked jalapenos), regional fruits and local cheeses. But what he did  with them in no way resembled the foods we had been dining on previously.  </P> <P> The following recipes are from these two meals. One caveat. They are not for  fat or cholesterol watchers or for anyone counting calories. They are, however,  good food, New Mexican-style.  </P> <P> La Casa Sena Luncheon  </P> <P> Chilled Roasted Poblano Veloute  </P> <P> Grilled Chicken Breasts With Chipotle Chantilly Sauce  </P> <P> Blue Corn Muffins  </P> <P> Fried Prickly Pear Cactus Strips  </P> <P> Poached Apricots With Raspberry Wine Sauce  </P> <P> Jane Butel's New Mexican Luncheon  </P> <P> Chiles Rellenos  </P> <P> Enchiladas New Mexico-Style  </P> <P> Carne Adobada  </P> <P> Sopaipillas  </P> <P> Food Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane Dinnerware and accessories  from The Broadway  </P> <P> CHILLED ROASTED POBLANO VELOUTE  </P> <P> 3 medium fresh poblano chiles  </P> <P> 1 cup warm chicken stock  </P> <P> 1 cup Gewurtztraminer wine  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 cups half and half  </P> <P> 2 cups whipping cream, whipped only until frothy  </P> <P> Fresh whole cilantro leaves  </P> <P> Roast chiles under broiler, turning frequently, until skins are well blistered.

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Science that provides no absolute answers Sir, In her article, 'Greens' bogus science' (September 6) Bronwen Maddox attacks Brian Wynne and myself for criticising the way that science is used in environmental policy. Bronwen Maddox's own analysis amply illustrates the issues by conferring a 'rigour' on science which the Financial Times would never ascribe to economics. She concludes that there is a firm distinction between 'needless worries' and 'real threats'. She implies this difference can be proved. In real life, science, like economics, is not like that. Nor is decision making. The problem we and others have identified is that science is systematically abused by governments and industry in order to use its authority to disguise value judgments and policy decisions. A common example is the use of the absence of data to imply there is nothing happening in the environment: for example, the now discredited principle of 'dilute and disperse' was justified because sulphur emissions or sewage discharges were diluted to the point of immeasurability. Similarly, the UK government measures radioactive emissions, but it assumes that a one in 10,000 risk of dying as a result of radioactive discharges is acceptable: the measurements are scientific but the definition of the problem (a 'real threat or a needless worry') is not. Bronwen Maddox claims that the proposals for a precautionary approach 'destroy any notion of proof'. In reality, scientific proof of safety is already unattainable and it is in the face of this that we propose the implementation of a precautionary approach. We should use the best scientific knowledge available to us to make decisions but not ignore its limitations in favour of vested interests.

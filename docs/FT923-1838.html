			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce in CDollars 140m aircraft engine venture ROLLS-ROYCE, the UK aero-engine maker, is forming a company in Canada to develop and manufacture an industrial version of its Trent 800 turbofan aircraft engine in co-operation with Westinghouse Electric. The total cost of the venture will be CDollars 140m (Pounds 66m) of which CDollars 17m will be in the form of interest-free loans from the federal and Quebec governments. The net cost to Rolls-Royce will be reduced, however, by various investment tax credits. The company, to be called Rolls-Royce Gas Turbine Engines Canada, will be located near Montreal and will initially employ 50 engineers. Rolls-Royce already has a substantial presence in Canada, with subsidiaries employing 3,250 people and annual revenues of more than CDollars 500m. Rolls-Royce said the engine, with a generating capacity of 50 megawatts, will be designed for industrial power generation and for utilities requiring peak-hour generating capacity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS--"Relations between Ukraine and  Crimea should be built on an equal and mutually beneficial  basis. This will be the main topic of my meeting with President  Yuriy Meshkov, which is due to be held in Simferopol on 7 May,"  Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy told TASS on  Thursday [5 May].    The proposed meeting is prompted by yesterday's closed-door  talks between Zvyahilskyy and Crimea's Deputy Prime Minister  Yevgeniy Saburov. The Ukrainian acting prime minister was  pleased that when asked with whom the peninsula was siding,  Saburov answered definitely: "with Ukraine."    "Only after this, I made up my mind to meet the Crimean  president," Zvyahilskyy stressed.</p>

"This shows that to attack China by using the human rights  issue is unpopular," he said, to a thunderous applause from the  NPC deputies.    The premier said, "deputies, I would like to tell you a  just-  received news dispatch. In a vote yesterday evening by the U.N.  Human Rights Commission, an anti-China motion raised by some  countries met with failure once again. This shows convincingly  that it is unpopular to attack China by using the human rights  issue. Here, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all  justice- upholding countries for their support to China on  behalf of the Chinese Government and people."    The premier said, "China values human rights and is willing  to discuss the matter with other members of the international  community on the basis of mutual equality."    "However, it will never allow anyone to interfere in its  internal affairs under any pretext," he said.    The Chinese Government supports a latest resolution adopted  by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights denouncing certain  countries for putting pressure on developing countries in this  regard, he added.</p>

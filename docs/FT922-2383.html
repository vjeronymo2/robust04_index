			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / EFA production may be delayed: Eurofighter compromise aired A COMPROMISE plan to keep Germany in the European Fighter Aircraft project could mean production of the aircraft being delayed to allow time for Bonn's budget crisis to ease. Proponents of the scheme in Britain and Germany hope to put off the final decision. This was to have been taken either next week, when the parliamentary parties of the ruling coalition meet, or on July 1 when next year's budget must be agreed in cabinet. The overwhelming political consensus, however, remains opposed to the sophisticated fly-by-wire fighter, seen as a symbol of conspicuous defence consumption rendered obsolete by the end of the Cold war. The idea of postponing a decision, understood to be backed by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and a supporter of the EFA, would be to include a budget finance line for the project, but to allocate no money to it. Some DM100m (Pounds 34m) is supposed to be included next year in preparation for full production. A similar idea was put forward by British MPs visiting Bonn yesterday to lobby for the EFA, which is being jointly developed by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. They suggested that full production could be delayed to allow a 'pre-production' phase to go ahead. This would not require a final commitment by Bonn to take the aircraft. 'Discussions are going on whereby the decisions regarding the production phase can be put off,' said Mr Keith Mans, a British Conservative MP, and secretary of the all-party aviation group in the House of Commons. Germany was not proposing to pull out of the development phase of the aircraft, for which it had already allocated DM6bn up to 1999, he said. He detected a growing feeling in Bonn that, having paid the development costs, it would be absurd to pull out of full-scale production. Supporters of the fighter admit that the choice is between a German decision to pull out of the project in the coming weeks, or postponing a decision for at least a year. They see no real possibility of the German government giving its approval, with the latest public opinion poll showing that more than 84 per cent of the population oppose buying the fighter for the Luftwaffe. At the Berlin international aerospace exhibition this week, Mr Waigel appealed for a calm assessment of the EFA project. He warned against 'laying waste' Germany's defence aerospace industry with an instant decision to pull out of the European fighter scheme. By including an 'empty line' for the EFA, Mr Waigel might succeed in putting off the final decision to quit, in spite of the expected recommendation to do so by Mr Volker Ruhe, the new defence minister.</p>

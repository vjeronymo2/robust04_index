			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Washing-machine workers laid off TWO LEADING washing-machine manufacturers yesterday confirmed the depth and severity of the recession by announcing plans to lay off almost 3,000 workers in an effort to cut unsold stocks. The lay-offs at Hotpoint and Hoover suggest that the rise in retail demand during the January sales may have been shortlived. Hotpoint is to lay off 1,600 shopfloor workers at two plants in north Wales for a fortnight next month. Workers at the factories at Llandudno Junction in Gwynedd and Bodelwyddan, Clwyd, are already working a four-day week because of the impact the recession has had on sales of washing machines and dishwashers. Mr Phil Collins, the personnel director of Hotpoint, said that continuing poor sales of washing machines since Christmas meant that it was necessary to have two full weeks of short-time working in the first and last weeks of March. Mr Trevor Gregory, the AEU engineering union convener for the plants, said that the shutdown and short-time working would result in each employee losing wages of about Pounds 700. Hoover blamed an increasingly difficult economic situation for its decision to lay off workers at its Merthyr Tydfil plant in south Wales for two weeks from March 2. The company said improved sales in recent months had not reduced the stocks of finished goods to acceptable levels.</p>

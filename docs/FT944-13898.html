			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Italian budget faces big hurdles: MPs' amendments may hit revenue measures and pension reform The Italian government is struggling to retain the identity and objectives of the 1995 budget amidst a vast quantity of amendments being tabled by the right-wing coalition and the opposition alike. The latest and most important amendment has been introduced by the government to offset a poor response to one of the main revenue raising measures. The move concerns a loosening of the rules regarding the amnesty on illegal construction and property development to encourage more taxpayers to take advantage of the concession. The amnesty, based on encouraging persons to register construction carried out without proper permission through the payment of a small fine, has failed to prove attractive. The measure was introduced before the summer and is due to yield L2,500bn (Pounds 1bn) this year and close to L10,000bn next year. But so far only L61bn has been paid in and the initial closing date for registrations is October 31. Thus, the government is further reducing the scope of sanctions applied to illicit buildings, especially on first homes. The opposition has already challenged the original measure and a number of regional administrations have challenged the decree on environmental grounds in the constitutional court, adding further to the confusion over the likely revenue yield. More than 1,000 amendments have been tabled to the budget - in almost equal proportion between the government members and the opposition. The bulk of the changes relate to the controversial pensions reform, following the government's decision to try to eliminate the many anomalies and hardship cases created by the proposals submitted on September 30. According to latest estimates, the changes will add an extra L1,000bn to the pensions bill in 1995 and even more in the following two years. The treasury is adamant the budget deficit target of L138,000bn, equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP, cannot be altered. However, the more the original measures are altered to satisfy different interest groups, the harder it will be to maintain this target. Yesterday the trade unions announced they were going ahead with plans to organise a 1m strong demonstration in Rome on November 12 to protest against the budget and pension reform. This is a follow-up to the general strike two weeks ago.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (4): Liberal attitude to broadcasting - Media enterprises Ever since Mr Rupert Murdoch, the broadcasting and newspaper mogul, avoided UK regulations on media ownership by registering his Astra satellite in Luxembourg, the Grand Duchy has enjoyed a certain notoriety as a base for media enterprises. Through the television and radio broadcasts of Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Telediffusion (CLT) and the satellite dishes of Societe Europeen des Satellites (SES), Luxembourg is responsible for broadcasts to more than 50m Europeans. This is largely thanks to a very deliberate strategy adopted by the Luxembourg government to encourage the development of the media industry. As early as 1931 it decided to allow a private company, Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radioffusion (now CLT) to broadcast from its territory, rather than creating a public sector broadcaster for its tiny population. On the other hand, and in spite of the government's attempts to encourage the broadcasting industry, it would be wrong to exaggerate Luxembourg's importance as a media base. But the media is an important sector of the Luxembourg economy. Perhaps the biggest attraction for incoming investors has been the Grand Duchy's traditionally liberal approach to broadcasting, in contrast to the highly regulated media industries common across the rest of the European Union. According to private operators, key government ministers are available to answer questions and resolve problems in person, all of which reduces bureaucracy and leads to speedy decision-making, often tailor-made to suit the needs of a specific project. 'Luxembourg is small enough to provide you with a very instant access to all of the decision makers in this country,' says Mr Yves Feltes, of SES. 'In a new venture like SES, the support of the Grand Duchy has proved to be very valuable.' Ms Karin Schintgen of CLT adds: 'It is very important to have the backing of governments, especially when you consider that in many countries the media is a political issue.' Although it is small, the Grand Duchy enjoys sovereign status which means that along with the rest of Europe, it has been granted an allocation of satellite frequencies. In 1983, the government granted a franchise to private investors to use the satellite frequencies allocated to Luxembourg, which led to the establishment of one of the country's greatest successes, the Astra satellite project. SES, the franchise holder, created Europe's first privately-owned television satellite system. Today, according to government figures, 55m households all over Europe can receive a selection of 50 television channels and an even greater number of radio programmes either directly to their homes with a satellite dish, or through cable systems. At the end of this month, SES hopes to launch its fourth dedicated television satellite. It will be capable of transmitting 16 channels of television using analogue technology plus two transponders set aside for experimenting with digital television. There will also be 40 transponders designed to provide back-up if any of Astra's existing three satellites should fail. The liberal environment has bred another well-known European successes. CLT is now involved in 10 television channels and 13 radio stations across eight different European countries, mostly under the RTL logo. In addition, it has become involved in rights acquisitions, film productions, co-productions and other press activities. 'We feel that being based in Luxembourg has been an asset for the European expansion of the group,' says Ms Schintgen. 'It is much easier to be European when you are a Luxembourger. Luxembourg is somehow in between cultures. The key to success is to stay close to your audiences and you can only do that if you understand them. 'From here you have a pretty good understanding of what French culture means, and also of what the German culture means,' she adds. Meanwhile, the Luxembourg government is doing its best to encourage the media industry to diversify. In particular, it has focused on production companies. Since 1988 it has offered special tax incentives for film-makers, aimed principally at producers of TV drama series. To begin with the strategy had only a mixed success. While more money than expected was spent in the country by mainly small operators, few producers put down roots. Many producers simply made their films and then left, contributing nothing to the industry's infrastructure. Since the early 1990s, the law has been changed to put a greater emphasis on attracting indoor studio filming. 'The government has tried to encourage investors not only to come to Luxembourg, but to invest in the infrastructure too,' says Mr Pierre Goerens, of the audiovisual department of the government. This is gradually paying off.' According to the government, the policy has had significant spin-offs including the establishment of 23 production companies, three animation studios, four production and three post-production studios.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday, the  Asia-Pacific region needed a new regional security arrangement  based on the idea of the interdependence and equity of nations  within a global community.    It must also principally serve the interests of the people  of  the region, not the vested interests of arms merchants and  defence industries, he added.    We must progress from containment, or even mere peaceful  co-existence, towards productive and mutually beneficial  collaboration in all spheres of activity, he said when  addressing the eighth Asia-Pacific Roundtable on Confidence  Building and Conflict Reduction in the Pacific, here.    He said that for Asians in particular, such an arrangement  must provide the right kind of environment for the full  flowering of their economic, social and cultural potentials.    We must also [word indistinct] a new global partnership for  peace, one based on mutual respect and genuine understanding  between nations, large and small, North and South, East and West.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Cabo Delgado Provincial Governor Antonio Simbine  has rejected accusations by Gilberto Catema, Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo] political delegate for that province, that  the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party and the  provincial government were giving military training to 800 men  in Tanzania.    Governor Antonio Simbine said that those accusations were  both false and without foundation. In an interview he granted  the Radio Mozambique correspondent in that province, Governor  Simbine noted that [words indistinct] accusations by Renamo  officers reflect the thought that is uppermost on their minds:  to return to war, should Renamo lose the upcoming multiparty  general elections.    The governor for Cabo Delgado Province invited the Renamo  political delegate to report the matter to the UN Operations in  Mozambique so that the truth can be established. [passage  omitted]    Governor Simbine dismissed as groundless reports that war  materiel was being stored in the (?lower part) of Pemba, the  capital of Cabo Delgado Province and he added that there should  be an inquiry into the matter. The governor for Cabo Delgado  categorically denied any provincial government involvement in an  alleged attempt on the life of the Renamo political delegate.  He said that Renamo should report all it knows to the competent  authorities, so that investigation can begin. He noted that,  quote, the government has no need to become involved in the  assassination of a simple citizen who happens to be an  opposition politician, unquote.</p>

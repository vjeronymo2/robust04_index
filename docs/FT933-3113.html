			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: San Paolo stock falls sharply SHARES in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group in asset terms, fell sharply yesterday as investors digested details of the merger with two quoted subsidiary banks announced on Monday night. Stock in San Paolo, which was floated in January, dropped by almost 5 per cent to L10,272. By contrast, shares in Banco Lariano climbed by 4.4 per cent to L4,750 while Banca Provinciale Lombarda rose by just over 3 per cent to L4,010. The merger will confirm San Paolo's position as Italy's dominant banking group, with total assets of about L200,000bn (Dollars 130bn) and almost 1,000 branches. However, the bank is expected to maintain the separate trading identities of its three operations to retain customer loyalties. Both Como-based Banco Lariano and Bergamo-based BPL are situated in the wealthiest parts of Lombardy, Italy's richest province. Shareholders in BPL will be offered 10 San Paolo shares for every 24 shares held. The swap ratio for Banco Lariano shares involves 10 San Paolo units for every 21 shares currently held. The share price movements caused little surprise among analysts, who said the terms had been devised to encourage shareholders in the subsidiaries to take up the offer. If all shareholders agree, the proportion of San Paolo's capital which is floating will rise to about 26 per cent from about 22 per cent at present. The amalgamation is predominantly tax-driven, with San Paolo taking advantage of a special Italian law to encourage bank mergers by granting substantial tax breaks for a number of years. The San Paolo group is expected to save about L70bn a year between 1993 and 1995 once the deal is completed. Separately, the three banks have also reported first-half earnings. San Paolo said net earnings amounted to L213bn, while Banco Lariano reported net profits of L70bn and BPL net profits of L67bn. None of the banks provided comparable figures. San Paolo is likely to need all its tax savings to offset a severe rise in bad-debt provisions this year owing to the recession. The bank is believed to be very heavily exposed to the troubled Ferruzzi group, and is also among the principal lenders to a number of other big companies which are now negotiating debt rescheduling pacts with their creditors.</p>

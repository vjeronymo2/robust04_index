			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER VOTE AGAINST TAYLOR RANCH SITE  </P> <P> In response to CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds' ultimatum that we must accept  Taylor Ranch as the site for the new CSU campus, I say No! Taylor Ranch is a  lousy location from a geographic standpoint. Why put a university at the  northern tip of the easternmost city in the county? Reynolds claims that "80%  to 90% of the students come from a 25- or 30-mile radius, and with Taylor Ranch  as its center, what do you get? A circle with half its area in the Pacific  Ocean and another fourth in the uninhabited coastal range north of Ventura! Not  exactly in the center of the county, chancellor.  </P> <P> Now draw a straight line from the Taylor Ranch to the Ventura-Los Angeles  County line in Thousand Oaks. Measure this line and you'll find that it's  almost 40 miles long. Almost all 700,000 county residents live west of the  ranch site. I just can't understand the chancellor's logic at all.  </P> <P> The chancellor said, "the people here are very concerned about . . . smog."  Obviously, she doesn't share our concerns. At a time when Ventura County is  already the third smoggiest county in the state, I'm incredulous that a state  official would tacitly condone a 25- or 30-mile one-way commute to college as  acceptable. Round trip, that's 50 to 60 miles a day, 250 to 300 miles a week,  1,000 to 1,200 miles a month of commuting per student! Multiply that by the  eventual 15,000 students the chancellor envisions, and you have a major new  source of smog.  </P> <P> It doesn't take much imagination to see what another 15,000 students converging  on the Taylor Ranch every day will do to air quality on the Oxnard Plain.  Laughably, the chancellor threw us a bone and said, "we could have a very  interesting program here on environmental management. . . ." Indeed. Perhaps  she should be one of its first students.  </P> <P> MIKE STUBBLEFIELD  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

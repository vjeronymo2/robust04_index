			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: M and S near to sale of Canadian chain MARKS AND Spencer, the international clothing and food retailer, is at an advanced stage of negotiations to sell its Peoples chain of Canadian department stores to Wise Stores of Montreal. The deal comes six months after M and S hired Burns Fry, a Toronto investment bank, to investigate ways of retreating from its perennially loss-making Canadian operations. Mr Alex Wise, president of Wise Stores, said yesterday that he expected the talks to be completed in the 'very near future.' There was an 'exact synergy' between Peoples' 81 department stores and his own group's 49 outlets. Both chains sell mainly clothing, houseware and appliances in Quebec and Canada's four Atlantic provinces. But Mr Wise said their outlets overlapped in only five cities. Terms of the proposed transaction have not been disclosed. But analysts in London speculated that M and S might receive anything between Pounds 10m to Pounds 50m, depending on the terms of the deal and strength of recent trading. In the year ending March 31 1991, Peoples made profit of Pounds 500,000 on sales of Pounds 81.4m, but slipped back into a small loss at the interim stage. M and S also operates 74 own name stores in Canada and 119 D'Allaird's women's fashion stores. In total, its three Canadian businesses lost Pounds 3.6m on sales of Pounds 191.2m last year. On Wednesday, the M and S board held its last meeting before announcing annual results on May 12. The subject of how to tackle the Canadian operations was believed to have been high on the agenda and further announcements are expected.</p>

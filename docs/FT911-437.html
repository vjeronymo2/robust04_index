			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / PowerGen may halve order from British Coal POWERGEN, the electricity generator, is expected to cut its order from British Coal from 26m tonnes of coal to between 10m tonnes and 15m tonnes. National Power, the other generator, also wants to cut orders in the current round of negotiations with British Coal. One of the generators also said it expected British Coal to cut its prices to match cheaper imports. Meanwhile Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, insisted at yesterday's annual British Association of Colliery Management conference that the price struck with the generators should reflect 'the true value of a large, reliable and consistent supplier'. The generator added that if British Coal was prepared to cut volumes substantially, it might secure a better price. The value of UK coal varied, the generator added. Coal supplied inland was more valuable than coal supplied on the coast, where imports were more competitive. At least one of the generators may use the difference in value to try to negotiate a range of contracts at different prices - in spite of resistance from British Coal. Talks between British Coal and the generators have begun informally. The existing contracts expire in March 1993 but British Coal will want advance warning if the new contracts are for much smaller volumes. British Coal has suggested that the generators were unwilling to hold formal negotiations before the end of the year. British Coal said that would give it a tough year. The two generators said yesterday they were willing to talk. 'We are already talking to coal producers overseas, and are happy to talk to British Coal when they want to,' said one generator. Britain's coal industry must improve its productivity to compete with competitors in countries in which productivity was often four times higher, Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, energy minister, said at the British Association for Colliery Management's conference. Mr John Northard, British Coal's deputy chairman, said at the conference that productivity in British Coal had increased by almost 9 per cent in the year to March 1991.</p>

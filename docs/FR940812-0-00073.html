			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) Organizational conflicts of interest;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of other relevant requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a manner that prohibits the use of statutory or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively imposed in-State or local geographical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section preempts State licensing laws. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and size of the project, to compete for the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical requirements for the material, product, or service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include a statement of the qualitative nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material, product or service to be procured, and when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear and accurate description of the technical requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a ``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance or other salient requirements of a procurement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The specific features of the named brand which must be met by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offerors shall be clearly stated; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating bids or proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicitation period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Methods of procurement to be followed <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procurement by small purchase procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Small purchase procedures are those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively simple and informal procurement methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> securing services, supplies, or other property that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost more than $25,000 in the aggregate. If small purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurements are used, price or rate quotations will be obtained from an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of qualified sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procurement by sealed bids (formal advertising).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procuring construction, if the conditions in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions should be present:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase description is available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to compete effectively for the business; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made principally on the basis of price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be solicited from an adequate number of known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set for opening the bids;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place prescribed in the invitation for bids;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantage of; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procurement by competitive proposals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than one source submitting an offer, and either a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify all evaluation factors and their relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be honored to the maximum extent practical;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of qualified sources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for selecting awardees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantageous to the program, with price and other factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procurement by noncompetitive proposals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement is through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined inadequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

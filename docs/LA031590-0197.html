Hubbard was completed Wednesday night when Lloyd Arnold, the  current owner, signed the final papers.  </P> <P> All that remains, according to all parties, is "housekeeping paper work" that  should be completed next week.  </P> <P> Arnold and Chris Bardis agreed to selling half-interest in 125 acres of track  property for $16.5 million.  </P> <P> The half-interest is actually being sold to Quarter Racing Inc. a corporation  of which Allred owns 56% of the stock. He has an agreement from minority  shareholders to purchase almost all of the remaining stock in the next few  weeks. At that point, he will sell one-third of the stock to Hubbard and Arnold  separately.  </P></p>

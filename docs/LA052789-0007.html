			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERROR JORDAN: REASON FOR THE SUCCESS OF BULLS DESERVED AN MVP TIE  </P> <P> On the balloting for the NBA's most valuable player, I cannot help wondering  how a real basketball fan can say that Magic Johnson is better and more  valuable than Michael Jordan or vice versa, for that matter.  </P> <P> Comparing Magic and Michael is like comparing Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, or  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain.  </P> <P> There's no clear winner.  </P> <P> Satisfying both their fans, we can say Magic is the best player on the ground  and Michael is the best in the air.  </P> <P> JOHN ARELLANO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

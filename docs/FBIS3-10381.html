			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Larios] </F>   [Excerpt] Finance Minister Emilio Pereira admitted before  the National Assembly's Economic Commission yesterday the  government is planning to dismiss at least 15,000 workers during  the next three years as a result of implementation of the  so-called Labor Mobility Program [Programa de Movilidad Laboral].    Virtually harassed by the commission deputies who asked him  to explain the details of the program, Pereira conceded the  government expects at least 5,000 workers will join the program  per year. He added $89 million in foreign financing is being  sought in 1994 to carry out the program.    Pereira kept contradicting himself when he answered  deputies'  questions. For example, he denied the Mifin [Finance Ministry]  is pressuring ministries to reduce their budget when only a few  days ago Education Minister Humberto Belli told the commission  he was told at Mifin: "Either reduce your budget, or we will  reduce it for you." He was told he had to reduce his budget by  13 million cordobas.    Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez has described the  minister's  appearance as "disastrous." Pereira was accompanied by his  deputy ministers, Mirna Somarriba and Rene Vallecillo. There  was a moment when Ramirez complained to the officials, asking  them why they had given the information little by little.    The officials had to face pressure from the deputies for  more  than four hours. They were demanding, among other things, a  list of government offices that will be mainly affected by the  Labor Mobility Program and the reduction of 140 million cordobas  in public spending, measures demanded by international financial  organizations.

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure just ahead of forecast Parkdean Leisure, the holiday park operator which floated last October, just beat its Pounds 1.4m prospectus forecast with operating profits of Pounds 1.41m, against Pounds 1.3m, for the year to November. The shares, issued at 120p, closed unchanged at 163p. With the benefit of the Pounds 7.5m net proceeds of the float for six weeks, interest charges fell from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 600,000 and pre-tax profits were up 61.6 per cent at Pounds 811,000 (Pounds 502,000). Mr Graham Wilson, managing director, said in spite of the worst summer weather he could remember and weak consumer confidence, Parkdean had sold 13 per cent more holidays in 1993 and had increased occupancy rates from 74.7 to 75.1 per cent on top of a 5 per cent rise in capacity. This year had started better with bookings up 6 per cent by volume and 10 per cent by value. Capacity for the 1994 season would be up less than 3 per cent, and like-for-like prices were about 3 per cent higher. The float had cut net debt from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 1.35m, and gearing was 13 per cent at the year end. Mr Wilson said it should peak in March at about 25 per cent. He said he was now looking at acquisitions, but had turned some down as being too expensive. The prospect of an enlarged group had helped Parkdean improve discounts from suppliers, partly offsetting the extra costs of being a quoted company, he said. Turnover was 8.5 per cent up at Pounds 9.22m. Touring income fell 10 per cent as caravan owners stayed at home in wet weather, but hiring income rose 8 per cent. The two contributed 40 per cent of group sales. Retail sales made 43 per cent of the total, with bar sales up 6 per cent. Caravan sales rose 25 per cent, although gross margins were lower. Earnings per share were 6.9p (6.1p) but on a pro forma basis were 8.9p against a prospectus forecast of 8.7p. A dividend of 1.3p is proposed.</p>

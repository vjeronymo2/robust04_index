			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPITALS, STILL ON TEAR, SHUT DOWN OILERS  </P> <P> The Washington Capitals have been consistent for most of this decade. They  start out each season poorly, make a move in midseason and wind up as a good  hockey team.  </P> <P> So far, the Capitals have been true to form. They won only 4 of their first 14  games and fell into the Patrick Division cellar. But now that the season is  past its midpoint, they are a team on the move.  </P> <P> Friday night, rookie John Druce scored the go-ahead goal in the second period  to lead the Capitals to a 5-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at Landover,  Md., and stretch their unbeaten streak to 9 games.  </P> <P> Dale Hunter and Mike Millar also scored in the second period to help lift the  Capitals into first place in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> New York Islanders 5, New Jersey 3 -- Rookie Rob DiMaio, called up from the  minors just a few days ago, scored his first goal midway through the third  period at East Rutherford, N.J., to break a 3-3 tie.  </P> <P> Winnipeg 3, Vancouver 1 -- Pat Elynuik scored the tie-breaking goal 5 minutes  into the third period, and Thomas Steen added another goal as the Jets ended a  6-game road winless string.

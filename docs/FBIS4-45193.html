			<p>CSO     [Text] Culiacan, Sinaloa, 6 May--Eight ships and 300 marine  forces from the Navy Secretariat, 2,000 Army troops, and 250  Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents will participate in a  coordinated counternarcotics operation. This announcement was  made today, individually, by the Eighth Naval Zone, the Third  Military Region, and the Attorney General's Office (PGR).    In this connection, the latter department's representative,  Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, reported that, since January, the  PJF [Federal Judicial Police] has turned 500 persons over to the  competent judicial authorities for implication in crimes against  health and illegal carrying of weapons.    He indicated that, on highways and roads, and in towns,  rural  communities, and fishing grounds located on the Sinaloa coast,  an extensive security system was established, in a coordinated  manner, between federal and state police forces.    He added that PGR helicopters are flying over the roadways  with the heaviest passenger and freight traffic, while  checkpoints have been set up at the main intersections,  supervised by agents from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office  and representatives of human rights commissions.    He specified that, in the head-on effort to combat the drug  traffic, 57 long-range and 167 short-range weapons have been  seized, as well as 2,858 cartridges of various calibers.    He noted that 250 members of the Federal Judicial Police  have  been mobilized for this purpose, and that during the past four  months 308 convictions have been ordered. Furthermore, there has  been a 75-percent cut in the existing backlog of preliminary  investigations.    The commander of the Eighth Naval Zone, stationed in  Mazatlan, Zilli Viveros, in turn, declared: "The coastal  surveillance operation is intended to support the PGR's action  against the drug traffic, and will be maintained as long as is  advisable."    He said that attention has also been given to reports  claiming that shrimp boats are being used to move drugs. Hence,  the activities include searches of suspected vessels in the area.    The commander of the Third Military Region, Jose Angel  Garcia  Elizalde, announced that 2,000 troops from the Task Force Mars  operation, backed by Mexican Air Force and PGR aircraft, are  remaining in the sierra zones and in the valleys, taking action  to combat the drug traffic.    He commented that, during this time of the year, when the  rainy season is about to begin, there is an increase in drug  production. Hence, the troops are also intensifying their  efforts to detect and destroy plantations, primarily those of  poppies and marijuana.    Finally, Garcia Elizalde stressed: "The troops have  succeeded  in destroying a considerable number of drug crops, located on  very high levels in the zone comprised of the converging  mountain regions of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Durango."</p>

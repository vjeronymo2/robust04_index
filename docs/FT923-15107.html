			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Nafta deal hangs over summit PRESIDENT George Bush will meet Mexico's Carlos Salinas in San Diego, California, on July 14, as the two countries - along with Canada - head into the final stage of negotiations on a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). But Mr Bush yesterday dismissed speculation that a Nafta deal would be concluded during Mr Salinas' quick visit. 'It is not a scheduled event,' Mr Bush said. Mr Salinas said in an interview that 'in the next weeks (the treaty) should finish and be initialled'. According to US law, the treaty can only be signed by Mr Bush 90 days after he has notified Congress of this intention. Mr Salinas said that at the moment the plan was to sign the treaty and present the agreement to the US Congress before the November elections. But the Mexican government has consistently underestimated the time it would take to complete negotiations. Rumours persist that the free trade agreement will not be initialled until October.

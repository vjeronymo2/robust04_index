			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Gaidar promises to fight hyperinflation: Prices rose 15-fold in last 12 months MR Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, yesterday told a sullen Russian parliament that the government would seek to enforce a tough credit and monetary policy in an effort to stem the spiralling budget deficit and hyperinflation. In his starkest speech since taking command of economic reform less than a year ago, the 36-year-old Mr Gaidar said the recent relaxation of tough monetary policy had reached a dangerous point, and must be reversed. 'We will have to toughen monetary policy in order to stop a destabilisation of the monetary system,' he said. In the short debate following his speech, deputies called for his resignation. Significantly, these calls came from leading members of centrist groups which had reluctantly supported the government in the past. Mr Gaidar said later he had no intention of resigning. Mr Sergei Polozhkov from the centrist Smena faction said that Russian industry would soon stop completely, and called for an 'anti-crisis programme' and for the resignation of Mr Andrei Nechaev, the economics minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation and Mr Peter Aven, the minister for foreign economic relations. Mr Mikhail Chelnokov of the Civil Society faction said that the reform 'was carried out in the interests of foreign business', and called on Mr Gaidar to resign. Mr Gaidar and his colleagues have dispensed with any efforts to put a positive gloss on the reform process, emphasising instead the catastrophic nature of the country's finances and productive base in the apparent hope that this will jolt the country into accepting a renewed squeeze on expenditure. However, as Mr Gaidar has recently noted, they face an organised and aroused opposition and a weary population. In his speech, Mr Gaidar painted a picture of a country racing towards collapse. Production last month was down 27 per cent on the previous August, capital investment had been cut by 46 per cent this year, and would be down by around 55 per cent on the whole year; the budget deficit stood at the end of the first eight months at Rbs800bn; inflation was rising to 4 per cent a week, or more than 20 per cent a month; prices had increased 15.6 times in the year to last month, while wages had gone up 10.6 times; 13m people lived below a (very low) poverty line of Rbs1,200 income a month (Dollars 5 at yesterday's new market rate for the rouble). The prime minister pointed out that living standards were at the level of the early seventies, before the Soviet Union enjoyed the benefits of the oil price rises. He forecast a harvest of 96.7m tonnes of grain - significantly below the 110m tonnes forecast less than two weeks ago by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, although better than last year's. However, livestock production had declined by 23 per cent, as producers stopped breeding because they could not afford fodder. The only good news was the privatisation of 18,000 small businesses and shops with receipts to the government of Rbs10bn - though this was far behind the annual target of Rbs96bn. Unemployment stands at only 500,000 in Russia, but is expected to grow to 1.5m by the year end - still only 2 per cent of the workforce, but also a sign that industrial restructuring has not yet taken hold.</p>

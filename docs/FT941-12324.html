			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Evidence for a real recovery at last Commentators on the economic scene have a habit of pointing to in-formation gaps. But just occasionally it is possible to be more definite. For instance, it is certain, as far as anything ever is, that the British economy has at last embarked on a real recovery. By that I mean not merely positive growth, which we have had since the second quarter of 1992 and of which the Treasury makes so much, but growth sufficient to take up some of the slack that developed during the recession. The fascinating aspect is that it is possible to infer something important from trends to which we can put only signs and not real numbers. The growth rate itself - now estimated at 2.1 per cent per annum for non-oil GDP - will not be known with any confidence for years to come. What we can, however, be reasonably sure of is that output is rising faster than trend. There are two main ways of measuring the slack in the economy. One is from direct survey data. The CBI trends inquiry now shows that capacity utilisation is not merely a good deal higher than at the bottom of the recession, but above the average percentage recorded since the survey began well over 30 years ago. Survey evidence of capacity covers mainly manufacturing, which is only a little more than a fifth of the total economy. It is also very likely that the high utilisation ratio reflects scrapping of capacity and not just the strength of recovery. So it is best to check with labour market data. Here we see that the jobless count has surprised nearly all observers by falling by 226,000 in less than a year. The increase in female part-time jobs does not explain the whole change. Other data, notably vacancies, suggest that the labour market has been tightening since the middle of 1993. For any given state of price expectations, inflationary pressures are affected both by the amount of slack in the economy and the rate at which the slack is being absorbed. Core inflation - if we remove both mortgage interest and tax distortions - is not far from 2 per cent per annum. The upward trend in sterling is also an anti-inflationary influence. The one influence for inflation is the rate at which the labour market is tightening, and unused capacity has been taken up. But starting from a deep recession, there is not yet a danger here. The remarkably subdued level of pay settlements indicates that the economy is still operating beneath the point at which inflation is liable to accelerate. What prudence does suggest is that the Treasury and the Bank should leave well alone and not try to stoke up the recovery by interest rate cuts - which oddly enough seem to have been demanded mostly by the anti-EC Right among ministers. Clearly, the present rate of recovery cannot be guaranteed. What are the main threats? The first and well-advertised one is from the effects of this year's tax increases, amounting to more than 1 1/4 per cent of GDP. But fiscal squeezes just as large have in the past failed to slow down recovery once confidence has returned. It would be quite wrong to offset contractionary pressures from this source before there is any evidence of their impact. The other potentially contractionary influence is an excessive rise in sterling. Here, however, the alarmists themselves are being over-influenced by the rate against the D-Mark. They should look at a chart in the CBI's own January Economic Situation Report, which shows that the great bulk of the depreciation of sterling since the UK left the ERM has remained intact, if measured by the comprehensive sterling index. This is better luck than the government was entitled to expect. Independent evidence such as that collected by the Bank of International Settlements suggests that sterling is slightly undervalued. If a wall of money were to descend on London and sterling threatened to reach dizzy and unsustainable heights, then it would be right to cut interest rates, maybe drastically. The anti-European Right might then be torn between its dislike of exchange rate management and its lately discovered penchant for depreciation. If I had to put it all on one of Winston Churchill's postcard-sized messages, it would be: 'UK economy moving right way. For now. As Asquith used to say: best wait and see.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>   [Text] China yesterday dismissed the controversy about a  human rights commission and freedom of information legislation  as irrelevant.    Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the Hong Kong branch  of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), said Hong Kong people  already enjoyed "all kinds of freedom and their human rights are  well safeguarded".    "In the Basic Law, their freedoms and human rights are  protected," he said.    "There is a whole chapter in the mini-constitution which  spells out clause by clause the fundamental rights and duties of  Hong Kong residents. It also stipulates that provisions in  three international conventions as applied in Hong Kong will  remain in force after China takes over.    "So it does not matter whether we support or oppose the  idea,  the fact is that it is completely unnecessary to set up such a  human rights commission again.... If the commission was to be  set up, we've made it clear that it will be dismantled after  1997."    Zhang was responding to reports that the Government has  turned down measures to set up a human rights commission and  increase freedom of information because it fears upsetting China.    The Government is today expected to announce a compromise  package of other anti-discrimination measures including an equal  opportunities commission and a United Nations convention to  protect women's rights.    The Chief Secretary, Anson Chan, said yesterday that the  Government was fully committed to protecting human rights but  there had to be some measures that were "durable".    "What we want to do in the coming weeks and months is to  give  careful consideration to the next steps that we should take to  strengthen human rights and will have the opportunity of  continuing both now and after 1997," Chan said.</p>

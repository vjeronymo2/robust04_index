			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares recover to finish little changed Wall Street US SHARE prices recovered from early losses yesterday to end virtually unchanged, bringing to a close three day's of solid gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,455.92, well above its low for the day of 3,437.54. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 0.26 at 448.40, while the Amex composite ended 1.10 lower at 419.42, and the Nasdaq composite 3.60 lower at 670.34. Trading volume on the New York SE was 261m shares. In recent day's the markets have been supported by declining bond yields. Yesterday, bond yields opened higher in the wake of a stronger-than-expected jobless claims report. The absence of an early lead from the bond market left equities to the mercy of corporate earnings and profit-taking. Brokerage stocks were out of favour, as were retail issues, which were hit by rumours that the Clinton administration will introduce a value added tax to pay for healthcare reform. Prices recovered in the final few hours of trading, aided by a rally in bond prices, which pushed yields down to new lows. The bond market turned around on the news that President Clinton is willing to compromise on his economic plans. Forest product stocks were buoyed by Wednesday's late news of improved earnings at Georgia-Pacific. That company's stock rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 64 1/4 , while Weyerhauser, which reported its earnings yesterday, added Dollars 1 at Dollars 44 3/4 and Louisiana-Pacific firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 7/8 . Declining stocks, which rose early in the week on news of big profits at Merrill Lynch, were hit by profit-taking and a broker's sector downgrade. Merrill fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 76 3/8 , PaineWebber gave up Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 26 1/2 , Charles Schwab fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/8 (despite reporting record first quarter profits) and Morgan Stanley dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 . Among retail stocks hurt by talk of a new sales tax were Gap Stores, down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 28 5/8 , Sears, Roebuck, Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 52 5/8 , and JC Penney, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 84 5/8 . On the Nasdaq market, leading technology issues were lower, with Apple down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 47 1/4 and Microsoft down Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 87 1/8 . Canada TORONTO prices closed little changed in heavy trading, as gold stocks gave back part of Wednesday's gains. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index rose 4.38 points, of 0.12 per cent, to close at 3,634. Imperial Oil fell  1/2 to 47 7/8 . The company said it will permanently shut down its Ioco refinery operations, resulting in a one-time charge of CDollars 54m against second-quarter earnings. Cameco jumped 1 1/2 to 20. The company issued a statement at the request of the TSE stating that the results of drilling at its 50 per cent owned Fort a la Corne diamond project 'warrant further exploration of the area.'</p>

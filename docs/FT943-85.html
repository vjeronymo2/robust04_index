			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper support level breached - Market Report Technical selling of COPPER was triggered at the London Metal Exchange after the breaching of support at Dollars 2,550 a tonne for three months delivery and a short-term trend line at Dollars 2,540. By the close of afternoon ring trading the price had reached Dollars 2,530.75, down Dollars 37.75 on the day, but some of the loss was recovered in after hours activity. 'The break below Dollars 2,550 sparked stop-loss selling and long liquidation before some covering and bargain hunting emerged to halt the decline,' one dealer said. Other LME metals came off the boil in line with copper but appeared to be finding some underlying support. The GOLD price ended 50 cents down at Dollars 395 a troy ounce at the London bullion market after bouncing off solid support at Dollars 394. Russia's state Precious Metals Committee yesterday disowned Wednesday's statement by one of its senior officials that the country planned to stop exporting gold. But the statement, which initially prompted a sharp fall in the price, had already been largely discounted in the market. 'Russia's presence on world gold markets has a long tradition and it is very stable,' said Mr Leonid Gurevich, a deputy chairman of the committee. London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures ended down but off day lows after roaster buying helped cushion the effects of arbitrage selling linked to a slide in New York. The November position closed at Dollars 3,891 a tonne, down Dollars 90, after touching Dollars 3,880 at one point. 'There has been good arbitrage selling all day and yet the market has held up really well,' one trader commented. The Brazilian weather factor had moved into the background for the time being, others said. Compiled from Reuter</p>

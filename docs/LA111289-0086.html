			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HUNTINGTON BEACH PROPOSAL FOR GOLF COURSE  </P> <P> Hurray for members of Save Our Parks. They are right when they say to let the  voters decide how Central Park is developed.  </P> <P> It really burns me up when I read how the mayor says what a great deal the  proposed golf course is. A great deal for whom? Twenty-five percent of the park  will be a golf course. Twenty-five percent of public land will be gated off and  non-usable by 92% of the residents for 40 years.  </P> <P> The mayor's math is amazing. Why can't the county build a regional park across  the street for $13,000 per acre when the mayor says it would cost $190,000 per  acre for Central Park? The golf course with all the bells and whistles is less  than $50,000 an acre.  </P> <P> Our mayor wants to be state insurance commissioner? Get the chickens in a  circle -- the colonel's about to attack!  </P> <P> CARRIE THOMAS  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

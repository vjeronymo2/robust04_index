			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Birt pay scheme row revives as BBC governors voice concern PRESSURE increased yesterday on Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, his chairman, over Mr Birt's tax affairs and his years as a freelance consultant at the corporation. As more BBC governors broke with tradition and spoke anonymously of their concerns about damage to the BBC's reputation, it emerged that the Department of Trade and Industry is investigating other company accounts prepared by Mr Michael Henshaw, the accountant employed by Mr Birt. Nearly two weeks after the revelation that Mr Birt as deputy director-general had been hiring himself to the BBC through his private company, John Birt Productions, and thereby saving tax, with the agreement of Mr Hussey and vice-chairman Lord Barnett, the row shows no sign of fading. On Monday Mr Birt expressed regret and applied to join the staff. The row was revived the next day by his refusal to name the secretarial assistant paid Pounds 15,000 by his company and the subsequent revelation that she was his wife Jane, who also received a Pounds 14,000 fee as a director. Lord Bonham-Carter, a former vice-chairman of the BBC governors, said last night: 'I think John Birt's position is becoming increasingly difficult as one revelation follows another.' He said the governors had 'every reason to be extremely angry if they were not informed about the nature of this arrangement'. One senior governor said he was 'concerned very deeply' that he had not been told about a 'non-standard arrangement' such as Mr Birt's contract. The governors meet on Wednesday at a dinner in honour of Sir Michael Checkland, the retiring director-general. Mr Birt will attend the dinner. His future and that of Mr Hussey could be decided at Thursday's formal meeting of the governors. Yesterday the Labour MP Mr David Winnick called on Mr Birt to resign. 'There is a growing feeling in political circles and I am sure within the BBC that the best course of action would be resignation,' he said. Some 64 MPs, including several members of the Labour front bench, this week signed a parliamentary early day motion criticising BBC management. The DTI probe will cover a number of companies created by well-known individuals from the media who have been advised by Mr Henshaw. It follows revelations that the 1991 accounts of John Birt Productions failed to comply with a range of auditing and accounting requirements, such as not signing the auditor's report. This will embarrass Companies House, the official depository of corporate information, which should reject accounts which do not have a signed audit statement.</p>

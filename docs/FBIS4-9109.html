			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 20 (AFP) -- A dozen Bosnian Serb  tanks were seen travelling towards the besieged enclave of  Gorazde, apparently heading for a Moslem-held munitions factory,  UN spokesman Matthew Nerzig said here Wednesday. Four tanks  advanced towards the town centre from the eastern town of Kopaci  and five others from Jabuka at 12:30 (1030 GMT), said Nerzig,  quoting reports reaching UN offices from the Moslem enclave.  The Serbs "could be interested" in the Pobjeda (Victory) arms  factory, he added. The factory was not included in the  ceasefire signed Tuesday evening by the United Nations and  Bosnian Serb leaders at their stronghold in Pale, being left for  an overall peace settlement.</p>

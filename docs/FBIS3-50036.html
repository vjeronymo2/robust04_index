			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The meeting held this afternoon between Foreign  Minister Alfred Serreqi and Ioannis Papandoniou, Greek alternate  national economy minister, assessed Papandoniou's visit to  Tirana, following that of Papoulias some time ago, as a concrete  step toward implementation of economic cooperation between both  countries, in the framework of an atmosphere of good cooperation  that is in the interest not only of Albania and Greece but also  of our turbulent region.    The existence of the Greek minority in Albania and of  Albanian refugees in Greece are circumstances that favor this  cooperation and ease bilateral understanding. Mr. Serreqi  stressed that, viewed from a judicial aspect and considering the  resources it possesses, Albania, which has made concrete steps  toward a market economy, sees as a favorable circumstance the  fact that Greece, as the only Balkan country near the EC and  being the EC president for the current six-month period, can  possibly influence Albania's concrete engagement in EC economic  projects.</p>

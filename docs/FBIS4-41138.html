			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of Russian Duma deputies led by Konstantin  Zatulin, head of the Committee for CIS Affairs, unexpectedly  arrived in Minsk at the end of last week.    According to official accounts, the aim of the Russians'  visit was to discuss three issues with their Belarusian  colleagues: Belarusian-Russian relations, the unification of  monetary systems, and the Belarusian attitude toward amending  the Constitution. According to Belarusian People's Deputy  Uladzimir Novik, however, the visit was actually prompted by the  upcoming presidential elections in Belarus. The deputy shared  with an RID correspondent his impressions from the meetings with  the Russian delegation: "I believe that Russian experts analyze  the situation in Belarus and realize that the image of  Vyachaslaw Kebich is very unattractive. Other candidates,  including Paznyak, Lukashenka, and Shushkevich, have a much  higher rating. That is why the Russian side is undertaking  certain steps, given that it needs a "loyal" president.    People like Paznyak or Shushkevich intend to build a  Belarusian state and not a northwestern province [of Russia].  Besides, neither of them is going to disrupt ties or contacts  with Russia. The visitors, undoubtedly, had one goal --to  support the pro-Russian candidate, who will then walk in the  footsteps of Russia's politics and pursue servile policies.  Zatulin did not try to conceal the fact that Russia has large  military-political and strategic interests in Belarus. In  particular, he pointed out that the Republic hosts important  military bases in Vileyka and Baranovichi, and that it can have  its bases in Russia, too. This was said in such a mocking  manner that my impression is -- Russia does not want to see or  perceive us as a state. I think that their delegation has  demonstrated that there is no normal sober atmosphere in the  Russian Duma and no prospects for equal cooperation. The spirit  of a great empire prevails there, and plans are being made to  revive this empire.    Zatulin told me that the union was disbanded for Russia to  build a new empire. That is why I have the impression that the  unification of monetary systems is just another invention of  Russian wizards and strategists, aimed at eliminating Belarusian  statehood. They are ready to ratify this absurd agreement if  this can help their protege. A majority of Belarusian deputies  present at the meeting, however, opposed the agreement and the  introduction of amendments to the Constitution."</p>

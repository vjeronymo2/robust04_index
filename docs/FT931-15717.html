			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / School for young blacks in jeopardy AN inner-city educational project that has successfully motivated young black people to study and obtain qualifications is fighting for survival because of financial problems. A total of 300 pupils aged between eight and 18 are studying voluntarily during evenings, weekends and holidays at the Chapeltown and Harehills Assisted Learning Computer School in Leeds, and a further 400 are waiting for a place. The school, set up in 1987 by Mr Brainard Braimah, a Ghanian teacher, to tackle low educational achievement among local black children, has seen four of its former students go to university and dozens obtain GCSEs. The winding-up last year of the Leeds Task Force, a government inner-city initiative, cost the school its main source of funding. A final grant of pounds 25,000 - matched by equal sums from Leeds City Action Team and the city's Training and Enterprise Council - was expected to last until March 31, but will be used up by next month, leaving the school in urgent need of pounds 7,000 to survive until April and uncertain of its funding next year. Mr Braimah last week held discussions with the City Action Team, which coordinates government department's inner-city efforts in Leeds and Bradford and later this month will meet the Tec. But he is not hopeful they will be able to fill the gap. Income generated by the school's commercial training wing is not yet sufficient to replace grant aid, he says. Leeds City Council and the Home Office already provide support, and Unisys, the computer company, has donated pounds 100,000 of equipment and free maintenance. Mr Braimah believes young black people underperform educationally because of low expectations and lack of encouragement, home support and role models. The school combines computer-based lessons in maths, English and science with more traditional methods - pupils learn tables and are set homework. Computer games are not allowed. 'This project does not just take these youngsters off the streets but lets them realise the responsibility they owe to society,' he said. The project has four full-time staff including Mr Braimah and 10 part-time teachers. All pupils attend one formal two-hour tuition session a week and can work outside school hours. During school holidays, says Mr Bramiah, many are queueing outside when the doors open. The City Action Team and Leeds Tec said funding for next year had not yet been determined, but both praised the school. Mr Jeremy Walker, chairman of the City Action Team, said: 'They have been particularly impressive in the way in which they appear to be able to motivate young people to improve their education performance.'</p>

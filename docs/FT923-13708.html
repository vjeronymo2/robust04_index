			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Snared in Andre's clever net: Dominic Lawson does not share the media indignation over Agassi's play-acting ANDRE Agassi has caused great offence. Not for winning Wimbledon while festooned with jewellery from the ear downwards. Nor for wearing a shirt which didn't cover his distinctively furry navel. Nor for keeping his tennis hat firmly on his head even while he received the All England trophy from the Duchess of Kent (he must have reasoned that if she would not take the plaster cast off her broken ankle, he would not return the compliment). It is not even the fact that Agassi comes from Las Vegas which has caused great offence. No, what has generated outrage is the revelation that he has engaged in a little play-acting. You might recall that after he won the final point of the match the American collapsed and then lay prostrate on the sacred turf in a display of apparently uncontrollable emotion. It now appears that young Andre was very much in control of his emotions. The sports commentator of the New York Post, one Phil Mushnik, obtained a copy of video film of the match shot from a low camera at the side of the Centre Court. This apparently shows Agassi falling to his knees as his opponent netted on championship point and then looking directly up at his trainer, Nick Bollittieri. Bollittieri is to be seen, not cheering, but waving his arms frantically downwards, indicating that his young charge should move from the kneeling position to one more appropriate in a mosque. Says Mushnik, this was 'the million dollar reaction shot, the shot that was too good to be true was, quite literally, too good to be true'. And it is certainly true that Agassi's paroxysm of victorious ecstasy seemed to have enormous PR value, remaining tear-jerkingly vivid long after the public had forgotten everything else about the match. The New York Post fumed that this little deception on the public was 'so damning, so disgusting.' The same attitude was taken by a number of newspapers in the UK, where the match was played. Today damningly and punningly referred to the incident as 'a grand sham'. One can understand why the media seemed so outraged by this harmless piece of public relations. They felt manipulated, because it was they who fell for it, and then sold on to the public what they mistakenly thought to be the genuine article: real emotion, folks. But the newspapers and television had only themselves to blame. I was struck throughout the championship by how much they strained to present the great event, not as sport, but as a soap opera, with the thrill of using 'real people'. So, instead of analyses of Monica Seles' tennis, we had endless stories about her not very gripping private life. The only aspect of her tennis that seemed worthy of detailed reporting was her grunting. Was Monica faking it? After each match the poor girl, under the terms of the tournament, had to face this absurd question from hordes of so-called sports writers. Even other, lesser players had to put up with inane questioning about their diet, their clothes, their hair styles. All to little point. The sad fact is that professional tennis players are very dull people, because they eat, drink and breathe tennis. So competitive is the sport, they have little choice. This may not matter. It is more than likely that the only interesting thing about them is the thing they all have in common: that they have unusually good hand-eye co ordination, and can therefore hit a tennis ball with a consistency which eludes the rest of us. Even if one were to stumble across a tennis player with a deeply fascinating world view, one could be sure that he would keep these personal thoughts well hidden from the crass types who thrust microphones and flash bulbs under their noses. Like all modern young celebrities they are sufficiently experienced in the ways of the media to know the safest thing is to invent a few trite insights into what passes for their character and repeat them parrot fashion to any journalist who crosses their path. Andre Agassi is even shrewder. He knows that by dressing in such a provocative fashion he needs say nothing at all. The dazzling exterior is a more than adequate substitute for dazzling utterances. His victory roll, premediated or not, was an act in the same spirit. Let us not complain if he chooses to keep his soul, however exiguous, hidden from us.

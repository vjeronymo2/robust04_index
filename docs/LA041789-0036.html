			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : NO PUNCH LINE FROM KILLING JOKE  </P> <P> Ten years ago, Killing Joke began a wall-of-sound juggernaut across the  post-punk soundscape with such innovative metal-dance anthems as "Change" and  "Wardance." After a two-year layoff, the English quartet roared into town over  the weekend, headlining the Ford Theatre and playing a Saturday set in Los  Angeles at the Club With No Name. (When the Joke finished at 3 a.m., it seemed  like the club with no schedule too.)  </P> <P> The band may have a new rhythm section, including original Public Image Ltd.  drummer Martin Atkins, but not much has changed since "Change," which is still  Killing Joke's best song. Too much of the material falls into the same  minor-chord mush, though the group still has the energy and sonic density of a  DC-10 lifting off.  </P> <P> Singer Jaz Coleman, who attempts an apocalyptic pagan image, is more clumsy  than compelling. With his blow-dried hair, sweat pants and messy Magic Marker  scribbles on his face, Coleman resembled a Middle Eastern lounge singer on a  bad mushroom trip. His kung-fu gestures did nothing to enhance his overblown  sermons about greed and cholesterol. CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

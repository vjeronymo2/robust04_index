			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bank of Spain tries to boost peseta's image THE BANK of Spain yesterday signalled its confidence in the peseta by partially lifting exchange controls that it introduced last month and by declining to raise interest rates. The peseta rose from Pta70.5 (39p) to the D-Mark to Pta71.8 early yesterday before stabilising at Pta71.5, clear of its Pta72.6 floor in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The bank's decision to maintain its 13 per cent intervention rate at yesterday's auction of certificates of deposit, failed to rally the markets. By mid-morning the Madrid stock exchange had fallen 1.8 per cent to a new low for the year. Exchange controls will remain in place on one- to three-day swap operations with the peseta. Thus dealers selling pesetas 'short' will have to deposit (interest-free with the Bank of Spain for up to a year), a sum equivalent to the day's transactions. Some dealers believed that the measures were now more stringent than before for those operating on the peseta's 'spot' market. Restrictions were, however, lifted on all other currency operations. The bank also lowered the obligatory deposit, proportional to the amount of foreign currency held, that domestic institutions have to make with the Bank of Spain. 'Before we were damaging those who were legitimately covering their currency investments and now we are simply focusing on the speculators,' a spokesman for the bank said. A bank circular said the controls, which had been introduced 12 days ago at a time of strong speculation on ERM currencies, were now being eased because 'the foreign exchange environment has since evolved towards greater stability'. The markets had widely anticipated that an easing of exchange controls would be accompanied by a rise in interest rates. The authorities, however, are apparently holding such a rise in reserve until there is a return to full currency liberalisation. The partial lifting earned a mixed reception. 'The authorities have prudently streamlined the restrictions and are transmitting confidence,' said Mr Jaime Pinies, chief analyst at Banco Santander de Negocios. Mr Stephen Hughes, of Nikko Europe in London, said: 'No foreign investor is going to come back into Spain until the controls are completely lifted. The investors sense a peseta devaluation and view the currency as risky.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- Foreign Minister Celso Amorim on 22  April reacted to the Argentine Government's proposal of putting  a levy on Brazilian exports to compensate for so-called "social  dumping," that is, the practice of competitive prices thanks to  cheap labor. The foreign minister said the connection between  labor standards and trade is a "spurious" matter, in response to  Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, who a few months ago  accused Brazil of taking advantage of the low salaries paid here  to increase its exports and trade surplus with Argentina.    "We cannot allow other countries to impose restrictions on  our exports," Amorim said as he attended the fourth ministerial  meeting of the Rio Group and EU with the presence of 25 Latin  American and European foreign ministers. In defense, Argentine  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella denied that his government  intends to put a levy on Brazilian products, but he said the  wage difference between the two countries must be reduced.    "The Brazilian economy is undergoing a transformation we  consider excellent," he said.    The Argentine proposal is similar to that presented by the  United States and France in the last meeting of the GATT Uruguay  Round: to link the increase of international trade with the  exporting countries' labor and environmental conditions. During  the meeting, the rest of the countries managed to avoid  mentioning this specific proposal.    "Since the developed countries are living in a recession,  there is a proclivity to include clauses that would imply  transferring the burden of unemployment to the developing  countries," Celso Amorim complained.</p>

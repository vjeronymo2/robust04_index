			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke buckles up And the sound that you heard was the sound of precedents breaking. The UK chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, yesterday decided to raise interest rates, before such a move was thought overdue, and only a month before the Conservative party conference. What is more, the leader of the opposition did not criticise the increase. Although a conclusive verdict will not be possible for some time (if ever), the policy shift looks about right. The breaks with tradition can be welcomed even less reservedly. Over two years into economic recovery, the direction of yesterday's half-point change - which took UK base rates to 5.75 per cent - was no surprise. The shock was the timing, and to a lesser extent, the size of the increase. On both, Mr Clarke has taken a smallish economic risk, and a larger political one. The economic gamble in yesterday's rise is that the recovery is strong enough to take it. Pointing to last week's mixed batch of data, critics might argue that this is far from certain. UK consumers may yet react more negatively to this year's tax rises than many suppose. Moreover, a rise in interest rates could, on this argument, snuff out any chance of a sustained upturn in investment, which has sadly lagged behind in this recovery to date. It is in the nature of a 'pre-emptive' rate rise that these doubts will be raised. But the recent experience of US monetary tightening indicates that the authorities cannot afford to look reluctant to raise rates as the economic cycle matures. The UK yield curve is unusually steep for this stage in a recovery, while price pressures, though thankfully slight, are visible nonetheless. The yield curve offers a reward for plucky chancellors, in the form of lower long-term rates. Judging by yesterday's market reaction, the decision to tighten could deliver just such an effect. The gap between UK and German government long-term bond rates - a good guide to differing inflation expectations for each country - narrowed a little to close at about 1.35 percentage points. As the continued size of that gap indicates, it will take more than a single pre-conference pre-emption for Mr Clarke to convince many that the UK's historic penchant for 'boom-bust' economics is gone for good. These fears would revive, for example, if Tory backbenchers were successful in winning tax cuts in the November Budget 'in return' for having swallowed yesterday's rate increase. It is crucial that the rationale for yesterday's increase be understood to be a long-term one: delivering the government's own inflation target of 1-2 1/2 per cent before the end of the current parliament. Yesterday's move seemed refreshingly novel: the good news is that with luck Mr Clarke will not have to steel himself to do the same again for some time to come.</p>

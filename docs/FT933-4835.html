			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Iberia move is welcome Sir, The recent ousting of Mr Aguilo, chairman of Iberia (International Company News, September 1), is certainly welcomed by a number of frequent flyers resident in Spain. Being exposed to sub-standard service and incidents, including aircraft departures without all passengers checked in, last-minute changes to published schedules, quasi-punitive pricing practices and failure to refund promptly unused full-fare tickets (more than six months) is irritating, especially since there is, for all practical purposes, no alternative carrier on most Spanish routes. Unlike Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways, who has taken pains to respond to written communications concerning major service incidents, Mr Aguilo has remained silent when I have written to him in an ultimate attempt to have incidents resolved. Until the European Commission's DG4 takes effective steps at crushing Iberia's abuse of monopoly power, we can only hope that Mr Aguilo's successor will introduce customer service on Iberia's agenda. Etienne Danois-Maricq, honorary secretary, IEE Iberica, Institution of Electrical Engineers, Madrid</p>

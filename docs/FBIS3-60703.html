Speaking at the oath taking ceremony of the office bearers  of  the Rewalpindi Press Club, the senate chairman said the  amendment is discriminatory and has tilted the military balance  in favour of India. He added no law and morality can permit  such kind of legislation.    Wasim said the Pressler amendment has totally failed to  achieve its objective of checking nuclear proliferation in the  region. However it is causing harm to America's age old friend  Pakistan. He said India exploded its nuclear device in 1971.  U.S. experts have confirmed that India is also making missiles.    The Senate chairman maintained that India will achieve the  capability in the year 2000 AD to make missiles which can even  target the United States. He reminded that India has already  made intermediate missiles.    In this situation, he said, imposition of Pressler amendment  is one-sided and unjustified. He vowed ``we will render every  sacrifice but will not bow before any discriminatory pressure.''    He told the audience ``we have made it clear to the visiting  U.S. Senators that Pakistan will turn to other options if  Pressler law stays.'' He added that we can buy better military  hardware on soft terms from other countries.    Wasim Sajjad said the amendment has affected our military  defence capabilities which is deplorable in the existing  circumstances.    Speaking on the Kashmir issue, the Senate chairman urged the  media to project the Kashmir issue vigorously at all levels and  air voice against the violations of human rights there.  [sentence as published]    He said Western countries, specially the U.S. has started to  realise the gravity of the Kashmir problem.    He said he had very useful talks with the U.S. Senators, and  noted that U.S. desired a peaceful solution of Kashmir.    He expressed satisfaction over the realising of the  violations of human rights in Kashmir by the Western countries.  The House of Commons also desired an honorable solution to the  Kashmir problem through use of the right of franchise to the  Kashmiris, he added.    Wasim Sajjad said both government and the opposition should  play their due role for strengthening the democratic process in  the country and should also play their effective and  constructive roles for the progress of the country.    It was high time, he added, to adopt a strategy and to  introduce a system which guaranteed the integrity and solidarity  of the country.    He said the early solution of Kashmir issue was imperative  for the congenial atmosphere among the two neighbouring  countries i.e. India and Pakistan.    He said Pakistan was facing various challenges including  poverty, unemployment, health and education which need urgent  attention of the government.    He said the press has the power to change human thinking.  ``I think responsibility of the national press has increased.  Journalism is not only a profession but also a mission,'' Wasim  Sajjad said adding the journalists should work to maintain  peace, unity as well as promote positive thinking    He stressed that journalists should also play their positive  role in increasing awareness among the masses to root out the  causes hindering progress and prosperity of the country.    He paid glowing tributes to journalists for their sacrifices  rendered for the freedom of press.    ``I believe in the freedom of expression as I consider it  the  first condition for strengthening a democratic system,'' he  added.</p>

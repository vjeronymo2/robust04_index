			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NADER SAYS U.S. LACKS ENERGY STRATEGY  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said Tuesday that President Bush has "substituted  a military policy for an energy policy" in sending troops to defend Saudi  Arabia.  </P> <P> Nader said at a news conference that the Bush Administration lacks a clear  energy policy and that opposition Democrats have failed to find an alternative  to reliance on imported oil.  </P> <P> He urged Congress to adopt new average fuel-efficiency standards of 45 miles  per gallon for new cars by 2000, a move that would reduce gasoline sales by at  least 20% and curb dependence on imported oil. The most stringent legislation  pending in Congress would raise average fuel economy to 40 miles per gallon by  2000 from the current level of 27.  </P> <P> Nader said conservation, greater fuel efficiency for cars and using more power  from such sources as wood, water and the sun offered a realistic alternative to  more imports from the Middle East. The United States imports about half of the  17.5 million barrels of oil it uses daily.  </P> <P> Nader said no one in the Administration has an energy plan.  </P></p>

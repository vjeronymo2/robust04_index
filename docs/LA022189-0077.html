			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLYLEVEN, ANGELS AGREE TO $1.1-MILLION DEAL FOR 1989  </P> <P> The final minutes of Bert Blyleven's contractual limbo found Angel Vice  President Mike Port bouncing from one practice field to another Monday morning,  searching for a tall, bearded right-hander wearing No. 28 on his back.  </P> <P> "Now when you want to sign him, you can't find him," Port quipped as he hustled  to yet another diamond on the Angels' training complex.  </P> <P> Finally, Port found his man. Then they found common ground. Moments later,  putting grievances and counter-grievances behind them, Blyleven and the Angels  agreed to a contract that will pay Blyleven about $1.1 million in 1989, while  giving the club the option of re-signing him for 1990.  </P> <P> Thus, the quiet controversy of the Angels' off-season reached resolution.  Overshadowed by the defection of Bob Boone, the pursuit of Nolan Ryan and Bruce  Hurst, and the appeasement of Wally Joyner, Blyleven and the Angels remained at  odds over salary since his Nov. 3 trade from the Minnesota Twins, each side  going as far as filing a grievance against the other.  </P> <P> The dispute evolved once Port attempted to cut Blyleven's salary 20% from 1988  -- the maximum allowed under baseball's collective bargaining agreement -- and  involved two different interpretations of what that final sum might be.  </P> <P> In 1986, Blyleven signed a two-year contract extension with the Twins, calling  for $2.95 million in addition to the $650,000 he earned in 1986. That's a  three-year package of $3.6 million, or an average of $1.2 million per season.  </P> <P> The Angels wanted to cut Blyleven 20% of $1.2 million, tendering him a 1989  contract of $960,000. Blyleven and his agent, Dick Moss, argued instead for a  20% cut of the two-year extension -- an average of $1.475 million per season --  which would translate into a $1.18 million salary for Blyleven in 1989.  </P> <P> So, Blyleven and Moss filed a grievance. Port countered by tendering Blyleven a  second contract worth $1.18 million, but accompanied the offer with a  counter-grievance. The intent: Let an arbitrator study both grievances and  choose his own figure.  </P> <P> "That was the worst-case scenario," Port said. "Bert would be pitching for us  on a one-year contract, at whichever amount was decided upon by an arbitrator."  </P> <P> Arbitration was averted Monday when Blyleven settled for $1.1 million. That's  more than the $1 million he netted in 1988, when he finished 10-17 with a 5.43  earned-run average, but less than the $1.2 million he averaged during his final  three years with Minnesota.  </P> <P> "I feel like I got a raise," Blyleven said. "I'm very happy with it."  </P> <P> And about those grievances?  </P> <P> Grievances, what grievances?  </P> <P> "I don't think we ever had that much difficulty or that much space between the  us," Port said. "All along, we knew Bert would pitch in Anaheim and be happy to  do so, and the club would be happy to have him on our staff.  </P> <P> "There were some questions, but there was never really any (major obstacle). It  was something about nothing, in hindsight.  </P> <P> Said Blyleven: "We really didn't have too many discussions with Mike Port  during the winter. My agent, Dick Moss, was involved in a lot of arbitration  cases, so there wasn't much communication.  </P> <P> "I didn't think there was a problem. I'd like to end my career in Anaheim and  this contract is a step in that direction."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Four days into spring camp and already the Angels are down two pitchers. After  the loss of Joe Johnson with an Achilles' tendon injury, non-roster invitee  Mark Clear left camp Monday complaining of pain in his right elbow, the same  condition that sidelined him for most of 1988 with Milwaukee. He will receive  treatment at home, but will not likely return to the Angels this spring.  "That's very doubtful," Mike Port said. "It's the same symptomology he had  before. There were no secrets; we knew the risks. He had it in Milwaukee and it  started up again right now. He just didn't feel he could keep throwing through  it." To fill Clear's vacancy, the Angels will invite minor-league pitcher Gary  Buckles to camp. Buckles was 14-3 with a 2.94 earned-run average at Class-A  Quad Cities last season. . . . Technicalities, technicalities: Although rules  prohibit position players from working out before Wednesday, third baseman Jack  Howell and outfielder Marcus Lawton were in uniform along with pitchers and  catchers Monday. Deadpanned Port: "They can't be here, so I think we're going  to have to release Jack Howell." Actually, position players can report early,  providing they are rehabilitating an injury, such as second baseman Mark  McLemore. Thinking on his feet, Angel publicity director Tim Mead came up with  this rationale for Howell's presence: "He's here for medical reasons, too.  Hemorrhoids." . . . Along with Bert Blyleven, relief pitcher Vance Lovelace  also agreed to terms with the Angels, bringing the club's number of unsigned  players to 14.  </P></p>

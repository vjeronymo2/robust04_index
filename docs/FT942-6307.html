			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Elektrim Elektrim, one of the biggest companies on the Warsaw bourse, yesterday cut the price of its planned rights issue by almost 20 per cent to 1.22m zlotys a share, reflecting the weakness of the market. The move by the foreign trade company, which specialises in telecommunication and power generation, slices 187bn zlotys (Dollars 8.4m) off the company's expected capital increase. It comes as Polifarb Cieszyn, a listed paints producer, said a mere 4,632 shares had been taken up of its 765,000 rights issue. The Polifarb rights price yesterday stood 4 per cent higher than its ordinary share price yesterday while Elektrim was trading yesterday at 1,350,000 zlotys per share.</p>

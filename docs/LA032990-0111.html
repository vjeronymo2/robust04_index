			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MCGUIRE'S GEM SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A MARK  </P> <P> El Camino Real High left-hander Ryan McGuire's 20-strikeout performance in a  7-2 defeat of Cleveland on Tuesday appears to be a seven-inning City Section  record.  </P> <P> According to Cal-Hi Sports magazine, which tracks state records in a variety of  high school sports, McGuire is the first City player to have achieved the feat.  </P> <P> Or so it would seem.  </P> <P> Most of Cal-Hi's records are based on marks reported to the magazine.  </P> <P> "It's a safe assumption that he set the record," Cal-Hi's Mark Tennis said.  "But the key word is 'reported.' "  </P> <P> Tennis said that Cal-Hi has a list of several players who have recorded 20 or  more strikeouts in a seven-inning game and that no City pitcher is on it.  </P> <P> The City Section keeps no statistical baseball records, Commissioner Hal  Harkness said.

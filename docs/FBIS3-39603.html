Claes also talked about the speeches by some six other senators  -- including Paul Pataer, Herman De Croo, Hugo Van Rompaey, and  Nelly Maes -- who took part in the debate.    Generally speaking, the speeches contained a carefully  worded  positive reaction to the NATO ultimatum. However, the questions  asked were primarily about the scope of the ultimatum and the  role of the European Union. As for the future of the southern  Slav region, a number of different voices could be heard.  Pataer rejected an ethnic division. On the other, Van Rompaey  and Maes stressed that the conflict between the peoples there is  already centuries old.    Foreign Minister Willy Claes defended the role of the  European Union in the conflict and also clarified the NATO  ultimatum. He put the emphasis on the fact that "the creation  of a new element following the failure of the latest  negotiations in late December was inevitable."    He explained that "he wanted to see no introduction to a  generalized military scenario" in the ultimatum. He did feel  that the ultimatum must be carried out with the necessary  strictness and that it must not be watered down on the ground.  The ultimatum concerns only Sarajevo and the surrounding area,  but can be broadened geographically if necessary.    Claes said that any such negotiated solution would not  really  be convincing without Russia and the United States. However,  that does not mean that "Moscow should think that it has a say  in determining the European Union's position." America must be  involved in a solution because the Muslims in Sarajevo feel that  only Washington can provide a convincing guarantee for a peace  agreement.    Claes came down against lifting the arms embargo, because  this would increase the risk of war for the UN troops and the  neighboring countries, but also because "some countries, which  are known for their support to fundamentalism and which are  already active on the ground in Bosnia," would not hesitate to  send advisers and mercenaries.    The minister finished by warning of a "mistaken vision of  nationalism that can deteriorate into racism and egoism," but at  the same time stressed that he "does not want return to the idea  of the right to self-determination."</p>

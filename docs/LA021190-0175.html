			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION COULD PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER 'SMALL TOWN IN GERMANY';  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE CAPITAL OF NEW NATION WOULD PROBABLY MOVE TO BERLIN. LANDLORDS FEAR  A MASS EXODUS.  </P> <P> After years of trying to be taken seriously as the capital of West Germany,  this sleepy, Rhine-side university town has the feeling that the political and  economic rug is being pulled out from under it.  </P> <P> Pulling at the rug is German reunification, a development likely to come sooner  rather than later, which means that the capital of the Federal Republic will  probably move to Berlin -- seat of past governments of kings, kaisers,  republicans and Nazis.  </P> <P> Bonn's first qualms surfaced a few days ago when the federal government  announced that it was halting preliminary work on the new $150-million federal  press and information center here.  </P> <P> Construction was also ordered stopped on a new lobbying office here for the  state of North Rhine-Westphalia.  </P> <P> Feelings of panic are rising among landlords, who fear a mass exodus of  politicians, diplomats and journalists to Berlin, depressing inflated rents and  prices for houses and apartments.  </P> <P> "This could be a city in ruins," commented a leading Christian Democratic  member of Parliament, Kai-Uwe von Hassel, who urged that the capital remain in  Bonn.  </P> <P> And Bonn's Mayor Hans Daniels calls the issue "a red-hot poker."  </P> <P> Bonn's worries come as the city of 300,000 has experienced the biggest building  boom in its history: Last year six hotels were completed, increasing bed space  by one third; a new legislative chamber for the Bundestag, or Parliament, is  being finished, and new (and, in most cases, unsightly) federal office  buildings are springing up all over town.  </P> <P> At last, civic fathers had thought, Bonn, with its fine city orchestra, parks,  restaurants, and new ministries, would cease being the butt of jokes about its  provincialism and small scale.  </P> <P> Now the question raised by many here is whether all the new buildings will end  up as white elephants if the government and ministries decide to pack up and  leave.  </P> <P> In announcing cessation of construction for the information headquarters, an  official said: "We don't know if we will stay here or move to Berlin."  </P> <P> Bonn has long been sensitive about being described as "a small town in Germany"  by spy-thriller writer John le Carre or being called by its more common  nickname, the "Bundesdorf" -- the federal village.  </P> <P> The guiding force behind Bonn's being chosen as the federal capital was the  first postwar federal chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, who had been mayor of  Cologne and lived across the Rhine from Bonn in a village called Rhoendorf,  where he tended his roses.  </P> <P> Adenauer's scheme in selecting Bonn was to keep alive the notion that an  eventually reunited Germany would return its government to Berlin, and Bonn's  function as the West German capital in the meantime would keep a major city  such as Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg or Munich from being chosen and  irreversibly established as the capital.  </P> <P> Bonn, then centered around the university, began annexing villages on both  sides of the Rhine, but it didn't have the kind of facilities needed for proper  government buildings and foreign embassies.  </P> <P> So the Parliament was placed in a teachers college, and the president's and  chancellor's official residences were former private mansions. Federal offices  commandeered whatever space they could find, and major embassies such as those  of the United States and Britain were housed in Spartan prefabricated  buildings.  </P> <P> The temporary appearance of the government quarter contrasted with the fine old  university buildings in the city where Beethoven was born.  </P> <P> On weekends, Bonn looked like a ghost town as politicians departed for their  home constituencies and the more sophisticated pleasures of the bigger cities.  </P> <P> "What's the best thing about Bonn?" ran an old joke. "The train to Munich." Or  Frankfurt, or Hamburg. Another: "Bonn has half the population of a Chicago  cemetery and is twice as dead."  </P> <P> But in the early 1980s, the government seemed to decide that Bonn might remain  the capital for some time to come, and a major building effort was undertaken.  </P> <P> Yellow and orange cranes went up along Route B-9 between Bonn and the  diplomatic community of Bad Godesberg to erect federal structures, embassies  and lobbying group headquarters. Castles were renovated for government guests  and new museums were established. An expensive remodeling of the Parliament  building was begun.  </P> <P> Just two months ago, Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a $75-billion contract to  support the extra needs of the city as the capital through the 1990s, ensuring  that all the buildings under construction will be completed.  </P> <P> With speculation rising over Bonn's future role, Mayor Daniels is mounting a  campaign to hang onto the capital. He says, "We stand on the threshold of a  fateful year."  </P> <P> An estimated 100,000 people, a third of the population, rely on Bonn being the  capital for their livelihood.  </P> <P> Other officials are urging that if the capital shifts to Berlin, most of the  ministry staffs should remain in Bonn, since Berlin is already overcrowded and  short of office and living space.  </P> <P> The mood of Bonn workers who would be affected is mixed.  </P> <P> One secretary said: "I like it here. Things are quiet and living is pleasant.  Berlin is too big, noisy and dirty."  </P> <P> But a newspaper bureau manager said: "I'm looking forward to moving to Berlin.  Now that would be a real world-class capital."  </P> <P> Officials at the newly completed Maritim Hotel in Bonn said optimistically: "We  are not too worried. We've got bookings well into 1995."  </P> <P> But if there's no governmental reason to come to Bonn, bookings might be  canceled, and, city officials fear, Bonn itself might be "canceled."  </P></p>

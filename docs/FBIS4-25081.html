			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 1 Jun (XINHUA) -- To further improve the  overall coordination of economic performance, the State Economic  and Trade Commission recently held in Beijing the first meeting  on the overall coordination of economic performance. The  meeting was attended by officials in charge of concerned  departments.    Comrades attending the meeting were of the opinion that,  under socialist market economic conditions, it had become  increasingly important to adopt new methods in line with market  economic work to guide economic performance. They said:  Currently, we should improve the overall coordination of  economic performance in accordance with the new characteristics  of the market economy, stressing "overall" and "coordination."  We should ensure that the economy develops in a sustained,  rapid, and healthy manner by exercising regulation and control  over economic performance in a timely fashion.    The primary purpose of the meeting was to study how to  establish a system for holding meetings on the overall  coordination of economic performance. The meeting also  seriously analyzed current economic performance and studied ways  to further improve the overall coordination of economic  performance, to coordinate relevant policies, and to implement  relevant measures.    While analyzing the current economic situation, especially  the situation of state-owned enterprises, Wang Zhongyu, minister  in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, said:  First of all, over the last few years the state has adopted  many policies and mesaures aimed at state-owned enterprises, and  party committees and governments at all levels and enterprises  themselves have done a great deal of work; as a result,  state-owned enterprises' conditions have improved. State-owned  enterprises have made and will continue to make great  contributions to the country's reform and development. Second,  we should pay great attention to and strive to solve  difficulties and problems related to some enterprises'  production and management. Some specific requirements and time  are needed to solve these problems. Third, state-owned  enterprises have vitality; we are full of confidence in  improving their performance. During the first quarter of this  year, some new developments occurred in state-owned enterprises.  By conducting a pragmatic analysis, we can find that  state-owned enterprises have improved in some way and have  developed in the right direction. Because of this, state-owned  enterprises over the last few years have been able to cope with  various negative effects (including adjustments in coal,  electricity, oil, and transportation prices) and have provided  the state with a large amount of wealth. As the measures to  reform the financial, taxation, and foreign exchange systems are  being carried out, the new systems have basically functioned  normally. During a period of time to come, we should make  special efforts to improve work related to state-owned  enterprises. We should make further efforts to transform  enterprises' operating mechanisms and to establish a new  enterprise system. We also should do a good job in  experimenting with the enterprise bankruptcy system, clearing up  enterprises' debts, increasing enterprises' own funds, limiting  enterprises' production and reducing their stocks, improving  enterprises' profitability, and improving enterprise management  to raise work related to state-owned enterprises to a new level.    Those attending the meeting included officials in charge of  the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Ministry of Coal  Industry, Ministry of Electronics Industry, Ministry of  Machine-Building Industry, Ministry of Chemical Industry,  Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Railways,  Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Internal Trade, Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the China National  Textile Council, the China National Light Industry Council, the  State Administration of Taxation, and the State Statistics  Bureau.</p>

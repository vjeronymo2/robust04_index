			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Markets Equities have suffered a jittery week. Yesterday the FT-SE 100 index plunged below the 3,000 mark. US, continental European and Far Eastern shares have also been under pressure. The main cause is investor concern over rising interest rates. Last month's 75-basis point increase in US rates is still fresh. But the US economy is growing so fast that many shareholders are now expecting further action from the Federal Reserve when it next meets on December 20. At some point, this year's sharp increase in borrowing costs will knock the economy and corporate earnings. Another worry has been the extraordinary events in Orange County, California. This is not merely a morality tale about the risks of leveraged investment. Markets have become jumpy at the thought that Orange County's bankruptcy may not be an isolated case. If other public and private institutions are found to be in the same boat, there could be a mass liquidation of investment portfolios. Still, amid all these troubles, the good news is that government bond markets are holding up. This is mainly because the higher interest rates that shareholders fear are finding favour with bond investors. There has been a pronounced 'flattening' of the yield curve over the past month; short-term yields have risen, but long-term yields have not. In the UK, this week's base rate increase has reinforced the view that the government is prepared to take a tough line to pre-empt inflation. So long as bond markets remain calm, there will be some underpinning for jittery equities.</p>

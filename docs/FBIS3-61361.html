On the Progress of the  Implementation of the State Program for the Employment of the  Population in 1993"]    [Text] The Ukrainian Ministry of Labor has released  information on the progress of the implementation of the State  Program for the Employment of the Population in the nine months  [as published] of 1993 which has been received from ministries  and departments, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of  Crimea, oblast state administrations, and the Kiev and  Sevastopol city administrations.    The employment program envisioned the introduction of  114,300  new jobs in the current year. Actually, 70,700 units, or 61.8  percent, were actually introduced during the nine months of this  year. The program of job creation at enterprises of the private  form of ownership was 154.3 percent fulfilled, of the mixed  ownership form--115.1 percent fulfilled, of collective  ownership--57.8 percent fulfilled, and of the state form of  ownership--34.7 percent fulfilled.    Some 17,626.7 million karbovantsy has been allocated to  create additional jobs from the state fund for facilitating the  employment of the populace, and 53.8 million karbovantsy from  the State Off-Budget Privatization Fund. The measures taken made  it possible to place 150,700 people in jobs from among the  nonemployed population during the reporting period, or 33  percent, compared to 27.5 percent during the corresponding  period of last year.    Considerable attention was paid to the job placement of  citizens who are not capable of competing in the labor market on  an equal footing and for whom 317,100 jobs were reserved this  year within the 5-percent quota.    The sphere of labor use expanded in the reporting period  owing to the organization of paid public works. Three times as  many citizens as in the corresponding period of last year  (11,200) took part in these works. More than 42 percent of the  citizens who engaged in such works were unemployed. A total of  306,700 man-days were put in at public works of all types, which  exceeds this indicator for the period between January and  September of last year by a factor of 2.4.    The invigoration of joint efforts by the Ministry of Labor,  Ministry of Education, and the State Employment Center and the  taking of organizational measures by them made it possible to  increase considerably the volume of vocational training and  retraining of laid-off employees and the nonemployed population.  The Employment Service has signed cooperation agreements with  more than 800 educational establishments. Between January and  September of this year, 23,300 nonemployed citizens received  instruction or underwent retraining.    Efforts are being made to ensure vocational retraining and  to  facilitate the adaptation of women and young people to the  conditions of the new economic situation. In particular, the  training of women has been organized at the school of  entrepreneurs in the sector of small- and medium-size businesses  at the Cadre Training Administration of the Ministry of Culture  of Ukraine and the Institute for Skill Improvement of the  Ministry of the Machine-Building Industry. Seminar training for  women in fundamentals of business is being offered in Rovno,  Kherson, Kharkov, and other oblasts. A total of more than 16,100  women have been referred for vocational instruction since the  beginning of the year.    Certain efforts have been made this year to organize the  training of servicemen discharged from the military service in  conjunction with strength or authorized complement reductions  and not entitled to retirement pay.    Some 1,594.6 million karbovantsy has been spent for  vocational training from the State Fund for Facilitating the  Employment of the Population, of which 507.2 million karbovantsy  was for the payment of scholarships.    Nonetheless there are still many shortcomings and unresolved  issues in the area of vocational training and retraining. The  main directions for further work on carrying out the State  Program for the Employment of the Populace in this matter were  set forth at a meeting of the collegium, which was held on 24  November, of the Ukrainian Ministry of Education with the  participation of representatives of the State Employment Center.  In particular, it is envisioned to develop the Concept of  Vocational Training and Retraining of the Nonemployed Adult  Population, to establish an interdepartmental commission for the  issues of vocational training and retraining, and to submit, for  consideration by the leadership of the Ministry of Education and  the Ministry of Labor, proposals for the establishment and  organization of the work of model centers of professional  training and retraining in the regions.    The scope of carrying out program measures over these nine  months has been in line with the current condition of the labor  market.    In Ukraine as a whole, the unemployment rate comes to 0.28  percent of the able-bodied population of the working age. As of  1 October of this year, a total of 78,700 unemployed were  registered, which is 1.3 times more than on the same date last  year. More than 75 percent of them are women.    The unemployment situation is the most acute in the western  region of Ukraine, where 50.2 percent of all unemployed are  concentrated.    Hidden unemployment persists on a considerable scale, just  as  it did in the first half of this year. In July through September  of this year, 759,400 people, or 16.8 percent of the average  number on the payroll, were on unpaid leaves of various duration  (from two weeks to one month or more) at 5,988 enterprises  surveyed by the employment service.    Reviewing the issue of the progress implementing the State  Program for the Employment of the Population for 1993 at a  meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine made it possible  to bring the development of the material-technical facilities of  the state employment service to the attention of the state  administration.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: PSDR data spark switching into long-dated paper THE long end of the gilts market rallied nearly half a point yesterday, on better-than-expected public sector debt repayment (PSDR) figures in January. The news prompted switching into long-dated paper, causing a further flattening of the curve. The market had already rallied sharply on Friday, when the retail price index in the year to January fell to 1.7 per cent. The Bank of England took advantage of the market's strength to issue Pounds 1.2bn of 9 per cent stock due 2011 and Pounds 150m of 4 1/8 per cent index-linked Treasury stock expiring 2030. The market absorbed the extra paper easily, taking comfort from the fact that the government is now well ahead on its funding. ELSEWHERE in Europe, investors continued to view the German market as a safe haven. The spread between 10-year French OAT and German bund yields widened to 89 basis points, from 82 basis points last week. Dealers said that although the bund market is not particularly bullish, some nervousness about the franc is encouraging investors to switch. The spread against Danish and Belgian bonds has also widened on fears of further currency turmoil. The margin between 10-year German and Danish bond yields has widened to 184 basis points, while the spread between German and Belgian 10-year yields has increased to 77 basis points. TREASURY prices were mixed yesterday as the market digested President Clinton's deficit-reduction plans. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 7.138 per cent. At the short end, however, prices remained firm, with the two-year note up  3/32 at 100 1/4 , to yield 4.098 per cent. The president's televised address on Monday night, in which he outlined his proposals to cut the deficit, was initially well received by the bond market. By mid-morning New York time, however, local investors' enthusiasm for Treasuries had waned, and long-dated prices soon moved into negative territory due to lack of domestic demand. The long end was also pressured by more good economic news. The Johnson Redbook service reported a 6.3 per cent rise in US store sales during the second week of January. THE government bonds table includes three new benchmark issues from today: a 9 per cent Belgian government bond due 2003, a 6 1/4 per cent US Treasury due 2003 and a 7 1/8 per cent US Treasury due 2023.</p>

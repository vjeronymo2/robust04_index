			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Gregor Mayer; place and date not given: "A Call for the  Guiding Hand of the State"]    [Excerpt] [Mayer] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy recently said  that Hungary is a "weak, poor country" and that Eastern Central  Europe will "unite in an alliance under Slovakia's leadership."  Should Hungary fear Russia again?    [Horn] One should not take Mr. Zhirinovskiy's statements  seriously. Of course, one must not ignore him either because  this nationalist-imperialist direction that he represents is a  certain challenge. However, I do not fear that Russia will  again turn Eastern Central Europe into its sphere of influence.    [Mayer] Why not?    [Horn] Russia neither has a reason nor the power. It is  struggling with its own internal difficulties. It is not easy  to hold Russia together.    [Mayer] Moscow's aspirations to push through some kind of  Monroe Doctrine for the territory within the ex-Soviet borders  do not alarm you either?    [Horn] Hungary and the other countries of Eastern Central  Europe never belonged to Moscow. This is completely different  from Georgia or the other ex-USSR republics.    [Mayer] However, you proposed as early as in 1990 that  Hungary should strive for its admission to NATO.    [Horn] At that time, I proposed that close relations with  NATO be developed. Even though this may have been differently  interpreted, I meant political, not military cooperation.    [Mayer] At any rate, at that time, when the new democratic  parties still talked of neutrality, you were a silent caller in  Hungary. Are you disappointed today at NATO's hesitation to  admit the Eastern European candidates as members?    [Horn] The "Partnership for Peace" program is a clever idea  because it holds out the prospect of the development of  cooperation to the East Europeans and does not commit NATO to  anything in the question of admission.    [Mayer] Poland has, therefore, reacted with frustration.    [Horn] I am rather disappointed, because I do not see a  guarantee that NATO would do something against a possible crisis  in this region or how this would be done. [passage omitted]</p>

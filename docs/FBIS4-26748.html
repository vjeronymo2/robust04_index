			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["International Forum" by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Inequality </F> Behind the Slogan of `Equality'"]    [Text] The affairs in the world today can be characterized  by "the tree desiring stillness but the wind not ceasing." When  the clamor of "linking trade with human rights" has just  subsided, certain Western nations are again trying to peddle  their "linkage between trade and laborers' rights and interests"  in a bid to force it into the GATT document. This will  naturally meet objection from the vast number of developing  nations.    In light of this fallacy, trade expanded by the developing  nations with their cheap labor prices is "immoral," "unfair,"  and "unequal" to the laborers of the developed or developing  nations; international trade organs should set up a standard for  labor prices and consider it a condition for developing nations  to enter the international market. In other words, Western  nations can erect trade obstacles under the excuse of the poor  remuneration of the laborers in some countries.    People may feel it strange that the gentlemen of the rich  nations have suddenly shown concern for the interests of the  laborers in the poor nations. People with good sense know that  this is another trick played by some Western nations to make up  for the decline in their economic competitiveness. In the name  of showing concern for the interests of laborers of the  developing nations, they are actually practicing trade  protectionism.    As everyone knows, for various reasons, the wages of  laborers  of the developing nations have always been lower than those of  the developed nations. It will be impossible to compare the per  capita wage of several hundred dollars of a poor nation with  that of $20,000 of a rich nation. This is common sense. It is  the right of the developing nations to take advantage of their  cheap labor to increase exports and take part in international  competition, which brooks no outside interference. To increase  remuneration of their laborers, the developing nations must  expand trade, develop their economies, and increase incomes of  their people. It would be unrealistic to raise the wages of the  developing nations to a level forced by the Western nations,  irrespective of their own national conditions. Moreover, it  will also weaken one of the limited advantages of the developing  nations, benefit the rich nations, let the poor nations suffer,  and eventually harm the interests of the laborers of the  developing nations.    Thus it can be seen that those who have proposed "linking  trade with the rights and interests of laborers" are not really  concerned about the well-being of the laborers. Instead, they  want to take this as an excuse to deprive the poor nations of  the opportunity to strive for development with their advantage  of cheap labor. Such a practice of ignoring the national  conditions of the developing nations and forcing the poor  nations to compete with the rich ones on the same level is  tantamount to a fight between a light weight boxer and a heavy  one, which is even more "immoral," "unfair," and "unequal."    Trade protectionism is a behavior which lacks foresight.  This is particularly true in the trade protectionism practiced  by the developed nations to the developing ones. It should be  noted that trade and economic growth of the developing nations  has precisely offered an extensive market and investment place  for the developed nations. The situation in East Asia today  serves as a practical example. The problem is, on the one hand,  some Western nations want to make the most of the opportunity to  strengthen economic cooperation with the developing nations; on  the other hand, they are also afraid that the developing nations  will become powerful, which in turn will menace their own  interests. Hence, they adopt all kinds of measures to restrict  the growth of the developing nations. Such a self-contradictory  move will only intensify the confrontation between the north and  south, harm the interests of developing nations, and eventually  ruin their own interests.    Although the situation after the end of the Cold War has  proved that naked military intervention will not work, economic  intervention is now on the rise. "The linkage between trade and  laborers' rights and interests" is a reproduction by the  hegemonists in the economic field. This merits vigilance.</p>

The huge rise is blamed on further declining production and  continued changes affecting the business world.    In an economic report released recently, the government also  said that the number of people entitled to unemployment benefits  this year will reach three million, up dramatically from last  year's figure of less than 50,000.    The report said that the government's major task this year  is  to stick to relatively tough financial and monetary policies so  as to lower the budget deficit and reduce the inflation rate to  between five and seven percent by the end of 1994.    In 1993, the budget deficit consumed about seven percent of  Russia's general domestic product (GDP), which fell by 12  percent from the 1992 level due to continued economic recession.    Employees are expected to be paid three times more than last  year's level in terms of face value of their wages, with average  monthly income hitting 240,000 rubles (about 200 U.S. dollars  according to the current exchange rate).    Meanwhile, commodity wholesale prices will rise by 2.6  times,  the report forecast.    Reviewing last year's economic situation, the report  commented that reform efforts toward establishing a market  economy had led to an increase in the private sector, which  utilized about 40 percent of the country's labor force.    It said as much as 70 percent of Russia's commercial  businesses, food industry and service trade had been privatized  by the end of 1993.    And the service trade alone produced 42 percent of last  year's GDP, representing a nine percent increase from that in  1992, it added.    According to the report, about 2,000 commercial banks were  set up during 1993, while a unified grain market also came into  shape.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Rate rise fears hit long-dated US Treasury prices US Treasury prices fell at the long end of the maturity range in thin trading as investor concern about another interest rate increase deepened ahead of Friday's all-important jobs data. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  11/32 at 95 9/16 , yielding 7.881 per cent. There was a lack of movement at the short end of the market, however, where the two-year note was unchanged at 99, to carry a yield of 6.653 per cent. Trading was extremely quiet from the opening. The day's main economic news - a 0.6 per cent rise in leading economic indicators during August - met analysts' expectations, and was largely ignored. Instead, attention remained firmly focused on the September employment report, due on Friday. Following fresh signs of economic strength, the market is bracing itself for another interest rate increase, and investors fear the tightening could come as soon as Friday if the September jobs data are much stronger than expected. If non-farm payrolls prove to have risen by 300,000 or more, analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates immediately. It was fear of this scenario, coupled with a weaker dollar and news of stronger than expected September car sales, that hit prices yesterday. European government bond markets regained their poise after Monday's slippage, but sentiment remained fragile and dealers said they expected trade to stay directionless ahead of Friday's release of US employment data. They reported little activity from investors, many of whom are seen to be holding their fourth-quarter asset allocation meetings. While inflation fears continue to overhang the bond markets, 'many investors are beginning to attach higher risk to the prospect of equity weakness, which could lead to strength in bonds', said Mr Malcolm Roberts, head of global bond research at Union Bank of Switzerland. In recent weeks traders have reported increased shifts into bonds from equities, especially in the UK markets. Moreover, observers say that many cash-rich investment institutions may be more likely to put fresh funds into bonds rather than equities. 'There is a sense that equities in many markets are expensive relative to bonds,' says Mr Roberts. UK gilts put on the best performance of the day, gaining nearly half a point after losing almost a point on Monday. The December long gilt futures contract rose by  13/32 to 99 5/16 . Among other factors, gilts gained support from spread-purchases against German bonds. After widening to 151 basis points on Monday, the 10-year yield spread over bunds narrowed to 135 basis points yesterday. Gilts were also underpinned by a more sanguine assessment of Monday's M0 money supply data, which were seen as something of an aberration, and reports of falling house prices and short-time work at two Ford car plants in the UK. German bonds made little progress, ending barely changed after a day of range-trading. 'The World Bank's DM2bn issue of five-year eurobonds was the major focus in the D-Mark sector; there wasn't much to inspire the bund market,' said one trader. Meanwhile, the October 16 federal elections continue to weigh on bunds, and traders said they did not expect to see significant investor activity in the bund market before then. French government bonds outperformed their German counterparts, causing the 10-year yield spread over bunds to narrow to 55 basis points from 65 on Monday. Tomorrow's auction of some FFr18bn - FFr20bn of 10-year bonds did not weigh on the market, with dealers expecting the 7.5 per cent coupon on the new OAT to attract solid investor demand.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Doubts cast over likely European performance The annual assumption that European equities will naturally stage a new-year rally stands to be tested this year. By December 31, the FT-Actuaries World Index series was showing Europe, excluding the UK, up by 39.9 per cent, accelerating from a gain of 24.4 per cent in the first nine months of 1993; and investment strategists were counselling caution. In that respect, they were agreeing with the helpless stance taken throughout most of last year by fundamental analysts, who said there was no hope of continental Europe, in the short-to-medium term, producing the economic recovery that would lift corporate profits to the level that share prices were demanding. Germany, said the analysts, should not have its blue-chip DAX index valued on a prospective 1994 p/e between 20 and 25 - depending on who did the sums  -when its economic and corporate performance was still looking grim. This argument had been overborne by the weight of liquidity coming into European equity markets, and especially German equities, from the US. US investment in overseas equities exploded in 1993. A boom in US mutual funds was sustained throughout the year by the low level of domestic interest rates. This, however, might be coming to an end, said Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, in London, in a review in the first week of the new year. Mr Edwards' fears for 1994 were: First, that US short-term rates were set to rise sharply, bringing to an end the US liquidity-led rallies in equity markets around the world; and Second, the realisation that recent low inflation experienced around the world is cyclical, rather than structural, could be a serious threat to current valuations. He made a deep cut in his model portfolio's recommended equity asset allocation to Europe, from 15 per cent to 8 per cent. The American influence last year cut both ways, fast and deep. Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, was a US favourite as recently as mid-October, when it hit a high of SKr477. Two months later, it had dropped to SKr311, with international investors heavy net sellers and little or no domestic buying interest to cushion the fall. At the time, dealers said the shares had suffered because the company's progress reports were no more than excellent; in fact, the fall coincided with the rise of US interest-rate fears. Most European equities are unlikely to be affected in such a dramatic way. Mr James Cornish, European equity strategist with NatWest Securities, notes that his bank is moving to an underweight position for continental Europe in its global asset allocation, with an overweight position for the UK. However, says Mr Cornish, this reflects the feeling that the best was seen in 1993; NatWest's projections for local currency markets in individual markets over the next 12 months range from 5 to 12 per cent. US flows could turn negative, he agrees, but this will be replaced by pressure on European domestic savings to move out of money markets and bonds into equities. 'The sums involved,' he says, ' are potentially enormous'. However, he thinks that rallies based on this feature would be extremely vulnerable to bad news, particularly in the bigger markets which have already risen the most, like Germany, up 44.5 per cent last year, and Switzerland, up 43.6 per cent. Investors this year need a solid base, he contends, which will not become available until economic recovery leads to visible earnings growth based on expanding margins and sales. With UK earnings growth early in place, this suggests a division of continental Europe into two camps. For a group including France, Norway, Spain and perhaps Italy (depending on the politics), economic recovery is in place, or not far away. In a group centred on Germany, including the Netherlands and Switzerland, growth will be weakened by low consumer confidence, restructuring is likely to continue, and firmly-based earings recovery may well not be visible before the end of the fall in the interest-rate cycle.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bullough declines by 60% to Pounds 8.5m BULLOUGH, the office products and refrigeration group which issued a profits warning in December, yesterday reported a 59 per cent decline in full year profits but is maintaining its dividend despite taking 'a heavy knock' in its French office furniture business. After allowing for restructuring costs of Pounds 3.32m, pre-tax profits in the year to October 31 fell to Pounds 8.54m from Pounds 20.8m in the previous year when the outcome was boosted by Pounds 994,000 of exceptional items. Mr Robert Steel, managing director, blamed the Pounds 12.3m profits decline on operating losses and restructuring costs in the office products division. Turnover slipped by 5 per cent to Pounds 276.9m (Pounds 292.6m); earnings per share fell to 4.45p (11.55p). As expected the final dividend is being maintained at 4.3p making an unchanged total for the year of 6.05p. Turnover in the core office products division fell 12 per cent to Pounds 104.4m (Pounds 118.8m) and a Pounds 7.82m operating profit turned into a Pounds 736,000 loss. Losses in Atal, the French office furniture company acquired four years ago, accounted for Pounds 5.8m of the decline. Mr Steel said Atal had had an appalling year because of falling demand and pressure on margins. Last autumn a new management team was installed and has introduced a Pounds 2.4m restructuring programme including accelerated job cuts. Among the group's other businesses, seven of the eight small companies in the engineering division increased sales and six increased profits. Overall the division lifted operating profits to Pounds 2.97m (Pounds 2.6m) on turnover which grew to Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 31.2m). Net borrowings at the end of October stood at Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 7.8m), representing 17 per cent (9 per cent) of shareholders funds. Looking ahead, Mr Derrick Battle, chairman, said the order book was slightly ahead of last year and noted that the avoidance of the heavy losses in the French office furniture business 'should lead to a useful recovery in our overall profitability.' COMMENT The problems at Atal, which was acquired for some Pounds 19m in September 1988, should probably have been dealt with earlier and more firmly. But since last autumn a more robust approach to problems at Atal has been adopted and another 200 jobs have been cut. The absence of losses and restructuring costs alone should be sufficient to boost group profits significantly this year, providing there are no other nasty surprises. Cash deposits of Pounds 13.2m should be sufficient for any small 'fill-in' acquisitions without straining the balance sheet. Meanwhile, maintaining the dividend has helped calm investor nerves and since December the shares have begun to climb again. This is a recovery stock with foreign exposure. With pre-tax profits expected to rebound to Pounds 14m or Pounds 15m this year, producing earnings of between 7.2p and 7.8p per share, the stock is trading on a prospective p/e of about 14.7. Accepting the risks, the shares are a buy.</p>

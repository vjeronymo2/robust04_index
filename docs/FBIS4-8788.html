			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 15 (AFP) -- Large-scale military  action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina seems unlikely unless there is another  massive Serb atrocity there, a NATO source said here Friday [15  April].    He was reacting to a series of Serb provocations against the  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia since U.S. warplanes  launched two small attacks on Serb positions outside the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde last Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April].    The public Western response to the Serb provocations has  been  low-key, with diplomatic pressure taking precedence over  military threats.    The NATO source said: "I think there is a mood of caution  and  hesitancy.... My hope is that there will be a cooling-off  period.... We on our part are not going to be doing anything to  escalate the situation."    Insisting on being identified only as a NATO source, he  discounted any quick repetition of a February ultimatum by the  U.S.-led alliance that Serb artillery around Sarajevo would be  bombed unless it was withdrawn.    The source said such action was unlikely unless there was  some atrocity which triggered a "welling up of emotion" on the  scale of the shell which landed on a Sarajevo market-place in  February and killed 66 people.    The atrocity motivated the ultimatum, which is credited with  forcing the Serbs to relax their artillery siege of Sarajevo,  and giving impetus to a new U.S.-Russian thrust towards a peace  settlement in Bosnia which has since stalled.    Any more such ultimatums, or attacks beyond surgical strikes  to protect UN peacekeepers, would need fresh authority from the  UN Security Council and NATO.    Within the UN, Russia is hostile to such an escalation, as  is  Greece within NATO. Both countries have traditional links with  Serbia.    The Russian Foreign Ministry criticised this week's U.S. air  attacks outside Gorazde, saying that they had "considerably  worsened" the chances for peace and objecting that Moscow had  not been consulted first.    Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said in Moscow Friday  that he was against Russia signing up to NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" programme of military cooperation with the former  communist bloc.    NATO had hoped that Moscow would join the partnership this  month, becoming the 15th country to do so since January.    Grachev said "we had the impression that our partners are  acting behind our back" -- a clear expression of anger at the  U.S. air attacks.    Since February, NATO threats in Bosnia have been restricted  to warnings that Serb forces threatening the safety of UN  personnel would be bombed.    The U.S. air attacks on Sunday and Monday, the first  fulfilment of the threat, aimed officially at stopping Serb  shelling of Gorazde, a UN-protected "safe area," because it  placed eight UN peacekeepers there in danger.    They hit a small command post and four vehicles. The Bosnian  Serbs said two male nurses had been killed.    In response, the Bosnian Serbs swooped on scores of UN  peacekeepers around Bosnia, keeping them immobile and virtual  hostages, shooting at some and abducting others.    They stepped up the shelling of Gorazde, fired on other  Moslem areas including the UN-controlled airport at Tuzla, and  tried to seize two UN-guarded weapons stockpiles at Sarajevo.  The western response was low-key.    But at a meeting of NATO ambassadors here Wednesday, "there  wasn't a hint" of a Sarajevo-type ultimatum or military action  beyond carefully-targeted air strikes if UN lives were in  danger, the NATO source said.    He added that the United Nations was relying on a Russian-UN  diplomatic mission rather than public military threats to defuse  the crisis.    Special Russian envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, UN  envoy Yasushi Akashi and UN negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg were  meeting together with the Bosnian Serbs on Friday.</p>

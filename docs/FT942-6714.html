			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Pepper: the world demand and supply situation suggests that pepper prices in general should be expected to increase. Rising coffee and cocoa prices might tempt farmers and dealers in the Far East to concentrate on those commodities rather than pepper which can be stored for a longer period. This might result in a further tightness in supplies. White pepper - a slightly steadier undertone for new crop positions. Spot offered at USDollars 2,650, new crop: July/Oct shipment was traded at Dollars 2,575 cif. Further forward offered at Dollars 2,600. Handpicked quality further forward was unavailable. Black pepper - the on prices from india and Lampong disappeared. Sarawak and Brazil were not competitive sellers. The market is fully steady. India mg1 1675/1700.</p>

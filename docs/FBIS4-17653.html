			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 26 TASS -- Russian leader Boris Yeltsin  should recognise Dzhokhar Dudayev, the head of the self-styled  Chechnya, as the official president of the Caucasian republic  and begin negotiations with him, according to Vladimir Shumeyko,  the speaker of the Federation Council who added that Chechnya  should also display goodwill.    "Certain political goodwill should be displayed not only by  the Russian side. President Dzhokhar Dudayev should recognise  that the Chechen Republic is a subject of the Russian  Federation", Shumeyko said in an interview with the "TRUD"  newspaper on Tuesday.    "As soon as he does it negotiations should immediately  begin", the speaker said.    Dudayev's election as president of Chechnya was annulled by  the former Russian Supreme Soviet. The maverick president  proclaimed independence from Russia, however, now Yeltsin had  authorised to hold talks with the republic and appointed  Nationalities Minister Sergey Shakhray to head the negotiations.    Shakhray believes Chechnya should follow suit of Tatarstan  and sign a share-power deal with Moscow.</p>

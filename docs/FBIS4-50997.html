			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Peter Chen] </F>   [Text] Brisbane, May 23 (CNA) -- Relations between the  Republic of China [ROC] and Australia's opposition Liberal Party  should improve in the long term following a change in the  leadership of the party, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office  (TECO) in Canberra said Monday [23 May].    Alexander Downer, formerly shadow treasurer under the  leadership of John Hewson, on Monday defeated his boss by a vote  of 43 to 36 to become the new leader of the liberals.    At a press conference in Canberra today, the 42-year-old  Downer pledged a fresh start for the oppostion.    "I pledge myself to do everything I can to restore hope and  a  bright future to Australia," he said.    Downer's father was a minister under the late prime minister  Richard Menzies.    TECO Representative Francias Li said both Hewson and Downer  are friendly to the ROC. They both visited Taiwan in March 1991  and were impressed by the progress they saw there, he said.    Li said many of Downer's supporters either have visited  Taiwan or are members of the Australia-Taiwan parliamentary  group in Canberra. The group now has 86 members, next only to  the Australia-U.S. parliamentary group in terms of participation.    Li said the election of Downer to head the Liberal Party was  a positive occurrence for the ROC. "I believe our relations  with the opposition will further improve," he said.</p>

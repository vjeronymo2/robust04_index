			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED CURBS ON LAPD FOUGHT;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: CHIEF GATES ARGUES AGAINST RESTRICTIONS ON WORKING WITH  IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates objected Monday to proposed curbs on  cooperation between police and immigration authorities, saying the restrictions  "would seriously endanger our ability to ensure public safety in the city."  </P> <P> The council's proposal includes limits on cooperation with foreign law  enforcement agencies, which Gates said would affect the department's  Anti-Terrorist Division.  </P> <P> In a letter made public at a meeting of the Council's Public Safety Committee,  Gates also objected to a provision that would bar any police cooperation with  an INS investigation, detention or arrest except in service of a search or  arrest warrant or in cases in which police believe that the suspect has  committed a felony.  </P> <P> "While I understand the committee's concerns as expressed in the proposed  procedures," Gates said, "I believe all residents of Los Angeles are best  served when its Police Department is able to work cooperatively with all  segments of government to provide for the public's safety."  </P> <P> The proposed guidelines would prevent the LAPD from initiating any action on  the basis of an individual's immigration status. Cooperation with any foreign  government's investigation of immigrants would also be prohibited, unless the  immigrant was suspected of having violated federal, state or local laws.  </P> <P> Immigrant rights groups and council members Michael Woo and Richard Alatorre  called for the new guidelines after two recent incidents in which police have  rescued immigrants from the hands of smugglers demanding ransom, only to turn  the hostages over to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service for  deportation.  </P> <P> Alatorre said the proposed policy would help curb what he called a rash of  unreported crimes against immigrants. "Those crimes go unreported for one  simple reason -- people are afraid of being turned over to the INS," Alatorre  said after the meeting.  </P> <P> In response to Gates' objections, Alatorre made minor changes in the wording of  some of the proposed amendments to department policy. Deputy Chief William  Rathburn told the committee that the department had not yet reviewed the  amended proposal.  </P> <P> To give the Police Department time to respond to the amendments, the committee  then forwarded the proposed policy to the full council without recommendation.  The council is expected to consider the measure in a week or two, Alatorre  said.  </P> <P> Alatorre said Monday he expected some council members to oppose the measure. He  said he would meet with LAPD Assistant Chief Robert Vernon this week in an  attempt to reach a compromise on the issue.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE BEAT;  </P> <P> SMALL GROUPS SEEK PIECE OF PIE  </P> <P> California dancers are fighting for sweeping changes that would give smaller  companies a bigger piece of the pie from the California Arts Council, according  to Tom Corcoran, executive director of the San Diego Area Dance Alliance.  </P> <P> "They need another system, since the present one is geared to larger companies  and presenters," he said. "It calls for a first-come, first-served basis, but  the big companies plan so far ahead, the smaller ones can never get any of the  grants. A large coalition of dance companies and other presenters are actively  lobbying for these changes now.  </P> <P> "We also want more California artists to be funded," Corcoran said, adding that  the council "should have some concept that promotes California companies. At  many levels, people are frustrated. Why help New Yorkers?"  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian is another target of the California dance community,  Corcoran said.  </P> <P> "For years and years, Gov. Deukmejian has reduced the arts council's budget. If  we had stayed with what Gov. Brown had given us, we'd be way ahead of  everyone," he said. "Now we're only 34th in the country. That's terrible."  </P> <P> Kodo was just what the doctor ordered for the San Diego Foundation for the  Performing Arts. Not only did the Japanese drummers turn out to be the biggest  box-office attraction of the season for the foundation, they gave its  fund-raising campaign a giant shot in the arm.  </P> <P> The opening-night gala, which attracted about 225 supporters, brought in  $91,000 for the evening, netting the organization $66,000. Even more  significant, as president Danah Fayman noted, was the influx of new money.  </P> <P> "The fact that we had several new major underwriters for the gala is  indicative, I feel, of the community's desire to help us in our time of  financial need."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, as Fayman pointed out earlier, filling seats, not just finding  sponsors, is the name of the game,  </P> <P> "Raising money is not the problem. We've already raised almost $300,000, and  that might be enough to assure a new season. But I don't like all the money to  come from contributed income," she said. "You have to sell tickets, or you  shouldn't be accepting all that money. All we sold for the Batsheva Dance  Company was 35%."  </P> <P> Does that mean the foundation's future is still in jeopardy?  </P> <P> "No, we're still working hard, and I'm not pessimistic about the future,"  Fayman said. "The foundation did what it had to do by cutting back. We'll still  have David Gordon" in May, "and we're trying to figure out new things now and  where to put them. We're looking into other venues for next year."  </P> <P> A contingent of dancers from Three's Company recently returned from a concert  date in Las Vegas, and, according to artistic director Jean Isaacs, everything  is coming up roses for the 15-year-old modern dance troupe.  </P> <P> "We had a sold-out house, and we even had to turn away about 100 people when we  performed at the university. The Las Vegas Gas &amp; Electric Co. sponsored the  concert, and it really went extremely well," she said.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of good stuff lined up, too," Isaacs said. During a visit to San  Francisco for a concert April 5-8, she and John Malashock will teach a class.  "We've hired a booking lady (a first for the troupe), and she's really helping  us a lot. And we're going to New York in May, so things are really working out  well for us."  </P> <P> Kristen Wielandt, a 16-year-old soloist with the American Ballet Ensemble, was  spotted by the second company of the Boston Ballet. The young dancer will join  the 15-member group during the 1989-90 season when it tours New England on its  own and performs in major productions with the Boston Ballet.  </P> <P> Three other ABE students are headed to Boston this summer. Natalie Cook,  Christopher MacDougall and Jonathan Chait were accepted into the Boston  Ballet's summer program. Four of the six scholarships offered by the  Pennsylvania Ballet summer school were snared by ABE.  </P></p>

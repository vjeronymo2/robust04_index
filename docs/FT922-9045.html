			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Books: Never look back ORPHEUS WITH HIS LUTE by Elisabeth Henry Bristol Classical Press (Duckworth) Pounds 30, 227 pages THE BYWAYS of literature, like those of a city, can lead wanderers to unexpected delights. Elisabeth Henry's book exemplifies this. In equal parts charming and fascinating, it sets out to explore the Orpheus myth, and in the process ranges with marvellous ease across time and the breadth of our culture. We move in the company of Aristotle and Appolonius Rhodius, Virgil and Monteverdi, Milton and Keats; we discuss Plato's views on the soul's immortality, and Harrison's recently staged Trackers of Oxyrhynchus. We explore the psychological effects of music; we witness conflicts between classicism and romanticism; we ponder sexual love, religion and mysticism. This is a rich mixture, but so lightly confected and elegantly served as to be irresistible. It is not surprising that a book on Orpheus should range widely. The story touches so many nerves that it is hard to find a single area of human creativity unaffected by it. It is like the note which, when struck, sets all the strings of the orchestra thrilling in response. At school, reading Virgil's Georgics, we learned that the beekeeper Aristaeus pursued Eurydice, who stepped on a venomous serpent as she fled. Aristaeus's bees died, and when he consulted the reluctant and metamorphic seer, Proteus, to find out why, he learned that it was punishment for Eurydice's death and its still more tragic sequel. For Eurydice was Orpheus's betrothed, and when she died he sought her in Hades, employing his potent music to charm its rulers. They agreed to let him take Eurydice back, provided he did not look at her until they attained the light. But he did look; and lost her again, this time for ever. He wandered the country in an agony of grief, playing music of indescribable beauty and sorrow. His music tamed savage beasts, who came and mourned at his side; and clifftops and huge oaks uprooted themselves to follow him. But female votaries of Dionysus, drunk and inflamed in their revels, angry that he refused their invitations to sport with them, one night attacked him and tore him to pieces. Virgil says that as his head floated down winding rivers to the coast of Lesbos his deathless tongue cried, 'Eurydice, Eurydice]' Much has been made of Orpheus's fatal backward glance. Leighton's painting of the moment, with Eurydice imploring Orpheus's gaze, inspired the eroticism of Browning's verse: 'But give them me, the mouth, the eyes, the brow]/ Let them once more absorb me] One look now/ Will wrap me round for ever.' In Monteverdi's opera, as in Ovid, it is not Eurydice's importunity but Orpheus's anxiety that prompts his disobedience to the gods; he turns because he is afraid she has weakened or fallen. But the backward glance has been emphasised chiefly by Romanticism, shallower than its rival tradition. It is notable that Eusebius, writing in the fourth century, depicts Orpheus as subduing the powers of hell with his mastery; but Poliziano, in 15th-century troubadour style, has him begging Persephone to 'pity a poor lover.' Eusebius invokes a majestic Orphic theme: the power of music, which can heal and charm, reveal truths, put man in communion with the divine. Orpheus is the type of many spell-binding musicians, like the Pied Piper and Mozart's magic flautist. He is kin to David the psalmist; it says in 1 Samuel, 'when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took an harp, and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed.' Shamans also used music to control spirits and visit the Beyond. This illustrates music's connection with religion and inspiration. Orpheus's 'katabasis', his journey to and from the underworld, is the paradigm for many tales of heroes, gods and poets, from Odysseus and Heracles to Christ and Dante. But Orpheus's journey is truly central: for it underlies the belief in immortality crucial to Plato's philosophy, and which, by way of Neoplatonism, entered Christianity. For centuries Christians had no belief in a soul but anticipated bodily resurrection on earth at the Second Coming. With this delayed sine die, Christianity imported Orphic concepts of an immortal soul and judgment in the afterlife. These and a dozen other themes of extraordinary fascination for anyone interested in literature, psychoanalysis, poetry, philosophy and religion crowd Henry's pages most readably. After each chapter she asks, what is a poet? Here is my only reservation: her poet is too Dionysian for me, too frenzied and uncontrolled. It is odd that she should infer this from the Orpheus story; for he, said by some to be Apollo's son, was destroyed by Apollo's enemy; the classic overthrown by the romantic. Yet when Orpheus, priest of poets, went through hell, he seems to me to have kept, on the whole, a classically very clear head.</p>

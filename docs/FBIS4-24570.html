			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The international  community should take a positive approach in handling the  relationship between trade and the environment, a Chinese  delegate told the U.N. Commission on Sustainable Development.    Zhang Kunmin, head of the Chinese delegation, made these  remarks while addressing high-level members of the commission on  Thursday [26 May].    He said that trade policy measures for environmental  purposes  should not be turned into means towards unjust discrimination or  limitations on international trade.    He added that any environmental measures aimed at solving  cross- boundary and global environmental issues should be based  on international consensus.    The commission, a watchdog body set up to monitor progress  after the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development--known  as the Earth Summit--held its second session on May 16-27.    The Chinese delegate called attention to the following  points  in taking a positive approach toward the question of trade and  the environment.    First, development and trade and environmental protection  should be made to promote and compliment each other instead of  being antagonistic.    In handling the relationship between trade and the  environment, a long-range, positive approach should be followed,  and efforts should be made in both fields. Any unbalanced  approach which would hurt one or the other should be avoided.    Second, the focal point should be on measures benefiting the  greatest number of people, he said.    Since only a limited number of countries possess advanced  and  environmentally sound technologies and products and the  financial ability to popularize them, efforts should be made to  ensure that mankind can benefit from them through open,  nondiscriminatory and equitable international trade, and through  technology transfer and cooperation.    He urged particular efforts against trends based on narrow  business interest considerations, and those unjustly harmful to  the trade opportunities of developing countries.    Finally, he said, emphasis should be placed on assistance  and  support.    To combine trade with sustainable development, corresponding  means and abilities are needed, particularly financial and  technological resources.    He urged the international community to help developing  states build and improve their abilities through real action,  including financial support, technology transfer and the opening  of markets.    The Chinese delegate called on the international community  to  carry out the commitments made at the Earth Summit as soon as  possible and as effectively as possible.    Zhang said he expects the commission's deliberations on  trade  and the environment to have a positive impact on the relevant  discussions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and  the U.N. Conference On trade and Development.</p>

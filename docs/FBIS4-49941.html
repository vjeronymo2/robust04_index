			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The  "Provisional Regulations Governing Registration of Futures  Brokerage Firms" promulgated by the PRC State Administration for  Industry and Commerce, were put into force beginning 28 April.  These are the first regulations ever enacted in mainland China  to govern the operation and management of futures markets.    The "Provisional Regulations" set out the following basic  requirements for futures brokerage firms: A futures brokerage  firm is to: 1) Have capital of more than 10 million yuan; 2) Be  equipped with qualified telecommunications facilities; and 3)  Employ no less than 20 full-time futures brokers.    The "Provisional Regulations" also set out the following  behavioral standards for futures brokerage firms: A futures  brokerage firm is to provide objective, accurate, prompt, and  highly efficient services; for the protection of its customers,  it is to set up a guarantee fund account at a financial  institution designated by the futures brokerage registration  agency, and is to deposit in this account a sum not less than 25  percent of the firm's registered capital; is not to collaborate  secretly with other futures brokerage firms in any attempt to  monopolize the market, or to secretly offset possible losses; is  not to fabricate and spread false information or information  that may easily be misinterpreted, with a view to misleading the  public; and is not to misappropriate customers' funds and hire  non-brokers to share customers' profits or risks.    The regulations also provide that industry and commerce  administration agencies are entitled to take actions against  those brokerage firms that violate the regulations. According  to the seriousness of specific cases, such actions include  warnings, confiscation of ill-gotten gains, and revocation of  brokerage firm licenses. Cases involving criminal violations  are to be handed over to judicial organs in due course for  further proceedings.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Avesta upgrades profits forecast Avesta Sheffield, the Swedish-British stainless steel group, has revised upwards its profits forecast for 1994, on the strength of rising sales prices for stainless steel. Avesta, 40 per cent-owned by British Steel, returned a SKr111m (Dollars 14.2m) profit after financial items in the first quarter of this year, on sales of SKr3.98bn. It said at the time it expected that level of profit-ability would be maintained for the whole year. The group says the return will be 'significantly better' if current market trends continue. Avesta Sheffield, formed in 1992 through a merger between Sweden's Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British Steel, showed a loss in 1993 of SKr98m. Volvo has sold a data company specialising in airline crew timetable calculation to Ad Opt Technologies of Canada for USDollars 3m. The sale is part of the Swedish group's strategy of divesting all its interests not related to core vehicle manufacturing operations. Merged, Ad Opt, owned by Canadian institutional investors, and Volvo's Carmen Systems will become a leading specialist in aviation and transport time-tabling, Volvo said. Carmen's clients include Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), Lufthansa and Alitalia. Ad Opt has concentrated to date on aircraft scheduling in the North American market.</p>

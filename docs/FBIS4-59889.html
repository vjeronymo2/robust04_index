The HA'ARETZ correspondent has learned from sources in Tunis  that 'Arafat decided to appoint General Misbah Saqr, an  inhabitant of al-Shaja'iyah in the Gaza Strip, as head of the  security services in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.    According to Palestinian sources, 'Arafat chose Saqr, a  close  confidant, as Dahlan's and al-Rujub's superior because of their  close ties with Israeli security elements.

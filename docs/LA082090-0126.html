			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HOOF MOISTURIZERS JOIN UDDER CREAMS AS BEAUTY AIDS  </P> <P> Question: I've been amused by your columns about people using udder creams as  elegant beauty aids. I run a feed and garden store, and many of our female  customers love these products. We always keep them in stock because the demand  is so great.  </P> <P> Were you aware that hoof moisturizers are also becoming popular? The horsewomen  in our area discovered that when they used their hands to apply such products  to their horses' hoofs, their own fingernails seemed harder and stronger.  </P> <P> We sell both Purina Hoof Moisturizer and Hoof Maker from Straight Arrow Co.  About 80% of our sales are to women who don't usually shop in a feed store.  </P> <P> Answer: Special thanks to Jack Haire and Glen Grant of Willowbrook Feed &amp;  Garden for alerting us to the popularity of hoof moisturizers for strengthening  human nails. We have no data to back up the claim that such animal "cosmetics"  are helpful for people. Ingredients like lanolin, beeswax, mineral oil and  coconut oil certainly should help brittle, dry nails, however.  </P> <P> For our readers who don't have access to agricultural supply stores, the Purina  customer service number is (800) 227-8941. The Straight Arrow Co. can be  contacted at (800) 827-9815.  </P> <P> Q. How safe is niacin to lower cholesterol? My son-in-law couldn't seem to get  his triglycerides and cholesterol under control until he started taking niacin  in large doses.  </P> <P> When I tried it, niacin made me extremely uncomfortable. The flush and prickly  feeling is almost unbearable. He claims he doesn't experience any side effects  from his niacin.  </P> <P> A. Some people are more susceptible to the niacin flush than others. Taking the  supplement at meals may help reduce the discomfort. Some doctors also recommend  an aspirin half an hour before taking niacin.  </P> <P> But the chances are that your son-in-law is taking a timed-release pill.  Although such formulas are far less likely to cause the niacin flush, there are  growing concerns that these products may be more toxic to the liver than  regular crystalline niacin.  </P> <P> Niacin is definitely not appropriate for do-it-yourself cholesterol control.  Consult with your doctor.  </P></p>

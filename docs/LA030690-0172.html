			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AOKI/WESTIN TO BUY SWISSOTEL  </P> <P> Swissair, the national airline of Switzerland, today announced the sale of its  worldwide Swissotel hotel operations to the giant Aoki/Westin group of Japan.  </P> <P> The price was not disclosed pending final agreement.  </P> <P> Swissotel fully owns or has a major stake in 12 luxury hotels including four in  the United States -- the Drake in New York, the Lafayette in Boston, the Swiss  Grand in Chicago and the Swiss Grand in Atlanta.  </P> <P> Swissotel, which has a total of 3,130 employees, also manages five other  leading hotels.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Swissair said the sale will become final as soon as smaller  shareholders in some of the hotels approve the transaction.  </P> <P> "It was decided to seek a buyer because Swissotel failed to reach the total of  30 or so hotels which were seen necessary to make operations profitable," the  spokesman said. "Aoki/Westin was chosen because it will give Swissair access to  nearly 100 top hotels around the world."  </P></p>

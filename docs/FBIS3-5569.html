The board demanded  disciplinary actions or warning against the public officials  involved. A board official said his board made a budgetary  inspection of the Economic Planning Board and 59 other  government offices for five days beginning last Dec. 20.    "The check showed a number of offices squandered unused  budgets in the year-end period or used them for purposes other  than they were intended for," he said. The Health and Social  Affairs Ministry, for instance, obtained 174 million won for use  in distoma programs reasoning the money was needed in treating  distoma patients, the number of whom it estimated at 50,000 in  1993. The Ministry gave the estimate despite the fact that those  stricken by distoma numbered no more than 7,900 to 14,000 a year  in the 1990-92 period. The ministry used only 31 million won in  distoma programs and diverted the remaining 143 million won to  other purposes such as staffs' welfare programs.    In another incident, the Pusan police agency wasted 30  million won by purchasing additional color films although there  was a sufficient stock of them, he said. The official said  unused budgetary funds were believed to reach 1189.6 billion won  in 1993.</p>

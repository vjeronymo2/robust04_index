Emerging from an expanded summit  meeting in the Japanese capital, the two leaders said that while  the nuclear issue affects security in the entire Northeast Asian  region, they had agreed to keep the door open for a peaceful  solution through dialogue.    Hosokawa, asked what actions his country would take in case  the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea,  said he preferred not to go into detail.    The South Korean president came to Tokyo Thursday on a state  visit. He held a private summit with Hosokawa on the day of his  arrival.    Saturday's meeting was joined by aides and accompanying  cabinet ministers.    "South Korea and Japan agreed to consult closely with the  United States and China, to do our best to solve the nuclear  problem," Kim said at a press conference.    He heads for Beijing via Shanghai later in the afternoon,  where seeking Chinese support in resolving the nuclear issue is  his key task. "The one thing that's clear is that China, too,  is absolutely against North Korea possessing nuclear weapons,"  said Kim.    "North Korea's nuclear development is a subject of the  greatest security concern," Hosokawa said. "It's important for  the international community to deal with North Korea in a  concerted, firm way. But we also agreed that it's important to  keep the window open to dialogue."    He declined to go into specifics on how Japan might  participate in U.N. sanctions, "because they are not under  discussion at the Security Council as of now."    Asked about the Japanese stance on South Korea's bid for a  non-permanent seat at the Security Council, Hosokawa said he is  studying the matter carefully.    On bilateral issues, Kim said the two countries will  cooperate closely in dealing with any new trade negotiations.  In tackling the trade imbalance between the two countries, he  called for enlargement of their trade relations as a solution.</p>

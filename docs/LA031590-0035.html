			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> PANEL OKS PLAN TO 'PRE-ZONE' U.S. LAND  </P> <P> The Port Hueneme Planning Commission has approved a proposal that would  pre-zone federal property within the city, which may be used for private or  public development.  </P> <P> The move was spurred by the Department of Community Development in an attempt  to pre-zone land occupied by the U.S. Naval Construction Battalion Center,  which covers 1,630 acres -- about 57% of the city -- to ensure that lands  disposed of as excess property by the government become automatically subject  to the city's land-use and zoning powers.  </P> <P> "With the events unfolding in Europe bringing a heightened possibility of that  land being 'excessed' by the Navy, it's prudent for us to put an overlay  holding zone over all federal properties so we have land-use authority --  that's all we're trying to do," Director of Community Development Tom Figg  said.  </P> <P> Facilities at the base range from environmental departments to research and  development areas, according to Assistant Planner Greg Brown, who said there  currently is no zoning for that portion of the city.  </P> <P> "About half of the base is under-utilized and it may be hard for the Navy to  justify keeping it in the future," Brown said.  </P> <P> The City Council will review the commission's recommendations at its March 21  meeting, before sending the proposal to the Coastal Commission for final  review.

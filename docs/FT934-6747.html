			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Rival market gives Bombay impetus to reform - India is to get a new stock exchange that will end a 128-year-old monopoly The Bombay stock exchange, India's largest share market, is bracing itself for competition. Its 128-year-old monopoly of stock trading in Bombay will end with the opening next year of a high-technology National Stock Exchange. The NSE plans to start by trading bonds, but intends to go into equities, the core of the BSE's business, by the autumn of 1994. The new exchange's official purpose is to develop markets in government and corporate bonds, which are still in their infancy in India. But the real intent of the government's finance ministry, which is backing the NSE, is to force the BSE to overhaul its antiquated procedures and abuse-prone practices. As Mr RH Patil, the NSE's managing director, says: 'The BSE brokers are very worried about us. Part of our aim will be met if other exchanges change and reform their markets.' Bombay brokers retort they are not scared of competition. Clients who have used the exchange for years are not likely to desert overnight, they claim. They say the BSE is busy on reforms to increase transparency and investor protection under the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the newly-created markets' watchdog. Brokers do admit the NSE's formation has given the BSE a new impetus to reform. Mr GB Desai, BSE president, says: 'The authorities have a bad impression of the BSE. We must change our way of working. We are changing and will be ready by the time the NSE starts trading equities.' Mr Desai says the BSE's reputation for tolerating unfair or dishonest practices has been created largely by the publicity given to a handful of scandals, such as last year's affair involving Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker who allegedly illegally diverted funds from banks into the market. Indian companies have this year been raising record amounts in new issues; new investors, including foreign financial institutions, have been active on the exchange. 'Business is pouring into the BSE,' says Mr Desai. 'If we worked only for the benefit of the brokers, would this business have come to us?' Until now, clients have had little choice, since the Bombay exchange faced competition only from smaller local exchanges in cities including Delhi, Calcutta and Madras. The NSE will be a different matter. The NSE is being established at a cost of about Dollars 6m by the government-owned financial institutions which dominate the shareholders' registers under the leadership of the Industrial Development Bank of India, a development bank. Starting in April, the NSE will trade bonds issued by the Indian government, by public sector enterprises and by private sector companies. Secondary trading in these instruments is now limited to an informal inter-bank market. Most paper is held by banks and other institutions from issue to maturity, so little trading takes place. NSE officials hope the new exchange will encourage trading, so promoting liquidity and greater efficiency in India's debt markets. The initial members will be about 20 banks and other financial institutions, which will operate as primary dealers. Membership for the NSE's equity market will be wider and will include stockbrokers. Unlike the BSE, where trading takes place mainly on a trading floor, the NSE will be screen-based. Its main computers will be connected to terminals in members' offices in Bombay and - via satellite - in other cities across India. Mr Patil says the satellite links will make the NSE India's first national financial market. The BSE hopes to have its own computer-controlled screen-based price quotation system by June, albeit for a limited number of heavily-traded shares. Trading in all actively-traded stocks is to be computerised by March 1995. Screen-based price-setting will not revolutionise stock trading in India unless settlement procedures are modernised. One problem - for the BSE and the NSE - is that transactions are completed by the physical transfer of securities via the broker. Financial institutions have a computerised depositary for shares, but its operation is limited to a handful of institutions. Mr Patil says that larger brokers on the BSE see the benefits of a transparent and efficient computerised system and will gravitate towards the NSE. Mr Desai believes the BSE will modernise in time to retain its grip on business. 'We plan to remain the largest exchange in India,' he says.</p>

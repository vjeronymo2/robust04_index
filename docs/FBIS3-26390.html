Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Zou  Zhekai, vice-president and secretary general of ARATS, held  meetings with Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general  of SEF, in Beijing on February 1-4.    After four days of discussions, they reached understandings  on many important issues.    First, both sides feel that they have reached understanding  on three issues of routine affairs, namely, the repatriation of  hijackers, the treatment of maritime fishing disputes and the  issue of sending back other personnel who cross the straits in  violation of relevant regulations.    They said that this has laid a good foundation for the  fourth  working meeting between the two organizations to be held soon  and the signing of a written agreement.    Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth working meeting on  the three issues in late March in Beijing, at which a draft  agreement will be decided upon between the two bodies.    Chiao Jen-ho hoped that Tang Shubei and his counterparts  with  ARATS will proceed to sign a formal agreement on the basis of  the draft in Taipei.    Second, also during the March meeting, the two bodies will  discuss other unfinished issues included in the agreement  reached between ARATS President Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo  Chen-fu last year. The issues will include the protection of  intellectual property rights on the two sides across the Taiwan  Straits, contacts and mutual aid between courts on the two sides  across the Taiwan Straits and joint operations against maritime  smuggling, robbery and other criminal activities. Besides, they  will formally discuss issues of economic exchange and cultural,  educational, scientific and technological exchanges.    Third, Tang Shubei presented a letter to Chiao on behalf of  ARATS President Wang Daohan to invite SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu  to meet on the Mainland.    Chiao Jen-ho said he would actively create conditions for  the  meeting between Wang and Koo. The time and venue of the  Wang-Koo meeting will be discussed at the March meeting.    Fourth, the two sides agreed to work together to properly  handle inherited property of those who left the mainland before  the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.    During the meeting this afternoon, they agreed to publish a  joint news release about their achievements. Each side has  designated a vice secretary general to be in charge of the  drafting of the news bulletin, which will be issued tomorrow.    The discussions were fruitful and lived up to the  expectations of the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits,  Tang Shubei said at a press conference after the meeting.    During the four days of discussions, each side deepened its  trust of the other and had a better understanding of the other's  viewpoints, Tang said.    The results of the talks proved once again that high-level  exchanges were very important, Tang said. Such exchanges can  deepen trust on a higher level and solve differences which are  not problems they appear to be, he said.</p>

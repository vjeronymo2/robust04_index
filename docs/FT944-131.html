			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Names might wonder at such crystal gazing Sir, Please forgive what might appear to be an unseasonally cynical observation, but I always wince when I hear so-called insurance experts talk blithely about underwriters only writing profitable business. In your edition of December 22, Lex refers to '. . . the temptation for Lloyd's underwriters to take on poor quality business'; in an adjoining column, Lloyd's chairman David Rowland is quoted ('Names win in court as Lloyd's unveils fall in capacity') as saying: 'Lloyd's underwriters are still being selective in the business that they write. Present market conditions indicate that there are good opportunities for underwriting profitable business in 1995.' If these visionaries know what constitutes 'profitable underwriting' and 'poor quality business' then perhaps luckless Lloyd's Names might rightly wonder what happened to the underwriters' crystal balls in recent years. Having recently moved into the area whence this letter hails, Mr Rowland will soon find there are many here in horse-racing country who claim only to back winners] N J F B Samengo-Turner, Coltsfoot Cottage, Wickhambrook, Newmarket, Suffolk CB8 8UW</p>

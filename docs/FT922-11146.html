			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: Vietnam lacks the power to lure investors  -Electricity shortages top list of foreign companies' complaints FOREIGN companies seeking to profit from Vietnam's economic reforms are beginning to place electricity shortages at the top of their list of complaints that already includes bureaucracy, corruption, an economic embargo by the US and a rudimentary legal system. In the south, where the dry season is coming to a close and hydroelectric plants are running out of water, businesses have to survive four days or more a week without power from the local electricity grid. Vietnamese officials are aware of the impact the power shortage is having on their efforts to attract more foreign capital, particularly since four-fifths of planned investment in Vietnam is in the more entrepreneurial south. 'Lots of companies come to the south but have no power,' said Mr Pham Dac Duyen, deputy director of the state committee for Co-operation and Investment in Ho Chi Minh City. Short-stay visitors might not notice. Hotels are allowed electricity all day, every day, although the Saigon Times weekly magazine reported recently that there appeared to be no legal basis for this privilege. 'How to get priority for electric power supply is a secret only we know,' it quoted a hotel manager as saying, 'so do not put it in your paper.' The magazine reported that 160,000 workers had been laid off in Ho Chi Minh City and said some companies, including a paper mill and a plastics factory, had failed to meet their orders on time. Mr Nguyen Duy Le of the local branch of Vietnam's Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 'It's keeping foreign investors away.' Both the government and the private sector have adopted stop-gap measures. The authorities are negotiating to buy gas turbines and renovate ageing thermal power stations, and small companies are resorting to imported second-hand generators. 'There's enough loose cash around for people to buy a generator and run a factory of 40 people,' said one banker in Ho Chi Minh City, boasting that he bought a powerful but noisy machine for a mere Dollars 2,000. A Taiwanese joint venture constructing Vietnam's first export-processing zone is said to be considering the purchase of a decommissioned power plant from China through a Hong Kong company. In an attempt to end the power rationing in the longer term, the Hanoi government started construction this month of a 1,414km, 500kV power line to take surplus electricity from the north down the narrow backbone of central Vietnam to the south. The Dollars 300m line is supposed to be completed by the end of next year, although Vietnamese officials say privately that the end of 1994 is a more realistic target. Another big project is the proposed construction of a Dollars 300m gas pipeline from the southern offshore White Tiger oilfield to the coast by a joint venture between PetroVietnam, the state oil company, and Canadian partners Liquigaz and SNC-Lavalin. The gas from the oilfield, now flared and wasted, would be used to supply power stations in the south. Both the electricity line and the gas pipeline need foreign finance, which is difficult to secure while Vietnam remains in arrears on debt repayments, and while the US maintains its economic embargo and vetoes the disbursement of funds by multilateral financial institutions. Even in the north, where electricity generating capacity far exceeds demand, an unreliable distribution system can play havoc with machinery, computers and air conditioning. 'In the north, we have one advantage the south doesn't have,' said Dr Luu Bich Ho, economist at the State Planning Committee in Hanoi, in an interview. 'The electricity is available all day, except in special cases.' A couple of minutes later, the lights went out.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia shows strength in a weak region INDEX-LINKED selling by investment trusts depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average closed lower in spite of a late bout of arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 15.35 down at 16,864.25 after a day's high of 16,922.75 and low of 16,796.53. The index fell in the morning on lingering concern over weaker than expected corporate profits, but recouped some of its loss in afternoon trading. Volume picked up to 220m shares from 194m and declines finally led advances by 584 to 377, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks eased by a marginal 0.43 to 1,275.82, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.38 to 1,026.00. In spite of the fall in the leading index, traders said sentiment was firm. Public funds were seen placing buying orders around the 16,500 level, and continued strength in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, usually seen as a market benchmark, provided some optimism. NTT gained Y15,000 at Y646,000 in heavy trading, with 38,618 shares changing hands, the heaviest since March 1991. The issue has advanced due to anticipation of a rise in city call rates, which is expected to improve earnings. Reports last week that the government will focus its new economic stimulus package on upgrading the country's telecommunication infrastructure also prompted dealer buying. Telecommunications engineering companies with close ties to NTT strengthened. Daimei Telecom Engineering, which installs telecom wires for NTT, climbed Y23 to Y685, while Nippon Comsys moved ahead Y26 to Y727 and Kyowa Exeo Y34 to Y859. Cable companies were firm, with Fujikura rising Y11 to Y569 and Hitachi Cable Y2 to Y644. Tokyo Steel, the electric furnace steel maker which declined on Monday following a downward earnings revision by Nomura Research Institute, rebounded Y80 to Y2,210 on bargain hunting. Toyobo, a leading textile manufacturer, shed Y9 to Y318 on reports that it would close its cotton-spinning plants temporarily due to sluggish demand. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 59.66 to 17,896.82 in volume of 63.7m shares. Liquidation of margin positions pushed the index below the 18,000 level for the first time since January 27. In Singapore, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange said trading of the Nikkei 225 futures last month surged 2.45 times from the previous year to 283,118 contracts due to firm interest from Japanese fund managers. Roundup WITH THE exception of Australia the region weakened yesterday. AUSTRALIA continued to climb, adding to Monday's substantial gains. The All Ordinaries index put on 5.8 at 1,645.0 in turnover of ADollars 377.6m. Good earnings results and the prospects of an interest rate cut contributed to the strength of the market. Among the banks, ANZ advanced 6 cents to ADollars 3.50 with 8.1m shares changing hands, Westpac firmed 3 cents to ADollars 3.22 and Commonwealth appreciated 12 cents to ADollars 7.02. HONG KONG began to decline at the opening on reports in the Chinese press that Li Peng, the Chinese premier, will make a strong attack on Hong Kong governor Mr Chris Patten in his report to the country's parliament this month. The Hang Seng index lost 54.59 at 6,344.23, after reaching a low for the day of 6,340.50 in the afternoon, in turnover of HKDollars 3.5bn. Mr Patten said diplomatic exchanges were still taking place and that he would make an important statement this week 'which will set out the way ahead'. Some property stocks, which made sharp gains on Monday, fell back: Cheung Kong receded 30 cents to HKDollars 22.20. HSBC fell 50 cents to HKDollars 64.50. TAIWAN declined on profit-taking and the weighted index closed 172.60, or 3.8 per cent, lower at 4,344.99. Turnover was a heavy TDollars 93bn, its highest since May 1991. Financials, which have led the recent equity rally, were particularly hard hit. However, some brokers said that in spite of yesterday's weakness, the medium-term outlook remained optimistic because of an improving economic and political situation. SINGAPORE extended its falls as investors continued to take profits. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 6.09 to 1,652.81 in volume down to 123m shares from 166m. SEOUL lost ground for the fifth straight trading day but volume was said to be thin. The composite index dipped 9.23 to 633.73 in turnover of Won234.3bn. MANILA retreated further, with the composite index giving up 20.44 to 1,473.95 in turnover down to 163m pesos from 196m pesos. PLDT surrendered 15 pesos to 965 pesos.</p>

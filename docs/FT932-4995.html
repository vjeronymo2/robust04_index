			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Knife-edge finish in Spanish poll: Exit results suggest Gonzalez may scrape back into government THE CLOSEST general election in Spain since it became a democracy in 1978 ended last night with early exit polls suggesting that Mr Felipe Gonzalez might have done just enough to secure a fourth term in spite of a dramatic collapse in support for the socialist party. Two polls published as soon as voting ended at 8 pm gave the Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) of Mr Gonzalez a slightly larger share of the vote and a handful more seats in the 350-seat Congress (lower house). But a third poll gave the conservative People's Party a slight edge in seats, even though it saw the PSOE winning more votes. The PP last night said it believed it had won the elections. 'This will be a long night,' said Mr Javier Arenas, leader of the party in Andalucia. 'I think a new stage is opening in the history of Spanish democracy,' Mr Jose Mara Aznar told private Cope radio. Mr Teofilo Serrano, a Socialist spokesman, said after the first polls that the situation was 'complicated'. 'We are going to have to wait until all the votes are counted,' he said. Voter turnout was about 75 per cent, compared with 69 per cent in the 1989 elections. The Socialist party said its own poll showed it had won the most votes, but some analysts were warning last night that the PP might still finish ahead of the socialists in the number of seats won, even though it might win fewer votes. The inability of the polls to be precise is a measure of how close the vote was expected to be as counting continued into the night. The PP was poised to take a number of key marginal seats away from the government, but those would depend on just a few hundred votes. Because Spain's electoral system gives greater weight to rural provinces - which tend to vote conservatively - the PP might win more seats in parliament although it has a smaller percentage of the popular vote. Seats are allocated according to the percentage of the vote that a party wins in each of Spain's 52 provinces. A minute after the polls closed, Spanish television said the socialists, with 175 seats in the last parliament, might have won between 139 and 155 seats, with the PP taking between 134 and 148 seats. Antena 3 television said the socialists appeared to have won up to 157 seats while the PP may have taken up to 154. It was clear even from last night's early results that whoever won would be forced to seek partners among the regional parties to form a coalition or at least to reach long-term agreements under which those regional parties, particularly in the Basque country and Catalonia, would support a minority government. The campaign, in which Mr Gonzalez had fought to remain in office against a background of economic recession and accusations of corruption, was bitter and ill-tempered. Last night's election brought a dramatic change to Spanish politics, which have been dominated by single-party governments since the first democratic election after the death of the dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. The victory may signal a rejection of the centre-right PP, which for some Spaniards harks back to Franco's days. The party's performance establishes its leader Mr Aznar as the nation's first conservative politician for a decade to seriously challenge the leadership of the country.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Competition and Gatt A TRAVELLER caught in a quagmire should, from time to time, look towards the final destination. Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the Commission of the European Communities is to be congratulated, therefore, for discussing the agenda of the next Gatt round in his speech to the World Economic Forum. He is to be congratulated still more for being right. International competition must, indeed, be one of the items on that agenda. But first, the Uruguay Round must be completed and the liberal competition policy of the EC safeguarded. The original design of the still-born International Trade Organisation did, in fact, include a section on restrictive business practices. But two subsequent developments have made global competition policy a still higher priority than it was 40 years ago: because traditional trade barriers are lower, international competition is increasingly important in determining competition in domestic markets; in addition, regulatory trade measures (anti-dumping duties, for example), though aimed at preventing harmful competition, have themselves become barriers to trade. The Gatt already allows countries to impose countervailing duties against subsidies and anti-dumping duties on dumped exports. On subsidies, therefore, Sir Leon argues that 'the most sensible thing to do would be to improve the coverage and enforcement mechanisms which the Gatt system brings to bear.' Anti-dumping is a more vexed issue. Sir Leon accepts that 'unfair trade is a cancer'. But he also asserts that 'anti-dumping might be compared to chemotherapy - a desperate and damaging remedy. Our aim - through competition policy - must be to cure the cancer itself before it takes hold.' Common framework How is this to be done when a fully fledged global competition authority is inconceivable? The Gatt's normal approach is agreement on a common framework for domestic legislation, alongside a right of appeal to the Gatt, appeals being focused on whether a given government is enforcing the agreed framework in good faith. In the case of cartels, Sir Leon suggests that the international rule would distinguish 'between acceptable industrial co-operation and unacceptable restrictive practices . . . . A simple rule . . . that restrictive practices and cartels thus defined are not enforceable at law would constitute considerable progress.' Sir Leon also suggests 'common rules on the appraisal of mergers' and international panels to 'provide firstly a forum for discussion of merger cases which involve several jurisdictions and secondly an impartial analysis of the merits of a particular case and which authority is best placed to deal with it.' Bold ideas These ideas are both bold and visionary. But first those quagmires need to be crossed. Without the Multilateral Trade Organisation's unified and improved dispute settlement procedure - as proposed in the draft final act of the Uruguay Round, put forward by the Gatt's director general, Mr Arthur Dunkel - Sir Leon's ideas will find no fertile soil. More fundamentally, all depends on a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round itself. This is not merely because new structures cannot be added to a collapsed building. It is also that liberal trade is the foundation for effective competition. Meanwhile, government-imposed or supported restraints on trade, like 'voluntary export restraints', are themselves the main distortion of global competition. If the Uruguay Round quagmire is to be crossed, the entire EC needs to push harder in that direction. Ways to reform the Common Agricultural Policy must be found that are acceptable to the EC's main negotiating partners. Equally important, however, is continuation of that 'strong commitment to competition policy' which Sir Leon lauds. The recession has brought forth renewed hopes of an active industrial policy and of greater protection against competitive foreign enterprises. Those ideas from a failed past must be resisted if what Sir Leon wants is to come to pass.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'US faces Dollars 6.5bn farm loan losses' TWO US agricultural loan guarantee programmes are facing losses amounting to billions of dollars having made an increasing number of high-risk loans, often for foreign policy purposes, according to a new US government report. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, says Dollars 40.9bn in guarantees have been issued since the short- and medium-term credit programmes were launched in 1981 to expand US farm exports. However, there is no clear evidence that the financing actually increased sales of US commodities, the investigators say. Although the US government has so far only had to pay out Dollars 3.6bn to banks that made loans to customers, the GAO calculates the cumulative costs of the programme at about Dollars 6.5bn. It estimates that the programmes' costs will increase by about Dollars 74m a year. The critical report puts the US loan programmes in some jeopardy. The new Clinton administration will be looking hard for budget cuts. Agriculture subsidies are often cited as a possibility. A costly programme which cannot prove to be productive offers a perfect target. The GAO makes clear that the loan programme has been given virtually impossible objectives by Congress and used by the Reagan and Bush administrations for foreign policy purposes. In the 1985 Farm Bill the US Department of Agriculture was ordered to authorise 'not less than Dollars 5bn' for short-term credit guarantees'. It set Dollars 500m as the floor for the medium-term scheme. Another Dollars 1bn was allocated for 'emerging democracies'. 'Principal recipients of guarantees have often been countries in which the US has had significant foreign in policy interests, such as Mexico, South Korea, Iraq, and the former Soviet Union and Russia,' the GAO said.</p>

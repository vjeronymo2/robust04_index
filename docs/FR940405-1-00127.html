			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons desiring to participate at the informal public hearing must file a notice of intention to appear by June 20, 1994. The notice of intention to appear must contain the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The name, address, and telephone number of each person to appear;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The capacity in which the person will appear;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The approximate amount of time required for the presentation;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The issues that will be addressed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A brief statement of the position that will be taken with respect to each issue; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Whether the party intends to submit documentary evidence and, if so, a brief summary of it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice of intention to appear shall be mailed to Mr. Thomas Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs, Docket No. H&hyph;122, U.S. Department of Labor, room N&hyph;3647, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, telephone (202) 219&hyph;8615.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A notice of intention to appear also may be transmitted by facsimile to (202) 219&hyph;5986, by the same date provided the original and 3 copies are sent to the same address and postmarked no later than 3 days later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any party requesting more than ten (10) minutes for presentation at the informal public hearing, or who intends to submit documentary evidence, must provide in quadruplicate the testimony and evidence to be presented at the informal public hearing. One copy shall not be stapled or bound and be suitable for copying. These materials must be provided to Mr. Thomas Hall, OSHA Division of Consumer Affairs at the address above and be postmarked no later than June 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requested in the notice of intention to appear. In instances where the information contained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested, a more appropriate amount of time will be allocated and the participant will be notified of that fact prior to the informal public hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any party who has not substantially complied with the above requirement may be limited to a ten-minute presentation and may be requested to return for questioning at a later time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time permits, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, but will not be allowed to question witnesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of intention to appear, testimony and evidence will be available for inspection and copying at the Docket Office at the address above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Conduct and Nature of Hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding will be resolved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which impede or protract the rulemaking process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally will be decided so as to favor development of the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that &sect;1911.4 specifies the Assistant Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternatives procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause. The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911 including the powers:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To regulate the course of the proceedings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witness and to limit the time for questioning; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated in the oral proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of the public response on the issues involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

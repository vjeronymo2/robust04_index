			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hopes of success grow at Brussels aluminium talks Expectations of a substantial co-ordinated cut in worldwide aluminium production increased yesterday after trade delegates from the main producing countries decided to continue their negotiations into an unscheduled third day. 'We decided we would keep talking while we were still making progress,' said one delegate. However, there were some indications that the talks were taking longer than the two days originally scheduled because of Russia's determination not to shift from its opening offer. Delegates were concentrating on how cuts of up to 2m tonnes a year of annual output could be shared between Russia and the rest of the world. A sudden surge in Russian exports to the west following a collapse in domestic demand, which had been largely for its military machine, is widely blamed for the aluminium surplus, which has driven down prices recently to all-time lows in real terms. Taking part in the negotiations with Russia are trade representatives from Australia, Canada, the 12-nation European Union as one body, Norway and the US. As an incentive to the Russia, second only to the US as an aluminium producer, to co-operate, the western governments are offering financial and technical help to the Russian industry. On the other hand, if no agreement is reached, US producers are likely immediately to make anti-dumping charges against the Russian industry. However, this process might take a year to complete. The EU already has imposed import restrictions on aluminium from the Commonwealth of Independent States which last until the end of February.</p>

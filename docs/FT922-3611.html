			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Safeway uses rail for store deliveries SAFEWAY has become the first UK grocery retailer to introduce rail into its store delivery systems. Traditionally retailers have said stores and distribution centres are inconveniently sited for rail transport, but Safeway has started using intermodal trailers to carry wines and spirits from its bonded warehouse in Harlow, Essex, to a new superstore at Bellshill, Lanarkshire. Intermodal trailers are road trailers that are driven on to special rail wagons without the need to remove wheels or use cranes. Safeway's will be operated by Charterail, a road-rail distribution company. Safeway is planning a national rail distribution network based on a central warehouse in the Midlands. Mr Lawrence Christensen, Safeway's director of distribution, said the company was also planning a pan-European rail distribution network with the supermarket chains Auchan in France and Albert Heijn in the Netherlands. The companies are partners in a venture to rationalise European sourcing.</p>

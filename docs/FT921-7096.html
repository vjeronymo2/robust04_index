			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Making waves for the world: New frequencies Generals and admirals use them, businessmen with their car phones depend on them and any future colony on the moon would need them. Radio waves underpin military, mobile and space communications, and much besides. But waves assigned to one service cannot be used by others. If they are, the result is a jumble of confused signals. This is the central preoccupation of more than 1,000 government delegates from about 100 countries who are meeting in Torremolinos, Spain, under the auspices of the United Nations. Their task is to revise an obscure but important backwater of international law - the radio regulations. These regulations specify which radio waves can be used for what purposes. Current regulations - most recently revised in 1979 - have become outdated because advances in technology have led to a mushrooming in new services that need radio waves to operate. But those parts of the spectrum which are the most commercially exploitable are overcrowded. So new services are competing with each other and with existing users for a scarce resource. The World Administrative Radio Conference, as the meeting is called, will set the framework for the whole gamut of radio-based services until 2000. At the conference, powerful industrial interests are lobbying to influence decisions on the allocation of frequencies. Much is at stake because of the huge investment needed to develop new services. High on the agenda are high-definition television (HDTV), satellite telephones, global radio programmes and space communications. Two main considerations will preoccupy the government-led teams: how to back their domestic industries, and how to cause minimum disruption to existing users of radio waves. More than 30 European nations have co-ordinated their conference aims, creating a powerful voting bloc. The US and Japan also have clear but rival agendas - largely because their industries have different technological approaches. It is the horse-trading between various national interests that forms the substance of the month-long conference. If a deadlock should result, there is a provision for voting on the basis of one nation, one vote. A compromise seems the likely outcome, partly because services from different countries need to operate without interfering with each other. An agreement is also necessary because only then can there be global technical standards and economies of scale. If equipment had to be manufactured to a variety of standards for each national market, costs would be high. So far, delegates have agreed to free up frequencies for more radio programmes with global reach such as the BBC World Service. There is also broad consensus on making frequencies available for radio programmes to be beamed by satellite, telephones in aircraft and communications in space. But there are two particularly contentious issues. HDTV. The US, Europe and Japan agree that frequencies should be allocated to HDTV but have proposed various frequencies. The US and Japan would like to use frequencies which the Europeans are using for fixed telecommunications links, while Europe wants frequencies occupied in the US by mobile communications and satellites. Mobile communications. The US is backing the idea that the next generation of mobile phones will involve bouncing signals off satellites, a technology where American companies are pre-eminent. The European nations favour the more conventional approach of sending radio signals along the earth's surface - a technology where their companies have expertise. The European view of the future of mobile communications is still unclear. One idea in the industry is that it will be simply an evolution of the current cellular systems - with higher quality and smaller handsets. Some visionaries, though, say it will combine a telephone, television and computer on a terminal the size of a wrist-watch. Even among those who argue that mobile satellite is the right approach, there are a variety of opinions. The best known plan is being promoted by Motorola, the US electronics group. It wishes to launch 77 mini-satellites that would circle the globe at 413 nautical miles above the earth's surface. The low height would allow customers to have small handsets similar to cellular phones because less power would be needed to communicate with the satellite. An alternative plan by the International Maritime Satellite organisation - a multinational group owned by 65 telephone companies whose main function is to provide communication services to ships - involves satellites at a height of 36,000 kilometres, as well as at a lower orbit. This would allow them to be stationary above the earth's surface, thus reducing the need for sophisticated technology to track moving satellites. In any event, the decisions in Torremolinos will not be the final word on radio communications. By the time the conference next meets in perhaps another decade, radio waves will be even more crowded and demands for frequencies from imaginative new services even more pressing than they are today.</p>

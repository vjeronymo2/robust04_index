"It's nice to see you again," Kim said to Chinese President  Jiang Zemin, recounting their first meeting in Seattle last  November during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  summit.    "You came a long way," Jiang answered, taking Kim's hand.    Kim shook hands with everyone in the welcoming line as Jiang  provided introductions. Kim obviously found some familiar faces  and didn't forget to say, "it's been a while."    The South Korean leader then followed suit, introducing  everyone accompanying him on his trip to China.    The welcoming ceremony lasted 15 minutes including the  performance of national anthems and the walk down the red carpet  between honor guards.    -- Kim jogged around Daiyoutai, the guest house where he is  staying, before leaving for the welcoming ceremony and  remembered to praise the beauty of the trees and the ponds in  talks with Jiang.    Chatting before the summit opened amid a burst of camera  flashes, Kim said he had spent a very comfortable night at the  guest house and especially appreciated the beautiful scenery.    The summit room, unlike when Kim met with Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with only one aide present, was  filled with officials from both sides.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Ambassador to Beijing Hwang  Pyong-tae, Senior Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong  Chong-uk and the Foreign Ministry's Director-General for Asian  Affairs, Yu Pyong-u, sat in for the Seoul side.    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Vice Foreign Minister Tang  Jiaxuan, Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan and the  Director-general for Asian Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, Wang  Yingfan, represented Beijing.    -- The Kim-Jiang summit was followed by an expanded summit  attended by 13 officials including the trade, science and  technology and communication ministers as well as military  leaders.    The two countries capped their summit with the signing of  agreements on cultural cooperation and avoidance of double  taxation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Here is what Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the  Serbian republic, said in our Sunday At Ten program:    [Begin Koljevic recording] In my opinion, today we witnessed  the greatest provocation since the beginning of the war in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the international community  insisted on stopping the war at any price, regardless of the  political solution that would ensue, and regardless of how long  the political talks would take. However, in an attempt to  manipulate and, particularly, to stage massacres, the Muslim  side has done something that, despite repeated attempts, has not  occurred up until now. Massacres have been staged in Sarajevo  on two consecutive days; today we were able to see this clearly  from the photographs available to us and yesterday it was  possible to deduce from the information available that our side  had not opened fire.    Why do I say that this is the most dramatic event? Because  it took place on two consecutive days, because the first  [massacre in Dobrinja] took place during the negotiations at the  airport that aimed at furthering mutual trust. Moreover, this  entire scandalous Bosnia-Herzegovina war chronicle happened five  days before the Geneva conference scheduled for 10 February. I  think, hope, and believe that Europe will find the strength to  learn its lesson from such manipulation, and that it will  finally accuse, or at least condemn, the side guilty of  continuing the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD SERIES / CINCINNATI REDS VS. OAKLAND ATHLETICS;  </P> <P> ATHLETICS ARE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN THEIR FALL FROM GRACE;  </P> <P> GAME 3: OAKLAND'S DYNASTY IN THE MAKING IS NOW ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION.  </P> <P> Even before his team's 8-3 humiliation in Game 3 of the World Series Friday  night, Sandy Alderson, general manager of the Oakland Athletics, was struggling  with the swiftly changing perception of the A's.  </P> <P> Alderson, sitting in the dugout before the A's fell behind the Cincinnati Reds  three games to none in the best-of-seven series, was asked if this was the  unmaking of a dynasty.  </P> <P> "I try not to deal in dynasty, legacy, travesty," he said. "One word synopses  are beyond me, but we seem to have gone from one end of the spectrum to the  other in 48 hours."  </P> <P> Was that his opinion or that of the media? Alderson shook his head and said it  seemed to be the media view.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, we were not at one end of the spectrum to start with and we're  not at the other now," he said.  </P> <P> Perhaps, but this much seems clear:  </P> <P> Where the A's are now is on the verge of embarrassing extinction, and much  closer to travesty than dynasty.  </P> <P> "If we keep playing the way we've played the last two or three games, we're  done," center fielder Dave Henderson said of a situation that finds the A's  needing to win four in a row.  </P> <P> He said it amid the sounds of silence in a clubhouse devoid of players for  almost 20 minutes after media was admitted.  </P> <P> A shock? An embarrassment?  </P> <P> "Not if we can come back and play to our capability, but if we get beat playing  the way we're playing, there's no other way to describe it," first baseman Mark  McGwire said.  </P> <P> "I mean, right now they're the better team, it's that simple. There's no  explanation, no excuses. We're getting smoked. They're hitting everything,  scoring a lot of runs and flat out beating us."  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- The A's have been outscored, 20-7, and are one for 23 with runners in  scoring position. McGwire is three for 10 with no runs batted in, and Jose  Canseco is one for 11 with two RBIs.  </P> <P> Booed by A's fans while going hitless in four at-bats Friday after being rapped  by manager Tony La Russa and Dave Stewart following Wednesday's game, Bash  Brother Canseco dressed in private and refused to speak with the media after  this latest disappointment.  </P> <P>  -- Oakland pitchers, who produced the American League's best earned-run  average for a third consecutive season, have given up 38 hits and 16 earned  runs in three games -- an ERA of 5.54 compared to 3.18 during the regular  season.  </P> <P> "Am I shocked?" Dave Henderson said of the pitching breakdown. "No, I'm the  center fielder. I saw the ball going to the plate. We're dealing with major  league hitters who hit pitches they should hit. Sometimes you can get away with  a pitch down the middle, but not as often as we're throwing them."  </P> <P> Mike Moore, who won Game 3 of the American League playoffs 10 days earlier,  didn't get away with it for long Friday. He faced 16 batters and yielded eight  hits, including the two home runs by Chris Sabo. Moore, as did Stewart after  Game 1, said he had good stuff but bad location.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous at all, but I couldn't put my pitches where I wanted, and you  can't make a mistake the way they're swinging," he said.  </P> <P> "I mean, they're relaxed, seeing the ball and hitting it. Right now, they're  more aggressive than any club we saw this year."  </P> <P> And the A's catalogue of mistakes expands.  </P> <P> Friday night, for example, there was a costly error by McGwire on a no-chance  throw by Dave Henderson that put another runner into scoring position, a stolen  base when the A's pitcher (Scott Sanderson) went into a full windup and a  booted double play ball by shortstop Mike Gallego.  </P> <P> As a complement, the team once thought to be the best in baseball managed only  seven hits and faces the possibility that its season could end tonight.  </P> <P> Stewart will try to extend the series and said he was undaunted, considering it  a no-lose proposition. He predicted another four games, although no team has  ever come back from a three-game deficit in the Series.  </P> <P> "Am I making that call? Sure, I'm sticking my neck out, but anything can  happen," Stewart said. "I mean, no one thought anyone would ever hit 715 home  runs, but Henry Aaron did. I think I'm going to make it real tough on the Reds,  and that will be the start of it."  </P> <P> Time will tell. For the moment, the A's seem closer to being finished than  getting started.  </P></p>

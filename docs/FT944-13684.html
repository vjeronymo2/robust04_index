			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): Systems fuel demand for space / A look at the fast growing market for electronic data storage Documents can be stored in a heap on the desk, in a filing cabinet or in a buff folder, but they can get buried or go missing. It takes time to retrieve data from cabinets and they take up space. A square inch of magnetic disk space can accommodate as much information as 20 filing cabinets or more. But despite a rise in the use of electronic storage methods, less than 5 per cent of the world's business information is stored 'on line' in a computer. 'The rest is on microfilm, microfiche and plain old paper,' says Paul Wolfstaetter, research analyst with the US Gartner group. The demand for electronic storage is growing rapidly - at a rate of 40-50 per cent a year and this is expected to continue. The UK data storage market alone is likely to be worth more than Dollars 400m this year, rising to about Dollars 700m by 1997, according to Dataquest, the research group. Demand is being fuelled by the greater use of computer-based office systems, the onset of multimedia applications, networks linking computers to telephone lines and an increasing use of software programs that eat up storage space. 'Only a few years ago, a 20 megabyte hard disk would have been enough for most people's needs,' says Trevor Duplock of Micropolis, the US disk drive manufacturer. 'Today, with the availability of software such as Windows NT which requires 100Mb of disk space, the typical user needs much more space.' The market's voracious appetite is forcing average disk and disk drive capacities ever upwards. According to a recent study* by Disk Trend Report, the US analyst, demand for 100-200 megabyte disk drives, which led the market in 1993, will plummet by 50 per cent this year in favour of 200-300m megabyte drives. By 1995, 300-500Mb drives will lead the market. The study expects growth in sales of hard disk drives for personal computers, workstations and network file servers to boost global revenues to about Dollars 33bn by 1997. Manufacturers, meanwhile, are responding by providing smaller disks with ever-increasing capacities. But as demand rises, the price per megabyte of storage is expected to continue to fall and storage options to increase. The way an organisation chooses to store data depends on four main factors. How much information needs to be stored; how quickly access is needed; whether the data needs to be processed; and the cost per byte of information. There are two main options. Magnetic disks dominate the storage market because they are rewritable, while optical disks are usually not. Magneto-optical disks, which form only a tiny portion of the market, are rewritable, but the cost of equipment is relatively high and retrieval times are slow - the cost per megabyte, however, is low. Most PCs are fitted with rewritable magnetic hard disks as well as floppy disk drives for portable data storage. A high proportion of new PCs are also now equipped with a CD-Rom (read only memory) drive for multimedia applications. The CD-Rom has become a popular medium for software distribution because it is relatively cheap, easy to handle, and capable of storing large amounts of data, voice and images. A new generation of storage devices that adhere to PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) standards is also beginning to take hold. These devices, often called memory cards because they are not much bigger than a credit card, incorporate semiconductor memory chips and provide data storage capacity approaching that of a magnetic hard disk. Prices of PCMCIA cards are coming down as the cards become more popular and manufacturing volumes increase. The advantage of memory cards is that they are rugged, light weight and portable. This makes them particularly well suited to notebook PCs and hand-held computing devices. In the mainframe and mid-range computer arena, another acronym that is becoming better-known in the market is Raid - redundant array of inexpensive disks. Standard, smaller disk drives are stacked together to give the sort of storage capacity offered by a single, more expensive drive. Linked in an array, they take large amounts of data and access times are relatively swift. Manufacturers, among them EMC, StorageTek, IBM and Micropolis, say they offer greater security because the failure of one, large disk means much more is lost than if one smaller disk in an array fails. At the same time, as manufacturers are fitting more data on to smaller disks, their price is falling, making it cheaper to make back-ups to store precious data on disks off site. 'The risk for the user is in a single, expensive disk. If I can buy two small disks with the same dollar and each with the same capacity, then I buy the two and use one to copy and store it,' says Mr Wolfstaetter. For now, magnetic hard disks will continue to dominate, says Mr Wolfstaetter. 'Magnetic disks have almost pushed optical disks out of the picture.' But he believes the medium of the future will be holographic crystal. Scientists at Stanford University have recently developed a fully automated digital holographic data storage system with a data capacity of 163,000 bytes. 'By the turn of the decade we will have holographic recording and we'll be looking at capacities of one terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) in a cubic centimetre.' * Rigid Disk Drives, 1994.

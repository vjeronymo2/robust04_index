			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ISRAEL WANTS U.N. OFFICER REMOVED  </P> <P> Israel today demanded the removal of a Norwegian U.N. commander who compared  the expulsion of 79 people from Israeli-controlled territory in south Lebanon  to steps Nazis took in World War II.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. J. E. Karlsen, commander of the Norwegian battalion in the U.N.  Interim Force in Lebanon made the comparison last week in a private meeting  with Israeli officials. His remark was leaked to the press, and Israel's  Foreign Ministry complained at the time. However, the ministry now wants him  removed because he was quoted by a newspaper as saying his comparison succeeded  in drawing attention to the expulsions, a ministry spokesman said.  </P></p>

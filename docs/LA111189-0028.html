			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: OUTSIDE THE PACIFIC 10, TROJANS ARE STRUGGLING  </P> <P> The success of USC's football team brings glory to the Trojans but reflects  negatively on the Pacific 10 Conference as a whole.  </P> <P> Writes Don Borst of the Tacoma Morning Tribune: "USC's ability to handle Pac-10  foes, but inability to handle quality teams outside the league, does not speak  well for the league's strength.  </P> <P> "Since the Trojans began their 18-game streak in conference games, they are 4-6  in nonconference affairs, including a 66-10 rout of lowly Utah State. Against  nonconference ranked teams, USC is 3-6.  </P> <P> "That nonconference record won't be fed any scraps any time soon either. USC  has the Rose Bowl coming up, followed by contests next year with Penn State, at  Ohio State and Notre Dame."  </P> <P> Add Pac-10: Borst goes on: "Oregon State hasn't quite reached the big time. At  least, members of the Beach Boys' road crew were unimpressed that the Beavers  were practicing in the Los Angeles Coliseum Nov. 3.  </P> <P> "With the Beach Boys' concert following the game Saturday, the stage and sound  system were being installed, and the roadies didn't like sharing the Coliseum  with OSU.  </P> <P> "Of course, the Beavers were already pretty distracted, anyway. Bo Jackson was  there also, taping a television commercial.  </P> <P> "We all were looking over at Bo," safety Larry Vladic said. "I mean, you  couldn't help it. He's a monster.  </P> <P> "And then the Beach Boys guys were trying to get us off the field. They said,  'Hey, we've got a concert.' We said, 'Hey, we have a football game.' "  </P> <P> Trivia time: There were nine players named Johnson in the NBA last season. What  was the second most-common surname?  </P> <P> You can look it up: The Philadelphia 76ers' media guide sells for $8. And it's  worth every penny; the guide includes:  </P> <P>  -- A recap of every dunk made last season.  </P> <P>  -- Technical-foul leaders since 1970. Kevin Loughery is No. 1 with 330.  </P> <P>  -- A list of 1988-89's top 40 players in combined points, rebounds and  assists, led by Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson.  </P> <P>  -- A team-by-team list of number retirements. Boston leads with 16.  </P> <P>  -- A breakdown of the types of injuries and illnesses that sidelined NBA  players for at least one game last season. Of 380 injuries and illnesses, 69  were ankle problems, followed by 52 knee injuries and 43 cases of flu.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Williams (seven), followed by Jones (six).  </P> <P> Quotebook: Bobby Knight, Indiana basketball coach, on a proposed postseason  tournament to determine the Big Ten champion: "The guys who devise these things  are the same type of guys who devised the Watergate break-in. I think they  overlooked some very important details." GARR KLUENDER  </P></p>

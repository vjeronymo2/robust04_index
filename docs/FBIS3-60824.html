			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by territories correspondent Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpts] Leaflet No. 2 of the Hebron Fatah Hawks group  warns: "Ge'ula Kohen should know that we are lying in wait for  her and her racist, extremist gang, which has come to set Hebron  on fire."    The leaflet, which was distributed on 25 December, also  says:  "There will be no peace without the expulsion of the settlers  from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The intifadah must be  kept at a high level, and painful blows must continue to rain on  the settlers. The circle of jihad between us will grow, and we  shall threaten their security night and day through all possible  forms of struggle."    The Fatah Hawks group in the Hebron region, which is  considered "Abu-Jihad's [Khalil al-Wazir] fortress," devoted its  leaflet, entitled "A Call for Steadfast Struggle and  Confrontation Against the Settler Gangs," to issuing various  instructions to the population with regard to the struggle  against the settlers, with the emphasis placed on  intifadah-style activities.    The Fatah Hawks declared that 1 January, Fatah Day, will  mark  an intensification of the battle against the settlers. Detailed  instructions were given on how to assist local residents who  live near the settlers in their struggle.    Wealthy residents were asked to contribute funds to support  these residents and the Hebron Fatah organization. Property  owners were asked to take 25 percent off the rent they charge in  light of the difficult economic situation in the area.    Town residents were asked to increase their presence in the  Cave of the Patriarchs to prevent the Jews from taking over.  The Fatah Hawks have also forbidden town residents to park  their cars in the center of town, "so that our squads will have  an easier job carrying out their operations (against the  settlers working nearby)."    As in the first leaflet distributed by the Fatah Hawks  approximately two weeks ago, this leaflet also calls for  "national unity" and coordination between Fatah and the  organizations that oppose the peace process: Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement], the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine.    The two leaflets call for a fundamental organizational  reform  in Fatah activity and demand the expulsion of "suspicious  elements who spread corruption in the organization's ranks and  cast aside its principles, values, and history in order to empty  Fatah of all content." [passage omitted]    Palestinian sources in Hebron expressed the assessment that  the activity of the Fatah Hawks reflects the positions of the  hardliners in the organization, who call for military activities  and are represented by 'Abbas Zaki and Muhammad Jihad, the heads  of the organization's "western sector" mechanism.    This faction of Fatah regards Abu-Jihad, 'Arafat's deputy  who  directed the armed struggle in Israel and was murdered in 1988,  as its spiritual mentor.</p>

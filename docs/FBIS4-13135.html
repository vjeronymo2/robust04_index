			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordanian officials on Friday [15 April]  dismissed as "political propaganda" Israeli accusations that  Jordan was helping the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),  which has claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks  that killed 12 Israelis during the last 10 days and threatened  to launch similar attacks in the future.    "According to our information, the attacks carried out by  Hamas inside Israeli were conceived, planned and executed in the  occupied territories," a senior government official said. "Thus  the accusation that Jordan is helping Hamas is unsubstantiated  hasty and does not contribute positively to the peace process,"  the official told the JORDAN TIMES.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday accused  Jordan of helping Hamas although he did not say how Jordan was  extending that help.    "Israel cannot tolerate the situation of Amman being a  paradise for the activities of the Hamas," Mr. Rabin said at a  hastily called late-night news conference in Tel Aviv. "I see  the need, I and the foreign minister together, to come and say  to the Jordan government: This situation is intolerable."    Another Jordanian official, who also spoke on condition of  anonymity, dismissed the Israeli accusations as politically  motivated. "It is ridiculous to say that Jordan is helping  Hamas in carrying out these attacks just because a Jordanian  citizen comes out and says my group did it," the official said  "what they (the Israelis) are trying to do is to look for  scapegoats outside the occupied territories to blame them for  their own frustration."    "Instead of doing that" the official continued, "Israel  needs  to look closer to home to see that acts of Palestinian violence  are in direct response to acts of violence by Israelis against  Palestinians. Violence can only breed violence, as the Israelis  well know."    Jordanian officials generally believed that Muhammad Nazzal,  the Hamas representative in Amman, who made the statements  claiming responsibility for the attacks against Israelis in  'Afula and Khudayrah "is not himself responsible for the attacks  and was only addressing journalists as a politician, which is  not against the law."    There was no official response from the Cabinet whose  spokesman said it was still deliberating the accusation and  preparing a response.    But some officials privately expressed concern that such  statements as those made by Mr. Nazzal in Amman were not  compatible with the Kingdom's policy on the Middle East peace  process and could put the country into a difficult position at a  time when it is calling for linking the lifting of the siege on  al-'Aqabah with its role in the process.    They said that the Hamas statements from Amman played into  the hands of the Americans and Israel who wanted to pressure the  Kingdom further after His Majesty King Husayn tied the Kingdom's  role in the peace process with lifting the siege against  al-'Aqabah.    "It is clear," a prominent Jordanian politician told the  JORDAN TIMES, "that the U.S. and Israel want to tie the Hamas  statements with Jordan's conditions on the peace process and the  al-'Aqabah blockade."    "They were unhappy with the King's conditions regarding  al-'Aqabah and this is how they found a counter issue to  pressure the Kingdom," the politician said.    A senior official, who agreed with the politician, also said  that Jordan also sees the anger expressed by the Israeli prime  minister as another indication of attempts to undermine Jordan's  role in the peace process.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who joined Mr. Rabin  in his press conference Thursday, said he was especially angry  that Mr. Nazzal had said that the two attacks were among five  that Hamas would carry out to avenge the Hebron Mosque massacre  of dozens of Palestinian worshipers.    "I don't know one incident in foreign affairs in which a  state which says it is aspiring to peace would allow in light of  day the head or representative of a murderous organisation to  say: `We committed two incidents of murder and we intend to  carry out three more incidents like this, in the light of day,'  on the television screen," Mr. Peres said.    Jordanian officials also believe that this is another link  in  the general antagonism many countries in the Arab region and the  U.S. feel towards Jordan's democracy and inability of many of  these countries to believe that Jordan cannot impose limits on  the political statements of politicians like Mr. Nazzal, or  force newspapers to take one side over the other.    "Since the Gulf war, the U.S. and Gulf states did not  believe  us when we said we could not control the media hailing Saddam  Husayn or criticising Gulf states," a well-placed official said.    "Now when we tell them that we legally cannot take any  action  against Hamas issuing statements from here, they are also not  going to believe us," the official added.    "Hamas represents an extremist point of view which echoes  statements made by the extremists on the Israeli side calling  for the extermination of all Palestinians," one official said  adding, "I do not see how Israel in a democratic context can  expect us to muffle the extremist voices on our side while  letting free the extremist voices on their side."    Hamas representatives were not available for comment over  this controversy, but one of them would only say that his group  did not want to "make Jordan's position any more difficult than  it already is."    However, prominent Islamist and Islamic Action Front (IAF)  Deputy Hammam Sa'id said that Hamas in Jordan had better leave  claims of responsibility to come from inside the occupied  territories.    "All Hamas activities originate from inside the occupied  territories and there is nothing coming from outside except  political and media statements...decisions for Hamas are not  taken from outside of the occupied territories in terms of  military action," he said.    Mr. Sa'id, implicitly criticising Mr. Nazzal, said that "the  approach should be of a different kind. People inside the  occupied territories should be left to express themselves by  themselves as they offer sacrifices and take their own  decisions."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Carlos Eichelbaum in </F> Santiago, Chile; copyright CLARIN]    [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor did not beat  around the bush: yesterday he told President Carlos Menem that  if no progress is made in Congress on the pharmaceuticals bill  before 30 April, Argentina would be removed from the list of  candidates for joining NAFTA. Menem and the diplomats  accompanying him reportedly asked for a "concrete gesture" for  joining that market as a necessary element for unblocking this  issue, over which the U.S. laboratories are especially  concerned. This happened in Chile yesterday, during President  Eduardo Frei's inauguration.    Kantor always uses the expression "Clinton told me that..."  to keep up appearances and bridge the gap in ranks. As a matter  of fact U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor -- who for all  practical purposes is the U.S. foreign trade secretary --  yesterday directly increased his government's pressures on  Carlos Menem for Argentina to make progress in promulgating a  pharmaceuticals bill before 30 April. Kantor cautioned that the  possibility that our country might join NAFTA depends on this  promulgation. He also cautioned about the risk that our country  might be included in the list of nations that -- for Washington  -- deserve economic sanctions.    It seems that the Argentine rejoinder was: "Our integration  into NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement, which so  far is made up of the United States, Mexico, and Canada)  represents a concrete goal, and maybe a clearer sign of this  integration might favor the approval of the pharmaceuticals  bill." The Argentine rejoinder might have hinted at a softening  of conditions by Washington: Perhaps a definition of the NAFTA  issue might still not achieve a final approval of the bill, but  it might actually achieve a decision by a committee, or in the  sessions hall of one of the two congressional chambers.    The hard -- as graphically described by an Argentine source  -- one-hour meeting between the president and Clinton's official  was held at the Carrera Hotel where Menem is staying in  Santiago. Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella; Hector Gambarotta,  the Foreign Ministry international economic relations secretary;  Jorge Herrera Vega, the Foreign Ministry under secretary for  international economic relations; North America Department  Director Alfredo Morelli; and Argentine Ambassador to Chile  Eduardo Iglesias also participated in the meeting.    Menem and Kantor met very early, shortly before leaving for  Valparaiso to participate in outgoing Chilean President Patricio  Aylwin's transfer of power to Eduardo Frei. In fact, this  meeting became President Carlos Menem's most important activity,  which was not included in the protocol, during his quick visit  to Chile.    Upon arriving in Santiago, Kantor, the head of the U.S.  delegation for the transfer of power, bluntly said: "Chile is  the country that is in the best position to join NAFTA." He  extolled Chile's economic and foreign policy, which includes  precisely the approval of a patents law -- that is, recognition  of all the "copyrights" for all types of foreign technology  applied in national manufacturing.    The increasingly pressing U.S. interest in the approval of  an  Argentine patents law -- there is an official bill in Congress  that meets Washington's basic specific goals -- is specifically  linked to the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals with an original  U.S. formula. U.S. laboratories claim that the lack of  recognition of their "copyrights" in our country represents a  yearly $200 million loss for them.    Kantor's deadline -- 30 April -- is when the U.S. Government  will draw up a list of countries that, in the U.S. Government's  opinion, do not respect the rules of honesty in their trade  operations structures and which, therefore, will be included in  the category of candidates for economic sanctions by Washington.    The May deadline is also at stake. In May, Kantor himself  must define those countries that will be able to initiate the  process of joining NAFTA. Chile is clearly the first candidate,  but Argentina and Colombia already have status as precandidates  [precandidatos].    Menem and Di Tella had confirmed Argentina's interest in  joining NAFTA -- this issue has just been discussed in a  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] meeting in Buenos Aires --  when they discussed with Kantor Clinton's proposal for an  Americas' Summit. Following the presidential inauguration in  Chile, and pursuant to the contents of a personal letter from  Clinton that Kantor delivered to Frei, it became known that this  summit, which is scheduled to define a sort of continental  globalization of political, economic, and social strategies,  will be held in Miami in December, even though a precise date  has not yet been set.    During his private talks with Frei on 11 March and on 9  March  Menem did not discuss the issue of his new Chilean counterpart's  upcoming "private meeting" with former British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher, who will visit Santiago next week to lecture.  She was invited by Sofofa [Industrial Development Association],  Chile's largest employers' enterprise. Thatcher will reportedly  be paid $100,000 for her lecture.    Curiously enough, entrepreneurs with large investments in  our  country, like Heliodoro Matte, are among the sponsors of a visit  eliciting strong reactions from the Argentine Foreign Ministry.  The two presidents also did not discuss what would happen when  Thatcher bumps into Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion  during their visit to the aeronautical exposition in the Chilean  capital.</p>

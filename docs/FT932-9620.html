			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Scargill to visit Timex picket MR ARTHUR Scargill, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, plans to visit the picket line outside the Timex factory in Dundee on Monday to show his solidarity with workers who have been on strike there for three months, Robert Taylor writes. But his plan will be criticised tomorrow by Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU engineering union. He regards it as an unwelcome interference in a difficult and lawful dispute that does not involve any of Mr Scargill's members and one which will do nothing to produce a settlement.</p>

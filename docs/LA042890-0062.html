			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's and Sunday's schedule of  the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival, with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> Highly recommended:  </P> <P> "THE NATURAL HISTORY OF PARKING LOTS"(U.S., 1990; Director: Everett Lewis; AFI  Mark Goodson, 9 p.m.). The horror stories of privileged throw-away kids,  considered disposable by new stepparents, gave writer/director Lewis the spine  of his story. From these, he's created a breathtaking breakthrough film, made  with the urgency one finds in works of the French New Wave. This one has  poetry, irony, compassion, eroticism, beauty, a Bresson-like purity, excellent  acting and slyly great music. (Sheila Benson)  </P></p>

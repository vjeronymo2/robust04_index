During his first trip to China the Russian Government head  is  expected to discuss with Chinese leaders on how to further  develop bilateral good-neighborly and friendly relations and  expand and deepen trade-economic ties between China and Russia.    The two sides are also expected to sign a package of  documents.    Chernomyrdin will also visit Shanghai, the largest  industrial  city in China, and the Chinese port city of Dalian.    In an interview with XINHUA earlier on Wednesday, the  Russian  prime minister stressed the need for the two governments to  create still more and more fine conditions for furthering  trade-economic cooperation in various fields.

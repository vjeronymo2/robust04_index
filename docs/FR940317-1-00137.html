Box 650405, Dallas, TX 76265&hyph;0405.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Claims over $100 generated by other nonappropriated fund activities will be transmitted to The Army Central Insurance Fund, ATTN: CFSC-RM-I, Room 1240, 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Alexandria, VA 22331&hyph;0508. When transmitting household goods or hold baggage shipment claims for payment, forward the entire claims file so ACIF can pursue carrier recovery. Use the ``NF'' claims database transaction code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Claims not over $100 generated by other nonappropriated fund activities will be transmitted to that nonappropriated fund activity responsible for payment from its funds. (See AR 215&hyph;1, paragraph 13&hyph;24a.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reimbursement to foreign countries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reimbursement to a foreign country of the United States pro rata share of a claim paid under an international agreement will be made from nonappropriated funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evidence of payment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a claim settled under this section is transmitted to a disbursing office for payment, the approving or settlement authority will request the appropriate disbursing office to return evidence of the date and amount of payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Claims Involving Persons Other Than NAF Employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.208  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims arising from activities of nonappropriated fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These claims should be disposed of in a manner similar to that set forth in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;42, 8&hyph;43, and 8&hyph;47. Post exchange concessionaires are independent contractors and are required to obtain workmen's compensation coverage under local law for their employees and public liability insurance governing their operations. If a dispute arises as to whether such insurance is available or applicable, the claim should be forwarded to Headquarters, AAFES, ATTN: General Counsel, P.O. Box 660202, Dallas, TX 75266&hyph;0202, prior to processing under the preceding chapters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.209  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Non-NAFI RIMP claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RIMP is administered by the U.S. Army Community and Family Support Center under the provisions of AR 215&hyph;1. Non-NAFI RIMP claims are not cognizable under any other provision of this regulation. However, except as otherwise provided in this section, Non-NAFI RIMP claims are subject to the same requirements that apply to other tort claims. USARCS carefully monitors all such claims to ensure proper investigation and resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.210  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims cognizable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Non-NAFI RIMP claims can arise from the activities of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Members of recreational NAFIs or authorized users of NAF recreational property, while using such property, except real property, in the manner and for the purposes authorized by DA regulations and the charter, constitution, and bylaws of the particular NAF activity. This category of persons generally has been limited to members and users of recreational facilities such as flying clubs organized as NAFIs and craft shops. This category does not include customers of exchanges, snack bars, motion picture theaters, or similar facilities. Whether a claim based on an act or omission of a member or authorized user of other types of NAF activities, such as officers' messes, would be cognizable under this paragraph depends on the facts and circumstances involved, including the degree of participation by the member or authorized user in the activities of the fund. Claims arising from the use of NAF property, as defined in this paragraph, are not cognizable under the FTCA or MCA, since the use of such recreational property is by individuals not considered to be employees of the Army or NAFI acting within the scope of their office or employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Family child care (FCC) providers, authorized members of the provider's household, and approved substitute providers while care under the FCC program is being provided in the manner prescribed in AR 608&hyph;10, except as excluded below. Such claims are generally limited to injuries to or death of children receiving care under the FCC program which are caused by the negligence of such individuals. Claims arising from the transportation of such children in motor vehicles and claims involving loss or damage of property are not cognizable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Although Non-NAFI RIMP claims do not involve employees of the United States, a claim under this section that is listed in &sect;536.51 of this part is not payable. For example, a soldier injured on a post golf course when hit by a golf cart operated by an authorized user is barred by the incident-to-service exclusion from recovering under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

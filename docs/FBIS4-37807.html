			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] When the legitimate Yemeni forces were on the verge  of settling the military confrontation in their favor after  tightening the noose on the secessionists, reports spoke  strongly of Saudi military concentrations on the Yemeni border.  This portends the danger that the conflict will expand and  deteriorate in that vital region.    The conspiratorial role played by Saudi Arabia against  fraternal Yemen is part of an orchestrated campaign led by the  United States and carried out by its agents in the region. U.S.  State Department reports had warned against the danger of Yemeni  unity to the Gulf region in general and to Saudi Arabia in  particular. The White House called for the need to accelerate a  crisis in Yemen that could kill the unity.    At the time, U.S. oil companies, especially Hunt, had  discovered huge oil finds in the south of Yemen, most notably in  Hadramaut. The company sent reports to U.S. officials affirming  that the Saudi-Yemeni border area had great oil potential. The  company expressed its concern over the difficulties it found in  digging and prospecting for oil in the Saudi-Yemeni border area.    The company frankly noted that oil exploration and  prospecting in the border areas would lead to deep political  problems between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Out of its commitment  to the basic motives of the U.S. strategy in the Gulf region,  the company asked U.S. officials for advice. It also asked that  the necessary measures be taken in this connection.    The report by Hunt clearly indicated that the process of the  border demarcation between Saudi Arabia and Yemen does not  include clear provisions on who controls the oilfields.    At that time and in accordance with the NAFTA agreement  between the United States and its Latin American neighbors, a  report by the Canadian company Canoscy mentioned that this  region contains--according to initial estimates--only 700  million barrels. Noting that several European companies had  begun invading the region, Washington expressed its concern at  the effect of this on U.S. interests. The Canoscy report  mentioned that around 40 European companies secured privileges  to explore and prospect for oil in the region.    In view of this, U.S. officials intervened so that Hunt  would  get the lion's share of oil prospecting in south Yemen. For  this purpose, butcher Schwarzkopf, who led the war to destroy  Iraq, and Zionist Henry Kissinger (Both work as advisers to  Hunt) paid a secret visit to Saudi Arabia in March. They met  Saudi officials and discussed ways to secure full control of  Yemeni oil. They claimed that north Yemen promised Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn that it would provide him with oil  royalties to enable him to rebuild Iraq's military power and  regain Iraq's superiority. They also claimed that this deal was  cut as part of a plan under which Iraq would modernize the  Yemeni army, transfer military and technical expertise to Yemen,  and enable Yemen to produce chemical weapons and weapons of mass  destruction.    Schwarzkopf and Kissinger claimed that in view of this,  Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states would fall between the  jaws of an Iraqi-Yemeni pincer with the aim of controlling the  Gulf oil.    Former U.S. President George Bush--who was appointed by Hunt  as a senior adviser, in addition to his posts in other oil  companies such as Exxon--was holding covert meetings with the  Saudi ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan, who  was the real leader of the front coordinating with the Americans  regarding Yemen.    This was preceded by secret meetings between secessionist  leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid--when he was Yemeni vice president--and  U.S. Vice President Al Gore during al-Bid's visit to Washington  for treatment last summer. Al-Bid asked for a meeting with the  U.S. vice president away from the gaze of the Yemeni ambassador  in Washington and embassy staff members. Al-Bid granted annual  leave to Yemeni Ambassador Muhsin al-'Ayni, who received  instructions from the Yemeni leadership in Sanaa to follow up  al-Bid's meetings in Washington. The Yemeni ambassador did not  realize the motives behind al-Bid's action. So the ambassador  informed the Yemeni capital that al-Bid did not intend to hold  meetings with U.S. officials.    Information has it that al-Bid met Al Gore, who affirmed  that  Washington would support him whatever stance he adopted. Al  Gore stressed that his country is governed by two basic options  regarding Yemeni unity.    The first option: If unity continued, Washington would  prefer 'Ali Salim al-Bid to be president of the state of unity.  Washington did not trust 'Ali Abdallah Salih's intentions,  especially after he supported Iraq during the Gulf crisis.    Regarding this option, al-Bid noted the difficulty in  achieving it in the light of the tribal and party makeup inside  Yemen, indicating that the congress party enjoyed wide bases of  support. But Gore advised him not to pacify the northern  leaders, emphasizing that the socialist party should abandon  unity as long as it could not assume power.    The second option: Maintaining the secessionist situation  inside Yemen.    In this regard, Gore said that Salih's aim behind unity was  control of the oilfields in the south and control of strategic  straits enjoyed by the south Yemen "state." The first step  Salih would take would be to remove the socialist party from  power.    Although the U.S. vice president submitted these two  options,  'Ali Salim al-Bid did not want unity to continue. He only  wanted to explore the U.S. view in this regard.    Gore claimed there was an expected alliance between Yemen  and  Iraq, which would lead to the loss of south Yemen's wealth. The  U.S. vice president gave al-Bid information on Iraqi contacts  with Yemen and Jordan to revive the idea of the Arab Cooperation  Council. He submitted false documents on contacts held among the  three states in this regard.    According to the reports, al-Bid emerged from that meeting  with one impression, namely, the need to abort the unity with  north Yemen's leaders and to let south Yemen monopolize its oil  resources.    During al-Bid's stay in Washington, a U.S. official gave him  an important report on huge oil discoveries in Ma'rib and four  other southern areas. The report noted that south Yemen could  become an economic giant if it could control its oil resources.    After reading the report, al-Bid met Saudi Ambassador in  Washington Bandar Bin-Sultan and asked him to tell the United  States of his real desire to secede from north Yemen and of his  fears of the consequences of secession if he were left alone in  the battlefield to face the northern forces.    Consequently, al-Bid obtained U.S. confirmation that the  United States would support his military stance and would not  allow the northern forces to get near Aden.    Following al-Bid's return from Washington, President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih asked for a report on his visit but al-Bid  fabricated a political crisis so as to avoid presenting any  reports on his Washington visit.    During that time, Prince Bandar Bin-Sultan arrived in Saudi  Arabia on a mission to brief Saudi officials on the outcome of  al- Bid's talks in Washington.    When the crisis escalated, the northerners made many  concessions for the sake of maintaining Yemeni unity while  al-Bid engaged in strengthening his ties with Saudi Arabia and  Kuwait. His deputy, Salim Salih, played a direct role in  obtaining financial support from Kuwait, which was later used to  buy weapons for south Yemen.    In light of the escalating developments that preceded the  outbreak of war in Yemen, the United States decided to build the  largest air base in the Jizan area near the Yemeni border and  placed the job of preparing it under the supervision of Sultan  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Saudi minister of defense and civil aviation,  who cut short a visit to Switzerland for treatment and returned  home to supervise the building of the base.    Information indicates that General Schwarzkopf's views were  sought. He proposed that the base should target Yemen and Iraq  so as to confront any expansion in the war.    These factors were behind the enthusiasm shown by the  southerners for the war against the legitimate forces. The  promises they got had an effect on the statements that were made  during the first days of the war, statements in which they  threatened to inflict defeat on the northern forces. But the  Yemeni people's rallying behind their national army thwarted the  plot of the secessionists and their supporters. This plot is on  the verge of final collapse under the blows inflicted on it by  those who believe in the unity of the fraternal Yemeni people.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVITATION BY BUSH TO TWO-DAY MEETING ON EDUCATION WELCOMED BY GOVERNORS  </P> <P> President Bush on Monday called on state governors to meet with him in  September for a two-day "summit" aimed at finding new ways to raise the quality  of American education.  </P> <P> "Together we can find ways to strengthen our schools, to enlarge opportunities  and to improve our nation's educational performance," the President told the  semiannual meeting of the National Governors Assn. here.  </P> <P> In general, the governors welcomed the idea as a way to call attention to the  problems of public education. Some were skeptical about whether much could be  accomplished by such a meeting unless the President seeks additional federal  funds to help state and local governments upgrade educational systems.  </P> <P> The idea for a summit meeting on education was first raised by Bush during the  1988 presidential campaign, when he vowed to be "the education President." He  mentioned the proposal again during a meeting with a group of governors in May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Specific Proposal  </P> <P> His remarks here Monday represented the first formal and specific invitation to  such a meeting. Bush said that the conference would be held on Sept. 27 and 28.  He did not say where.  </P> <P> The President did not spell out an agenda in his 20-minute speech to the  governors, but he did refer to the educational reform package he submitted to  Congress last April, in which he proposed setting up a system of awards to  encourage extra achievement on the part of schools and teachers and a  $100-million-a-year fund to help start and expand so-called "magnet schools"  offering special curricula.  </P> <P> "I don't view (a summit meeting) as something like today, where I spend a few  minutes and then take off," Bush said here. "This is going to be a session  where we will have an opportunity together to take a considerable amount of  time to discuss these issues."  </P> <P> "It certainly will be helpful," California Gov. George Deukmejian said of the  summit proposal. "I think the main thing the federal government and the  President can do is to continue to focus the nation's attention on the  importance of improvement in the quality of our educational program. By having  a presidential summit on education with the governors, that's certainly going  to highlight it."  </P> <P> "I think it will be a good thing," said Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, like Deukmejian  a Republican. "We need a national educational policy, and (federal officials)  can help give us direction and help us pull together."  </P> <P> "I actually think (Bush) wants to do something," Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a  Democrat, said. "We ought to give him the chance."  </P> <P> "I don't think you can do anything but profit from sitting down with 50  governors to discuss these issues," said New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, another  Democrat. Cuomo said that Bush deserved praise because "he is showing interest  in the issue and he is showing that he is willing to listen."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Cuomo said he is concerned that the President will simply "focus  attention on the issue and leave the states to pay for it."  </P> <P> Unless Bush relents in his opposition to new taxes, Cuomo said, "there is no  meaningful way you can make progress" on education or any of the other social  problems the states are facing.  </P> <P> After his speech here, Bush cut short what was to have been a two-day trip,  including Las Vegas and Oklahoma City, and returned to Washington because of  reports that pro-Iranian Muslims in Lebanon had executed U.S. Marine Lt. Col.  William R. Higgins.  </P></p>

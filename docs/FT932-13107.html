			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: An eye on the big earners - Nicholas Garnett meets a man who makes money from executives pay packets ARE Britain's directors and senior managers greedy? The Institute of Management thinks many are. It dished out strong criticism in a report this week on recent management pay rises. This was the latest side swipe from those uneasy about the rise of top people's pay and benefits in inverse ratio to the declining performance of the companies they run. Peter Brown, who has quickly built a successful little company advising on directors' remuneration packages says some of this criticism is justified. But he is keen to tell you what his company does not do. 'We are not called in to act as a bludgeon on the remuneration of company directors. That is not what we do at all.' His company, the Top Pay Research Group probably would not get any contracts if it did. Brown's business methods are somewhat softer and more sophisticated than a mallet. 'We are hired, often by non-executive directors to advise on whether remuneration policies in a particular company are appropriate and suggest alternatives on a range of things if we think that is required. We have never felt it necessary to recommend pay reductions but on a few occasions we suggested a freeze.' In its first year to November 1991, Top Pay Research earned a total fee income of just Pounds 21,000 but in the next 16 months to March this year, the company made Pounds 130,000. Overheads are low, Brown takes a reasonable salary and the company makes a pre-tax return of 30 per cent. At 57, Brown is a one of a breed of entrepreneurs more common in the US than in Britain. He is chairman of one largish library supply company, and a board member of a non-quoted chemicals company. He set up Top Pay Research as his own business which he runs part time. 'It is much more common in the US for people at the top of large companies to have their own businesses that they run alongside their other roles.' The parallel is not quite exact because Brown joined the library supply company when it purchased a remuneration surveys operation Brown had set up in the 1970s. Top Pay Research uses a small office in central London, Brown's wife, Rosemary, works as the researcher, there is a tiny secretarial staff and three consultants who visit client companies carrying out assessments. They are paid by Brown on freelance rates of Pounds 250 to Pounds 400 a day. 'I thought there was a niche for this type of business. We did a lot of research and a lot of marketing to potential clients without at the start getting companies to say yes but many eventually did.' The Top Pay Research spends some Pounds 6,000 a year on promotion. Brown's company was given a fillip early on by support from an initiative by the Confederation of British Industry and the Bank of England to encourage the use of non-executive directors and by last year's report by the committee on financial aspects of corporate governance chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury. Top Pay Research has worked for about 30 clients, including Smith and Nephew, Welsh Water and National Westminster Bank. The little company accepts contracts ranging from advice on whether it would be out of line with the rest of a particular industry if a chief executive were given a 7 rather than a 5-series BMW, to the level of overall directors pay and the suitability of share option and bonus schemes. This is largely done using remuneration information from businesses in similar sectors. 'In general, companies are happy to give us comparative information on this because they know they will not be mentioned individually in any report and that we do not keep records of this information on computer so they have no fear it will be spun off into a general database. In this business you must have the ability to get people to share information with you.' Individual pieces of work vary from Pounds 400 to Pounds 8,000 and the company has two retainers, the largest one of Pounds 13,000 a year. Half the company's inquiries come from chief executives and personnel directors, the rest from companies' in-house remuneration committees and their non-executive directors. 'We have to satisfy ourselves that our work will go to someone who will not directly benefit from it. That is the crux.' A quarter of inquiries are over pay rates for non-executive directors but the bulk centres on salaries, bonuses, pensions, share options and benefit packages for executive directors. 'There is often genuine uncertainty over remuneration packages. Some companies are concerned that their chief executives might be asking for too much. Sometimes the question is whether a package is structured correctly.' Share options which have gone 'under water' - the share price has plummeted  -are one fruitful area of Brown's work in which managers seek to reactivate incentives through new bonus systems, including parallel or so-called 'phantom' option schemes. 'Share price is not a very objective measure of performance,' says Brown, who is critical of over-dependence on this as a gauge for directors' bonuses. Incentives should be tied more to use of assets, accumulated profits and market share, he argues. Meshing two pay cultures when companies merge is another source of contracts. Brown acknowledges that when it comes to pay this 'meshing' is always upwards. Outside consultants on remuneration play an important role, Brown says. 'There must be harmony on company boards and one of the easiest ways of damaging that is to question each other's remuneration direct.' Brown says Top Pay Research's target is an annual fee income of Pounds 700,000 within another four years from about 100 clients. If that happens it will come from using the knowledge of which side his bread is buttered. 'You are not going to tell your clients what they don't want to know. What is the point of telling them to cut pay if that will not work. We give practical not other-worldly advice.' Top Pay Research Group, Upper Ground Floor, 9 Savoy Street, London WC2R 0BA.

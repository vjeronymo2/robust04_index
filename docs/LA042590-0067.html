			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THESE WOMEN FIND SUCCESS IS A BREEZE;  </P> <P> SAILING: TRACY EDWARDS AND HER ALL-FEMALE CREW ARE OVERCOMING STEREOTYPES AND  IMPRESSING COMPETITORS IN RACE AROUND THE WORLD.  </P> <P> When Tracy Edwards of England rounded up 11 friends to sail in a race around  the world, some in the yacht set nudged one another and made jokes about Gidget  Goes to Sea.  </P> <P> They wished her luck, waved her off -- and put the Coast Guard on alert.  </P> <P> When she drove her 58-foot sailboat Maiden toward the icebergs, gales,  four-story seas and other horrors of the Southern Ocean, they paled: This had  gone far enough.  </P> <P> Not quite. She and her crew had thousands of miles to go before they rested. On  Sept. 2 at Portsmith, England, they began sailing in this Whitbread Round the  World race. The competition is divided into four divisions, determined by boat  size. Never before had there been an all-female crew.  </P> <P> More than the ocean, Edwards feared failure, so she kept sailing, withstanding  stereotypes as well as the sea.  </P> <P> "You're brought up from when you're that high," Edwards said, reaching toward  the deck, "that women can't do certain things that guys can."  </P> <P> But, she said, English women are a lot like American women: "When we decide to  do something, we just go do it.  </P> <P> "Now that we've done it, they're all (saying), 'Brilliant . . . well done.'  They're surprised and pleased."  </P> <P> Edwards has a confession to make. She wasn't sure they could do it, either.  </P> <P> "Even though we said, 'Oh yes, we can do it,' we were a bit nervous because we  didn't know what to expect.  </P> <P> "This race has been an education for all 12 women on Maiden. It was a total  experiment . . . never been done before. People weren't aggressively opposed to  us doing it. They just didn't think we could."  </P> <P> So 29,095 nautical miles later, with only 3,837 to go, the yachting world is  impressed. So is Edwards.  </P> <P> "I think I've got the best crew in the race," she said. "We're the only crew  apart from (first-place) Steinlager that hasn't changed on the way around."  </P> <P> By the time they're done, that will be about nine months in the same boat.  </P> <P> "We'd been told time and again we wouldn't get on, (that) we were gonna argue  and be unhappy, so there was a bit of trepidation," said Edwards, who sold her  house to buy the boat.  </P> <P> "But it's been unbelievable. They're all very special ladies or they wouldn't  be there, and there were about 200 other applicants that could have easily gone  with us."  </P> <P> Edwards had no trouble collecting a crew. She received 460 applications and  interviewed more than 100 candidates.  </P> <P> "They were picked on an instinctive liking -- not just me for them but them for  me, as well," she said. "They have to trust me a lot to let me take them around  the world, when everyone was telling me it wasn't possible.  </P> <P> "If they walked into my office and we both clicked, they're on the boat now."  </P> <P> Edwards replaced the original first mate when it appeared she wouldn't work  out. The other 10 selections remained. They represent seven nationalities.  Three are married.  </P> <P> One -- Dawn Riley, 25, of Detroit -- is an American. A former captain of the  Michigan State sailing team, she signed up when she found herself "between  jobs."  </P> <P> Edwards will write a book that has its own stereotypes.  </P> <P> "The thing we have learned is that women are a lot more adaptable than men,"  she said. "I've done the race with 17 guys on a maxi, and I've done the race  with 11 women, so it's very clear to me: women have different problems on the  boat, but privacy doesn't seem to be a problem.  </P> <P> "We've got one head (restroom) on the boat. It's tiny and you can spend only a  short time in there before someone else needs to come in. But it hasn't been a  problem."  </P> <P> In the last Whitbread race, Edwards, 28, sailed with 17 males. One guess what  her position was: (a) captain, (b) grinder, (c) cook.  </P> <P> "This is an infinitely better job," she said.  </P> <P> From the galley in that other race, she watched and listened as the rest of the  crew got on one another's nerves, day by day. It hasn't been that way on  Maiden.  </P> <P> "Women seem to be a lot more comfortable with each other in an enclosed space  than the guys were," she said. "They all get on brilliantly together. It's not  out of necessity. They actually like each other and respect each other and  they're all fighting for the same thing. We all want to win."  </P> <P> Maiden is second among the five boats that started in Division D. Going into  the final leg, it trailed the French entry, L'Esprit de Liberte, by 41 1/2  hours.  </P> <P> Maiden has won Beefeater trophies for placing first in her division on two of  the five legs -- defeating all the men, of course.  </P> <P> "Men are much more aggressive and competitive with each other on a boat than  women are," Edwards said. "We don't feel any need for it."  </P> <P> Riley said: "A lot of guys who have done their own projects have big egos that  get in the way."  </P> <P> The only problem is strength.  </P> <P> "Although you can sail the boat with brains and common sense, you still need  strength," said Edwards, a former ballet dancer who is 5-feet-2 1/2, 119  pounds. "That's why we work so well together, because we can't pump up a huge  sail in one throw. We have to have two of us. We need each other.  </P> <P> "It works so well it's been even better than I thought it would be. It's  changed our lives forever."  </P> <P> The only concession Edwards made was in her choice of boats. She opted for one  of the smaller, Division D entries, knowing it would be easier to handle --  easier, not easy.  </P> <P> She calls it a "sensible size," compared to one of the event's monster, 80-foot  maxis, which she regards as "very powerful, very dangerous boats.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to have any accidents or do anything which anyone would pick up  on and say, 'There, I told you they couldn't do it.' "  </P> <P> The boat placed fourth in the '81-82 race but was 10 years old and needed a lot  of work. The women did it themselves, sanding, scraping, drilling and rigging.  </P> <P> "We've made the boat faster than it was when it was Disque d'Or III," Edwards  said. "We've got every right to feel proud of ourselves and proud of women in  general.  </P> <P> "We've had a similar response from women all over the world. We wanted to  project ourselves right from the beginning as not being women's lib or  feminists. What we wanted to say was, you don't have to be like that if you  want to sail.  </P> <P> "Girls can sail. They don't have to be macho. That's all we wanted to say."  </P></p>

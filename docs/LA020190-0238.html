			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEAM PROBABLY WON'T PROTECT DOUG WILLIAMS;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: MVP OF '88 SUPER BOWL MAY BECOME A PLAN B FREE AGENT. BRONCOS'  CLARENCE KAY AND STEELERS' TODD BLACKLEDGE ALSO MAY NOT BE PROTECTED.  </P> <P> Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, the Most Valuable Player in the  1988 Super Bowl, was expected to be missing from the team's 37-man protected  list submitted to the NFL today.  </P> <P> Other players who might become Plan B free agents are starting tight end  Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback  Todd Blackledge. As Plan B free agents, the players would be free to negotiate  with any team or re-sign with their present team.  </P> <P> Williams, 34, would have earned $1.2 million this season. If he chooses to stay  in Washington, the team would not be obligated to pay him the salary he would  have earned were he kept on the protected list.  </P> <P> The Redskins will not release their list of protected players until Friday, a  team spokesman said.  </P> <P> Williams, who threw for four touchdowns and 340 yards in Washington's 42-10  victory over Denver in the Super Bowl XXII, has said he is "positive" that he  will be excluded from the Redskins' list of protected players. He saw limited  playing time last year because of a back injury and finished the season clearly  the No. 2 quarterback behind Mark Rypien.  </P> <P> In Denver, Kay said Wednesday that Broncos coach Dan Reeves told him "don't be  surprised" if his name showed up on the team's Plan B list.  </P> <P> All NFL teams were to submit today a list of 37 protected players to the league  office.  </P> <P> Kay, a starter the last six seasons, said he thought there was a 50-50 chance  he would be exposed to Plan B free agency.  </P> <P> Among the Bronco veterans who are likely prospects for Plan B are running back  Sammy Winder and offensive guard Keith Bishop.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Todd Blackledge's contract expires  today, and the Steelers will not offer him a new one, according to a published  report.  </P> <P> The Steelers planned to begin their search for a replacement for Blackledge  today when several coaches and scouts were to work out former Green Bay  quarterback Randy Wright at the University of Wisconsin, the Pittsburgh  Post-Gazette said.  </P> <P> Blackledge was the Steelers' backup quarterback for two years. Except for him,  most of those left unprotected probably will be invited to training camp by the  Steelers if they do not sign with another team.  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengals place-kicker Jim Breech said he expects to be one of the  team's unprotected players because the team knows he doesn't want to leave the  Cincinnati area.  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / MPs seek reform of university spending Sloppy purchasing procedures cost the 'old' universities in England at least Pounds 30m per year, the cross-party Commons public accounts committee says in a report issued yesterday. It recommends reforms to universities' financial management, and calls on the Higher Education Funding Council for England, an education department quango, to take the lead in ensuring the savings were made. The figure excludes 'new' universities recently converted from polytechnics. The report says: 'We note the acceptance by the higher education sector that savings of at least 5 per cent are achievable from improved purchasing practices, equivalent to over Pounds 30m each year for the old universities sector in England alone.' It found that large numbers of staff had purchasing responsibilities, and that 'in some universities there were lapses in the fundamental requirement that an invoice should be authorised for payment by a different person to that raising the related purchasing order'. The committee recommends publishing comparisons on prices paid for a 'substantial basket of goods'. Research shows that could have saved 5 per cent if they all bought 27 commonly used items at their average price. Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the funding council, welcomed the report. He said it would allow further progress to be made, but he added that universities had achieved savings of Pounds 1.7bn since 1988-89 by 'expanding their student numbers without a proportionate increase in public funding'.

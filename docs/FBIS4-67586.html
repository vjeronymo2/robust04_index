			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Steen Voigt report: "Auken Brings Together Eastern </F> Europe's Top Environmental People"]    [Text] The environment ministers of all the countries of  Eastern Europe will meet in Copenhagen in June at the invitation  of Svend Auken to discuss "soft loans" for environmental  investments. The aim is to accelerate environmental work in the  East.    It is of crucial importance for improved and increased  environmental work in the countries of Eastern Europe that they  have access to cheaper forms of finance for their environmental  investments -- in water and air purification installations, for  example.    So said Environment Minister Svend Auken (Social Democratic  Party) who has invited all his East European counterparts to  Copenhagen for the first three days in June to discuss "soft  loans" in the environmental field in order to exert pressure on  international banks.    The environment ministers from the three Baltic countries,  Russia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine have accepted the invitation.  This is the fist time that so many East European environment  ministers will have been brought together.    "Like the countries of Eastern Europe Denmark is tired of  the  fact that reports are written and large-scale investigations are  carried out without anything coming of them," Svend Auken said  yesterday when he announced the meeting. "Now we want to show  that something can be done."    Svend Auken has long been pressing the EBRD [European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development], for example, to grant  cheaper "soft loans" with lower interest rates, longer repayment  periods, and a repayment-free period if the loan is for  environmental purposes.    Today international banks do not have different interest  rates for purely commercial loans and environmental loans. This  is slowing down the environmental work in Eastern Europe whose  countries with their weak currencies need an immediate economic  return rather than an environmental return from their  investments.    "The idea behind the meeting is to influence the  decisionmaking processes of the banks, but also to make this  into a major issue when we meet in Sofia next year at the  pan-European environment conference," Auken said.    Representatives of the EBRD, the World Bank, The European  Investment Bank, and the EU [European Union] Commission have  also been invited to the meeting in Copenhagen.</p>

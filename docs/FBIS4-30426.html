			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Song-chu: "The Prospect for U.S.-North Korea </F> Summit in the Wake of U.S. Secretary of State's Remarks"]    [Text] After former U.S. President Jimmy Carter visited  North Korea, a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear issue  has suddenly been made, paving the way for an inter-Korean  summit--the first one ever--and the third round of high-level  U.S.-North Korea talks slated for next month. With these talks  ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a CNN  interview on 24 June, touched on the possibility of a summit  between U.S. President Bill Clinton and North Korean President  Kim Il-song.    In light of this, public interest is arising on a U.S.-North  Korea summit.    When asked about the chances for a U.S.-North Korea summit,  Secretary of State Christopher said that North Korea has not yet  established the kind of record that would justify a U.S.-North  Korea summit. But, he said that such a possibility exists if  North Korea changes its present stance and starts having the  kind of behavior that justifies a summit.    Since he made clear that this would only come after the  normalization of bilateral diplomatic ties, holding such a  meeting at an early date would be realistically impossible.  However, the fact that the issue was brought up hints several  things.    First, the U.S. Government insinuated that it has the will  to  normalize diplomatic ties, aside from the chances of a summit.  This may promote bilateral relations sooner than expected. In  other words, by partly showing a carrot, "a bilateral summit,"  this could induce North Korea to assume a more flexible stance.    The card called a U.S.-North Korea summit is something that  deserves to be considered by President Clinton, who has repeated  diplomatic failures in the Bosnian crisis, the extension of  China's most-favorite-nation status, and the Haitian matter.    President Clinton has received criticism from both the  ruling  and opposition parties for being incompetent and indecisive on  the North Korean nuclear issue. Under such a condition, he may  attempt to get a firm political foothold with a summit with  President Kim Il-song.    With a nonpresidential election slated for next November,  the  Democratic Party is now in a weaker position than the Republican  Party.    For President Kim Il-song, who became a familiar face to the  American people as he appeared on U.S. television day after day  after Carter's visit to Pyongyang, he could bear diplomatic  fruits beyond his expectations in the event the summit is held.    Explaining the results of his visit to the United States,  former U.S. President Carter once said that "There is something  I have not talked about" and "this can only be told to Clinton  and Christopher." Chances are high that it has something to do  with the summit.    Nonetheless, we will just have to wait and see to confirm  whether or not Secretary of State Christopher's remark is mere  diplomatic rhetoric.</p>

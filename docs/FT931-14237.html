			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chicago seeks bigger share of forex market THE Chicago Mercantile Exchange hopes to grab a bigger slice of the Dollars 1,000bn per day global foreign exchange market with plans to offer futures and options contracts that resemble over-the-counter spot currency transactions. The new contracts, known as 'rolling spot' contracts, will be four times the size of the CME's existing foreign currency products, a feature that should make them more palatable to the institutional traders who dominate foreign exchange trading. The exchange plans first to offer rolling spot futures and options based on sterling with a contract size of 250,000, and then extend the concept to five other currencies on which it trades conventional futures. The products have been submitted for regulatory review, and the CME hopes to launch them by June. The futures and options will expire quarterly and be quoted in terms identical to the interbank market. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman, said: 'The spot market place as it stands is needlessly cumbersome and inefficient. Each of these spot transactions and rolls exacts a tremendous toll on banks, in that they involve considerable transactional and operational expenses, as well as the potential for costly mistakes in actual payment flows. The Merc's clearing house will streamline this process by automatically adjusting for the roll, most likely in variation margin.'</p>

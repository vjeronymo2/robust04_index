			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Eighty people were hurt when rival members of Mexico's oil workers' union,  still feuding after the arrest of their powerful boss in January, clashed over  control of a union local in Veracruz state, about 135 miles east of Mexico  City. Police said that about 200 club-swinging workers stormed union  headquarters in the oil town of Poza Rica in a bid to oust members of a rival  faction that had seized the building. Police broke up the clash but made no  arrests, a spokesman said. The skirmish apparently pitted union members backing  the new national leadership against followers of Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, who  was arrested on arms-smuggling and murder charges in January.  </P></p>

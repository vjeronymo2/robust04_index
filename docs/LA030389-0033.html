			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RUSH LEADS VALLEY PAST SAN MATEO INTO STATE JC SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> Tisa Rush landed on her backside but came up smiling. The Valley College  freshman guard was so happy about sinking a layup that she felt little pain  from the fall.  </P> <P> "I had been bricking on my layups tonight, so I was relieved just to get one  in," Rush said.  </P> <P> Rush scored a game-high 21 points to lead the Valley women's basketball team to  an 84-68 victory over College of San Mateo in a California junior college  championship quarterfinal game at Valley on Thursday night.  </P> <P> The Lady Monarchs (30-3) will play Fullerton College (27-1), a 87-70 winner  over Contra Costa, in the semifinals at 8 tonight.  </P> <P> College of the Sequoias (34-3) will play American River College (27-4) at 6  tonight in the other semifinal game. Sequoias defeated Golden West, 80-61, and  American River was a 77-62 winner over Los Angeles Trade Tech in earlier games.  </P> <P> By virtue of the play of Rush and Christine Rumfola, who added 16 points,  Valley had a relatively easy time dispatching San Mateo. The Lady Monarchs led,  42-33, at halftime and did not allow the Bulldogs (29-2) within 10 points in  the second half.  </P> <P> Yet despite the Lady Monarchs' lead, Valley Coach Doug Michelson remained wary  of the Bulldogs, who had won 21 consecutive games before Thursday.  </P> <P> "I have been around basketball long enough to know that a 10-point lead in the  second half is not enough," Michelson said.  </P> <P> Rush broke open a close game with a three-point shot as time ran out in the  first half.  </P> <P> "That was a huge momentum play for us," Michelson said. "She had a great  offensive game, but she also did a great job defensively on a big-time point  guard, (Eleanor) Wells."  </P> <P> San Mateo led for the first seven minutes until Valley pulled even, 11-11, on  Rush's first three-point basket. Rush added a basket 28 seconds later to put  Valley ahead to stay.  </P> <P> Rush, who averages 11.5 points and 3.8 assists a game, was three for three from  three-point range and made nine of 14 field-goal tries.  </P> <P> Shagarro Lattin added 14 points for Valley and Sandrine Rocher scored 12 points  off the bench. Center Ruth Aguilar, who averages a team-high 14.7 points a  game, sat out part of the second half because of foul trouble and added only  seven points.  </P> <P> Lattin filled in for Aguilar on the boards with six rebounds to lead Valley,  which has won 14 games in a row.  </P> <P> Valencia Hedgebeth scored 21 points for San Mateo and center Pauline Manu added  15.  </P></p>

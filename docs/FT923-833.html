			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / As They Say in Europe: 'It is not a war yet' 'AT THE outset, small calculations, children of the short term, of circumstances and of the vanity of a head of state; at the end, an historic event which transcends France but with a result sufficiently narrow that nobody, from one side or the other, can evaluate it.' Serge July's summing up in Liberation (he was writing about the outcome of a referendum in France last weekend, by the way) showed the crisp, modern side of French journalism. A more traditional approach appeared in Les Echos: 'Voila, France has spoken. Everyone illuminates with their own commentary this morning the historic choice they have just made . . . This choice having been expressed, France finds itself more than ever facing herself.' That piece was signed with the pen name Favilla. Favilla's piece last Monday was, as usual, faintly at odds with the resolute 'Oui' policy of Les Echos. In the paper of the Communist Party, L'Humanite, there was no room for divergent opinions: 'Those who constitute the living forces of the country - the world of work - in the majority said No. The proof is in the result of the cities and regions where communist influence is strong: the opposition to Maastricht achieved impressive results.' The trouble is that those regions also are those where the right-wing National Front has influence. France-Soir, surprisingly, took an international approach. 'Europe, Francois Mitterrand and the cream of the political class just about got away with it . . . But the battle is not yet won because Maastricht has now to cross the channel, chased by the waves of the pound sterling . . .' That was before the pound bumped into the franc going the same way. The British provided a lot of material, both in connection with the treaty and other matters which seem to have generated another round of that genial contempt their neighbours often reserve for them. The London correspondent of La Tribune wrote that the French referendum result would not make things easy for John Major. 'On the positive side, it can be said that the concern dear to the prime minister's heart - to put the United Kingdom 'at the heart of Europe', even though he signed a treaty specially amended for Great Britain - has not led to an impasse. On the negative side, the cabinet has no choice now but to pursue ratification of the treaty in the House of Commons.' We might very well have seen the end of 'John and Helmut' as a result of recent events. Everybody noted how the Germans and the British had fallen out over the manner in which, with one bound, the pound leapt free from the fetters of the ERM. It then achieved the triumphant collapse advocated by Lady Thatcher and her friends. Things got so bad at the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington that a Bundesbank official was heard to say: 'Es ist doch kein Krieg' ('It's not a war yet'). In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jochen Rudolph wrote at length under the headline, 'The pound on the defensive.' He discussed the long opposition to Britain's presence in the ERM and predicted it would not be back again for many a long day. 'Once,' said Rudolph, 'it was the 'ugly gnomes of Zurich' who were publicly blamed for the weakness of the pound . . . Then the Germans became the main culprits for the misery of sterling. And, ultimately, they were blamed for not having taken over the role of 'locomotive' in the world economy.' WHEN THE French finance minister, Michel Sapin, gave a briefing to French reporters in Washington as soon as the referendum result became known, he was asked by Paul Fabra of Le Monde why so many had voted No. 'Oh well, you know, many people are unhappy about social problems, unemployment. Others are concerned about agriculture.' Fabra, possibly the most respected journalist in France, replied: 'I am perfectly happy, I have no social problems, I have a job, I don't care about agriculture and I voted No.' James Morgan is diplomatic correspondent of the BBC World Service</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Acquisition lifts Mayflower MAYFLOWER, the Surrey-based specialist engineer, reported profits markedly ahead from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 1.58m pre-tax in the six months to June 26. Turnover jumped from Pounds 5.62m to Pounds 32.6m. The outcome partly reflected the inclusion of Motor Panels, acquired from the administrators of CH Industrial last September. The operation, based at Coventry and Wigan in the UK and Ohio and North Carolina in the US, and famed for its body panels for certain Jensen and Rolls-Royce models, saw sales from Wigan rise 16 per cent and US sales advance 34 per cent. Negotiations for the disposal of non-core businesses were at an advanced stage, directors said. An interim of 0.4p is declared - the first pay-out since 1987 - from earnings of 1.34p (0.05p) per share.</p>

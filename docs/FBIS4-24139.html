			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Up to 150 Zairian parliamentarians have decided to  end the seven-week boycott of the Assembly. They originally  walked out in protest at attempts to sideline opposition leader  Etienne Tshisekedi, who claims to be prime minister. But, last  week, the parliament chose Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister, and  on the face of it Etienne Tshisekedi is out in the cold. On the  line to Brussels, Chris Greene asked Justine Kasavubu,  spokeswoman for Tshisekedi's UDPS [Union for Democracy and  Social Progress] party if the return of the deputies wasn't a  slap in the face for Tshisekedi:    [Begin recording] [Kasavubu] No, no, not at all, not at all.  You are mistaken. I think you are totally wrong, no. If you  can remember, the call Mr. Tshisekedi did about on the 5th of  June for a general strike, it was a massive, a massive support  in favor of this appeal for Mr. Tshisekedi. So, he still has  the people on his side.    [Greene] But, he is isolated in parliament and the foreign  donors are no longer interested in supporting him.    [Kasavubu] No, no, it is only Paris -- France -- who are  still corrupting some of our politicians in order to, you know,  push them and not to support Mr. Tshisekedi, but this doesn't  come from the people of Zaire at all.    [Greene] But, inside, Kengo Wa Dondo must have been boosted  by all these deputies deciding to return to Parliament.    [Kasavubu] No, I don't think so, and please give yourself  some time in the coming weeks and you will see what will happen.  I don't think that Kengo Wa Dondo or Mobutu now they can cry  for victory. Just wait and see and you will see that the truth  is on Mr. Tshisekedi's side.    [Greene] Can you give our listeners a preview of what is  going to happen in the coming weeks?    [Kasavubu] Well, it is going to be more and more civil  disobedience, boycott of French enterprises, and even Belgium --  if ever Belgium happens to change its position in favor of  Mobutu. So, we think that we have no choice now, it is going to  be resistance until we get this democratization process under  way. [end recording]</p>

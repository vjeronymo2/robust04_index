			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ANTI-DRUG POLICE TEAM WILL SPREAD A WIDER NET;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: SIGNAL HILL, SANTA MONICA AND UCLA POLICE, SHERIFF'S  DEPARTMENT TO JOIN WESTNET.  </P> <P> WESTNET's first arrest nabbed more than $500,000 in cash and 30 kilos of  cocaine just as the suspected dealers tried to move to a new location by  concealing the cocaine in packages wrapped like birthday gifts.  </P> <P> Since that raid nearly 18 months ago, the Westside Narcotics Enforcement Team  has seized more than $3.5 million in cash, well over a ton of cocaine and other  drugs, and scores of vehicles and weapons, while arresting 57 suspected drug  traffickers. Ninety-five percent of the arrests have led to convictions,  according to the team's leader, Capt. Tim Grimmond of the El Segundo Police  Department.  </P> <P> The successes of the team -- initially created by the Inglewood, El Segundo,  Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Palos Verdes Estates police, with Redondo  Beach and Hawthorne quickly joining in -- have attracted the attention of  several other police departments.  </P> <P> This month, WESTNET will expand out of the South Bay as four new police  agencies come on board -- the Santa Monica Police Department, UCLA's police  force, the county Sheriff's Department and the Signal Hill Police Department.  </P> <P> With the expansion to 11 agencies, WESTNET's original team of nine officers  will be joined by a second team of nine, doubling its investigative capacity.  </P> <P> The operation's growth warrants giving it headquarters of its own, El Segundo  city officials have decided. The city is putting up $100,000 to turn the  basement of City Hall into a new home for WESTNET.  </P> <P> Each police department assigns officers to WESTNET when it joins the team. The  agencies also provide equipment, such as cars, radios and computers.  </P> <P> Although Grimmond said he knew WESTNET would do well when it started in  January, 1989, its rapid growth has pleased police agencies throughout the  county.  </P> <P> "We're a small community in Los Angeles, and we realize that criminals just  cross jurisdictional borders without even thinking about it," said Sgt. John  Miehle, assistant to the Santa Monica Police Department's chief.  </P> <P> "We can't just close ourselves into our borders and think that criminals live  here and commit their crimes here and nothing else," he said. "That's why we're  joining WESTNET. We're more than happy to pool our information and our  resources, because we know that always works out better."  </P> <P> Before the team's creation, Grimmond said: "South Bay police handled narcotics  on a very local level, with very little surveillance and very little effort put  into regional problems. We worked hand-to-hand sales and saw maybe two to three  kilos in a big bust."  </P> <P> In 1987 and 1988, however, local narcotics officers began noticing a  proliferation of cocaine in the South Bay, at roughly the same time crack was  coming on the scene, Grimmond said.  </P> <P> Although larger police departments had the resources to create special drug  enforcement teams, smaller South Bay departments did not have that option.  </P> <P> WESTNET grew out of their frustration, Grimmond said.  </P> <P> Drug dealers "operate all over. They know no boundaries," he said. "They move  as fast and as far as cars and planes will take them. That's how we have to  move."  </P> <P> Although the team's cases all begin with information gathered in the South Bay,  Grimmond said, most leads eventually take them out of this area.  </P> <P> Their biggest haul to date -- 491 kilos of cocaine hidden behind a false  partition in a 20-foot tractor-trailer rig -- was taken at a truck stop just  outside Barstow.  </P> <P> On some cases, Grimmond said, individual officers have spent weeks on  surveillance before making an arrest.  </P> <P> Police officials, however, say they are not concerned about the amount of time  the team spends outside its home area.  </P> <P> "By pooling your resources, you can start to solve the problem. There are no  walls around this place," said Chief John Barber of the UCLA police agency.  "One of the real benefits for us, too, is that an officer working on a  specialized task force is working with some of the best experts in the world. .  . . We get back a better officer."  </P> <P> Officers assigned to WESTNET will rotate out every two or three years, Barber  said. Not least among the benefits, police chiefs say, is that federal drug  asset seizure laws allow local agencies to keep a large portion of the cash,  cars and other assets that have been used in drug transactions.  </P> <P> This means that at least $250,000 has gone to each WESTNET member agency so  far, more than covering the operation's cost.  </P> <P> "Our primary objective is to arrest these people and prosecute them," Grimmond  said. "But it's been a big boon to law enforcement to have something like this  pay for itself, too."  </P></p>

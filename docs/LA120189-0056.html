			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SIGNS BILL CREATING CIA OVERSIGHT POST;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: CONGRESS GETS ITS WAY OVER A RELUCTANT PRESIDENT. THE NEED FOR AN  INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR AROSE DURING THE IRAN-CONTRA INQUIRY.  </P> <P> President Bush on Thursday reluctantly signed into law a bill creating a new  independent inspector general within the CIA, two years after such a move was  called for by congressional investigators of the Iran-Contra affair.  </P> <P> Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to the oversight posts  at other government agencies that review federal programs and seek to ferret  out abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing U.S. intelligence activities  for the coming year.  </P> <P> While the precise spending authorized by the bill is secret, it reportedly  involves between $25 billion and $30 billion for intelligence collection and  analysis, upgraded spy satellites and other hardware, and covert operations  overseas.  </P> <P> In a statement, Bush said the new inspector general post "could impair the  ability of the CIA to collect vitally needed intelligence information by  creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed."  </P> <P> To secure cooperation, the CIA "must be able to assure foreign individuals and  organizations that their identities, the fact of their association with the  United States, and the information they provide are not subject to exposure,"  said Bush, a former CIA director.  </P> <P> CIA Director William H. Webster said Wednesday that while the provision could  damage confidence of foreign intelligence services in the agency's ability to  keep secrets, he would seek to rebuild safeguards against compromising  intelligence sources and methods.  </P> <P> Bush said his objections were mitigated by a provision that would let the CIA  director kill any inspector general's investigation he believed might  compromise national security interests.  </P> <P> The new inspector general would be appointed by the President and confirmed by  the Senate, and the auditor's reports would be available to the House and  Senate committees that oversee U.S. intelligence.  </P> <P> Currently, the agency's inspector general is appointed by the CIA director and  reports only to him. That arrangement has caused friction with the House  Intelligence Committee, which has been denied access to some reports.  </P> <P> Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandal said the  agency's inspector general lacked independence and did not have "the manpower,  resources or tenacity" to uncover arms-for-hostages transactions or the  diversion of profits to Nicaragua's rebels.  </P></p>

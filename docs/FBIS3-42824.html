			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Yelena Imedashvili: "Yeltsin Was Met in Tbilisi </F> With Music"]    [Text]  <H3>  Mikhail Ukleba: "Today's Realities Permit the Development of  Good-Neighbor Relations..." </H3>   A president of Russia has for the first time visited an  independent Georgia. "In the age-old history of Georgian-Russian  relations this is a significant event," Eduard Shevardnadze  declared. "Russian leaders came to Georgia earlier also, but  they came as to a colony...." At the airport the head of the  Russian state was greeted by an orchestra. But only the  initiated know that for want of suitable musicians in Tbilisi,  worn out by war and political strife, the presidential orchestra  had been brought into the city several days prior to this.    "The Friendship, Good-Neighborliness, and Cooperation Treaty  is a symbol of the new relations between Russia and  Georgia"--this was how Mikhail Ukleba, deputy minister of  foreign affairs of the Republic of Georgia, characterized the  significance of the Russian president's visit in conversation  with your OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "The Russian and  Georgian delegations performed a great deal of work. There were  five rounds of negotiations to prepare the documents, on the  basis of which mutual relations between the two states will be  built. Permanent political dialogue will enable us to develop  good-neighbor relations, and in the future, possibly, allied  relations at a new level. A great deal has to be done to restore  the traditional economic relations. We are confronted with the  task of a settlement of the conflicts in Abkhazia and the  Tskhinvali region."  <H3>  Snap Poll for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA of Leaders of Georgia's  Political Parties </H3>   Georgiy Chanturia, chairman of the National  Democratic Party of Georgia: "We take a positive view of the  visit and see it as an opportunity for a settlement of relations  between Russia and Georgia. How successful this proves will  depend to a large extent on Mr. Yeltsin and what Russia wants to  see in the shape of Georgia: an independent neighbor or a  semi-colonial country. We understand by the rapprochement of the  two states civilized mutual relations and we support such a  policy. But we are categorically opposed to agreements that  could be followed by a loss of Georgian statehood."    Vazha Adamia, chairman of the Merab Kostava  Society: "We are for cooperation and a strengthening of  contacts. But not such as Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the  Georgian state, proposes. We are opposed to enslaving agreements  and opposed to his decision concerning Georgia's membership in  the CIS."    Irakliy Tsereteli, chairman of the National  Independence Party: "Our party's attitude toward the visit is  unequivocal: The head of a state which since 1921 has  perpetrated against Georgia permanent aggression is coming to  independent Georgia. Russian forces of occupation are still  here. Yeltsin's visit will have bad results for Georgia,  primarily because it is Shevardnadze, who is his 'assistant,'  who will be meeting him.    Nodar Natadze, leader of the Popular Front of  Georgia: "The visit is in itself a positive phenomena, but I  have no great hopes that this might exert a positive influence  on the situation in Abkhazia or South Ossetia."    Guram Muchaidze, leader of the Social Democratic  Party of the Republic of Georgia: "We advocate the maximum  rapprochement with Russia. We welcome any steps aimed at the  establishment of good-neighbor relations. Had we moved toward a  rapprochement with Russia earlier, Georgia would not be in the  deplorable condition in which it finds itself today. As far as  the signing of the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between  Georgia and Russia is concerned, we may say just one thing:  better late than never."</p>

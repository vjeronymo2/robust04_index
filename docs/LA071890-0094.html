			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Agency Wants to Lower Asbestos Limits: The Labor Department's Occupational  Safety and Health Administration has proposed halving the average number of  fibers allowable in the air to 0.1 per cubic centimeter. The agency reduced the  level from 2.0 to 0.2 in 1986. The latest proposal would require reports by  owners of buildings where asbestos is disturbed, as well as special provisions  for handling asbestos used in such services as auto brake and clutch repair.  </P></p>

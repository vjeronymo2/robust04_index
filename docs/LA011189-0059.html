			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Shamrock Holdings said the Delaware Supreme Court granted the Burbank firm a  quick appeal of a Chancery Court judge's ruling last week upholding the  validity of a Polaroid Corp. employee stock plan. Shamrock, owned by the family  of Roy E. Disney, has launched a hostile $2.4-billion bid to buy the shares in  the Cambridge, Mass., instant photography company that it doesn't already own.  Shamrock wants to overturn the stock plan because it puts 14% of Polaroid's  stock into the hands of employees, which makes it difficult for Shamrock to  acquire enough Polaroid stock to complete a merger under Delaware law.  </P></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Kao Corp climbs 3% over year KAO Corp, the Tokyo-based soap, cosmetics and chemicals manufacturer, yesterday announced a 3 per cent rise in parent net profits to Y22.7bn (Dollars 169m) for the year to March on a 3.8 per cent advance in sales to Y591.8bn. Consolidated sales rose 10.3 per cent to Y729.9bn and consolidated net profits edged ahead 0.2 per cent to Y20.0bn.

Chemical sales grew 3 per cent to Y79.5bn. The largest increase of 8.3 per cent to Y25.7bn was for fatty chemicals. Aggressive marketing activities led to strong gains in fatty alcohol and glycerin sales. Parent company sales for the current year are forecast to rise 4 per cent to Y615bn and net income by the same amount to Y23.5bn. Kao expects consolidated sales to rise 4 per cent to Y760bn and consolidated net profits by 12.5 per cent to Y22.5bn. The dividend is being increased to Y5 per share, up from Y4.1.</p>

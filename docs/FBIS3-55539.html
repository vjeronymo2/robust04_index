			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent A. Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today at the eastern district prefecture building in  Moscow, a working conference of the leaders of the Russian  All-People's Union [RANU] took place.    The conference began with a wave of displeasure in the hall  when the chairwoman attempted to address those in attendance as  gentlemen. However, this vexing slip of the tongue did not  affect the course of the meeting. On the agenda were economic  and political issues as well as the RANU's tasks for the next  six months.    The greater part of a speech by Nikolay Pavlov, one of the  RANU leaders, was devoted to criticizing the president and the  government. On the whole, it contained nothing new: the  accusation that Yeltsin and the government had organized the  putsch, the dissolution of parliament, the slump in  manufacturing, corruption and criticism of foreign policy, and  of the START II treaty in particular. It was asked why so many  people had perished on October 3-4 if the balance of forces in  the new parliament will not, in the opinion of RANU members, be  in favor of those now in power, in so far as former deputies and  opposition members have once again got into the Duma. [sentence  as heard]    There was, however, recognition that the RANU is an  insufficiently powerful political force and therefore it has  been decided to re-register the movement as a party.</p>

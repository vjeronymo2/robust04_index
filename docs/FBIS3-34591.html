The latest  crime was the ugly one that took place in Sarajevo's market on 5  February, which claimed the lives of 68 people and wounded 200  others.    Hence, there was nothing odd in seeing Egypt support a  policy  that is the opposite of its firm stance on international  armaments and the arms race. Egypt's firm policy on this issue  is based on the need to stop the arms race, to remove chemical  and nuclear weapons, and to establish peace and stability in  parts of the world where conditions allow. This policy  underlines the credibility of international legitimacy, which  has raised the slogan of security, stability, and human rights,  and has decided to confront any aggression against peoples.    International legitimacy succeeded very effectively after  the  Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Reaction to this aggression  showed the backing and support for what was termed international  legitimacy and the hopes of many peoples, particularly the Third  World peoples. But the Serbian aggression against human rights  in Bosnia, which has continued for more than two years without  appropriate action on the part of international legitimacy, has  been a lethal blow to this legitimacy, especially as the  television networks are conveying truthfully and without  exaggeration what is happening on Bosnian territory and the  barbaric crimes that humanity can only be ashamed of. This has  prompted Europeans and Americans to stage dozens of  demonstrations demanding that their governments take effective  action to stop these aggressions that have distorted the image  of Western civilization and underlined the imbalance of the  human rights slogans raised by Western governments whose  criteria differ noticeably from one country to another.    President Mubarak touched on the Bosnian tragedy when he met  the Armed Forces officers and soldiers. He very clearly held  the European countries responsible for what is happening there  and reiterated that the international community has to uphold  its full commitments to this problem in support of the  credibility of international legitimacy and in order to save the  principle of peaceful coexistence, which this legitimacy affirms.    Egypt's request to the Security Council to lift the embargo  on arming the Bosnian people has met with some international  welcome. Egypt stresses that its request falls within the  context of the UN resolutions and charters, which stress the  right of every country to self-defense against any outside  aggression. The meetings that Egypt's UN permanent envoy has  held with the heads of the five permanent member delegations in  the Security Council on adopting appropriate deterrent measures  against the aggressor Serbian forces represent a new action for  Egyptian diplomacy.    Egypt, while moving in all directions to stop this tragedy,  is certainly expressing the stifled cries in the hearts of Arab  and Muslim peoples. It should be recalled that these peoples  supported international legitimacy in repelling the Iraqi  aggression against Kuwait even though Iraq was an Arab League  member. All this underlines the credibility of the Arab people  in dealing with issues without any double standards.</p>

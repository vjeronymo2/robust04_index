			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Retailers find little cheer at Christmas Retailers seem set for a gloomy Christmas. With 11 trading days left, a business survey yesterday reported retailers' confidence falling and suggested that profit margins will be under severe pressure. The survey, from the Confederation of British Industry, provides fresh evidence of the 'feel bad' factor souring Britain's economic recovery. Weak sales forced the retail trade to keep annual price increases in November at their lowest level for at least 11 years, the CBI said. Mr James May, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said retailers were likely to see a 'tough Christmas'. Official retail sales data, due tomorrow, were likely to show High Street inflation was lower than 1 per cent in November, he said. The CBI survey is expected to fuel stock market concerns that intense price competition and low consumer spending will further erode profits and margins in the run-up to Christmas. However, it boosted City hopes that November's official inflation data, published today, will show continuing low price pressures. This might ease some of the impetus for another interest rates rise, fuelled earlier this week by rising raw material costs. Yesterday's data indicate why some shops have introduced pre-Christmas sales. 'In terms of margins and profits it is very tough - people are going to have to adjust their ideas of profits,' Mr May said. The CBI said its survey showed retailers reporting the lowest annual growth in selling prices in November since the price survey started in 1983. Selling prices were reduced by 24 per cent of shops compared with last November. Some 25 per cent of shops expected prices to be lower in December than last Christmas, with 37 per cent expecting them to be higher, a positive balance of 12. Discounting in November succeeded in slightly boosting overall retail sales volumes, the survey suggested. The level of sales reported by retailers in November was slightly better than in October, with 40 per cent of retailers reporting sales higher than in the previous November. However, this was below retailers' expectations in the previous quarterly survey, and the level of optimism fell to its lowest level for two years, with 74 per cent of retailers expecting no improvements in the next three months. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's survey panel, said there appeared to be a slowdown in sales growth, partly as a result of recent tax and interest rate rises. But consumers may be leaving shopping until the end of the Christmas period, he said.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: HOT LINE PROVES THAT WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S IRE  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> While driving on the Costa Mesa Freeway, I was stuck behind a vehicle that was  emiting smoke from the tailpipe. Not only was there a large cloud of smoke, but  the smell was so bad that I had to roll up my windows and change lanes.  </P> <P> I understand that there is a telephone number that you can call to report cars  that emit excessive amounts of smoke from their tailpipes. Could you please  print this number and explain how the system works?  </P> <P> David B. Smith, Corona del Mar  </P> <P> Anyone stuck behind such a stinker can call (800) CUT-SMOG. You'll reach the  Air Quality Management District, which will attempt to take action against the  owner of the vehicle.  </P> <P> Bill Kelly, an AQMD spokesman, said the program works like this: You report the  car's license number, its make and description (a gold Mercedes, for instance,  or a pink VW bug), and the date, time and location at which you observed it.  The air district taps into the state Department of Motor Vehicle's database to  determine the owner.  </P> <P> A letter is then dispatched to the owner of the smoking vehicle saying that he  or she may be in violation of the state's air pollution laws and asking that  the problem be repaired. It also provides a form to fill out and return to the  district either verifying that the work was done or stating that a mechanic  said no repairs were necessary.  </P> <P> The program is voluntary, because the district has no enforcement power.  Nonetheless, it has reaped some results, Kelly said. The CUT-SMOG line receives  about 15,000 complaints a month from irked Southern California motorists. The  response rate from suspected polluters who receive letters from the district is  about 40%.  </P> <P> Even those who ignore the district's warning are eventually snagged. The  California Highway Patrol has eight officers in the Southland assigned  specifically to squad cars that do nothing but hunt down polluters. And if the  CHP doesn't get them, the DMV will with its mandatory smog check every other  year for all cars on the road.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I own a 1979 diesel auto. The cost of diesel fuel relative to regular and  unleaded gas has me baffled. We travel with our diesel to all parts of the  United States, and I have wondered why in places like Oklahoma diesel is 20  cents a gallon less than unleaded, whereas the cost of diesel relative to  unleaded is higher in California. Are diesel refinery requirements here more  stringent than elsewhere?  </P> <P> Carl Weinert, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Oil industry experts say there are several factors that come into play to keep  diesel costs high in California relative to the price of other types of  gasoline.  </P> <P> For starters, there are additional refining requirements in California,  according to Doug Elmets, a spokesman for ARCO. California's air pollution laws  require that diesel fuel sold in the state contain one-tenth the sulfur in  diesel sold in other states. This adds additional refining steps and, hence,  additional cost.  </P> <P> Elmets said supply and demand also occasionally play a role in keeping  California's diesel prices a bit higher relative to gasoline. There are more  diesel automobiles in the state than in any other, but the fuel supply doesn't  always keep up with the demand.  </P> <P> Diesel prices in other states can also rise and fall with the seasons. Diesel  is a close relative of the fuel that is used to heat homes in many Midwestern  and Northeast states, according to Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg  Letter, an authoritative newsletter on the oil industry.  </P> <P> During winter months, when the demand for heating oil is great, the supply of  diesel in those states is less, driving up prices. In the summer, refineries  shift back to producing more of the diesel, causing prices to slip downward.  The price of unleaded and regular gasoline, meanwhile, generally is not  affected as much by seasonal factors.  </P></p>

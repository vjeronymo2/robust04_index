			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 23 March, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary  Unity [URNG] issued a seven-point statement discussing the  national situation from its perspective. At first, it says that  the circumstances that existed at the time President de Leon  Carpio began his mandate no longer prevail and that the people's  expectations have once again been sneered at because, as in the  past, the military and economic powers still dominate the  country's fate.    The URNG claims that the government's partiality is evinced  by comparing the prompt solution given to the demands of fuel  carriers and the owners of urban transportation vehicles with  the police and Army suppression on residents of Santa Lucia  Cotzulmaguapa, Escuintla. The indifference shown regarding the  murder of a religious leader in San Lucas Toliman, Solola, and  the manner in which the government deals with the demands of  state employees are other examples.    The URNG also refers to the support the president has given  the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], and his willingness to  serve military interests through rewards and salary increases  denied others. It stresses the lack of resources in hospitals  and the violent removal of people that invade lands, which very  much follow the pattern set by predecessors Cerezo and Serrano.    The URNG points out that the attack on the San Juan River,  at  the 20-km marker of the Atlantic Highway, was perpetrated by the  military itself, thus reflecting the existing division in the  Army which was confirmed by General Quilo Ayuso in his statement.    The URNG indicates that the current crisis of  ungovernability  actually seeks to trigger social explosions, like the one in  Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, to prolong and increase suppression  and to impose a state of exception. The possibility of a coup  d'etat, however, should not be discarded. Last, it warns PAC's  not to lend themselves to the suppression of popular demands  because if they do, as has happened until now, they will be  attacked by the guerrillas to break, in this manner, the truce  declared with them.</p>

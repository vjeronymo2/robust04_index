			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Beijing eyes twin markets of Dollars 150bn China aims to export Dollars 150bn worth of electronics and machinery annually by early next century under an ambitious three-phase plan aimed at securing a substantial share of the world market. 'Expanding exports is the key to the development of China's machinery and electronics industries,' the official China Daily newspaper quoted an official of the Ministry of Machinery Industry as saying. Exports of machinery and electronics are expected to reach Dollars 26bn this year, an increase of Dollars 3.3bn or 14.5 per cent over last year's figure of Dollars 22.7bn. China has targeted the machine-building and electronics sectors as offering the best options for rapid export growth. These are also areas of the economy in which foreign investors are active. Taiwanese, Hong Kong, Japanese and South Korean companies are investing heavily in consumer electronics. Taiwanese manufacturers, for example, have transferred to the mainland the manufacture of basic items such as computer keyboards and disc drives. Pocket calculators are another item that is being manufactured in increasing numbers in China for export. China plans to increase exports of electronics and machinery to Dollars 30bn by 1995, Dollars 60bn by 2000, and to exceed Dollars 100bn by the early part of the next century, according to the three-phase plan. In 1993, exports of these items accounted for 30 per cent of total exports of Dollars 86.3bn. Exports of all manufactured items grew from 49.8 per cent of China's total exports in 1980 to 78.5 per cent in 1993. Export growth for these items reached 9.6 per cent in 1993 compared with the previous year. China's coastal provinces have the lion's share of machinery and electronics exports with Guangdong province dominant. Guangdong's exports last year accounted for 62.1 per cent of the total, reflecting a surge of Taiwan and Hong Kong investment. China's export drive in products known as elaborately transformed manufactures (ETMs), reflects a desire to become more competitive in both world and domestic markets. This also coincides with Beijing's moves to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'Only when Chinese companies can compete on the world market can they keep a lock on the domestic market,' said an official quoted by China Daily. 'If domestic companies dare not enter the world market, they will almost certainly lose the home one,' he said. A senior US trade negotiator yesterday said China must make much faster progress and be more flexible if it is to meet its goal of entering Gatt by the end of the year. Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade representative, said in Beijing: 'If it is to realise its accession or completion of negotiations by December 31st 1994, we would suggest China put its foot on the Gatt pedal.' Talks on China's accession to Gatt have been continuing in Geneva for several weeks.</p>

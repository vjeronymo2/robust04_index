			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gieves Gieves Group, the Savile Row tailor which also has licensing and publishing operations, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 518,000 for the half year to July 31. The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 9.13m (Pounds 8.84m), compared with profits last time of Pounds 837,000. However, on a like-for-like basis, excluding the release of a Pounds 535,000 provision arising from the disposal of Redwood Press, the book and magazine manufacturing business, in 1992 the pre-tax line rose 72 per cent. Earnings per share dropped to 1.5p (5.4p) but an interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is declared.</p>

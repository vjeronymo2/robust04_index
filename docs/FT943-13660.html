			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Sino-Indian trade route reopens India and China yesterday agreed to reopen an ancient trade route after 32 years, as Mr Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister, said during a visit to New Delhi that he hoped border disputes between the two countries would be resolved soon, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi. Mr Qian and Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, signed an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal and tax evasion. The agreement provides for lower rates of taxation for income generated by transfer of technology and investment, with guidelines to resolve tax disputes and provisions for exchange of information on tax evasion. An ancient trade route through the Shipkila Pass on the border of Kinnaur district in Himachal Pradesh was formally restored with the signing of a protocol by the two governments. The route, closed in 1962 after the occupation of Tibet by China and the Indo-China war, will be serviced by trading complexes at Chhapan on the Indian side and Jueva on the Chinese side.</p>

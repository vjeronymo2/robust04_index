			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Fatimah al-Barnawi, chief of Palestinian </F> women's police, by Nabil al-Baradi'i in Tunis; date not given:  "We Will Not Be a Repressive or Overbearing Police, but a  Security Service in the Civilized Sense!"--first three  paragraphs are AL-HAWADITH introduction]    [Text] Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has appointed  Fatimah al-Barnawi chief of the Palestinian women's police in  the self-rule area of Gaza and Jericho.    Fatimah al-Barnawi is an activist who spent 121 months in  prisons of the Israeli occupation. She is married to the  activist Fawzi al-Nimr, who himself spent 15 years in the  prisons of the occupation.    The following discussion took place in an interview with  Fatimah al-Barnawi.    [Al-HAWADITH] When did you begin to be an activist?    [Al-Barnawi] In my early childhood I used to see Israeli  attacks on Palestinians. I had no explanation for them. In 1948,  we migrated from Jerusalem to Jordan and lived in the camps with  other Palestinian emigrants. After three years I could bear it  no longer, so I returned to Palestine and stayed with my father.  I learned nursing and worked with the relief and Palestinian  refugee employment agency in the city of Qalqilyah, which in  those days was in ruins after the tripartite attack on Egypt in  1956. The Palestinians who were under arrest in the police  station died martyrs' deaths in the attack on the city.    The city of Qalqilyah was attacked again in 1963, when they  destroyed the wells because of their importance to a city  dependent on agriculture. Orchards dried up and agriculture  suffered. Israel attacked the city again in 1965, destroying the  gasoline pumps to paralyze traffic and make an impression on the  residents. Naturally, the solution was to turn to the United  Nations, which merely criticized, while Israel continued its  attacks. The situation is the same today; nothing has changed.    [Al-HAWADITH] Was it the passivity of the UN resolutions  that  made you think of militancy?    [Al-Barnawi] Faced with such a dark reality, I began to feel  that I was wronging myself by not being politically educated.  Our reactions were merely emotional. Without a militant  organization we lacked political consciousness. My zeal  increased when Israel attacked and occupied the Gaza strip in  1956. I wanted to perform any act that would be a reply to  Israel's repeated aggression against our people, particularly  since I saw the dead and wounded by virtue of my job as a nurse.  So I joined a group of young people, and we began working  together--secretly, of course.    [Al-HAWADITH] Did you carry out any militant operations as  part of this group?    [Al-Barnawi] There were some Egyptian soldiers who had come  from Egypt to help us. Some of them were wounded and were wanted  by the Israelis. I, my sister, and three young people tried to  smuggle them out of the city of Qalqilyah. We gave them clothes  to replace their Egyptian army uniforms, which we burned, and we  enabled them to escape. But an Israeli doctor at the hospital  became aware of the operation and alerted the Israeli soldiers.    After questioning, although I utterly denied the charge  against me, I was dismissed from the hospital. I began to work  with the Palestinian people under trees and in homes, nursing  the wounded and giving aid.    [Al-HAWADITH] How did you join the Fatah movement?    [Al-Barnawi] I became acquainted with a group from the  Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, which was  headed by Yasir 'Arafat--he was then called Abu-Muhammad--and I  joined them.    After they inducted and trained me, they asked me to carry  out an operation involving planting explosives in a movie house  called Cinema Zion. The choice of the movie house was not  arbitrary. It was chosen first because it was in Jerusalem--for  the symbolic significance of the city. Next, there was the  attitude of the shows in the movie house, which presented films  about the spurious Six Day War and sold cassettes pushing  Zionist ideology and calling for strengthening and expanding the  Israeli occupation at the expense of the Arabs. Before you ask  about civilians being present in the theater, I say that the  Israelis all are soldiers--even their civilians are reservists.  Thus, we did not target civilians. The theater was full of the  Israeli army. I carried out the operation in company with my  sister, who was five years younger than I, but had joined Fatah  before me. There was also brother Fathi Shahrur, who was an  official in the organization. During the same night other  operations were carried out, and they all succeeded.    [Al-HAWADITH] How were you arrested?    [Al-Barnawi] Although my dark complexion played a great part  initially in making the operation successful and throwing the  Israeli soldiers off the trail, they finally caught up with me.  Thinking that I was an Ethiopian, they contacted the Ethiopian  embassy and confirmed that no young Ethiopian girls were in the  area. Meanwhile I had returned to Qalqilyah. When they went to  the house and found neither me nor my sister who had carried out  the operation with me--Abu-'Ammar had enabled us to escape--they  arrested my mother and two of my other sisters. Of course they  tortured them. It had not been hard to find the house, because  Palestinians of African ancestry live in one neighborhood near  al-Aqsa Mosque. They caught up with me two days later. They  encircled the house where I was staying with a group of girls,  because the Israelis thought I was a dangerous, muscular woman.  When they saw me, they were surprised that I was young and  slender--I was no more than 25 years old. The girls raged  against them because they did not know what I had done. The  soldiers told me to put on the shoes I had worn the day of the  operation. I knew they wanted to get evidence to condemn me, so  I changed shoes. They took me. In the prison they left me with a  female guard whose daughter had been present in the movie house  that the operation targeted. Although I was handcuffed and she  was armed, she was afraid of me. I made movements to provoke  her, so that she would become even more afraid. On entering the  prison, I saw many dark-skinned girls standing waiting for the  perpetrator of the operation to be brought in. When they saw me,  they ran up to me saying, "Confess, because we are in prison  because of you--and your mother, too." I answered them that  every one had to bear her own responsibilities, and that I had  nothing to confess.    [Al-HAWADITH] Why didn't you run away after carrying out the  operation?    [Al-Barnawi] I lacked experience. When I returned to  Qalqilyah, I did not know that the Israelis were searching for  me. I couldn't even comprehend what I had done. Like other  sisters, I had watched the struggle of Algerian women. We had  seen the film "Jamilah." My entire hope was to make some  response, even a small one, to the Israeli actions. I did not  think of running away. Even when Abu-'Ammar sent a message to  the house asking us to leave the place as a precaution, I was  not present when the message arrived. Because the operation had  been secret, I could not reveal what I had done to anyone so  that they might advise me what to do or how to behave.    [Al-HAWADITH] Tell us how they questioned you?    [Al-Barnawi] First they tried to make an impression on me.  They reminded me of my African ancestry, trying to convince me  that I had no connection to Palestine--to mislead me, of course.  I replied that I knew nothing about Nigeria; I knew only  Palestine, where I had been born. I belonged to Palestine, not  to a country I had never visited and about which I knew nothing.  On the next day, they told me that I had been in the movie house  and had been carrying explosives. I admitted that I had been in  the theater, but denied carrying explosives. They did not  believe me and threatened me, saying that they would make me  confess everything. They summoned a powerfully built blond  soldier carrying a whip. The fellow was roaring; he was no  normal person. I asked them what was wrong with him. They told  me that the poor fellow was of German origin. The Germans had  killed his family, and I now wanted to kill him! I told him that  I had never gone to Germany to kill him; rather, it was he who  had come to take my house and attack me.    Of course they tortured me. They tortured my mother in front  of me to influence me. The rule was that if we were caught and  forced to confess, we were to confess only against ourselves and  mention nothing about others. If we confessed, we were to  mention the reasons: we were to say it was because they had  dispossessed our people and occupied our land, while we had  previously coexisted with the Jews.    [Al-HAWADITH] What about the trial?    [Al-Barnawi] The trial was in a military court. It lasted a  week. They appointed Zionist lawyers for us, who tried to  convict us more than defend us. Instead of defending me, the  lawyer would ask before the court about the depth of the  impression the explosion had left.    The lawyer had promised my father to get me out of the  court.  I rejected him. I said that anyone who lied to my father and  promised him something he could not do could not be trusted with  my case, and I rejected him. In convicting me the court relied  on a discussion that took place the day I was arrested, when the  girls became enraged with the soldiers who took me. To calm  them, they claimed they were going to take me for only 10  minutes. I had replied to them, "Just say 10 years!" They  insisted that if I had done nothing, I would not have expected  10 years in prison. Before that, they sent a lawyer to me to  offer me release from prison in exchange for a confession before  everyone, including foreign reporters and observers. I was to  express my regret for what I had done, because I had been misled  by the Palestinians and had been influenced without holding  convictions. However, what happened was the opposite. Along with  those who had carried out the other operations, I insisted that  we were not guilty and not sorry, because we were in the right.  Israel was the aggressor, and we had responded to it. They  sentenced me to 10 years in prison for belonging to an illegal  organization, life in prison for possessing weapons, and another  life sentence for carrying out the operation. In other words, I  was to die [in prison], wake up, and die again!    [Al-HAWADITH] How was prison life?    [Al-Barnawi] We were subject to a strict regimen. Although I  was the first woman prisoner from Fatah, I found two Palestinian  women prisoners who must be mentioned. One was imprisoned five  years before me. She was working with the pro-Syrian al-Ard [the  Land] group and was in charge of passing information to the  group. This prisoner was a wonderful worker with her hands. When  she refused to give the Israelis any information, they sentenced  her to six years in prison. The second was the activist Nayifah  al-Mawji. She was from the area of Galilee occupied in 1948. She  helped me a lot. Although she was not in the same cell with me,  she would raise my morale by writing a note and passing it to me  when she went by my cell. She told me to be strong and patient.  She also told me that there was no death penalty in Israel--the  Israeli papers were publishing my picture with a noose around my  neck to intimidate and terrify me and anyone who wanted to  resist the Israelis. These newspapers would get into the prisons  through the Israeli women prisoners. Because the Israelis  refused to consider us political prisoners, they threw us in  with women drug smugglers, thieves, and prostitutes--into a  world of depravity and crime. They knew no fear. Whenever  activists carried out any commando operation, the Israeli women  prisoners, instigated by the women jailers, would take vengeance  on us. My teeth were broken in one of the attacks. When I made a  complaint against them, the woman lawyer Felicia Langer came.  They accused me of attacking one of them and of having broken my  teeth by biting her!    There is also a work system in the prison. Anyone who  refuses  is forbidden to go out for sun and air. The jobs to be done were  kitchen work, gardening, cleaning rooms and toilets, ironing the  clothes of Israeli women soldiers, and embroidering clothes in  the Palestinian style for sale. Since the latter amounted to  theft of our heritage, we used to refuse to do it. I worked in  the kitchen for eight and one-half years. It was hard, tiring  work that went on without a break from eight in the morning to  four in the evening.    [Al-HAWADITH] Besides the newspapers, did you read anything  else?    [Al-Barnawi] We were prohibited from reading political and  educational books. We were only allowed to read worthless  sentimental books. However, a year and one-half after I entered  prison, we were joined by some educated Palestinian  sisters--about twelve activists who helped educate their less  informed and less educated colleagues. We used to talk  surreptitiously during the hour in the sun, and we would meet in  furtive attempts to organize recreational and educational  programs inside the prison. The Israelis tried to stop these  programs. Whenever they saw one of us happy or glad, they would  put her back into her cell before the hour was up. They wanted  to see us always sad, worried, and depressed. When we protested  about the shortening of the rest interval, they answered that  they were not bound to a schedule and that we had to submit to  their orders.    [Al-HAWADITH] Did they talk to you in Arabic?    [Al-Barnawi] They spoke Hebrew, and we had to learn it  through the women jailers who had lived in Arab countries. Those  women had maintained some Arab customs. Those who came from Iraq  were devoted listeners to Nazim al-Ghazzali, and everyone had to  listen when he sang. The Yemeni Jews hold their weddings in the  Yemeni style. They would drum on a pot, use henna, and wear Arab  clothes, just as if they were in Yemen. The Israelis do not have  a unified culture. To go back to the women jailers from Arab  countries--they were set to guard us precisely so that they  could understand what we were saying with our families during  visits.    [Al-HAWADITH] How long did your mother and two sisters stay  in prison?    [Al-Barnawi] My sister was imprisoned for a year. My other  sister and my mother remained without sentence for two months,  just to take vengeance on me and pressure me. The Israelis  usually destroyed prisoners' homes, but they were unable to  destroy our house because it was next to al-Aqsa Mosque. My  father died while I was in prison.    [Al-HAWADITH] And after you left prison?    [Al-Barnawi] They expelled me. They let me off at the  Jordanian border, where there were brothers waiting for me. They  did not inform the Red Cross. I returned to the revolution and  contacted the PLO again to continue my activities.    [Al-HAWADITH] Was your life sentence lifted?    [Al-Barnawi] Exile is crueler than prison. Although we have  been accepted and treated as guests by Arab countries like  Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan, we yearn to return home. In  Tunisia we were accorded every sort of hospitality by the  generous Tunisian people, and we felt comfortable in this  beautiful country. But that does not prevent us from thinking  about regaining our land, rejoining our kin, and beginning to  rebuild, even inch by inch. All expelled Palestinians feel that  they are guests and that they must return to their lands that  they left against their will. I take with me a good memory of  Tunisia. It was here that I married another expelled activist  who had carried out militant operations and was sentenced to 15  years in prison.    [Al-HAWADITH] When did you go to Tunis?    [Al-Barnawi] After leaving prison in 1967 and being banished  to Jordan, I went subsequently to al-Biqa' and south Lebanon. I  went to Tunis in 1983.    [Al-HAWADITH] What is your position on the peace agreement?    [Al-Barnawi] Our people have become weary as a result of the  daily siege imposed by the Israelis and the prohibition on  workers pursuing their jobs. We did not carry on these  negotiations by ourselves: all the Arab brothers and all the  Arab countries agreed to them and participated in them. Just as  Israel occupied our land bit by bit, so we shall regain it in  the same way. When we are on our land, we can struggle. The  struggle of the Palestinian people can be considered one of the  most difficult of struggles. Our Algerian brothers, for example,  resisted French occupation from within, on their own land; but  we are scattered and dispersed to all parts of the world.    [Al-HAWADITH] What do you feel when you remember the 10  years  you spent in prison?    [Al-Barnawi] Ten years and a month! They were not in vain,  but have begun to bear fruit. I do not consider myself to have  given anything. Those who really sacrificed are the martyrs of  Palestine. As for me, I was imprisoned and came out. Palestine  is worth our giving our lives. If I gave 10 years of my life, I  am not sorry. Returning to Palestine compensates me for my  entire life.    [Al-HAWADITH] How did you receive the decision of your  appointment as chief of the Palestinian women's police?    [Al-Barnawi] In fact, I knew about it because Faruq  al-Qaddumi had spoken to me, saying: "A decision will be issued  appointing you as chief of police. You are the only one capable  of carrying out this mission. All the Palestinian leaders are  happy about the decision. It is an honor for you, sister  Fatimah." While I was away from Tunis, my husband Fawzi  al-Nimr--by the way, he is an activist who has experienced the  two most bitter things in Israeli prisons--contacted me and told  me about the decision. My feeling was a mixture of joy and fear:  joy at the confidence that Abu-'Ammar and the entire Palestinian  people have accorded me, with constant telephone calls from  inside and outside the occupied territories to congratulate me  on the new position; and fear that the new task may be too great  for my ability. However, with God's help, I will succeed and  prove to the whole world that Palestinian women are capable of  working and carrying on in all fields. I am now as happy as can  be. I am very glad that I shall be serving the general good, the  good of the Palestinian people.    [Al-HAWADITH] Will your experience in Israeli prisons have  an  effect on your new job?    [Al-Barnawi] Of course. The experience will have a positive  effect. I have learned a lot from my prison term and how the  women jailers treated us. I learned the meaning of mercy and  humanity and how much they affect the spirit. I learned the  meaning of injustice and cruelty. All this naturally will have a  positive affect on my work.    [Al-HAWADITH] Do you expect many young Palestinian women to  show an interest in joining the police service?    [Al-Barnawi] Yes, I get telephone calls every day from  inside  the country, particularly from young women expressing a great  desire to join.    [Al-HAWADITH] What qualifications must young women have in  order to join the police? Do you intend to bring in women who  have been released from Israeli prisons to work in the women's  police?    [Al-Barnawi] The idea of women's police usually implies  women  who are large, powerful, and mean tempered. We are an exception  to this rule. We will choose educated young women and guides who  have compassion and good characters. We will make the women's  police service an educational school and put the right person in  the right place. We will not be a police of repression or  overbearing, but a security service in the civilized sense, so  that we prove that we are fit for this job and others.    [Al-HAWADITH] When will this service go into operation?    [Al-Barnawi] It is not easy for us to begin from nothing.  First, I have asked Yasir 'Arafat that there be contact with our  Tunisian and Jordanian brothers, so that we can profit from  their experience in this field. I am pleased with the young  women who work in the security service, for I see them  constantly. As soon as we enter Palestinian territory, we shall  begin to accept young women and send some of them to enroll in  the military academy in Tunisia, Jordan, or Egypt.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Old boys who refuse to grow up - Abbey Theatre, Dublin Bernard Farrell's new play shows five apparently normal men reduced to emotional wrecks in the course of a school reunion. There are no old school ties sported here: the Apaches, the scourge of the class of '78 in a large Dublin Comprehensive, are now young professionals of varying degrees of respectability. Instead of going home for sandwiches and cake at pub closing time, they break into the old school, and hold their reunion in a gaunt Victorian classroom with tall windows and cobweb-hung lights perfectly evoked by Frank Hallinan Flood's gloomily realistic set. Harry, a dubious travel agent laden with cases of lager, his mobile phone buzzing with news of delayed charter flights, is planning a simple 'piss up', but Maurice, a psycho-babbling ex-seminarian turned insurance broker, produces a five-point programme and a film projector. Jimmy, the pest control specialist (not ratcatcher), expecting another sort of evening altogether, brings his ex-wife Deirdre and a tin of meringues, prompting Nick, the pony-tailed fashion designer (or is it window dresser?) to go home for his wife, Jackie. This is a move he quickly regrets when her ex-boyfriend, the fifth Apache, Paudge, arrives unexpectedly from his prosperous Tipperary farm. The first act passes in a flash as the play skilfully and very funnily reveals the insecurities of the ill-matched group. The second act opens with Item Three on Maurice's programme: Film. His home movie leads to the revelation that Paudge and not Nick is the father of Jackie's daughter, and then to the first of a series of physical attacks. Meanwhile Deirdre's guileless revelations of Jimmy's sexual preferences (involving her nurse's uniform and a pair of fireman's boots) provoke Jimmy to that immemorial cue for the major marital row: 'I think you've had enough to drink'. But all this is peripheral to the play's central themes of guilt and self-deception. Maurice wants the Apaches to face up to the fact that their bullying was responsible for the suicide of one of their schoolmates, Gregory. Suddenly, perhaps too suddenly for comfort, the ragging is over and it all turns deadly serious as the Apaches are forced to confront their own cruelty and its tragic consequences. So far the evening has been easy going and undemanding, but suddenly we are asked to consider the mindless cruelty of children, and almost as bad, the mindless refusal of these grown men to come to terms with their past. The play is directed with superb pace by Ben Barnes, but even his best efforts cannot ease the difficult transition from comedy to tragedy. In a generally strong cast, Jane Brennan's carefully controlled Deirdre never puts a foot wrong while Arthur Riordan's Maurice grows ever more sinister and enigmatic. Lines were occasionally gobbled or fluffed but perhaps this was due to the prodigious on-stage consumption of lager.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Cleveland challenge to commission plan Cleveland County Council yesterday applied for judicial review of proposals for the area by the Local Government Commission which has recommended abolishing the county and splitting the area into four unitary all-purpose authorities. The Labour-controlled council, which claims all-party support for the move, says the commission's proposals are 'ill-considered, unwanted and expensive'. Editorial comment, Page 11</p>

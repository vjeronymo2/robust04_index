Calderon Sol, who was accompanied by his running mate, Dr.  Enrique Borgo Bustamante, and the candidates for deputy in the  country's 14 departments, emphasized the importance the next  Legislative Assembly will have, given its support will make the  executive work smoother for the benefit of the neediest families  in the country.    According to Calderon Sol, the candidates for deputy, as  well  as the presidential ticket, will conduct a lofty campaign aimed  at making Salvadorans aware of the work ARENA will conduct in  the Executive Branch to continue upgrading the country's  legislature.    This is the fourth time ARENA has participated in elections  to choose representatives to the Legislative Assembly. It has  controlled the assembly with a conservative majority of deputies  during the last two assemblies.    "El Salvador wants to live in harmony, peace, and social  welfare, and that is why it wants Executive and Legislative  Branches that coordinate with each other to give continuity to  the country's social and economic development," he said.    During the announcement made at ARENA headquarters, Calderon  Sol said the 60-percent reduction of U.S. aid to the country had  been programmed already, and so it must not cause surprise, much  less uncertainty, he added.    The reduction is a recognition of the president's actions  over the past years, Calderon Sol said, adding that El Salvador  is no longer a country that needs to be held by the hand, given  that it has sufficient forces to move ahead. As proof of the  above, he said the inflation rate in 1993 decreased by 12  percent; better control over fiscal funds were established;  exports rose; and local and foreign investment grew considerably.    According to the ARENA presidential candidate, a public  debate with his opponents, Fidel Chavez Mena and Ruben Zamora,  would not make sense, given the public challenges they have made  are part of a publicity strategy from which they hope to extract  electoral gains.    "They are dropping considerably in the people's preference,  and they lack popular support," he said, adding that his life  has always been a challenge, and now he is facing the biggest  challenge, namely serving society and meeting its needs as  future president.</p>

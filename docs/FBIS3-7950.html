			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Polish Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy is ending his visit  to the Czech Republic today. In his talks he learned that the  Czech Republic does not wish to change the Visegrad Four into a  lobby for persuading the European structures to accept these  countries more swiftly. When meeting the press at the end of  his talks in Prague, the Polish Sejm speaker said that Poland  also does not wish for the institutionalization of the Visegrad  Four and acknowledges that the Czech side emphasizes economic  cooperation. On the other hand, Poland is convinced that the  Visegrad Group ought to explain jointly to the West European  countries its urgent need to join the European structures.    In an interview for Czech television, the Polish Sejm  speaker  spoke about the current situation in Russia and the possibility  that Russia would like to play the role of superpower also  within the Partnership for Peace program. Poland must carefully  follow developments in Russia where democracy is only in its  initial stages. Poland must draw its conclusions and bring them  to the Pan-European discussion.    In spite of its firm Euro-Atlantic course, in no way could  Poland neglect its good economic relations with Russia and  Ukraine because it sees the [word indistinct] future of Polish  interests in them also, Mr. Oleksy said.    Poland and the Czech Republic are of the opinion that only  democratic Russia should take part in the structures of the  Europe of the future and in its future security system. A  Russia with an imperial policy will not fit into the strategy of  European security, as it is perceived by Poland and the Czech  Republic, the Polish Sejm speaker said in Prague today.</p>

Makhnyr, E.P. Kozlovskaya, Pacific </F> Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at the Far Eastern Department of  Russia's Academy of Sciences, Vladivostok; UDC 577.11]    [Abstract] The potential of using Radianthus  macrodactylus sea anemones as a source of physiologically  active substances and the failure to isolate neurotoxins with a  nonprotein origin from Radianthus macrodactylus sea  anemones prompted attempts to isolate highly active nonprotein  toxins from tropical sea anemones. The toxin was isolated by  chromatography on polytetraflourethylene, CM-sephadex C-25, and  HPLC ion exchangers in Ultropac TSK CM-3SW and Ultropac TSK  DEAE-3SW columns. This toxin was firmly sorbed by the  hydrophobic agent Polychrome-I and interacted weakly with  cation- and anion-exchange substances at a pH of 5.0 and 7.4,  respectively. The toxin's nonprotein origin was confirmed by the  negative outcome of a test for N-terminal amino acid and amino  acid analysis. It is shown that the palytoxin molecule's  trans-3-aminoacrylamide fragment which is responsible  for the 263 nm peak in the ultraviolet spectrum is unstable both  in acidic and alkaline media. For intravenous injection in mice,  the toxin's LD[.sub]50[/] is 74+/-0.29 g/kg. It is  speculated on the basis of the substance's high toxicity as well  as spectroscopy data that it is the same palytoxin which was  isolated for the first time from Palythoa toxica  zoanthid. The authors are grateful to T. Balashova and A.I.  Kalinovskiy for recording the 500 MHz NMR spectra and discussing  the spectrum patterns. References: 7 Western.</p>

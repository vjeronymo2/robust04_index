			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A JAUNTY NONCHALANCE  </P> <P> It is every reviewer's (sometimes secret) ambition to write a review that  stands on its own as a fine piece of work.  </P> <P> All too often, time, circumstance, bad luck, a faltering talent, turn this  ambition to folly.  </P> <P> But Grover Lewis' splendid review of "Pastures of Plenty" by Woody Guthrie  (Dec. 2) must be an inspiration to reviewers and readers everywhere. Lewis'  lovely Texan prose, his knowledge of the subject matter, his almost  terrifyingly jaunty, nonchalant expertise on the underclass -- its horrors, its  triumphs -- made your front page a blast!  </P> <P> What a treat to see Grover Lewis' good work again.  </P> <P> CAROLYN SEE  </P> <P> PACIFIC PALISADES  </P></p>

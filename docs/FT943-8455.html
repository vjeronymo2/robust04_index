			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Mix 'n' match tax A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but taxes need all the re-labelling they can get. Cynics would say that this was the logic behind earmarking taxes, an idea which is gaining favour within both of the UK's main opposition parties. In fact, proposals such as those published yesterday by the Liberal Democrats stem from a desire to improve the substance of fiscal policy-making. Unfortunately, earmarking taxes is not the answer. Yesterday's report suggests a number of areas where 'hypothecation' - earmarking a chunk of tax revenues for a particular purpose - could be used to raise public confidence in taxation policies. Although the Liberal Democrats have taken it furthest, the same notion has gained support in the Labour camp. Its proponents claim that hypothecation is not merely a marketing exercise, but aims to raise the transparency and accountability of fiscal policy. In theory, earmarked taxes would heighten the public's awareness of the connection between taxes and services. Better informed about the trade-offs between the two, it could discuss fiscal policy more honestly, and officials could be held more accountable for the way those trade-offs are agreed and implemented. In practice, however, 're-connecting' taxes and services, at a national level at least, is likely to mislead the public or, worse, leave the tax system even less capable of delivering difficult reforms. At its simplest, earmarked taxation is a mere re-labelling exercise, as in the case of national insurance contributions, which are separable from income tax in name only. This reduces transparency, since the public is given a misleading picture of the link between contributions and benefits. A more honest way to earmark revenues would be to ring-fence them, along the lines of the television licence fee. But this might lower accountability since officials would no longer have to defend their expenditures every year. A deeper drawback is that the earmarked revenues would be prey to the business cycle. As the Liberal Democrat report notes, this severely limits the scope for hypothecation: it would be senseless for unemployment benefits, for example, to be bound by revenue from cyclically variable taxes. The authors also argue that means-tested benefits should not be hypothecated, because there needs to be 'a fairly close correlation between those who pay the tax and those who benefit from the expenditure.' Broader application of the latter principle threatens two undesirable effects: a greater emphasis on taxes which are easily personalised, such as taxes on employment, and a balkanised tax base, as different interests vie to sell their causes to the public. Better informed public debates about fiscal policy could help rebuild public trust in politicians, but hypothecation is a quick fix. Declaring that a proportion of income tax is to be replaced by a 'health service tax' may sound attractive, but it is not the same thing as debating the future of the national health service. Some of the report's ideas could have more positive results: the idea of sending a yearly tax and spending statement to each UK household, for example, is a good one. But if the opposition parties, particularly Labour, wish to win the next election by addressing people as citizens, not only as consumers, they should avoid proposals that risk making such a presentation of the public budget look uncannily like a shopping list.</p>

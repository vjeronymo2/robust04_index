			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Simon seeks Pounds 50m as losses rise Simon Engineering, which yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 160.3m for 1993, is planning a Pounds 50m rights issue. Mr Maurice Dixson, who became chief executive in a boardroom shake-out last September, said the rights issue would be 'the corner stone that puts us on a sound financial footing'. Yesterday, the shares recovered from a low of 82p to close at 117p, up 11p. Simon, which makes access equipment including fire rescue gear, flagged its losses in January when it announced plans to raise Pounds 40m through disposals. The deficit, which compares with a previous pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.04m, mostly reflects goodwill written off totalling Pounds 101.5m. This followed the company's unwise diversification in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when it acquired businesses based on markets and people, and with very little assets. The operating loss on continuing operations was Pounds 6.9m, compared with an operating profit of Pounds 7.4m last time. Losses per share were 22.3p (3p). The board is not recommending a dividend. Turnover from continuing operations eased to Pounds 340.2m from Pounds 343.6m. Turnover from discontinued operations was Pounds 46m (Pounds 144m). The new management's strategy is to cut debt and concentrate on three core markets - the access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the process engineering contractor. Of the three, only Simon Storage reported an operating profit for the year, up from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 8.5m on turnover of Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 39.3m). By the year end debt had been reduced to Pounds 117.8m from Pounds 148m when Mr Dixson took over. After the proposed rights issue, gearing would be cut from 264 per cent to 54 per cent immediately, and Mr Dixson was confident it would be reduced to about 45 per cent by the end of this year. However, the group would not go ahead with the rights issue until it had completed protracted negotiations with its lenders. It hoped to normalise its lending facilities so that it could grow the business to enhance shareholder value, rather than to pay down debt. COMMENT The shares reacted immediately to the horrible figures coupled with a proposed rights issue. But the later recovery reflects market realisation of the new management's considerable achievement since September. In the first half the company's haemorrhage of cash was continuing, with an outflow of Pounds 43.7m; the second half saw a cash inflow of Pounds 13.1m. At the present rate, this year should see the completion of the restructuring, and benefits should start to flow through to shareholders in 1995. Investors who bought into the company at the 34p low last July have already done well. On balance, it looks as though the shares are still a buy, but the management is at the beginning of a very long road.</p>

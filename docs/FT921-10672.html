			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Cummins improves performance CUMMINS Engine, the loss-making US maker of diesel engines, improved its financial performance in the fourth quarter and said it expected to return to profit in the first quarter of this year. The company, hit hard by weakness in the North American heavy truck market, reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 2.3m, or 29 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 59m, excluding a Dollars 65.3m restructuring charge, and a Dollars 5.3m extraordinary credit in the same period last year. Sales fell from Dollars 899m to Dollars 865m. Cummins said the figures reflected a continued improvement in operating results, helped by a cost-reduction programme and strong demand for its B and C series mid-range engines. Its successful 1991 product launch had meant lower product coverage expenses. For 1991 as a whole, it lost Dollars 14.1m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.4bn, including a Dollars 51.5m gain because of an accounting change. In 1990, it lost Dollars 137.7m, including unusual charges, or Dollars 12.25 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn. Cummins expected to be profitable in the first quarter even though no economic improvement was foreseen in most of its markets.</p>

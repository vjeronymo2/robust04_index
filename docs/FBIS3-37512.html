			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy article: "Optimism and Caution Voiced </F> During John Major's Visit to Moscow"]    [Text] Statements by Russian and British leaders indicate  that relations between the two countries are on the up and are  cause for satisfaction on both sides. This primarily applies to  the economy and trade. Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin  pointed out during a meeting with his British counterpart John  Major, who is paying an official visit to our country, that  according to last year's results Britain was third in Western  trade with Russia. Neither side intends to rest on its laurels.  During the British delegation's visit to Moscow they discussed  plans to step up cooperation in the field of fuel and energy and  communications, as well as in education, science, and culture.    Such an important avenue of our cooperation as British  firms'  involvement in implementing the privatization program in Russia  will be "inspected" by John Major in Nizhniy Novgorod, which he  is to visit after Moscow 16 February. It is there that the  practical aid that British capital has afforded the oblast  administration's efforts is most palpable.    The day before in Moscow's Kremlin a symbolic line was drawn  under the period of hostility between our states, a period which  for several years now has effectively been at an end. The  Russian president and Britain's prime minister signed a joint  statement on nontargeting of their strategic nuclear weapons  against one another. During the delegations' talks in the  Kremlin it was also pointed out that military cooperation  between our states gratifies the two countries' leaders.  However, as far as developing this cooperation is concerned,  the sides have at the moment confined themselves to a fairly  cautious "agreement in principle" that Russian and British Army  subunits should hold a series of joint exercises from early 1995  on both Russian and British territory.    The politicians were also cautious in their statements on  the  military-political aspects of our relations during a meeting at  the Russian Defense Ministry in the afternoon of 15 February.  Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev received  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the opinion of  Russia's defense minister, it was noted at this meeting that the  "Partnership for Peace" principle proposed by NATO is a good,  attractive principle. However, when talk turns to putting this  into practice, it is obvious that the concrete programs for  implementing this partnership are currently at the development  stage.    John Major voiced a fairly optimistic opinion of the results  of his discussion of the Bosnian crisis with Russia's leaders,  noting the Russian-British (in this case also read NATO) mutual  understanding "on many important aspects of a settlement to the  conflict." President Yeltsin was more restrained in his  opinions, saying that "some people are trying to resolve the  Bosnian question without Russia's involvement. We will not  allow that." It is easy to guess that the NATO  military-political leadership is the unnamed "some people."  Evidently one of the aims of John Major's visit was to try to  win Russia over to NATO positions, secure its consent to the  planned troop operation in Sarajevo, and thus invite Russia to  take part in that resolution of the Bosnian conflict. However,  both President Yeltsin and Premier Chernomyrdin clearly told the  British premier that Russia has its own view of how the conflict  should be resolved, namely that peace can only be secured in  Bosnia via negotiation.    On the whole the British premier's visit to Russia clearly  showed that Britain and Russia are profoundly committed to  developing a mutually beneficial partnership and establishing  the kind of relations that may indeed become partnership  relations in the near future, as Boris Yeltsin suggested during  his visit to London.</p>

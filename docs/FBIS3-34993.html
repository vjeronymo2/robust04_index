During the meeting, Hammudi asserted that the continued  enforcement of the unfair embargo clamped on the Iraqi people is  a crime against a people who opposed aggression, injustice, and  slavery.    For his part, Stevens condemned the unfair embargo imposed  on  Iraq, because it is a violation of all international conventions  and norms, particularly since Iraq has honored all its  commitments as enshrined in the relevant international  resolutions. He noted the unethical conduct practiced against  Iraq during the war of aggression.</p>

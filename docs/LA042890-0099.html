Bob Keller had two doubles and three runs batted in to lead  Biola (13-27, 4-16).  </P> <P> In order to earn a playoff berth, the Kingsmen need to win one of their next  three District 3 games.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Moorpark 10, Santa Monica 0 -- After losing a Western State Conference game at  home for the first time in seven years on Wednesday, Moorpark bounced back  against visiting Santa Monica in a game shortened to five innings because of  the mercy rule.  </P> <P> The win gave Moorpark (25-9, 12-1) a share of its fourth consecutive conference  title and its sixth in the past seven years.  </P> <P> Freshman right-hander Robin Thomas (23-6) limited Santa Monica (5-7 in  conference play) to four hits and struck out four.  </P> <P> Catcher Missy Cress hit her third home run, a three-run shot, in Moorpark's  five-run fourth inning.  </P> <P> Canyons 5, Pierce 1 -- For the second time this week, Canyons held a WSC  opponent to one hit.  </P> <P> Michelle Ruffner threw a one-hitter Wednesday, and freshman right-hander  Rebecca Schuster held visiting Pierce to a double in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Schuster (3-1) struck out three and walked two.  </P> <P> Jill Greenwood, Debbie Rendall, Kelly Kepplinger, Debbie Barnard and Roxana  Marta all had two hits for Canyons (20-19, 5-8).  </P> <P> </P> <P> SWIMMING  </P> <P> Western State Conference meet -- The Ventura women are in the lead and the  Ventura men are in second place after the second day of the three-day  competition at Valley College.  </P> <P> Ventura won the men's 200 medley relay and the women's 400 freestyle relay.  </P> <P> The Valley women are in third and the men in fourth after combining for three  individual victories on Friday.  </P> <P> Valley's Ashley Watier won the 50-yard backstroke and teammate Krickett Jones  won the three-meter and one-meter diving events.  </P> <P> Bill Fox of Valley was victorious on the one-meter board.  </P> <P> Stuart Blair won the 100 butterfly for Canyons, but the Cougars' men's and  women's teams are both in fifth.

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Rail failure to affect roads ABOUT 27,000 extra truck movements a year will take place on Britain's roads following the collapse late on Thursday night of Charterail, one of Britain's biggest private-sector freight operators. This figure, based on Department of Transport and industry estimates, emerged yesterday as Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, moved to secure Charterail's assets pending a meeting of shareholders early next week to put the company into liquidation. Charterail's collapse is embarrassing to the government. Three successive transport secretaries and Mr John Major, the prime minister, each visited the company to support its aims. The company had set out to reverse the decline in rail freight by introducing a pioneering road-rail system which enabled truck-trailers to be switched on to rail wagons. It failed with debts estimated at between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m because it ran out of money before it could move into profit. It accused British Rail of charging excessive rates for haulage - the supply of locomotives and crew to haul Charterail's trains over BR's tracks. Yesterday the government was attempting to distance itself from Charterail's collapse. There were no ministerial comments and the Department of Transport said it was 'very much a commercial matter between British Rail and Charterail'. Charterail has previously been held up as an example of how the private sector could start operating trains on BR's tracks in advance of legislation to privatise the railways. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group said it still hoped to press ahead with the introduction of experimental passenger services in October next year, but the success of its plans rested on the outcome of commercial negotiations with BR due to take place next month.</p>

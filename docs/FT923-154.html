			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Devis portrait tops Pitchford auction: Saleroom A GROUP portrait of John Cotes and six of his eight sons by John Devis, the 18th-century artist who popularised family portraiture in England, sold for Pounds 88,000 to a London dealer yesterday at a sale of the contents of Pitchford Hall, Shropshire. It was the highest price paid at the two-day auction, which went ahead when the government refused to buy the 16th-century listed timber-framed house and its contents for Pounds 1.8m. The Colthurst family needed the money to meet debts incurred at Lloyd's of London. The auction, organised by Christie's, totalled about Pounds 1.5m, near the top of Christie's estimate, even though four lots - including some of the more important early family portraits - were withdrawn before the auction for private sale to national museums. The house will now be sold. The Cotes lived at Pitchford in the 19th century. Another John Cotes, portrayed by Thomas Weaver in 1809 giving instructions to his bailiff, went for Pounds 46,200. The London dealer Partridge was an enthusiastic bidder, acquiring a Regency mahogany four-pedestal table for Pounds 46,200, twice its estimate.</p>

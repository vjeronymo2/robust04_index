			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A lottery for good causes THERE STOOD the home secretary, ready for his photo opportunity, brandishing a handful of Pounds 10 notes and looking for all the world like a reasonably prosperous bookmaker. The image was appropriate. The proposal for a national lottery, which was announced on Friday, has the marks of a rather seedy piece of electioneering. The lottery, according to Friday's white paper, will provide 'a harmless form of entertainment'. Until 1826, when it was banned, it was 'a respectable government undertaking, which at one time had the then Archbishop of Canterbury as a trustee'. That may be a rather partial view of history: a House of Commons committee, established in 1808, concluded that 'the foundation of the lottery system is so . . . vicious . . . that under no . . . regulations will it be possible . . . (to) divest it of all . . . evils'. You do not have to go all the way with these worthies to be critical of the present proposal. In the first place, a lottery is highly regressive. All the evidence from around the world is that tickets are mainly bought by the poor, the frustrated and those who are falling behind society in one way or another. Moreover, they are sold on terms which would make a mobster blush. The government expects that around a third of the proceeds will go on 'good causes' and another 15 per cent on expenses; what is left for prizes will then be subject to an as yet unspecified lottery tax. That adds up to a very negative sum game indeed, and one which even by the standard of lotteries seems heavily loaded against the player. On one estimate, prizes usually average around 60 per cent of receipts. Cultural pursuits The worst feature of the plan is that the people who pay for it will not, by and large, be the main beneficiaries. The good causes which the government has in mind include the arts, sports, the heritage and charities: special emphasis is placed on improvements to the national heritage 'ranging from cathedrals through museums to listed buildings from our artistic and industrial past'. All worthy objects, but all tending to be of most pressing interest to the more prosperous members of society. The relatively poor people who will buy lottery tickets will be subsidising the cultural pursuits of the relatively well off, who will not. New quango There is something rather odd about a conservative government proposing the establishment of a legally protected monopoly, to be administered by a new quango. Its members will be 'independently minded and have achieved personal distinction and public standing'. No wonder the various arts and sports lobby groups are already rubbing their hands in anticipation. At least the white paper promises that the money raised will not be used to finance the government's conventional spending programmes. But you can never be sure. New York established its lottery in 1967 with the profits to be set aside for education: came a budget crisis, and the money was quickly shifted into the general fund. The same happened a little later in Connecticut. Despite all this, the economic and political climate is probably right in the UK for a lottery system: the home secretary will not be alone in dismissing its critics as 'party poopers'. Ever since lotteries were used to rebuild Rome after Nero burnt it down, governments and the public have been happy to turn to this device at times of slow growth and growing deficits. But if a lottery is inevitable, let there be some attempt to steer the proceeds towards the people who will be buying the tickets. One idea would be to build a network of money advice centres, which could - among other things - warn people against playing games in which the dice are too heavily loaded. If Britain needs to spend a bit more on the arts, which it probably does, and if the sensible way to fund this is through a hypothecated tax, which it possibly is, then let the levy fall on those who are most likely to benefit. A tax on muesli, perhaps, or on designer ice creams.</p>

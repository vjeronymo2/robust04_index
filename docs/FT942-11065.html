			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Norway to float currency Norway announced yesterday it would formally adopt a floating rate currency policy, marking a shift from a long held target of re-establishing a fixed rate for the domestic currency, Karen Fossli reports from Oslo. The krone was de-linked from the European Currency Unit on December 10 1992. The aim of the move is to stabilise the krone against European currencies at around current levels and is a formalisation of practices undertaken since last spring. The krone yesterday traded about 5 per cent below its former central rate against the Ecu. Should Norway join the European Union, however, it intends to take part in European monetary arrangements and the parity grid. Norway will hold a referendum in November on membership of the EU.</p>

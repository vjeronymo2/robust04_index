			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal identifies certain minimum procedural and maintenance requirements. First the specialist's book must be kept confidential. Second, the affiliated upstairs firm can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions. Third, material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the affiliated upstairs firm from the issuer may not be made available to the specialist. Fourth, clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated upstairs firm and specialist entities. Fifth, the Exchange may from time to time request that specialists file information and reports in a specialty security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposal places limitations on the information which may pass between a broker associated with an affiliated upstairs firm and the specialist, such that they are limited to that exchange of information which would occur in the normal course of business with a comparable unaffiliated individual. Thus, the broker may make available to the specialist only the market information he would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal course of his trading and ``market probing'' activity. The specialist may divulge to the broker only the information about market conditions in specialty stocks that he would make available in the normal course of his specialist duties to any other broker, and in the same manner. The specialist, however, is further restricted in that he may provide market information to the broker only upon request of that broker and not on his own initiative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal permits an affiliated upstairs firm to popularize <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about the existence of possible conflicts of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Popularizing'' generally refers to the practice by specialists, their member organizations and their corporate parents, of making recommendations and providing research coverage regarding their specialty securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23768 (November 3, 1986), 51 FR 41183 (November 13, 1986) (``NYSE/Amex Order''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the proposal provides specific procedures that will apply if a specialist becomes privy to material non-public information. In such a case, the specialist must promptly inform his firm's compliance officer, or other designated official, of such communication and seek guidance from such officer or official as to what procedures he should subsequently follow. Such officer or official must maintain appropriate records, including the action taken and a summary of the information received by the specialist. If the specialist is required to give up the ``book,'' then such transfer must be done in a neutral fashion to ensure that the transfer itself does not disclose the information, and the Exchange must be informed. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The compliance officer is also required to keep a record of the time the specialist reacquired the book, reflecting acknowledgement by the compliance officer that the reacquisition was appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, with respect to compliance, the Exchange will periodically examine the Information Barrier procedures established hereunder and will conduct surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated upstairs firm and its affiliated specialist or specialist firm. The Exchange will monitor specifically the trading activities of affiliated upstairs firms and affiliated specialists in the specialist firm's specialty stock in order to monitor the possible trading while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison reports generated by the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that significant conflicts of interest can arise between an approved person and the affiliated specialist unit which, if not addressed by appropriate Information Barrier procedures and the monitoring and surveillance of the continuing adequacy of such procedures, could result in potential manipulative market activity and informational advantages benefitting the affiliated upstairs firm, specialist unit, or the customers of either, all in contravention of Section 6(b) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The Commission further believes that the procedures the Exchange intends to implement with respect to approving and monitoring the Information Barrier address these concerns, and therefore are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, in that the procedures proposed by the PSE are designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by specialist units affiliated with an affiliated upstairs firm. Further, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) Congressional finding <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  in that it aids in assuring fair competition among brokers and dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78k&hyph;1(a)(C)(ii) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission initially addressed the necessity and viability of Information Barriers in approving the amendments to New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') Rules 98 and 193 respectively, which created the present Information Barrier scheme in effect today on those exchanges. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  At that time, the Commission expressed its belief that it is also desirable for the regional exchanges to consider requiring specialists affiliated with integrated firms to establish an adequate Information Barrier and generally to review the efficacy of their surveillance and compliance procedures regarding those specialists. In this regard, the Commission thus far has approved two filings submitted by regional exchanges to adopt such procedures. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE/Amex Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34076 (May 18, 1994), 59 FR 26822 (May 24, 1994) (approving the Boston Stock Exchange Chinese Wall proposal); and 34449 (July 27, 1994), 59 FR 39611 (August 3, 1994) (approving the Cincinnati Stock Exchange Chinese Wall proposal). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Observer: Honourable mention Can anyone remember the last time the chairman of a big international bank and a bunch of his non-executive board chums resigned because they had let the side down? True, career bankers sometimes get the chop for making too many dud loans or overspending on acquisitions. But it is almost unthinkable for bigwig non-executive directors to take the rap as well. Hence the rarity of the boardroom exodus at Australia's troubled Westpac Banking Corporation. Chairman Sir Eric Neal, and four other members of the antipodean corporate establishment, have handed in their notice. Many of Westpac's problems can be blamed on bad management, but they occurred during the departing board's watch. So the five have done the honourable thing. What a pity that similarly placed non-executive directors of big London clearers or New York money centre banks are so reluctant to follow the Australian example.</p>

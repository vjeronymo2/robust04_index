			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : EL CAJON  </P> <P> Arraignment of an El Cajon businessman charged with kidnaping for ransom was  delayed Friday to give the defendant, J.C. Aler, time to complete legal  arrangements.  </P> <P> Aler is charged with the Tuesday kidnaping of Sarah Zien, the daughter of Jim  and Lois Zien, who are friends of Aler.  </P> <P> Aler, wearing blue jail clothing, stopped and stared when he entered the  courtroom Friday and saw Zien and her parents. He took a step backward as if to  leave, but a deputy marshal directed him to turn around and to face Municipal  Court Judge Gale Kaneshiro.  </P> <P> Aler's attorney, Jack Phillips, requested and received a continuance until  Tuesday, saying Aler has to complete legal arrangements.  </P> <P> Aler, 55, is being held in County Jail without bail.  </P> <P> If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in state prison.  </P> <P> Aler owns Industrial Plastics &amp; Assembly Corp. on North Magnolia Avenue in  El Cajon.  </P> <P> Sarah Zien, 26, told police she was kidnapped Tuesday after her abductor told  that other family members were in danger.  </P> <P> She was handcuffed to a toilet Tuesday night, but on Wednesday persuaded her  kidnaper to take her to a pharmacy to refill a prescription for a medical  problem.  </P> <P> Employees at the El Cajon drug store assisted Zien in escaping and Aler, who  was wearing a disguise, was arrested as he left the store.  </P> <P> The parents reportedly received telephone calls asking for a $400,000 ransom in  exchange for freeing the young woman. No ransom was paid.  </P></p>

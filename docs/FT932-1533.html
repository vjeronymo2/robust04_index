			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Shake-up at the Vestey empire LORD VESTEY has taken some of his executives by surprise by deciding to establish a new management structure for the Vestey Group under which all group operations and investments will report. Lord Vestey and Mr Edmund Vestey, who is chairman of the Western United Investment Company, are looking to hire a new chief executive and chief financial officer responsible for 'all the family interests'. However, Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive of Union International, the principal trading arm of the Vestey Group, has privately made it clear that he is not prepared in the short-term to report to any new management company. One of Union International's advisers yesterday said: 'Mr Robinson does not currently report to anyone, not even Union's holding company Western United. His contract, which has another 18 months to run, mentions nothing about reporting to any new Vestey company'. The Vesteys recruited Mr Robinson from Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, to turn around the heavily-indebted Union International. The company recently reported profit before tax and exceptional items of Pounds 30.8m in the year ended December 31, compared with a loss of Pounds 20.5m in the previous year. Mr Robinson reached a standstill agreement with Union's banks last year. The arrangement, however, is unlikely to be completed until December 1994. Mr Robinson is understood to have told the Vestey family that he is more than happy with reporting to a new management company, but only after Union's restructuring is completed by the end of next year. He yesterday confined himself to saying: 'I welcome the idea of experienced management at the top of the Vestey empire'. Mr Edmund Vestey said: 'It is in the best interests of all the group's stakeholders - employers, customers, shareholders - for a professional management team to be given strategic and day-to-day management control.' Mr Vestey will become non-executive chairman of the company and three other representatives of the family will be non-executive directors.</p>

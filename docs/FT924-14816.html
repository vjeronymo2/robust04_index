			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Russia approves draft law to raise customs tariffs THE Russian government yesterday approved a draft customs law which, if it is approved by parliament later this month, will impose tariffs of up to 15 per cent on imports and up to 30 per cent on certain sensitive exports. Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, a senior government adviser, described the draft customs law as an effort 'to defend certain branches of our domestic industry' and as retaliation against North American and Western European anti-dumping laws which he said had hurt Russian exporters. It may also represent an effort by Mr Piotr Avens, Russia's reformist minister of foreign economic relations, to defend himself against the biting attack of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who on Tuesday accused Mr Avens of 'lack of firmness and consistency in defending Russia's interests'. The draft law proposes import tariffs of 15 per cent on finished goods and 5 per cent on parts and raw materials. No tariffs are to be levied on foods and medicines on the grounds that these goods are in desperately short supply in Russia. Under the old Soviet system, quotas were used to restrict exports. Under the draft law, quotas will apply only to oil, oil products, precious metals and gas, which are heavily subsidised in Russia. In their stead, the draft proposes that exporters pay a tariff of between 20 and 35 per cent of the world price of the goods they are selling abroad. To enforce the law Mr Anatoli Kruglov, head of the State Customs Committee, told the official news agency Tass that he hopes to double Russia's current 300 customs posts. Mr Ulyukayev said that Russia is forming a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan, the most pro-Russian of the former Soviet republics, but that customs posts would be erected on Russia's borders with Ukraine, the Baltic republics and with the Caucasus region. He said Russia was particularly disturbed by the smuggling of roubles from the Baltic republics, where they are no longer legal tender. According to the Tass news agency, approximately Rbs750m in cash have been smuggled into Russia from Latvia and Lithuania since those republics de facto adopted their own currencies.</p>

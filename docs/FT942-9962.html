			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Lubbers throws hat into Euro ring Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, yesterday entered the campaign to become the next president of the European Commission with a call for a crackdown on organised crime and illegal immigration in the European Union. Mr Lubbers made his pitch to succeed Mr Jacques Delors in a speech in Aachen, Germany, on the future of Europe. His twin themes of law and order, as well as the need to tackle public insecurity over jobs, crime and drugs appeared aimed at coaxing Chancellor Helmut Kohl into backing his candidacy. Chancellor Kohl is reported to have reservations about Mr Lubbers, who faces rival bids for the top executive post in Brussels from Sir Leon Brittan, the chief EU trade commissioner, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. Until yesterday, Mr Lubbers has remained silent about his political ambitions. But in his speech - delivered in honour of Mrs Gro Harlem Brundt-land, the Norwegian prime minister and this year's winner of the Charlemagne prize, he managed to pay tribute to or mention almost all EU member states or prime ministers - with the exception of the UK. The German presidency of the EU, which takes over from Greece on July 1, has pledged to give high priority to such issues as crime, joblessness and illegal immigration. The 12 EU heads of government are expected to choose a successor to Mr Delors at the European summit in Corfu next month. A stand-off between Mr Dehaene and Mr Lubbers, both Christian Democrats, might delay a decision. However, Mr Dehaene, whose candidacy remains undeclared despite encouragement from France and Germany, may withdraw to avoid a public contest.</p>

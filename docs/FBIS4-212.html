			<p>BFN     [Text] Empangeni, Northern Natal April 5 SAPA--Several  hundred Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] supporters, many bearing  traditional sticks and shields, began massing at a field in  Empangeni in Northern Natal on Tuesday [5 April] in preparation  for a march to protest against violence. Police tried to  prevent the protesters from alighting from buses with their  traditional weapons, although many had assembled on the field  brandishing sticks and knobkerries in defiance of emergency  regulations.    Police spokesman Maj Margaret Kruger said organisers had  attempted to obtain permission for marchers to carry the  weapons, but this had been refused by police headquarters in  Pretoria. "They don't have permission to carry weapons. We are  trying to get the IFP leadership to get them together," she  said, adding that police would request marchers to leave their  weapons on the buses.    She said police did not want to provoke the crowd. "We will  see how the situation develops."    There was a strong police and defence force presence along  the march route and organisers said they expected thousands more  supporters to arrive later.    The atmosphere was cordial at 10.30AM in spite of a few  protestations by marchers when police searched them as they  alighted from buses.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: SAS to sell Chilean airline stake Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is near to finalising a deal to sell its 42 per cent stake in LanChile, Chile's leading airline. The shares could change hands for around Dollars 19m. SAS said the stake was no longer strategically important following the collapse of its plans to merge with Swissair, Austrian Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in the so-called Alcazar project. It stopped flying to South America in January 1992. The holding is being bought by two Chilean investors, the Cueto family and Mr Boris Hirmas, who already own 20 per cent of the airline. The Chilean government is expected to sell its 22 per cent holding in the airline soon. SAS said the disposal would produce a small capital gain. The move is not connected to its broader restructuring plan which aims to cut costs by SKr2.5bn (Dollars 313m). Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, is selling three finance subsidiaries to GE Capital, part of the General Electric group of the US. The units all belong to the bank's FinansSkandic subsidiary and have total assets of SKr5.8bn. The businesses being sold are SkandicBilfinans, a vehicle financing unit; Vendax, a computer leasing specialist; and Nordic Finans, which concentrates on office and data equipment.</p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Whistleblowers spotlight fraud at work Corruption and financial malpractice in the workplace were the most common concerns of workers who contacted a charity set up to give legal advice to employees. The first report of Public Concern at Work, the charity that advises so-called 'whistleblowers' - people who expose malpractice in the workplace  -is published today. It says that a third of the calls the charity dealt with in its first month of operation concerned corruption and potential fraud. It also found that the National Health Service was the largest single source of complaints. In one case support staff at a trust hospital - not named in the report because of the charity's duty of confidentiality - raised worries about a doctor who they said intimidated nursing staff and colleagues. They also alleged that his patients had a significantly higher mortality rate than those of his colleagues. The charity advised a union official to raise the problem informally with the hospital's chief executive. The result was that the working atmosphere improved and the doctor's medical performance was being monitored. Mr Guy Dehn, director of the charity, said the hierarchical nature of the NHS meant 'the idea that nurses, blue-collar or clerical staff could even politely suggest that the surgeon is chopping off the wrong leg is unheard of'. Of some 200 calls received by the charity in the first month, a quarter involved people with serious workplace concerns. Others wanted information on the legal service or had private grievances not covered under the charity's remit, which insists on a public-interest element in the concern. The report said 25 out of 51 people who had blown the whistle on their employers before contacting the charity had been victimised for speaking out, and 17 had been either sacked or forced to resign. It added that people at all levels, including directors, senior managers and consultants, had sought advice. Concerns included unsafe buses, mail-order fraud, suspected tendering fraud in local authorities, abuse of children in care, dubious methods in financial services and drugs misuse at work. The charity said that its advice in one case prevented the award of a Pounds 750,000 freight contract to a company which had been running unsafe vehicles. The safety inspector for the customer company ignoring his worries about the vehicles' roadworthiness and suspected he was receiving bribes from the contractor. The inspector was advised to raise his fears discreetly with the company finance director. This led to the contract being awarded elsewhere, but the suspect manager was still in post and the inspector was considering leaving his job.

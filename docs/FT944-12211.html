			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Bank to set up securities brokerage Sumitomo Bank, the world's largest lender, will join the country's other leading banks later this week in establishing a securities brokerage. The bank announced yesterday that it had received approval from Japan's ministry of finance for the wholly-owned subsidiary to begin trading on November 24. Last month, the MoF sanctioned plans for the other banks to establish their broking units, but withheld approval from Sumitomo because of a disagreement with the bank over the proposed name of its subsidiary. Sumitomo had wanted to call it Sumigin, an abbreviation of the bank's Japanese name. But the ministry objected to the use of the Chinese character 'gin' in the title - a character that forms part of the word for 'bank'. The authorities intend to maintain distinctions between the banks and their brokerage operations, and objected to the transparent similarity between the name of the bank and its subsidiary. Sumitomo has now agreed to call the company Sumitomo Capital Securities. The banks' long-awaited arrival in the brokerage business is likely to cause significant upheaval in Japan's financial sector. In order to protect the existing brokers, the activities of the banks' subsidiaries will, for the time being, be tightly circumscribed. They will not immediately be allowed to trade equities - the principal market - but will be confined to the growing business of corporate bond issuance. Nevertheless, companies like Sumitomo Capital Securities, backed with substantial capital from their parents, are likely to make large inroads into the market share of the brokers, who are already hard-pressed by the chronic weakness in Japan's equity market.</p>

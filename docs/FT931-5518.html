			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke In retrospect it is clear that Ladbroke's rather cheeky 1991 rights issue has pulled the company's fat out of the fire. The Pounds 460m was supposed to be spent developing the Hilton hotel chain, but has instead underpinned the damage caused by the property slump. However, gearing has risen back to 53 per cent - not far short of that before the issue. If intangible assets are excluded from the balance sheet gearing is 80 per cent. Shareholders funds are now almost exactly back to the level of two years ago. Without the rights cash, things might have got very sticky indeed. Which is not to say that everything is rosy at an operational level. With little upturn expected in the UK, Texas Homecare and racing are unlikely to increase profits. Hilton may do well in parts of the far east, but Japan and continental Europe will remain difficult. Property income may improve, but there is always the threat of a further write-down. The company may regard trading hotels as a normal part of its business, but this hardly provides high quality earnings. Ladbroke's reported Pounds 53.8m cash inflow includes Pounds 150m from hotel and property disposals. That has paid the dividend this year. Ladbroke will be similarly dependent on selling assets to maintain the payment in 1993. Fund managers may be attracted by a 7.5 per cent yield and a long run recovery story. But will they really be happy to be paid with their own assets?</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Commissioners gain new power - Confidentiality Tax commissioners are to be given the power to request information from the Inland Revenue on a taxpayer's liability to tax to help them in deciding tax appeals. The change outlined in the Finance Bill follows similar provision in the 1992 Finance (No 2) Act enabling the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, to make regulations giving General and Special tax commissioners powers to request information from taxpayers about their tax affairs. The move follows concern expressed by the Council on Tribunals, the government's tribunals watchdog, about the lack of formal procedural rules for tax appeals. In 1991 the Council produced a set of model rules, which prompted the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Inland Revenue to issue a joint consultation document: Procedural Rules for General and Special Commissioners. The consultation exercise exposed the need for commissioners to have tougher powers to request information from both sides to an appeal. Clause 239 of the bill provides powers for the Lord Chancellor with consent to make regulations allowing the commissioners to require any party to an appeal, including the Inland Revenue, to provide information relevant to the determination of a taxpayer's liability. The Lord Chancellor is expected to lay the regulations before Parliament soon. In the 1992/1993 tax year the general commissioners dealt with 376,695 tax appeals and the special commissioners heard 45 cases.</p>

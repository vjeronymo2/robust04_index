			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Call for study of gas market change MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and Industry secretary, is being urged by gas consumers to launch an investigation into recent changes in the gas market. The Gas Consumers Council, which represents the UK's 17m gas users, says in its annual report today that it believes proposals by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for restructuring British Gas and creating more competition in gas supply might mean higher prices. The reforms were agreed after a long row between British Gas and the OFT. They compel British Gas to cut its share of the industrial gas market by 50 per cent within three years and allow other gas suppliers to use its pipelines. The consumers council report warns that there is a limited amount of gas in the UK market and more competition might force the price of this gas higher. Sir James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, the industry's watchdog, said both domestic and industrial consumers would benefit from competition. Industrial consumers that were buying from suppliers other than British Gas were very satisfied and had seen price cuts of between 7 per cent and 9 per cent.</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): The customer always did know best MASS CUSTOMIZATION: THE NEW FRONTIER IN BUSINESS COMPETITION by B. Joseph Pine II Harvard Business School Press, Dollars 29.95, 333 pages FROM TIN SOLDIERS TO RUSSIAN DOLLS: CREATING ADDED VALUE THROUGH SERVICES by Sandra Vandermerwe Butterworth Heinemann, Pounds 25, 304 pages FOR GENERATIONS, Henry Ford's dictum about selling cars 'in any colour as long as it's black' has been a metaphor for a bygone business era. Yet until about a decade ago the essential precepts of Fordism, with its single-minded focus on making large volumes of standardised products as cheaply as possible for a homogeneous market, remained embedded in much of western industry. The Fordist model finally collapsed under external pressures with which it was ill-equipped to cope: the need to differentiate products in the face of saturated demand; accelerating technological change and discontinuity; the advent of new, more agile forms of competition, particularly from Japan; and above all, the emergence of more sophisticated and discriminating consumers. The system was further weakened by internal sclerosis. Its preoccupation with continuous production flows and operational efficiency bred a lop-sided, introverted management culture. Research and development became more remote from manufacturing, while the main role of the sales function was to dispose of whatever the factories chose to produce. Both books offer a broadly similar analysis of the failings of the old model. They also agree on the nature of the new challenge confronting business: to find ways of adding value by meeting the specific needs of individual customers, rather than merely through the relentless pursuit of lower production costs. The question is how to meet that challenge. Joseph Pine, a manager with IBM's executive education centre, argues that the answer - in both manufacturing and services - lies in combining the cost efficiencies of mass-production with the variety of tailor-made solutions which characterised craft production. His vision may sound fanciful. The strength of his book lies in its deft amalgamation of rigorous analysis with a wealth of plausible case studies of companies which have embarked on what most have discovered to be a never-ending quest for the holy grail of 'mass customisation'. Some examples, such as Toyota's ground-breaking work in cutting production cycles and accelerating model development and the story of the Swatch, are well-known. Others, such as the flexible production system developed by Bally Engineering Structures, a US building industry supplier, are fresh to the UK. Though Pine writes with proselytising zeal, he is realistic about the pitfalls which mass customisation can face. One is the pursuit of diversity for its own sake, which either fails to create additional demand or alienates customers by rendering existing products obsolete too rapidly - a trap into which some Japanese electronics and car manufacturers have fallen. Another danger is that too many different product offerings can create pressures for standardisation, as has happened in computer operating systems. But then, as Pine points out, such sudden changes of direction are part of the market turbulence to which 'mass customisation' is supposed to respond. The central thesis propounded by Vandermerwe, professor of international marketing at IMD, a Swiss business school, is that industries must increasingly think of themselves as providers of services, rather than producers of things. 'The inroads made by services will continue into the next millenium. In fact, they are likely to be even more predominant,' she writes. 'Whereas the service ethos is now the competitive differentiator, it will become a condition for corporate survival in the future.' But what does that really mean? The basic message seems to be that producers prosper by doing what customers want, rather than what suits themselves. However, Vandermerwe does not advance the debate on the concrete implications for management much beyond the existing literature on fashionable topics such as empowerment and teamwork. Nor is great enlightenment to be found in the book's choice of bite-sized case studies. Few observers would disagree that Federal Express and SAS are models of how to create value from customer service. But to commend in the same breath practices at American Express cards, IBM and Matsushita - all of which have recently seen their traditional market franchises eroded - is, to say the least, confusing.</p>

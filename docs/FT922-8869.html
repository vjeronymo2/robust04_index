			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / World's industrial nations make jobless top priority THE WORLD'S leading industrialised countries have placed unemployment back at the top of the international economic agenda, as concern has grown in several nations at a sharp rise in jobless totals over the past two years. Unemployment and wider social issues such as crime, inner city decline, immigration and racial and religious intolerance will be tackled in the first session of a two-day meeting of ministers from the 24 industrialised member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that starts in Paris a week today. The issue will be given more prominence than at any time since the early 1980s, reflecting rapid growth in unemployment in the OECD area to 30m from less than 25m two years ago. France, the US and the OECD secretariat have been especially keen to put unemployment high on the agenda. But Britain, which last week omitted any reference to unemployment in the Queen's speech outlining Mr John Major's legislative programme, is adopting a low-key approach to the OECD talks. Mr Michael Portillo, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, will go to Paris instead of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, accompanied by junior trade and foreign ministers. The 5m jump in unemployment since 1990 has reversed most of the fall in OECD jobless achieved through strong growth in the 1980s. The rise is viewed with particular concern because people in virtually all age groups and skill categories are affected. The OECD is especially worried about Europe, where unemployment is increasingly a white collar phenomenon and is expected to remain high for some years. The OECD's latest standardised jobless statistics showed that unemployment affected 9.2 per cent of the European Community's workforce in February compared with an average OECD unemployment rate of 7.2 per cent. The organisation has warned that developments in March pointed to 'a possible further deterioration in the OECD unemployment situation'. At the weekend, however, EC economics and finance ministers rejected any short cuts to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment in the community. After a French-inspired discussion on the effect of Germany's high interest rates on growth and employment, they agreed at an informal meeting in Oporto, Portugal, that fiscal rigour and structural reforms were the best way to create jobs. Next week's OECD meeting is likely to reach similar conclusions. The ministers are expected to stress the need for strengthening education and training, encouraging flexible wage setting, and promoting 'active' labour market policies that shift the emphasis from income support during unemployment to increasing the incentives for the unemployed to seek jobs.

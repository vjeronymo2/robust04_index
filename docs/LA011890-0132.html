			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS NORIEGA TRIAL TO BEGIN WEEK OF MARCH 5  </P> <P> In a surprise move, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler on Wednesday  ordered the drug-trafficking and money-laundering trial of deposed Panamanian  dictator Manuel A. Noriega and a raft of co-defendants to begin the week of  March 5, but he left open the possibility of postponements.  </P> <P> Hoeveler fixed the trial date after attorneys for Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid, one  of Noriega's co-defendants, invoked the federal "speedy trial" statute that  requires court proceedings to begin within 70 days of arraignment.  </P> <P> The action was taken following a two-day bail hearing in which much of the  government's case against Del Cid, the former commander of Panamanian military  forces in the province of Chiriqui, near the Costa Rican border, seemed  uncertain.  </P> <P> "You want to go to trial quickly, and you are entitled to go to trial quickly,"  Hoeveler told Del Cid's lawyers.  </P> <P> Noriega's lawyer, Frank Rubino, who was in the courtroom at the time, later  told reporters: "I'm as shocked as you are. . . . I told the judge I'd be ready  (for the trial) in nine months or a year."  </P> <P> Hoeveler indicated that he probably would postpone the trial if asked to do so  by Noriega or any of the other defendants. But he noted that Del Cid could be  tried separately. Del Cid previously asked to be tried alone, but Hoeveler has  not yet ruled on the motion.  </P> <P> The Del Cid bail hearing provided the first courtroom test of the case against  one of Noriega's associates. Hoeveler agreed to give Noriega's lawyers, Samuel  I. Burstyn and Kenneth Swartz, 10 days to respond to assertions made late  Wednesday by federal prosecutor Myles Malman. He will not announce his decision  on bail for Del Cid until he hears the response.  </P> <P> Under the relaxed rules that apply to bail hearings, attorneys for both sides  outlined for the judge the evidence they could present without being required  to prove their assertions.  </P> <P> Even so, significant factual portions of the prosecution case seemed shaky  during the hearing. Although indictments against Noriega, Del Cid and the other  co-defendants were returned almost two years ago, the government seemed  uncertain of the facts it hopes to prove.  </P> <P> In a Jan. 2 hearing, Malman had said the U.S. government was prepared to show  that Del Cid was former chief of intelligence for Noriega's Panama Defense  Forces. On Wednesday, though, Malman conceded that Del Cid had never held the  intelligence post.  </P> <P> "When I said Del Cid was head of (intelligence), I misspoke, but I misspoke in  favor of the defendant and not the government," Malman said, contending that  Del Cid was more powerful than the intelligence chief.  </P> <P> Later in the hearing, Malman said the intelligence post was held by Luis A.  Cordoba, and that "Cordoba and Del Cid were close." Burstyn, however, said the  friend of Cordoba actually was a Mario del Cid, not his client. Malman did not  contest the assertion.  </P> <P> At the Jan. 2 hearing, Malman also had asserted that Del Cid surrendered his  troops in Chiriqui province to invading U.S. forces only after military defeat  was inevitable and after Noriega had also given up the fight.  </P> <P> Swartz said Wednesday that Del Cid had telephoned the U.S. Southern Command  early in the invasion with an offer to surrender to avoid needless bloodshed.  </P> <P> "The surrender was not done at gunpoint; it was done over long-distance  telephone," Swartz said.  </P> <P> Later, Malman acknowledged that Del Cid offered to surrender Dec. 22, before  Noriega sought refuge in the Vatican embassy and at a time when there were no  U.S. troops in his province. The actual surrender came three days later, when  the first American forces arrived, Malman said.  </P> <P> The hearings were marked by an extraordinary degree of rancor between Burstyn  and Malman. Each man peppered his argument with sarcastic references to the  other.  </P></p>

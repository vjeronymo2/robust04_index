			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD TURNS FIRST-HALF FUTILITY INTO SECOND-HALF SUCCESS  </P> <P> University of San Diego, frustrated in the first half when its offense stalled  three times inside the 20-yard line, scored 22 second-half points Saturday en  route to a 28-14 victory over Menlo College in Atherton.  </P> <P> The victory for the Toreros (6-2) may have been the most satisfying of the  season, because it came against a team that had beaten two Division II  opponents and was ranked in the top 10 in the Division III Western Region. It  was the first victory in three attempts on the road against the Oaks (5-3) for  USD, which has a chance to equal its 7-2 record of a year ago.  </P> <P> "This is just a great team effort," Toreros Coach Brian Fogarty said.  </P> <P> But in the first half, getting in the end zone was an exercise in futility for  USD's offense. Fortunately for the Toreros, the their defense bought them some  time by making some big plays and scoring some points to trigger the big second  half.  </P> <P> With the game tied, 6-6, early in the third quarter, USD's offense broke down  for the third time deep in Oaks territory, this time on the 10. The drive  resulted in a 32-yard field goal by Dave Bergmann, his third of the game to  give USD a 9-6 lead.  </P> <P> Then two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Torero safety Darby Barrett  intercepted a bad pass by Menlo's Greg Clark and returned it 32 yards for a  touchdown. USD led, 15-6, after Bergmann's extra-point kick failed.  </P> <P> The Oaks pulled to within 15-12 when Clark capped an eight-play, 64-yard drive  with a three-yard touchdown pass to Matt Moseley on the first play of the  fourth quarter. But Darryl Jackson kept Menlo from cutting the lead to two when  he blocked the extra point.  </P> <P> That seemed to give the Torero offense the lift it needed. Fueled by a 54-yard  kick return by Fallbrook High alumnus Greg Frinell and a crucial  roughing-the-passer penalty on fourth down, USD's offense produced its first  touchdown on a 10-yard run by fullback Scott Sporrer.  </P> <P> Then after the defense forced a Menlo punt, the Toreros used 11 plays and five  minutes to march 49 yards and score again, this time on a seven-yard pass from  Brendan Murphy to tight end Mike Hintze. That gave USD a 28-12 lead with 6:16  left.  </P> <P> "The key for us was the second half, when we were able to run the ball on  them," Fogarty said. "We got them on their heels a bit, and it opened up our  passing game. It was nice to finally get the ball in the end zone." DANA HADDAD  </P></p>

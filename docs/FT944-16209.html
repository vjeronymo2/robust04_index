			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / A vote on Europe Mr John Major could show himself to be the cleverest bastard of them all today. 'Bastard', you may recall, is the term the prime minister once famously used to describe the uppity liberal nationalists within his administration. Several of his superficially loyal lib-nat colleagues have cast doubt on their own legitimacy this week. They have paid lip service to the government's carefully constructed position on the development of the European Union, but their body language has indicated that they do not believe a word of it. Mr Major could outflank them. He could promise a referendum on Europe. Let me explain. All politicians can learn from the speech given by Mr Tony Blair at the eau-de-nil conference in Blackpool 10 days ago. The Labour leader painted a picture of where he wanted to take the country. He sounded honest and straightforward. He capped his peroration with a sizzler. By undertaking to review the party's constitution, simultaneously translated by his aides to mean abandoning the socialist Clause 4, Mr Blair convinced his audience, including some Conservative observers, that he had the stuff of leadership in him. The honest and straightforward Mr Major could have the equivalent effect today. When he addresses the Conservative conference in Bournemouth this afternoon the prime minister will presumably stick by his European strategy, which is increasingly Gaullist. Beyond that he could, if he chose, say that his government would consult the people before throwing sterling into the melting pot of a single European currency. Monetary union may never happen, but, he could intimate, if it does Britain's position will be decided by the electorate. Mr Major's minions could fan out among the media and, nudge nudge, explain that by 'consult the people' he means a referendum. There is one immediate snag. The prime minister has repeatedly declared his opposition to plebiscites, on the ground that decisions should be taken in Parliament. Against that, he has just conceded a popular vote on the future of Northern Ireland. It is to his credit that he has done so. His careful management of the peace process is evidence of how his painstaking attention to detail, allied to his negotiating skills, can best be deployed. The declaration signed by Mr Major and his Irish counterpart at Downing Street before Christmas tied every participant - British, Irish, Northern Irish - to the principle of self-determination. That alone was worth establishing. The ceasefire announced by the 'loyalist' terrorists yesterday is evidence of the declaration's powerful effect. There is, however, a corollary. Self-determination cannot reasonably be granted to Ulster and subsequently denied the rest of the country. I have long argued that the EU is not an embryonic federation, but a casbah of governments, a permanent session of bargaining among national states. That proposition could not be sustained if the members of the EU melded their currencies and placed the management of their economies under the control of a single central bank. It would be a constitutional leap in the dark of greater importance than the matter of whether there is a united Ireland or a self-governing Scotland. Given the prospect of such a tremendous change in our fortunes, a referendum would be more than politic. It would be right. Opponents of a national vote always ask what the question would be. This one is easy. 'Do you want to join the European single currency?' A Yes and we would be in; a No and we would remain outside. The national debate that would precede the voting might be more elevated than cynics expect. A promise that such a question will be asked if the time comes should unite the Conservatives. It could silence most of the nationalist faction within the party. It would pre-empt an almost certain decision by Labour to promise a similar plebiscite if they are el-ected. It might even attract voters' attention. Fanatical chauvinists may protest that this is not enough. A referendum in the wild blue yonder, following, say, the amalgamation of the French franc, the D-Mark and the Benelux currencies, is too far away, too uncertain. They want a vote in principle, now. More ambitiously, they want the question to be 'do you want a federal Europe?' hoping for a No. That would pre-empt what they fear will be a further erosion of sovereignty following the 1996 inter-governmental conference on the development of the EU. On such matters the Eurosceptics are, however, divided, the wildest of them postulating a withdrawal from the Union. They are fighting under their blankets, each clutching their own nightmare. Those who would not quieten down after an offer of a single-currency referendum could, for a while at least, be ignored. Ministers I have spoken with in Bournemouth show some nervousness about what may be a close vote on the forthcoming 'own resources' bill on the finances of the EU. Are the backbench bastards hoping to bring the government down so that they might capture the party while in opposition? Is Mr Michael Quixote the potential leader of such a coup? I doubt it. On past form, the schismatics, themselves divided, will use the tension surrounding the passage of the own resources bill to extract such sceptical statements as they can from the prime minister. They picture themselves squeezing Mr Major to the last available drop, then supporting the government. Nobody expects the prime minister to announce a referendum this afternoon. It will be surprising if he does. Yet it is likely that by the time of the next election all three national parties will be committed to a popular vote on the EU. The Liberal Democrats are already there, Labour within a whisker of a decision. As to the outcome, senior ministers I consulted agree that Britain would probably stay out of a single currency at the start, then, after a few years, scramble to get in. One, a sceptic who thinks joining a single currency wrong on principle, accepts that, if the continental countries create a monetary union that works, we might think again. The chancellor says 'one day'; others 'never'. Come to think of it, we may need two plebiscites on a single currency before the decade is out, the first to say No and the second Yes.</p>

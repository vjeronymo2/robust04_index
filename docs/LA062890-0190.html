			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> HOUSING BILL CLEARS SENATE ON 96-1 VOTE  </P> <P> The Senate approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation's housing policies. The  96-1 vote would make available $17.9 billion next year -- an increase of $3.1  billion from the current level -- for housing for low- and moderate-income  families. The Bush Administration supports the Senate bill but opposes a  measure awaiting House action that would increase federal housing programs by  far more.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 4 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament  passed a motion dismissing all but two of the members of the  Slovak Television Council today. Supporters of the government  coalition's bill said the Council had sought to take over the  running the channel whereas it was meant only to ensure its  objectivity. The government was also concerned at the Council's  pro-Meciar bias and preferred all parliamentary parties to be  represented in it. The opposition decried the bill as an  infringement of democracy and a purge.    The motion was passed only in a repeat vote because in the  first attempt deputies had left a number of voting papers  invalid.    Today's edition of the trade union daily PRACA commented  that  the present coalition would be interested in voting "its people"  onto the Television Council because transmission times for party  political broadcasts are at stake before the general elections,  to be held September 30-October 1.</p>

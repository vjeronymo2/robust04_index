Around 100 armed Serb soldiers and police took control of  the  bridge on the River Sava Friday, overpowering a United Nations  control post manned by Nepalese troops.    Two battalions of Jordanian UN troops and part of a  contingent of Argentinian peacekeepers in north-central Croatia  were placed on alert, said UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig.    UNPROFOR commander in Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot,  threatened Saturday to order the use of force to regain control  of the bridge linking Stara Gradiska, Croatia, and the Bosnian  town of Bosanska Gradiska.    UNPROFOR deputy commander, John MacInnis, travelled to the  region Tuesday to prepare a report on the situation for Yasushi  Akashi, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special  representative in ex-Yugoslavia, said Nerzig.    A high-ranking UNPROFOR officer told AFP Saturday that, if  the Serbs from the self-declared Serbian republic of Croatia  (Krajina) refused to withdraw, the UN was in a position to  "exert armed pressure on them, encircle them and block their  movements."    Western military sources here said the Krajina Serbs could  have been supported by Serbian forces from northern Bosnia in  seizing the bridge.    The Croatian Serb agency ISKRA reported the takeover by a  unit of Krajina's "special police" Friday.</p>

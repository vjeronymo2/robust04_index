			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Pacific Rim output on the up - Asia: Ian Robertson examines the market's renewed expansion Congestion, low incomes, government policy, pollution and underdeveloped roads will all hamper market progress in some Pacific Rim countries, but the average rate of growth will still be almost four times that of the west. The new-vehicle markets of the region registered a 12 per cent increase, to 1.9m sales, in 1993 - and this did not include the large growth markets of China and South Korea, which together accounted for more than 2.8m sales. Demand is likely to exceed 2m this year, and rise to over 3m (including 1.5m cars) by 2000, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (The Automotive Sector of the Pacific Rim and China Report R320). Last year's greatest volume growth occurred in Thailand, India and Indonesia, while the more mature and congested market of Taiwan reported a slight fall in new vehicle sales. By the end of the decade, Thailand will overtake Taiwan to become the region's leading vehicle market, followed by India and Indonesia; while, with its gross domestic product now beginning to increase rapidly, Vietnam takes its first painful steps towards motorisation. After slipping in the previous year, vehicle production in the Pacific Rim rose by 10 per cent, to over 1.6m units in 1993; and forecasts indicate that, by the end of the decade, the industry will be producing 3.2m vehicles a year. The risks to investors in the region include potential political uncertainty. Thailand and the Philippines have had recent difficulties and, although stability appears to have returned, it is by no means assured. India has a host of potential problems, from its borders with Pakistan to states wanting to break away from the federation. Only the Philippines, Indonesia and India have experienced any real economic downturn in the last few years, although demand has slowed in most countries. All are expected to see considerable development of their infrastructures and economic wealth over the next few years. Population growth could present difficulties in the long term, particularly for India and Indonesia. Conversely, the prospects for Malaysia may be limited by a labour shortage. Income levels are still low. The passenger car market usually begins to grow quickly when GDP per head reaches the current equivalent of about Dollars 5,000 a year. Only Taiwan has reached this level. In India GDP per head is only Dollars 250. By this measure, for most of the region any real volume opportunity, particularly for passenger car sales, remains some way off. Some of the largest markets - notably Taiwan - remain effectively closed to incoming car manufacturers, while Japanese vehicle producers and technology already have a formidable hold in the car and light commercial vehicle markets of the region. In Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, Toyota will retain its dominance. In Malaysia, Mitsubishi and Daihatsu will control the market through their local producers. In Taiwan, there is a more fragmented Japanese control, although Mitsubishi monopolises the commercial vehicle sector. In India, in spite of news of Volkswagen's latest partnership with Eicher Goodearth, the market is dominated by Suzuki's technology; while, in Vietnam, Mitsubishi appears to have gained the strongest role. Although quality levels still fall short, Japan is aware of the potential of the region's low labour costs as a refuge from the high yen, and its policies have sought to satisfy co-operative ambitions across the region, including the development of specific models for Pacific Rim markets. Bangkok now has the world's worst traffic congestion. Kuala Lumpur is little better. And Taiwan is trying to restrict sales of vehicles until its mass transit system is complete. Already infrastructure is lagging behind market growth, and the Tiger economies are suffering the penalty of little or no pollution controls. Overcapacity and restricted growth prospects elsewhere in the mature markets of the industry have inflated interest in this emerging region. Moreover, the rush of new investment into the Pacific Rim threatens to result in gross capacity in excess of foreseeable demand. In the latest market to emerge, Vietnam, the government is already concerned about over-supply as Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Peugeot SA join others in the latest attempt to break into the market. With time running out, opportunities for new entrants in the region centre on the commercial vehicle sector - notably pickups and light vans. The other growth opportunity is in components. As the volume of vehicles produced in the region grows, the components industry will need to restructure and rationalise. New entrants also offer access to advanced technology - essential for markets such as Malaysia or Taiwan with ambitions to step up exports of their own national vehicles. In some markets, government-initiated programmes are stimulating development of the automotive sector. In India, the removal of stifling controls in 1991 heralded a period of transformation for the industry. During the 1980s there were only three vehicle manufacturers in the country, producing around 120,000 vehicles per year; now there are 13, with installed capacity of almost 600,000 units. Sales were lifted last year, when excise duties were reduced from 55 per cent to 40 per cent, resulting in lower car prices and further reductions in the tax burden are expected. Competition for industry leader Maruti/Suzuki is growing. Other local producers are keen to enter the smaller car segment: Mahindra, Telco, Bajaj and Escorts. In addition, Premier, already the second largest supplier in the car market, has spent much of the past few years exploring new opportunities. Hindustan Motors, the third main supplier in the car sector, is working on a rival in collaboration with Germany's Opel; while Eicher will start production with Volkswagen in 1997. A new entrant, Sipani, has also signed an agreement with Rover to produce the Montego. Other challenges come from Mercedes-Benz, Daewoo and, significantly, from the motor-cycle industry. Japan's grip on the Indonesian market is overwhelming and getting tighter. Japanese producers control 99 per cent of the commercial vehicle market and over 80 per cent of the smaller car sector. They are investing in new facilities and introducing new models. They have increased their shares in local assemblers, and are supporting the Indonesian government's plans to develop a regional Asean components industry. Their dominance of the market has forced many weaker competitors - both US and European - to withdraw in recent years. Outstanding growth prospects are still luring newcomers in, however, not least Volkswagen's Seat and Skoda, Proton, Hyundai, Opel and Kia. In Malaysia, the government is keen to build on the success of Proton. A second national project has just started production, making the Kancil in partnership with Daihatsu. A third project is planned involving pickups with Hyundai, and a fourth is on the drawing board. The Philippines government is trying to stimulate the sector with the development of a smaller, inexpensive people's car. This has brought Kia, Honda, Daihatsu, Fiat and Daewoo into the market as assemblers. The car development programme will regulate the industry until at least 1998, when local content requirements may be scrapped, with a radical change in market structure expected to follow. In Taiwan, industry attention centres on the Gatt, which could mean that import tariffs on vehicles and parts will have to fall quickly, with devastating implications for local producers. The challenges to the country's export drive are also mounting. To boost the local industry and to meet the conditions of the GATT, the government in Thailand is liberalising the sector. In 1990, it lifted a ban on imports under 2.3 litres. Vehicle taxes were cut in the following year, and in November the government signalled that it was to end the requirement for assemblers to have local stakeholders. In Vietnam, still at a more embryonic stage, several vehicle manufacturers are already queueing up to join the Mekong Corporation (Ssangyong/Fiat Iveco) and Vietnam Motors Corporation (Colombian Motors of the Philippines) in a bid to share the expected growth in the region's newest vehicle market. Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, BMW and other South Korean suppliers have all sought to make substantial investments, and look likely to succeed. Others, including Suzuki, Toyota, Volkswagen and Peugeot SA, are also trying to break into the market, but finding entry more difficult.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PACIFIC RIM: SALES AND FORECAST SALES OF NEW MOTOR VEHICLES (000S)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Taiwan    Thailand       India   Indonesia  Philippines  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990     9,484.0     9,302.7     9,357.7     9,274.5     9,132.7 1991     9,487.0     9,268.6     9,344.9     9,261.4     9,118.6 1992     9,547.1     9,363.0     9,330.3     9,169.5     9,146.1 1993     9,540.1     9,456.5     9,382.0     9,214.2     9,163.6 1994     9,574.0     9,435.0     9,405.2     9,277.5     9,172.0 1995     9,596.0     9,460.0     9,430.0     9,313.0     9,183.0 1996     9,604.0     9,490.0     9,460.0     9,353.0     9,190.0 1997     9,618.0     9,540.0     9,490.0     9,389.0     9,199.5 1998     9,632.0     9,585.0     9,530.0     9,430.0     9,210.0 1999     9,646.0     9,625.0     9,570.0     9,482.0     9,223.0 2000     9,660.0     9,665.0     9,610.0     9,540.0     9,236.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Malaysia    Vietnam      Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1990             9,165.9       91.8    91,719.3 1991             9,181.9       90.8    91,663.2 1992             9,145.1       96.0    91,707.1 1993             9,154.4       97.5    91,918.3 1994             9,175.0       99.7    92,048.4 1995             9,189.0      913.8    92,184.8 1996             9,209.0      918.8    92,324.8 1997             9,230.0      928.2    92,494.7 1998             9,243.0      936.2    92,666.2 1999             9,255.0      942.7    92,843.7 2000             9,266.0      951.5    93,028.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EIU: The Automotive Sector of the Pacific Rim and China  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

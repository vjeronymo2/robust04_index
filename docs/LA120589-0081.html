			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OFFICERS DETAINED, FREED IN E. GERMANY  </P> <P> Soviet military personnel in East Germany detained a team of U.S. military  officers for 7 1/2 hours on the eve of President Bush's summit with Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Pentagon said Monday.  </P> <P> "There were no U.S. or Soviet injuries. U.S. personnel were released later that  day. The incident is under investigation," a Pentagon spokesman, Navy Lt. Cmdr.  Ken Satterfield, said.  </P> <P> Satterfield said the U.S. team was "on their assigned mission" which involved  observing installations near Halle in East Germany.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how many U.S. and Soviet personnel were involved  in the incident.  </P> <P> The spokesman said the vehicle in which the U.S. team was riding was held and  "a tire was punctured with a bayonet." Satterfield said the team was not  threatened.  </P> <P> The incident, which was confirmed by several other Pentagon officials, has  raised tempers among some military officers.  </P> <P> The U.S. military mission in Potsdam was established under a 1947 accord that  allowed the Western allies and the Soviets to set up such offices in each  other's occupied zones of Germany.  </P> <P> The incident had not been announced by U.S. authorities, and Pentagon officials  offered information about it when questioned by reporters.  </P> <P> "They don't want to elevate this," said one Pentagon source, referring to  efforts by U.S. officials to minimize the incident at a time of improving  U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> Satterfield said he was not aware that any official protest had been filed over  the detention.  </P> <P> "The incident was not routine, but it's not unheard of, either," he said. "It's  being handled on a military-to-military basis."  </P> <P> The spokesman said the liaison officers operate under an agreement that allows  contentious issues such as these to be discussed between U.S. and Soviet  military commanders.  </P> <P> In 1985, Army Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., 37, assigned to the U.S. military  liaison mission at Potsdam, was killed by Soviet guards near the town of  Ludwigslust, in East Germany. Soviets officials said at the time that Nicholson  was taking photographs in a restricted area.  </P></p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Stake sale knocks 4 1/2 p off Queens Moat shares SHARES IN Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group, fell 4 1/2 p to 53 1/2 p yesterday after an announcement that Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, had sold 1.1m shares for Pounds 629,500. Mr Marcus said he had sold the shares to fulfil personal obligations and that the transaction was not related to any aspect of the group's performance. He sold 500,000 shares at 57.5p and 600,000 for 57p. He still holds an additional 1.16m Queens Moat shares. Mr Marcus said the group's close season began on Monday and he would not have been able to deal in the company's shares until after the annual general meeting at the end of May. He said: 'One has to look to one's personal commitments.' The sale did not reflect a lack of confidence in the company. 'The fact that I have a pretty large holding goes to confirm that,' he said. Mr Marcus said Queens Moat hoped to make an announcement in 'the not too distant future' on the use of an international hotel brand. Rumours have circulated for several months that Queens Moat intends to broaden its link with Holiday Inn. Queens Moat is already a Holiday Inn franchisee on the Continent and in the UK. Holiday Inn is thought, however, to want to increase its UK presence. Last year, Scott's Hospitality, a Canadian company, changed the franchise of 15 of the UK hotels it owns and operates from Holiday Inn to Marriott.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Algerian Economy Minister Mourad Benachenou has just  paid a lightning visit to Paris. He met with his French  counterpart Edmond Alphandery. France is not renewing the aid  it gave last year for the immediate future, but it has  reaffirmed its support for the Algerian authorities. Jerome  Bastion:    [Bastion] There is support in principle, but financial  commitment only behind the IMF [as heard]. This is basically  Paris's response to the visit by the Algerian economy minister,  as France has made the continuation of its aid -- 6.3 billion  francs in 1993 -- conditional on an agreement for the  rescheduling of the crushing Algerian debt to the IMF.    The Algerian economy minister must have been disappointed at  a time when the Malek government is regularly calling for more  sympathy and understanding from the French. It should be said  that Paris's response is somewhat brusque; France, which is  Algeria's main creditor and is owed more than 18 percent of its  debt, has already, for example, wiped out Egypt's debt.  However, France's caution is explained by the reticence of its  partners in the Paris Club over becoming too involved with an  unsteady government which is dragging its feet over liberalizing  its economy. However, on the internal front the Algerian  authorities have a twofold problem -- finding fresh money to  avoid bankruptcy and also avoiding the social upheaval which the  measures to clean up the economy could bring about.    Leaving Paris the Algerian minister headed for Washington,  where he could finalize the stopgap loan announced by the IMF  head in Algiers a week ago.</p>

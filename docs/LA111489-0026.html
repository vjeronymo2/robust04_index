			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL  </P> <P> Charles Krauthammer's column ("Shamir Is Guarding Israel, Not Quibbling," Op-Ed  Page, Nov. 5) defending Shamir's refusal to negotiate with Palestinians outside  the occupied territories betrays a thinly veiled pro-annexation bias.  </P> <P> If either Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir or Krauthammer were seriously  interested in establishing a lasting territorial compromise between Israel and  the Palestinian people, locking the 3.5 million Palestinians living outside the  West Bank and Gaza out of the peace process would be the worst way to achieve  it. For without the political and economic support and continued loyalty of  these external Palestinians, a weak Palestinian mini-state in the West Bank and  Gaza could readily be undermined by "Palestinian outsiders" claiming no  allegiance to its borders, leaders or political institutions.  </P> <P> Israel's own long-term security, thus, depends on obtaining the binding  commitment of the Palestinian diaspora and the Palestine Liberation  Organization, in addition to the territories existing residents, to any  negotiated peace.  </P> <P> Neither the majority of Palestinians nor Jews may be able to live in the  resulting Palestine or Israel. But the majority of both must have "their  homeland" to support.  </P> <P> Shamir's and Krauthammer's objection to talking to external Palestinians about  this path to peace, indeed, is not a "quibble." It is a calculated political  monkey wrench thrown into the peace mechanism itself.  </P> <P> JOEL GAYMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

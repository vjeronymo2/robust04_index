			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party-National Salvation Front  [PD-FSN] has faxed us the text of an open letter addressed by  that party to President Ion Iliescu. Among other things, the  letter says, quote, we express our sorrow, disillusion, and  great concern caused by the fact that, over the short period of  time that elapsed since your talks with the representatives of  the PD-FSN, a dangerous record was achieved in the violation of  the rules any democratic regime ought to follow through the  elimination of some of the essential offices in parliament as  well as by the intensification of the unspeakable attacks  against the opposition, in a new campaign launched by the  representatives of the current state power, beginning with the  head of the executive and ending with the leaders of the  extremist parties belonging to the ruling majority.    We are certain that you are well aware of all these facts,  but we would still like to remind you of an extremely grave act  that totally despises parliamentary norms, namely the way in  which the draft bill empowering the government to rule by  ordinances was discussed and passed in parliament. That  regrettable moment is an embarrassing world premiere in this  domain: A normative act was passed while parliament lacked the  constitutionally established quorum. Unfortunately, that is not  a solitary case, as a large number of representatives of the  current state power, both in the government and in parliament,  are systematically trying to put the opposition in a situation  that is inconceivable in truly law-governed states, obviously  intending to make it capitulate unconditionally under the  pressure of abuse and discriminating and discretionary acts that  also include menaces with penal sanctions, unquote.    After emphasizing the need for the accomplishment of a  national pact, the letter outlines the key ideas and principles  of the pact that the PD-FSN has repeatedly proposed. It then  defines the concepts of a national pact, national interest, the  structure of the pact, the economic pact, the social pact, and  the political pact.</p>

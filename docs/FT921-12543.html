			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Stock Exchange to probe market in Lonrho shares THE LONDON Stock Exchange is investigating whether there was a false market in Lonrho shares on Thursday, during which it was difficult for investors in the international trading group to assess the proper value of the shares. This emerged yesterday as Lonrho revealed that it is planning another Pounds 400m worth of disposals which it hopes to complete within three months. Although it has given itself a year to reduce net debt from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 600m, Lonrho said negotiations over a series of sales were at an advanced stage and could be completed by the end of April. Institutional investors, meanwhile, said they wanted the company to explain its unexpected dividend cut. Exchange investigators are focusing on Lonrho's announcement early on Thursday that it was selling 50 per cent of its interest in Kuhne &amp; Nagel, the German freight forwarder. This was followed, after the stock market had closed, by a separate announcement of its full-year results and the decision to cut its final dividend. The announcement of the disposal was regarded as good news by the market and Lonrho's shares rose 9p to close at 163p. However, Lonrho's shares then plunged in after-hours dealing, when the company disclosed its annual profits were well below most forecasts. By yesterday's close thay had fallen 43p to 120p. An official with a close knowledge of the inquiry said the exchange would be trying to find out why the announcements were not made at the same time. Lonrho said it would use most of the DM340m (Pounds 118.4m) proceeds from the sale of its stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel to reduce borrowings. Three of Lonrho's directors - Mr Philip Tarsh, Mr Robin Witten and Mr Paul Spicer - have arranged a series of meetings with institutional shareholders next week. These include the South African Mutual Life Assurance Society, Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, Legal and General, Robert Fleming Investment Management and Postel Investment Management. Fund managers contacted by the Financial Times yesterday said that they would be pressing the directors of Lonrho to explain why the group cut its final 1991 dividend by 3p to 5p and withheld its first 1992 interim dividend. One said: 'Given that the banks did not force the group to cut its dividend, Lonrho must obviously be feeling pressure from another quarter.' Mr Spicer said: 'I wish people would accept that we are in the middle of a recession. We have prudently decided to cut the dividend. This year is going to be a good housekeeping year for us.'

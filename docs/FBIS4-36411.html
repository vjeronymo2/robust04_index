			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in Sanaa by </F> Amir Taheri in London; date not given]    [Text] [Taheri] After more than five weeks since the  fighting began, do you believe that resorting to force was  unavoidable?    [Salih] That question suggests that it was Sanaa which  resorted to force. We would like to stress to you that we went  to impossible lengths to avert the fighting. It would take a  long time and numerous pages to explain all that in detail.  Nevertheless, we are willing to reply to any suggestion that  Sanaa was working for a military solution to the crisis, which  was prepared and stirred up by known leaders in the Socialist  Party who were preparing to implement its military aims at least  10 months before the fighting began. Numerous states have  irrefutable evidence of this, namely the arms supplies which  were delivered secretly to al-Mukalla and Aden ports with  financing from some states in the region.    Sanaa is certain that al-Bid's return to Aden on 19 August  1993 and his remaining there until the day he moved (to  Hadhramaut) and his refusal to return to Sanaa after the signing  of the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman on 20 February, after  Aden's failure to engage in a long-term confrontation with the  al-'Amaliqah forces in Abyan on the same evening the signing  took place...all this was part of the conspiracy which resulted  in the current state of war. So Sanaa cannot be accused of  preparing for this war. And if you have any doubts in this  connection, we want you to provide evidence of your doubts so we  can reply to them more clearly.    [Taheri] What can the Yemeni leadership achieve through  military confrontation that it cannot achieve through  negotiation?    [Salih] We confirm to you that negotiation and dialogue were  the Presidential Council chairman's preferred option. The  military option was imposed by the other party, because his real  aim since he fabricated the crisis on 19 August 1993 was to  impose secession by force -- which so far he has failed to  achieve.    Thus we stress that the political leadership in Sanaa can  achieve all its aims through dialogue as long as this dialogue  is based on constitutional legitimacy, adherence to Yemeni  unity, and compliance with the results of the 27 April 1993  elections. But if the secessionists are seeking to achieve  through dialogue what they have failed to achieve by force, they  will suffer a more severe failure than their military failure.    [Taheri] Under what conditions would the Yemeni leadership  be willing to accept a halt to the operations, starting with  agreeing to the cease-fire?    [Salih] A cease-fire is not a problem for us, because our  Armed Forces have been able to destroy the huge military  equipment the rebels inherited from their close relations with  the Warsaw Pact and as a result of the huge supplies they  purchased before and after fabricating the crisis through  al-Bid's return to Aden, and with finance from some Gulf  Cooperation Council states. However, we do not conceal that we  are very concerned that the Security Council resolution is  nothing but a prelude to new accusations to be fabricated  against the Republic of Yemen and its political leadership for  the sake of passing new resolutions or justifying blatant  interference in our internal affairs, especially as we had  bitter experience in the early sixties during the conflict  between monarchists and republicans.    [Taheri] Under what conditions and within what framework  do you expect the Security Council to play a role in ending the  armed conflict?    [Salih] We are certain that the Security Council's role in  ending the existing dispute cannot transcend the existing  legitimacy. Proof of this is the situation the government of  north Cyprus has been experiencing for about 20 years. You know  who is behind it. But we cannot ignore the possibility that  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas may become a second Denktas. However,  he cannot achieve at the international level more than his  opposite number has achieved.    [Taheri] Are you demanding the restoration of the situation  that existed before the fighting erupted? Or is your government  willing to negotiate a new formula for unity with the southern  leadership?    [Salih] The Yemeni leadership is demanding nothing from  anyone under the legitimate unity announced on 22 May 1990 on  the basis of legal and constitutional foundations governed by  the laws in force in what used to be called the Yemen Arab  Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. The  Republic of Yemen was established on the basis of the  constitutional rules and legal stipulations that governed the  two countries. After the announcement of the unified state, the  Constitution, over which we negotiated for 10 years, became the  foundation of the new entity. After the announcement of the  Republic of Yemen, a referendum was conducted on the new state's  Constitution, on which the inhabitants of the republic  overwhelmingly agreed. Nearly three years after the state was  announced, general elections were held, and the world attested  they were honest. Then the coalition government you know was  formed. Despite all this, the secessionists relied in their  announcement on House of Representatives members loyal to them,  who had been elected by the people under the Constitution of the  Republic of Yemen and the electoral law ratified by the House of  Representatives, whose speaker was a prominent member of the  Socialist Party, which is now seeking a new legitimacy for  itself. So can there be any other demands for us to submit to  the secessionists except the abolition of their decision to  secede? If that is not achieved through legitimate channels  internationally, I am certain that the Yemeni people are capable  of achieving their unionist aims. And we stress to you that the  preceding means that we are not willing to accept any formula.    [Taheri] Are there any mediation efforts which enjoy the  Presidential Council's support? Or is the aim to achieve a  decisive and complete victory on the battlefield?    [Salih] We believe that it is the secessionists who  desperately need to achieve a decisive military victory on the  battlefield, because that is the only way to prove their  legitimacy. As for the legitimate authority in the Republic of  Yemen, it does not need to do that, because it cares very much  about every citizen's life, and shedding citizens' blood cannot  be a means to prove its legitimacy. It is the rebels who need  to prove their legitimacy by shedding the Yemenis' blood.    On that basis, we have confronted them firmly and  powerfully,  because we know who is behind them. And we can clearly tell you  now that we are not fighting a party that obtained 25 percent of  the citizens' votes. It represents a minority that cannot be  relied on. We are facing a foreign scheme.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOHN PISANO HITS RIGHT CHORDS FOR BRAZILIAN TUNES  </P> <P> It was one of those cultural juxtapositions, like the kosher burrito, that we  in Southern California have come to expect. This time it was Brazilian jazz  being played in a Mexican restaurant.  </P> <P> The occasion? New York-born guitarist John Pisano joining bassist Luther  Hughes' trio Friday and Saturday nights for their regular weekend appearance at  El Matador restaurant in the Huntington Harbour Mall. Pisano was a member of  Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass and wrote material for Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66  some years ago. He also accompanied Peggy Lee for a time and appeared on Joe  Pass' momentous album "For Django." Pass included Pisano on his most recently  recorded album as well.  </P> <P> It was the Pass association that was most prevalent during Pisano's first set  Friday. In a program of mostly familiar Brazilian standards, the guitarist, on  both electric and acoustic instruments, played with clean, accurate tones and  improvisational savvy of the kind that Pass has built his reputation on. In a  world full of guitarists making a living on no more than three chords, Pisano  deserves wider exposure.  </P> <P> Opening on electric, Pisano pulled a classic Wes Montgomery-like sound from his  instrument during Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Captain Baccardi," spiking melodic  single-note lines with plucky, rhythmic chording. While keyboardist Matt Harris  stated the winsome theme of "Cascade of the Seven Waterfalls," Pisano's  soulful, samba-flavored chording moved along at the speed of a stroll in the  sand. The tune ended with some spunky chordal exchange between guitar and  keyboard that recalled the melody to Thelonious Monk's "Bright Moments."  </P> <P> The guitarist switched to acoustic for his own "Amanhecer" -- Portuguese,  Pisano explained, for "dawning" or "daybreak" -- spinning strings of  well-defined notes into a narrative whole above Hughes' gently swaying bass.  The bassist took a spare, considered solo on the tune, reworking the somber  theme while backed by Harris' synthesized string accompaniment.  </P> <P> Everaldo Ferreira held down the percussive chores, working an understated  double time on his cymbals during bossa nova-style beats and always keeping  some suggestion of dance movement in his timekeeping. Odd man out on this night  seemed Harris, whose electric keyboard solos, glistening with pop  sensibilities, detracted from the evening's decidedly Brazilian feel.  </P> <P> The crew found common ground on Jobim's well-worn "One-Note Samba" and "Summer  Nights," the title cut from Pass' latest album. Though the rhythm section  seemed a bit tentative on the reflective tune, Pisano put this mood to good  use, coaxing an intoxicating blend of hope and nostalgia from his strings. The  guitarist turned to his electric instrument on Neil Larson's "Sudden Samba," a  lively romp which featured Ferreira using his snare as a kind of touchstone  during his snappy drum solo.  </P> <P> Brazilian burrito, anyone?  </P></p>

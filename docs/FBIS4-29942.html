			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second in three-part series entitled "Moves Are Afoot To </F> Streamline and Integrate U.S. Military Bases on Okinawa":  "Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield -- The Full Return of the Airfield  Is Under Study"]    [Text] The return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield hinges  largely on how to resolve a radio wave obstacle problem at the  Sube Communications Station operated by the U.S. Navy. The  Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed on 16 June to set up a task  force mandated to discuss ways to return the airfield. The task  force will begin studying technical ways to resolve the radio  wave obstacle problem. U.S. forces in Okinawa have already  assigned experts to do research on the relocation of the  communications station.    The question is where the current parachute training ground  should be relocated from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. U.S.  forces in Okinawa have often conducted parachute training on Ie  Island. U.S. forces in Okinawa have said: "The parachute  training ground on Ie Island is located near coastal areas and  paratroopers are in danger of losing their lives if they land in  the water. We have to ferry our paratroopers to the island the  day before parachute training is conducted on the island and  preposition rescue boats in waters near the parachute training  ground. We have to spend a lot of time and money to conduct  parachute training on the island." In this way, U.S. forces in  Okinawa think it improper to relocate the parachute training  ground from Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield to Ie Island.    Chubu Training Ground at Camp Hansen, which is located  between Kin Town and Ginoza Village, is being mentioned as a  potential site for the relocation.    U.S. forces in Okinawa use Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield not  only as a ground for parachute training, but as a radio wage  buffer area for the Sube Communications Station. The  communications station is managed by a U.S. naval communications  security group assigned to the Naval Communications Security  Group Command (NSGC). U.S. forces in Okinawa call the  communications station Hanza base.    The communications station is part of the global U.S.  communications network. The station intercepts foreign  communications and secret codes in the Asian region and sends  them back to the NSGC in Washington D.C. after decoding them.    According to an American serviceman, economic activities are  expected to be brisk as one building after another is  constructed near the communications station and U.S. forces in  Okinawa are concerned that such buildings would obstruct the  smooth operation of the communications station. According to the  same American serviceman, a group of American electronics  engineers are looking for an alternative site on the premise of  relocating the communications station.    If the parachute training ground is relocated from Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield, then the Sube Communications Station would  have to be relocated. There is a high possibility that their  relocations could abruptly lead to a full return of the Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield. It is said that plans worked out by U.S.  forces to resolve problems facing the communications station  definitely indicate the possibility of fully returning the  communications station. The biggest task will be the technical  study of how to relocate the communication station and the study  of how to persuade Okinawans residing in an area where the  communications station is relocated.</p>

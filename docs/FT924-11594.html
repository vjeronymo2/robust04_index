			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Exxon and Mobil slightly ahead in third quarter EXXON and Mobil, the two biggest US oil and natural gas groups, yesterday reported third-quarter net profits that were only slightly improved year-on-year. Exxon said its third-quarter net income was Dollars 1.135bn, compared with Dollars 1.115bn in the same period last year. That translates into earnings per share of 90 cents, two cents higher than a year ago. Exxon added, however, that with extraordinary items stripped out its year-to-year improvement was 6 per cent. Mobil reported a 13 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits, to Dollars 413m. That was Dollars 1.00 per share in the 1992 third quarter, compared to 87 cents a year ago. However, the company said that with extraordinary items stripped out its third-quarter 1992 net would be 11 per cent higher than last year. Mobil also announced that from January 1 next year it would start reorganising its European sales, marketing and administrative activities. The reorganisation would see the full range of Mobil's business placed in three new profit centres - refining, fuels marketing and lubricants marketing. Revenues from these businesses in Europe last year amounted to Dollars 14.87bn out of total worldwide revenues of Dollars 38bn. Mobil said the European reorganisation was accounted for as part of the Dollars 68m of restructuring charges it had written off in the third quarter. Some 8,000 of Mobil's 67,000 total employees are employed in these European activities, although the group said it could not predict how many jobs might eventually be cut as a result of the reorganisation. Exxon said its third-quarter revenues were Dollars 30.6bn, up from Dollars 27.5bn a year ago. Third-quarter capital and exploration spending was Dollars 2.16bn, down from Dollars 2.28bn in the same quarter last year. For the first nine months of 1992 Exxon's net profit was Dollars 3.44bn, a sharp drop from the Dollars 4.48bn achieved in the same period of 1991. The company attributed the slump to unusually high refining margins in early 1991 that resulted from declining crude prices. Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 were Dollars 86.32bn, up slightly from Dollars 85.47bn in the same period of last year. Mobil's net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 795m, down from Dollars 1.52bn in the same period of 1991. On Wall Street, Exxon's share price was unchanged at Dollars 62 while Mobil's price was up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 63.</p>

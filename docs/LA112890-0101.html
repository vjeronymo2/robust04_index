			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> TAKASUGI, LOPEZ AND PLISKY ARE SWORN IN  </P> <P> Amid flattering speeches and hearty handshakes, the winners of the Nov. 6  election -- Nao Takasugi, Manuel Lopez and Michael Plisky -- were sworn in as  Oxnard city councilmen in a brief ceremony Tuesday.  </P> <P> All three acknowledged that because of tight finances, the city faces a  difficult future.  </P> <P> But they vowed to work together to solve the city's problems.  </P> <P> Takasugi, who won a fifth two-year term as mayor by receiving 45% of the vote,  thanked his wife, Judy, for her support in the campaign.  </P> <P> Lopez won his fourth four-year term on the council by receiving about 17% of  the vote. He said some family members were initially opposed to him running  again. But he said after he made the decision, the entire family gave him full  support.  </P> <P> Plisky, a former council member who won 22% of the vote, said he has not always  agreed with other council members but promised to try to work in harmony within  the council for the next four years.  </P> <P> During a light moment in the ceremony, Takasugi poked fun at Plisky when City  Clerk Mabi Plisky, the new councilman's wife, told him where to stand so that  he could take his oath of office.  </P> <P> "Just like home; Mike takes orders from Mabi," Takasugi said, amid laughter  from the audience.  </P> <P> Before starting the regular meeting, each council member praised Ann Johs, who  lost her reelection bid after five years on the council.  </P> <P> Johs said she will stay active in community service organizations. "I'm not  dead and buried," she said. "I have a lot more to do." HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

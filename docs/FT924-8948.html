			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Austrian petrochemicals group back in the black OMV, the state controlled Austrian energy and petrochemical group, returned to profit in the third quarter and is now expecting to reach break-even in the full year. The group, which has suffered from boardroom strife and a slump in its refining and petrochemical operations this year, said it made a pre-tax profit of Sch201m (Dollars 189m) in the third quarter after a loss of Sch584m in the first half. For the nine months, pre-tax losses were Sch383m compared with a profit of Sch1.19bn in the same period of last year. Turnover was down 2.4 per cent to Sch60.7bn. The energy division was responsible for the profit turnround, with both the refining and marketing businesses returning to profit in the third quarter, mainly as a result of cost cutting. The division as a whole made a profit of Sch919m in the nine-month period, down 43 per cent. The chemical division lost Sch46m in the third quarter as fertiliser and melamine sales slumped, but a turnround is expected next year. The plastics division lost Sch367m in the third quarter, as prices for polyolefins fell. The group said at the interim stage that it was still expecting 'a positive result' for the year, but this has been revised downward to break-even. Verbund, the Austrian electricity utility, expects net profits to jump 24 per cent this year to Sch750m, Mr Walter Fremuth, chief executive, said in Frankfurt.</p>

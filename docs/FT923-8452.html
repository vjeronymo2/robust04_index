			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Call for 'Iraqgate' prosecutor rejected: White House risks another clash with Congress THE Bush administration risked another election year confrontation with Congress yesterday when the attorney-general rejected the House judiciary committee's request that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the 'Iraqgate' affair. Mr William Barr said the committee's letter of July 9 requesting he appoint a prosecutor 'contains vague and general allegations and lists a number of statutes that may have been violated'. This lack of specifics, he said in a written reply to Congressman Jack Brooks, panel chairman, did not mean the case was closed but that the conditions laid down in the act, passed after the Watergate scandal and empowering the appointment of a special prosecutor, had not been met. This is the 10th occasion that Congress has made such a request and the first rejection by an attorney-general. The authority of the act, of which Mr Barr and President George Bush have been conspicuous critics, expires in December unless renewed by Congress. Iraqgate covers the actions allegedly taken by the administration consequent on the US 'tilt' towards Baghdad, starting in the mid-1980s at the height of the Iran-Iraq war and continuing until shortly before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. They include fraudulent loans to Iraq channelled through the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the misuse of loan guarantees offered by the Department of Agriculture, and the alteration of Commerce Department export certificates to conceal the supply of arms and other technology relevant to Iraq's military development. Throughout the congressional investigations, involving half a dozen separate committees, there have been complaints that the administration has persistently withheld evidence. Mr Barr's refusal to appoint a prosecutor will doubtless cause these to grow, although it also leaves the door open to Mr Brooks and Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, to make a second approach, naming those suspected of having broken the law. The administration has countered that Congress's motives are purely political and designed to embarrass the president's re-election campaign. Similar criticism has been directed from the White House at the activities of the independent prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair.</p>

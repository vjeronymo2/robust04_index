			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher chief quits after 'pressure' MR TONY MILLAR, who built Albert Fisher into an international fresh fruit and vegetable company worth over Pounds 780m at its peak, yesterday resigned as executive chairman following pressure from non-executive directors. His departure, just more than 10 years after his acquisition of a small Blackburn-based fruit and vegetable supplier, ends an era at one of the acquisition-driven growth stocks of the 1980s. Over the past year, the City has increasingly questioned Mr Millar's ability to manage growth at a time of tough market conditions even before a profits warning earlier this month. Mr Stephen Walls, currently a non-executive director, will become non-executive chairman while the board reviews the group's strategic direction. Mr Walls said that the management changes had been decided by the board, including Mr Millar, after the non-executive directors had acted as 'catalysts' for the discussions. The board had invited Mr Millar to become Honorary President as a tribute to his 'vision and performance in creating the group'. Albert Fisher's share price has fallen from a peak of 133p in March last year to a low of 36 1/2 p earlier this week before recovering to 39p, where it closed yesterday. The profits warning was issued after June sales demonstrated that the price of fresh produce in Europe and North America had collapsed due to a glut in the market. By that time analysts had already grown wary that the rapid 1980s growth that was fuelled by a string of small acquisitions of family businesses, was not sustainable in markets hit by recession. Mr Walls yesterday repeated a reassurance that trading, though hit by low fresh produce prices, remained in line with expectations and the balance sheet placed the group in a strong position to take advantage of future growth opportunities.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- The Monday edition of every  Hungarian national daily gave extensive coverage to the first  round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, May 8. Much of the  coverage extended to praising the high voter-turnout and the  calm atmosphere that marked the voting, and to quotations of  preliminary election count results, which placed the Hungarian  Socialist Party in first place and the Alliance of Free  Democrats in second place.    In its commentary headlined "Calmly", NEPSZABADSAG says,  "The  task today is to look to the future calmly, irrespective of  whether one considers what happened to be a sweeping victory, or  a defeat. ...The main lesson for those in power, who will most  probably be forced to leave after the run-off elections in three  weeks, will be that no political force can dismiss dialogue with  society. Those at the helm up to now liked to believe they know  exactly what the people, and the nation, needs and desires,  while humiliating those ruled by them every day."    "What people in Hungary want most is dignity; they wish for  their ability and performance to be recognized and for their  leaders to give a free rein to their creative power. This is  where they were disappointed most over the past four years, and  this is probably why they voted the way they did."    NEPSZABADSAG formulates the following lessons for political  forces emerging on top after the elections: "They must reach  understanding with the people and with the opposition, while  proving themselves prepared and competent to hold the reins of  power. They must be aware that their coming to power should  mean respect for popular sovereignty."    UJ MAGYARORSZAG says, "Four years ago the majority agreed on  what they did not want. Now, it seems that while one half of  society does not know what they want, the left wing is fairly  capitalizing on electors' forgetfulness, nostalgia, desire for  revenge, and discontent. Such is democracy, they say. ...It  already seems certain that the Socialists have increased chances  of forming a government. This -- in view of their promises and  past -- holds not much good for the future. Behind the  flickering computer screens, a vision is emerging of people  queuing in long lines outside banks to take out the currency  they saved at the time of the outvoted coalition. This will  also be a vote, costing far more than yesterday's."</p>

Foreign Affairs Minister  Andre Ouellet made the pledge during a meeting with Mr.  Aristide, who is on a six-day visit to Canada.    Current sanctions imposed by the United Nations prevent oil  and weapons from reaching the Caribbean island, but Ottawa wants  the ban made complete in order to prevent Haiti from receiving  anything except aid from nongovernmental organizations.    Mr. Ouellet said Canada and the other three so-called  friends  of Haiti -- the United States, Venezuela, and France -- will  soon put a motion before the UN Security Council, calling for  the tougher sanctions. All four nations promised to push for a  total embargo against Haiti if the military refused to  relinquish power by 15 January. Mr. Aristide won Haiti's first  democratic elections over two years ago, but was later deposed  in a bloody coup.</p>

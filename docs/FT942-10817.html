			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Biotechnology (4): Seeking a backer - Raising capital is never easy If one phrase describes the nature of the biotechnology business it is 'credibility equals capital'. A decade or so without income from sales means that the boss's job consists of endless rounds of capital raising. The chief executive has no suitcase of samples and the main sales tool is the scientists' creativity and hard work. Capital is needed more than just to pay the bills. A company with Dollars 100m in the bank has a strong hand when negotiating with potential partners from the mainstream pharmaceuticals industry. 'Capital is a strategic asset, not just something you intend to spend,' says Joshua Boger, president of Massachusetts company Vertex. Yet it is hard to imagine a more ignorant group of investors than typical fund managers. Nobel prize-winning science must be sold to people who are accustomed to evaluating the plans of shopkeepers and food manufacturers. And the sales pitch is getting tougher. New biotechnology companies are launched every week. Yet, US biotechnology companies managed to raise only Dollars 2.8bn in 1993, down from Dollars 3.4bn in 1991 and only a slight improvement on the Dollars 2.5bn raised in 1992, according to research from biotechnology consultancy Feinstein and Partners. The increasing difficulty in translating credibility into capital is seen in the average amount raised on flotation: Dollars 22m in 1993, compared with Dollars 26m in 1992 and Dollars 33m in 1991. One biotechnology company chief speaks of 1991's 'waterfall of money. You just held out your cup and it was full'. Today, the tables have turned. 'There's more great science than access to capital,' says Harvey Berger, chairman of Ariad Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Steve Burrill of San Francisco merchant bank Burrill and Craves says that the US biotechnology industry alone will demand Dollars 5bn in 1994 in further investment. It is unlikely to get it. Wall Street might not understand science, but it does understand that the industry rarely provides a return on its investment. One of the main reasons that Wall Street has been prepared to fund the mysterious biotechnology industry is that it has thought it might be investing in a product so innovative it might be a monopoly. But healthcare reforms around the world threaten to prevent the charging of monopoly prices. 'Healthcare reforms scare off Wall Street,' says Alison Taunton-Rigby, chief executive of start up Boston biotechnology company Mitotix. 'Especially the thought of price caps on drugs.' So the merchant bankers' minds have turned to ever more innovative financial instruments, many designed to appeal to those who would not normally invest in the sector. Last month saw a successful cash call from British Biotechnology using effectively a deferred rights issue. Half the money is to be put up now, the other half in two years time when investors have had a chance to see the results of work in progress. In the US there have been even more creative ideas put into action, including off-balance sheet financing and spin-offs of subsidiaries. One of the most widely employed is the Pipe - a private investment in public equity - in which a block of shares is placed privately at a discount to the market price. Pipes accounted for more than Dollars 500m in 1993's biotechnology fund raising, according to Feinstein and Partners. Nevertheless Pipes arouse controversy in the industry. For Mr Burrill, the private placing avoids the problem of the share price being depressed by market knowledge that a large block of shares is on offer. 'You might offer the shares privately at a 15 per cent discount to the market price, but if you offered them openly, the stock might fall 30 per cent.' But one embittered biotechnology chief executive says: 'It's not very creative to sell stock at a discount. Sell it at a premium, that's creative.' So the search continues for financial innovation suited to the industry. Aberlyn Capital Management, a US subsidiary of Dutch merchant bank Mees Pierson, part of the Netherlands' largest bank, ABN-Amro, lends money to biotechnology companies using their equipment and patents as collateral. 'We are not taken aback by the dismal shape of the balance sheet,' says Aberlyn president David Sakura. 'Leasing on a patent as collateral can be done because patents are carried on the books at the cost of filing. In many cases, the technology remains sound even if the company gets into trouble. Investors lose sight of this.' Another fund raising idea comes from Drug Royalty Corporation, a quoted Canadian company, which invests cash in return for a slice of the royalty stream of a product. Alan Grieve, president, explains that their policy of not taking equity is attractive to biotechnology executives who have seen their stakes diluted as wave after wave of conventional investors becomes involved. Such ideas have yet to make inroads into biotechnology companies. If Wall Street or the City of London are unable to provide the funds they need, they are likely to turn to the cash-rich pharmaceuticals companies for finance. Drugs companies can provide research and development help as well as cash. But they often demand in return marketing and manufacturing rights and a slice of equity. For Ms Taunton-Rigby, drugs companies provide a less than satisfactory alternative to capital markets. 'We've gone to pharmaceuticals companies, but given a choice we would not, as you give up too much.' Nevertheless, now is a time of investor caution. Even a powerful story of scientific and management expertise meets with scepticism from investors. Good science will always find backers, runs an adage in the sector. Privately, however, company executives concede that there are huge doses of salesmanship and luck to be added to a successful recipe. Credibility will continue to be the goal of the biotechnology company manager, and it will be achieved any way possible.</p>

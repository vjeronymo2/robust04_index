			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANAGING THE MOJAVE: A STRUGGLE FOR THE BLM  </P> <P> Afton Canyon, a four-mile ribbon of green wetlands wedged between majestically  weathered rock walls in the middle of California's Mojave Desert, has attracted  many people for many reasons over the last century.  </P> <P> It has a reputation as a cattle trail, campground, firearms range, off-road  motorcycle course and bird-watcher's paradise. Wildlife, such as bighorn sheep,  also come to the canyon for its life-giving, year-round Mojave River flow.  </P> <P> But in trying to accommodate each of those often conflicting reputations at the  same time, Afton Canyon has earned a new reputation as a clear example of the  problems preventing the Bureau of Land Management from properly managing the  Mojave.  </P> <P> Conservationists and others say the California desert is too big for the BLM to  manage well with the number of employees it can afford. At the same time --  though the desert itself covers a quarter of the state -- its most popular  areas are not big enough to accommodate all the people who want to use them.  </P> <P> Conflicts are common: motorcyclists wrestling with backpackers, gold miners  pitted against environmentalists and cattlemen battling conservationists. Even  the U.S. Army has joined the war over the desert; it wants to expand its  tank-training grounds at Ft. Irwin.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Bureau of Land Management is expected to mediate compromises  among these users while also planning a balanced and sustainable future for 12  million acres of desert -- not unlike the way city planners zone suburbs.  </P> <P> An increasingly common opinion is that the BLM has, in many ways, failed.  </P> <P> Indeed, concern over the potential for the permanent loss of some resources --  especially wildlife habitat and wilderness -- has spurred a campaign by Sen.  Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and the Wilderness Society to take the state's desert  from the BLM and turn it over to the National Park Service for preservation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Push for Park Status  </P> <P> They contend that strict preservation as a national park is the only way to  assure the long-term survival of a deceptively delicate and vital land rich in  anthropological resources, wildlife and plants, including the planet's oldest  living thing, an 11,700-year-old creosote bush.  </P> <P> And, scientists say, so little is known about the desert that entirely new life  forms may be waiting to be found there. For example, Robert Stebbins, professor  emeritus of zoology at UC Berkeley, has turned up a large-eyed toad in Afton  Canyon that may establish a new amphibian species.  </P> <P> But the debate over how to protect the desert has, in turn, sparked its own  debate. Some conservationists challenge the assumption, implicit in Cranston's  bill, that the BLM is incapable of preserving environmentally sensitive areas.  Instead, they contend that the bureau has simply been prevented from doing its  job by political manipulation and under-funding.  </P> <P> For these BLM watchers, the battle over the future of the California desert --  and a similar debate that is developing over Utah's rugged canyon and desert  wilderness -- also are battles over the future of the Bureau of Land Management  itself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Morale Factor  </P> <P> "Whenever an attractive piece of property is discovered in BLM hands, some  group or another asks to take it away," said former BLM Director Frank Gregg,  now working at the University of Arizona. "What that does is demoralize those  in the agency who have spent their careers -- with considerable success in many  cases -- trying to move the bureau away from being only a commodity-development  agency and toward (becoming) a real resource-management agency."  </P> <P> Paul J. Culhane, environmental adviser to former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt  before joining the faculty at Northern Illinois University, said stripping the  desert from the BLM could prove problematical for conservationists in the long  run because it would cement the bureau's reputation as an exploitation agency  -- as when it is chided as the "Bureau of Livestock and Mining."  </P> <P> "There are good things to be said for letting BLM keep wilderness areas," like  those proposed for transfer to the Park Service, he said. "It reinforces to the  agency the fact that there are recreationists and others out there, and they  serve them too.  </P> <P> "If you isolate BLM to deal only with consumptive users," he added, "you narrow  its view and its approach to other users."  </P> <P> Ed Hastey, director of BLM operations in California, agreed.  </P> <P> "If people continue to carve out these little bits for parks and things," he  said, "it is going to make it much harder for us to manage the rest of it --  areas of less publicity."  </P> <P> Conservationists favoring the desert bill remain suspicious of the BLM for many  reasons, such as its reluctance to routinely require miners or mining companies  to post reclamation bonds -- money put in trust to assure that tailings and  other toxic wastes will not simply be abandoned once a mine is exhausted. BLM's  semi-independent Nevada state office has balked at requiring such bonds, even  though the conservative Nevada Mining Assn. itself came out in favor of the  idea.  </P> <P> California activists, meanwhile, remember a unilateral revision of the 1980  Desert Conservation Plan by an assistant secretary of the Interior after final  public hearings were held. BLM workers said the handwritten addendum, allowing  cattle grazing in a bighorn sheep preserve, was meant to benefit a subsistence  rancher with 14 children. Critics said the change accommodates "any" grazing --  and, in any case, exposes the sheep to potentially deadly bovine diseases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Internal Dissent  </P> <P> The dissent extends to the BLM staff. As early as 1976, 18 BLM employees wrote  an internal memorandum, eventually leaked to the press, that criticized the  California BLM office for routinely ignoring scientific advice and federal laws  while catering to motorcyclists and other special-interest groups.  </P> <P> Others within the BLM are less critical of the bureau's record, but there still  is considerable internal debate over how best to administer the Mojave Desert,  one of the most sensitive and sought-after pieces of public land controlled by  the agency.  </P> <P> Last February, such internal criticism erupted publicly when Hastey, acting  against the advice of his own staff expert, asked the California Department of  Fish and Game to wait up to four years before listing the desert tortoise as a  state threatened species.  </P> <P> He said BLM needed the time to develop its own tortoise-protection program, but  he later privately told a reporter that he also feared a negative reaction from  ranchers and off-road vehicle users, whose activities would be curtailed if the  tortoise were given threatened-species protection.  </P> <P> "How can we Americans poke our fingers at South American countries for not  preserving the Amazon rain forest when we're letting the western Mojave Desert  deteriorate?" said Kristin Berry, a BLM zoologist in the western Mojave. "We're  giving it all away to a few Marlboro men on motorbikes."  </P> <P> Hastey discounted that charge. He said the BLM -- pressured by the Cranston  bill and a growing public awareness of what the desert has to offer -- is  redoubling its efforts to find that elusive balance of demands Congress  mandated when it approved the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act, or  FLPMA.  </P> <P> "We have -- I think, quite well -- balanced those socioeconomic needs with the  need to preserve some of these (natural resources)," Hastey said, citing the  bureau's efforts to preserve the habitat of such endangered species as the kit  fox and fringe-toed lizard.  </P> <P> Hastey also cited management of the King Range in Northern California, the  first Wilderness Conservation Area, as an example of BLM's ability to balance  conflicting interests in an innovative fashion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Land Swaps Praised  </P> <P> Meanwhile, conservationists praise the BLM for using land swaps to preserve  valuable wildlife habitat along Arizona's San Pedro River in the nation's first  Riparian Conservation Area.  </P> <P> But, as in the past, BLM employees find their job made difficult by a lack of  adequate funding and the confrontation politics that result when interests  collide. Confrontations are especially acute in arid lands, since most users,  whether they prefer wildlife or strip mines, want land with water or access.  </P> <P> Afton Canyon is blessed -- or cursed -- with both.  </P> <P> Its early popularity as a cattle trail and wildlife habitat was compounded in  the 1960s, when the BLM built a campground linking Afton Canyon with Interstate  40 east of Barstow.  </P> <P> But the bureau lacked both the money and mandate to staff the campground as the  National Park Service or U.S. Forest Service might have done. Intense, often  unregulated vehicle traffic, shooting and cattle grazing resulted, scarring the  land and destroying native vegetation. Bighorn sheep eventually moved off into  the open desert and grew dependent on cattle-watering troughs called  "guzzlers."  </P> <P> In 1980, the BLM named the canyon an "area of critical environmental concern"  -- a designation meant to qualify it for special protective management. But  Reagan Administration budgets never contained money to manage the canyon, so  the environmental degradation continued.  </P> <P> Pressured by the campaign to turn the desert into a national park, the BLM last  year proposed a plan to stop the destruction of Afton Canyon by limiting human  activity in the area.  </P> <P> Among other things, the BLM plan would prohibit motorcycles and all-terrain  vehicles from driving along the delicate stream bed and up the severely scarred  hillsides, and would assure allocation of enough rangers to enforce the law.  </P> <P> Environmentalists were ecstatic over the BLM proposal. Judy Anderson of the  California Desert Protection League called the proposal "the only gutsy thing  the BLM has done in years."  </P> <P> Off-road vehicle owners were outraged. Richard MacPherson of the California  Assn. of 4-Wheel Drive Clubs asserted that "there is nothing drastically wrong  out there" and characterized the BLM plan as "management through closure."  </P> <P> The polarization -- a result of the BLM's exploitative history clashing with  its new conservation mandate -- has left the bureau in an increasingly familiar  bind: MacPherson has threatened to sue if the BLM implements the plan, and the  Sierra Club has threatened to sue if BLM tries to modify it.  </P> <P> MacPherson said, "There is very little documentation to prove the vehicles  passing through bother wildlife." But Stebbins, the zoologist, said tire tracks  crisscross the pool of water containing tadpoles bred by the new and possibly  endangered species of toad he and others are studying.  </P> <P> Others note that the desert, being a dry environment, is slow to heal. Even  though BLM managers say off-road vehicle users clearly are more environmentally  sensitive now than in the past, tracks cut in the desert decades ago are still  plainly visible.  </P> <P> Conservationists say such tracks, some of which were cut by tanks preparing to  fight in World War II nearly 50 years ago, are more than ugly; they also  encourage soil erosion and damage vegetation. To limit the impact of the  vehicles, they are now limited to designated "off-highway vehicle areas."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Race Through Desert  </P> <P> "I may not like motorcycles, but it is not my place to tell them they have no  place in the desert," said Alden Sievers, manager of the BLM's Barstow resource  area. That area contains the starting line for the big Barstow-to-Las Vegas  cross-country motorcycle race, which environmental extremists have tried to  sabotage to protect wildlife habitat on the race course.  </P> <P> "Congress, in fact, has said we shall find areas for that activity," said  Gerald Hillier, manager of the BLM's desert district. "But I do think that  instead of the desert being nibbled to death, as some tell you, we're nibbling  toward bringing some law to the desert."  </P> <P> Sometimes, the law must be harsh to accommodate past BLM mistakes.  </P> <P> Desert tortoises, for example, are in dramatic decline for several reasons,  including loss of habitat to off-road vehicles and other human activities that  the BLM has been unable to control. Now, their dwindling Mojave community also  is being decimated by ravenous ravens.  </P> <P> BLM's answer is to shoot and poison the ravens. Environmentalists ask why the  BLM did not years ago control the urban encroachment on the desert that gives  the birds a food source -- garbage -- to fuel their population explosion.  </P> <P> This alleged lack of foresight is particularly ironic to some BLM employees who  say the agency has a tendency to abuse the planning process to avoid making  tough management decisions.  </P> <P> "Talk is cheap and the bureau is full of talk and plans," said one BLM  biologist. "We plan to plan. When are we going to implement?"  </P> <P> Some plans will be implemented soon, according to a congressional timetable for  setting aside wilderness tracts from among BLM lands. But even here, there are  questions about the bureau's sincerity.  </P> <P> For example, a draft of the BLM's California Statewide Wilderness Study, which  has been circulated within the bureau and other government agencies but not yet  released publicly, has been challenged by some outside experts who have seen  the report for grossly overestimating the amounts of minerals in the Mojave --  even after figuring in likely future price increases.  </P> <P> A final version of the wilderness report is to guide Congress as it decides  which proposed wilderness studies areas should be preserved and which could be  "released" for other uses, such as mining, grazing and off-road racing.  </P> <P> A geologist who studied the draft report but claims no feeling either way about  the value of wilderness said the overestimates make the draft "more of a  political document for anti-wilderness than anything else." This, he said, is  because the draft seems to assume every mineral trace is valuable, even if it  is so small or diffuse it is unlikely ever to be economic to mine.  </P> <P> Hastey said the draft plan tries to anticipate the nation's mineral needs.  </P> <P> "We do not know what the market for these minerals might be five, 10 or 20  years down the road," he explained. "We do know we are dealing with a highly  mineralized area, and what is not economic today may be valuable 15 years from  now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Struggle for Balance  </P> <P> Hillier said those kinds of decisions are all part of the bureau's struggle to  balance inherently conflicting uses, as Congress has instructed.  </P> <P> "Some people complain there is not enough for wildlife," he said, bucking  uncomfortably across the desert in a BLM four-wheel-drive vehicle, "but  Congress did not create the desert wildlife park.  </P> <P> "Off-highway vehicle owners complain we do not allow them enough room. But  Congress did not create an off-highway vehicle park, either.  </P> <P> "What Congress did was create the California Desert Conservation Area, and  'conservation,' in its old definition, means 'wise use,' not preservation."  </P></p>

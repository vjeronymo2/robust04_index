			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Poverty - a limited truth, but alarm bells should be ringing Sir, There is only limited truth in the assertion by Mary Campbell (Personal View, August 2) that the government's Households Below Average Income statistics give an incomplete picture of poverty in the UK. She is right that to talk of vast increases in people in poverty is unhelpful if the benchmark has itself risen dramatically, as is the case with average income. However, she overlooks the fact that more people are now living on income lower than half the 1979 average. Thus, in 1979, 9 per cent of the population (5m people) were living on income less than half the average. If this 1979 income figure is uprated by inflation, we find that 11 per cent of the population (6m people) have income below this level. There is a particular impact on children, with rises from 10 to 15 per cent and from 1.4m to 1.9m children. These figures are after housing costs. Such a measure gives an indication of the amount of income a family has to live on after the key component of housing has been accounted for. Before housing costs, income has risen for many families not because they are better accommodated, but because the government has forced up both council and housing association rents through its housing finance policy, leading to increased income in housing benefit. Mary Campbell calls for statistics which reflect people's needs. She seems to be unaware that the low income families statistics, which related income to what a family would get on benefit, were discontinued by the government. However, a report for the social security committee showed 11.35m people living on or below income support rates of income in 1989. Alternatively, the figures for means-tested benefits should sound alarm bells. In 1979, 7.9 per cent of families with dependent children claimed one or other of the two key income support benefits, but by 1992 this had risen to 31.2 per cent. The debate on what to do about poverty is not helped by suggesting the problem is not really a very serious one.

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: REVIVED MOVIE CAREER GETS TRAVOLTA DANCING  </P> <P> JOHN TRAVOLTA delighted the Rainbow Room patrons on New Year's Eve when he took  to the dance floor. He made people feel just like it was -- well, New Year's  Eve!  </P> <P> Although the glamorous room atop New York's Rockefeller Center doesn't really  encourage disco dancing, Travolta moved around the floor much as he did years  ago in "Saturday Night Fever." He is a big star again, thanks to "Look Who's  Talking," which has taken in $150 million so far at the box office.  </P> <P> Travolta couldn't get himself arrested about a year ago, but now he is juggling  six movie offers. No wonder he's dancing!  </P> <P> NEXT TUESDAY at 10 a.m. the National Museum of American History in the  Smithsonian will officially install the Barbara Bush inaugural gown designed by  Arnold Scaasi. And the sapphire "Barbara Bush Blue" velvet-draped top with its  skirt of sapphire blue satin becomes a part of permanent official history.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush will give a private luncheon after in the White House for designer  Scaasi, as well as for the queen of all purse makers, Judith Leiber, and  Kenneth Jay Lane, the man who designs the Barbara Bush pearls.  </P> <P> Scaasi, whose new perfume is said to be the rage of Los Angeles, will stay  overnight in the private Bush quarters at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  </P> <P> This has caused his pals, who call Arnold "He Who Must Be Obeyed," to quip that  it will be the first time a Napoleon has ever slept in the Lincoln bedroom.  </P> <P> JOSEPH HELLER, the maestro of "Catch-22" and many another walloping American  yarn, has been offered a Christianson Fellowship at Oxford next winter and has  decided to accept. He will give at least one lecture on American literature and  then spend the rest of his time "socializing and learning," as he puts it. "I  am really looking forward to this." Heller was in Oxford back in 1949 on a  Fulbright Scholarship.  </P> <P> The author is busy on a new novel, which takes place when his "Catch-22"  protagonist, the former Air Corps Capt. Yossarian of World War II, will be a  fictional 68 years old.  </P> <P> It projects a time when President Bush will have resigned in favor of Dan  Quayle. There is no title yet for this work, but both Esquire and Smart are  said to be preparing excerpts.  </P> <P> DAWN STEEL, the head of Columbia Pictures pre-Guber &amp; Peters &amp; Sony, is  in a wheelchair from a broken leg suffered while skiing in Colorado over  Christmas. They do say Dawn will soon be wheeling herself right out the front  -- not the back -- door of Columbia, and it will happen as soon as negotiations  for her departure are completed.  </P> <P> I told you she didn't resign; she'll go quietly when the time and the price are  right. They do say this lady has tales to tell -- which she probably won't --  about the machinations of Columbia's takeover by Sony of Japan.  </P></p>

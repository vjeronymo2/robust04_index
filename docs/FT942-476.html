			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Copier leasing industry warned Photocopier leasing companies criticised in March by the Office of Fair Trading for unscrupulous selling practices have been given three months to clean up the industry or risk losing their consumer credit licences, Robert Rice writes. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, yesterday said the industry had until the end of September to meet higher standards of transparency in leasing contracts. He told the Institute of Trading Standards Administration conference in Brighton that he believed in freedom of contract within wide limits. But onerous contract terms such as long-term leases for machines with short lives, or lease and service-inclusive cost-per-copy contracts, with an obligation to pay for a minimum volume of usage, should be drawn to customers' attention. Sir Bryan said: 'Engaging in misrepresentation or deceitful selling practices, or failing to observe high standards of transparency about all the main terms and conditions of a contract, are likely to be inconsistent with fitness to hold a consumer credit licence.' He has said that he will carry out a further review of the industry at the beginning of next year.</p>

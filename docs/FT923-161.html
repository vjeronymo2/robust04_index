			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Washington seeks shift in IADB role: Risk to democracy in Latin America and Caribbean sparks loan proposals THE Bush administration has proposed a radical shift in the role of the InterAmerican Development Bank, suggesting it lend without protection of government guarantees and urging a big expansion in lending to attack poverty and poor social conditions. The proposals, according to US officials, are meant to address concerns in Washington about the risks to democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean should the benefits of the emerging economic recovery in the region not be distributed among the population. The US, the largest shareholder in the bank, also indicated its willingness to explore a 'healthy increase' in the bank's capital resources to sustain its lending 'indefinitely'. The officials said this would mean that capital increases after the next would not be automatic, as in the past, but would depend on need, a similar arrangement to that of the World Bank. The previous capital increase of Dollars 26.5bn (Pounds 15.4bn), agreed in 1989, was meant to support the bank until the end of 1993. This has allowed the IADB, under its president Enrique Iglesias, to raise its lending to about Dollars 7bn a year. The proposals also suggest diverting more of the bank's resources to the region's poorer economies. The bigger economies, which now dominate the bank's lending policies, will be expected to rely increasingly on private-sector capital inflows. Reflecting concern that the bank's policy of lending only with a government guarantee could discourage privatisation, the US has called for the IADB to explore the possibility of lending, for a transitional period, to just-privatised companies. The proposals were contained in a little-noticed speech this month by Mr Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Mr Wethington said in an interview that it should be possible to complete negotiations on a capital increase next summer, in time to include it in the fiscal 1995 budget. He said the proposals had broad support in Washington. Mr Wethington, who would not be drawn on what he considered an appropriate capital increase, said there had been strong support from Latin America. US officials said Brazil, Argentina and Chile had all indicated they backed the proposals. The US suggestions also include the merging of the IADB's private-sector arm, the InterAmerican Investment Corporation, into the bank proper and that the Multilateral Investment Fund, set up last year to encourage investment reform, should also be integrated into the bank. Future capital increases for the IIC should be provided by the bank. Some European governments whose shareholdings in the IIC are larger than those in the IADB are concerned that this would dilute their influence. The US has also called for a strong reorientation of the bank's priorities towards ensuring that 'economic opportunity and government services are broadly distributed'. This would include a broad attack on poverty. Fifty per cent of the bank's lending should therefore support 'economic opportunity, social sector development and governance objectives in all borrowing member countries'. The US also proposes that: Thirty per cent of the bank's lending should support traditional infrastructure, which in many countries is a big constraint on economic development. So-called policy-based lending - balance of payment finance to support specific policy reforms - should be reduced to 15 per cent of total lending. Many larger borrowing countries that have already opened their economies are expected to have less need for such finance. There is now a 25 per cent limit on such lending. The bank's concessional loans arm, the Fund for Special Operations, should be restructured to offer interest support on bank loans, rather than act as a direct lender as at present.</p>

Father Felini MacAlister, Robert Elco, a doctor, his wife  Karena and their daughter Zita were caught by automatic gunfire  Saturday during an attack by United Revolutionary Front (RUF)  rebels near the hospital at Panguma, 240 kilometres (145 miles)  east of here, it said. They had been trying to escape the  attack in three vehicles along with five other colleagues. One  of the others, New Zealand doctor Ann Greeling, was captured by  RUF forces but was freed unharmed by government forces,  according to the statement.    The two others, Irish nun Madeline Naughton and her Nigerian  colleague Jestina Igwu, escaped unscathed as did Americans Mary  Tippet and Arthur Gordon.    Last August, two nurses from the International Committee of  the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed and a third wounded in the  Pujehun region, 210 kilometres (125 miles) southeast of Freetown  during an attack attributed to the RUF.    The rebellion, which started in May 1991, has increased in  intensity since December in the east near the Liberian border  and in the south along the Atlantic coast.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stefano Zurlo: "Rocco And His Baggage"] </F>   [Text] Who is this Buttiglione who aspires to be  leader of the Christian Democrats [DC]? He has dinner with the  pope; takes notes in German; writes books in Polish; and likes  Father Giussani and Julia Roberts. The following is an  unauthorized biography of the philosopher who wants to lead the  DC.    With his natural immodesty, he has defined himself as "the  number one assistant of Professor Wojtyla." In other words, the  most authentic exponent and interpreter of the philosophical  ideas of John Paul II.    All the other labels are too narrow for Rocco Buttiglione.  It  is probably true, however, that he is a philosopher, a political  scientist, the former ideologist of the Communion and Liberation  [CL] movement, the favorite disciple of Augusto Del Noce, and  the intellectual who is adapted to politics, and perhaps many  other things, too--but all this is as nothing compared to the  friendship and esteem of the pope, who in fact appears to have  accorded high praise to Buttiglione's book Il pensiero  filosofico di Karol Wojtyla [The Philosophical Ideas of Karol  Wojtyla]. The pope has accordingly transfigured Buttiglione  into a kind of intellectual super partes who stands  aloof from the worldly matters in which, however, he is actually  immersed 18 hours a day.    It is a continuing contradiction for Buttiglione who moves  with the ease and frustrated ingenuousness of a man of culture  in the environment of dramatic practicality that characterizes  DC headquarters on the Piazza del Gesu [headquarters of the  Christian Democratic Party] in Rome where Buttiglione has been  installed as chairman of the Ethics Committee for the reform of  the party. Now, however, he is a candidate for party secretary  of the post-Martinazzoli period. But that is the way it is: in  Italy, today, it is the turn of the professors. They have the  task of rebuilding everything that the others have devastated as  barbarians. It is the day of the Ciampis, of the Cacciaris, of  the Demattes. These are all people who prefer the bicycle to the  off-road vehicle. They are intellectuals who do not pale at the  name of a poet or philosopher. Who is not daunted by the  Germanophile encyclopedism of Franco Tato, the new managing  director of Fininvest?, or when reading the mile-long resume of  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi? Whether these gentlemen now know how to be  administrators is another question.    Buttiglione fits perfectly into this pantheon. Although born  in Gallipoli, Apulia, he represents the most severe challenge to  the old southern DC. Remember Ciriaco De Mita and the court of  miracles of Nusco, that irresolute Italian who seemed  perpetually to be down with a cold? And who has forgotten the  histrionic speech mannerisms of Paolo Cirino Pomicino, or the  variegated crowd of lovers and bagmen that surrounded him, or  Claila, the boat of the provincial Onassis that was berthed in  the Naples sun? Buttiglione is light years distant from that  stereotype.    A few details will help us to understand. In addition to  English and French, the professor speaks German and Polish. He  is the author of an impressive number of books, articles, and  essays. Then there is the oleography [as published]: he takes  notes in German (which for him is like a mother tongue). He also  gives orders in German to Teo, his huge German shepherd (the  name is engraved on the dog's collar), which he personally takes  out for walks and treats him as his toy.  <H5>  The Meeting With Wojtyla </H5>   The thickest part of his biography, however, is the one that  involves the Polish language. Buttiglione learned Polish by  reading the pope's books in the original version and by  fraternizing with the Catholic intellectuals of Krakow.    A priest from Romagna who was associated with the Communion  and Liberation movement, Don Francesco Ricci, introduced him  during the 1970's into the ecclesiastic circles of Krakow. Don  Ricci was director of the Center for Eastern European Studies  and was in close contact with Polish anti-Communist circles.  During that period, Buttiglione collaborated with a publishing  house that was close to CL--Jaca Book--which had a series  dedicated precisely to the countries of real socialism. Don  Ricci one day brought the brilliant intellectual to Krakow and  introduced him to the then-Bishop Karol Wojtyla. When Wojtyla  became pope, he brought Don Stanislao Dsziwisz to Rome as his  private secretary, and Don Stanislao summoned Buttiglione to the  Vatican on instructions from John Paul II. This began a  relationship that has never been interrupted. Rocco's interest  in the Church, moreover, is shared by his family: his two  sisters--Angela and Marina--are both Vaticanists, working  respectively for TG-1 [TV Channel 1 news] and TG-5. There is  even an antipope in the family: the mother-in-law, Caterina  Jacobelli, a theologian of the dissidence. But Rocco is  something more than that--indeed, much more than that--on the  other side of the Tiber. Recently, too, when the the encyclicals  Veritatis splendor and Centesimus annus  were being written, Buttiglione was at the pope's side. In  particular, the 45-year-old philosopher from Gallipoli wrote the  most important chapter of Centesimus annus--the  chapter that deals with the changes in East Europe, the end of  real socialism, and the advent of a new era.    Very well, but what is the nature of this new era? Here is  where Buttiglione emerges from limbo and the chorus of angels  and plays his ace--the Church's social doctrine--which is a  manual for the kind of civil coexistence that has been dear to  the pope's heart ever since the 1980's and that has been  forgotten by Catholics who have devoted themselves to politics,  notably the Christian Democrats. Indeed, the social doctrine was  disregarded to such an extent that the content was lost. Many  Catholics pay the doctrine lip service, and some quote it  (usually inopportunely) in speeches at the party congresses,  explaining that it is the visionary third way--the evangelical  alternative to savage capitalism and ferocious Marxism.  <H5>  God, Municipality, and Family </H5>   Buttiglione, on the other hand, knows by memory the basic  concepts of the doctrine, and accordingly promises miracles. The  key passage calls for the application of the principle of  subsidiariness, whereby each level of the social pyramid should  be self-sufficient and should request help from the next higher  level only in case of necessity.    But the levels of the social pyramid that have been designed  by the pope's philosopher also seem strange. First of all, there  is the family, and then by successive levels one finally reaches  God. In synthesis, it is a triad of values: God, municipality,  and family. In fact, Buttiglione counters the federalism of  Umberto Bossi and Gianfranco Miglio--and its many  microregions--with the concept of a nation of regions, parishes,  and villages [campanili], as taught by Catholic tradition, which  is anti-Piedmont and localist. Is it a credible plan, or an  indigestible mix [preceding word in English]?    Buttiglione constructed this table of values by adding up  and  blending various formative experiences which--as an intellectual  enamored more of himself than of anything else--he subsequently  surpassed and put aside.    The first of these formative experiences was his  discovery--as a young man--of Communion and Liberation, through  a priest from Catania, Don Ciccio Ventorino. Buttiglione was  impressed by the importance that Don Luigi Giussani, CL's  founder, placed on the evangelical phrase "whosoever follows me  shall have a hundredfold here below and eternal life." The young  Buttiglione was fascinated by the "hundred-fold" concept--by the  challenge posed by this kind of Christianity that deals with  everyday life and aspires to redeem it. Along the way,  Buttiglione also made the acquaintance of Augusto Del Noce, one  of the most recent active Catholic thinkers. Del Noce was the  only Catholic thinker in this century to attempt a Catholic  reinterpretation of history, following the example of the great  reactionaries and enemies of the modernism of the 1980's, from  Joseph De Maistre to Monaldo Leopardi. In Del Noce's opinion,  the right-left classification must be replaced by the  sacred-profane classification.    By completing CL's anthropology, Del Noce's example gave  Buttiglione the ideological framework that he lacked, and  Buttiglione expressed his gratitude whenever he could. Every so  often the master would ask him to supply quotations from Hegel,  to which the disciple responded immediately--from memory, and in  German.    One thing is sure. Del Noce, Don Giussani, and Don Ricci  were  Buttiglione's three principal teachers, but over time things  changed. Don Ricci and Del Noce died, and relations with Don  Giussani soured. Meanwhile, however, relations were developed  with other sponsors [preceding word in English]: the Vatican  and--beginning in the mid-1980's--certain intellectuals in the  United States.    The latter included Michael Novak and George  Weigel--sociologists and theorists of Catholic capitalism--and  subsequently a series of bishops and cardinals, including John  O'Connor of New York and Joseph Bernardin of Chicago (who became  famous worldwide because of the accusations of pedophilia). They  are the right wing of the U.S Church.    The triad of God, fatherland, and family is once again with  us. Buttiglione is at his ease on the other side of the ocean  because--among other things--his foothold in the United Sgates  gives him the dimension that he had lacked, namely  internationalization: a gift that only a few of the saints had  ubiquitousness. To those who point out that his appearances at  Teramo--where he teaches political philosophy--have become less  frequent, he responds in a truly baronial manner. "If I give  lectures in New York and Rio de Janeiro, in Buenos Aires and  Washington," he says, "it is because they invite me, and this  does no harm to the university where I teach, but in fact  enhances its prestige." It is the culture of the visiting  professor [preceding two words in English].  <H5>  "It's A Pity He Is Naive" </H5>   And as a visiting professor, Buttiglione will speak a few  words of charitable common sense to anyone in the decomposing  universe of Catholic power who asks him to do so. They all want  him to speak; they all revere him as if he were an icon. For  that reason they are running him as a candidate for the most  unlikely posts: mayor of Rome (but he does not reside there);  editor of the moribund Catholic weekly IL SABATO; and editor of  the daily L'AVVENIRE. It is quite true that it costs nothing to  promise that which no longer exists. This includes the ethics of  the DC, which he is has been asked to reorganize, given the fact  that for every meeting the party holds, the judiciary responds  with an average of five arrests--a little too much to be allowed  to continue. "He is naive," the Catholic writer and journalist  Vittorio Messori told L'EUROPEO. "He is unable to recognize the  bait put out by the media, and that is why his interviews and  statements sometimes appear to be stupid. I hold him in high  esteem, however."    Will the professor who does not know how to avoid the traps  set by the journalists be able to avoid the entanglements of  politics? Will he be the savior of a DC that is in the process  of liquidation? "If they offer me the position of secretary, I  shall accept it," Buttiglione answers, with the typical  terseness of someone who is at the head of his class. "He will  lose," Messori says. "When there is a revolution, it is fought  between Girondists and Jacobins. No one remains in the center.  But one day Thermidor [Robespierre's overthrow] will come, and  Buttiglione will be revalued."    Be that as it may, Buttiglione does have one merit by  comparison with Martinazzoli: he is good-humored and whimsical.  A small example? Two years ago, he saw (in the original  language, of course) the film Pretty Woman, featuring  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, and he was profoundly impressed  by it. He accordingly went to the store, bought the  videocassette, and gave it to his three daughters, praising the  film's "highly educational content for the younger generations."  For those who have never seen it, Pretty Woman is the  story of a prostitute who falls in love with one of her clients.</p>

The third plenary session of the provincial discipline  inspection commission held second meeting on the afternoon of 25  March. Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party committee,  gave a speech, entitled: "Submit Ourselves to and Serve the  Overall Situation of the Whole's Party's Work and Conduct  Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained, In-Depth, and More  Effective Manner.    Provincial Leaders, including Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma  Guoliang, Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Li Qinglin, and Yu  Jingchang attended the meeting.    Sun Weiben pointed out: Constantly and deeply fighting  corruption is a strategic policy decision made by the party  Central Committee after correctly appraising the previous stage  of work, the further demand of deepening reform and accelerating  development, the important guarantee for political and social  stability, and the current strong desire and demand of cadres  inside and outside the party. To this end, our party and  government leading comrades at all levels must be soberly minded  in this aspect.    Sun Weiben pointed out: This year the general demand of our  province's anticorruption work is to comprehensively fulfill the  three central tasks, to consolidate the achievement, and to  carry it out in an in-depth and more effective way. To  consolidate achievements means that we must grasp the  anticorruption work which we started last year until good  results are achieved; places which have achieved good results in  this aspect should continue to improve their work. To pay  attention to in-depth work means that we must resolutely  straighten out and handle the problems which have been  discovered and step up efforts to formulate and improve the  relevant management regulations and preventive measures. To pay  attention to effective results means that we must sum up and  popularize the experiences and lessons gained in the previous  stage of work and improve and strengthen work measures in an  effort to achieve greater achievements.    Sun Weiben said: The current anticorruption struggle must be  carried out in the course of accelerating the establishment of  the socialist market economic structure. The work of fighting  corruption and promoting honesty must be combined with the  implementation of the major reform measures. In addition to  providing conditions and a guarantee for the implementation of  the four reform tasks through anticorruption struggle, we should  also fundamentally check the appearance of corrupt phenomena by  deepening reform and building systems so as to achieve results  in bringing about a temporary solution and in getting at the  root of the problem. Sun Weiben stressed: Taking a two-handed  approach and being tough with both is a strategic principle and  leadership method which our party has persistently upheld.  According to the past experiences and lessons, the phenomenon  of being tough with one hand and soft with the other hand will  easily occur when the reform and economic work tasks are  arduous. This year more reform measures will be issued, the  reform strength will be strong, and risks will appear. Under  such circumstance, we should all the more persist in taking a  two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should  strengthen leadership over the anticorruption struggle.  Therefore, we should continue to implement the responsibility  system in anticorruption work, strengthen supervision,  inspection, and work guidance, and earnestly support discipline  inspection and procuratorial organs to exercise their duties.    Provincial leaders, including Li Genshen, Xie Yong, Sun  Kuiwen, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, and Ma Shuji, comrades of the  leading group for building party style and administrative  honesty of the provincial party committee, and principal  responsible comrades of various provincial-level departments  also attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme </F> Council session in Kiev -- live]    [Excerpts] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych, esteemed people's  deputies. The issues that have been submitted for your  consideration are of an exceptionally important significance.  Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent  state depends to a large extent on the the decision you will  adopt today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme  Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of  the START Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, with certain  reservations. Among other things, it also contained an  instruction to the president of Ukraine and the government to  hold appropriate negotiations between interested states and  international organizations with the aim of due protection of  both Ukraine's security and its material interests, which would  open possibilities for the START I Treaty to enter into force  and would initiate the process of genuine international nuclear  disarmament.    You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted  resolution. After this decision made by the parliament, Ukraine  stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative  image we earned for our state because of this began to intensify  to a level which opened the possibility of imposing more than  just economic forms of pressure. [passage omitted]    The nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former  USSR  not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but are a  threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific nor the  manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of billions of  dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture new nuclear  weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons could be  tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's deputies  of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the opinions of  leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which was shown on  Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear state and  gain something positive from this, then why not accede to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 world  states? [passage omitted]    Ukraine is now being accused of something very serious: If  we  do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier,  we are halting further world disarmament. START II comes under  threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused.  Although the state of our economy and the possibility of  reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is  true -- without support from international financial  institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money  but also with experience, private investments, and the granting  of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we  would not be able to manage without the Russian market.    Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress,  normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful  problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken.

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Problems at US cable offshoot leave Delta 6% lower at Pounds 31m DELTA, the cables and engineering group, said that one of its four business cylinders had failed to fire in the first half, causing pre-tax profits to fall by 6 per cent, from Pounds 33.1m to Pounds 31m. The 'problem child' was Surprenant, a US cables company badly affected by defence cuts. The cables division saw operating profit halve to Pounds 5.61m (Pounds 10.7m) in the six months to June 27 on sales of Pounds 139m (Pounds 146.6m). Delta's share price, which hit 505p in May, closed 25p down at 353p yesterday. Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said UK cables prices had fallen through the recession and the capital spending of privatised electricity companies remained limited. Overall, group operating profit declined to Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 29.5m) on turnover of Pounds 402.3m (Pounds 389.6m). Earnings per share slipped to 12.7p (14.3p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 4.2p. The star performance came from the engineering division, which advanced operating profits by 18 per cent to Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 9.53m) on sales of Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 145.7m). The continental plumbing products business, related to building refurbishment, had continued to grow and there was considerable scope for expansion in eastern Europe. Industrial services slipped to Pounds 8.43m (Pounds 9.71m) on sales of Pounds 89.2m (Pounds 96.7m). The main impact came from the weakening Australian dollar. Overall the effect of currency movements knocked nearly Pounds 1m off group profit. Circuit protection improved by 27 per cent to Pounds 7.38m (Pounds 5.8m) on Pounds 66m (Pounds 53.7m) turnover. New products had improved the company's market shares. Before the group acquired the outstanding 36 per cent of Delta Crompton Cables for Pounds 37m from BTR in June, gearing was similar to the year-end ratio of 13 per cent on net debt of Pounds 40.7m. Mr Mike Gill, finance director, said the up-to-date gearing figure was about 25 per cent. The proportion of group sales in the UK has steadily declined to less than 50 per cent. Altogether, Europe, accounted for Pounds 329.2m (Pounds 307.5m) of sales. COMMENT It seems the market has grown a little bored with Delta's worthy record of cost-cutting to tackle recession, maintaining a comfortably covered dividend and eschewing rights issues and big acquisitions. It used to benefit from the reflected lack of glory of BICC. But with BICC yielding nearly twice as much, sentiment has swung the other way. Unfortunately for Delta, the prompt rationalisation to protect margins is seen as limiting recovery potential. This is perhaps a little unfair because only a 5 per cent increase in volume in cables would create a bounce from the lean cost base. But there are few good words for Delta's cables business at the moment, which is seen as commodity-like - hence the vulnerability to falling prices. The group remains in a good position to make acquisitions for cash - there is some regret that it did not use its erstwhile highly rated paper for this purpose. A full-year pre-tax profit of Pounds 62m gives a prospective multiple of 13.5. The share price ought to have fallen far enough, but it will take some positive news to get it moving.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Liberals set for Canadian poll victory CANADIANS set aside their political differences yesterday to celebrate the Toronto Blue Jays' second consecutive victory in the World Series baseball championship. But the exuberance of the hundreds of thousands of fans who clogged downtown Toronto will not prevent Canadian voters exposing the widening fault-lines in their society today when they go to the polls. Mr Jean Chretien, whose Liberal party is almost certain to end nine years of Progressive Conservative rule, saw the Blue Jays' nail-biting win over the Philadelphia Phillies as a good omen for the success of his own party. If opinion polls are correct, the Liberals will be left as the only national party with significant representation in the 295-seat House of Commons. The Conservatives, led by Ms Kim Campbell, and the left-of-centre New Democrats are bracing themselves for some of the most devastating setbacks in Canadian political history. Ms Campbell, who took over as Canada's first woman prime minister four months ago, has had a disastrous campaign. Her inexperience and an unconvincing policy platform have wiped out hopes that she would erase voters' memories of her unpopular predecessor Mr Brian Mulroney. Most of the opposition seats are expected to be occupied by two fledgling regional parties, the secessionist Bloc Quebecois and the populist Reform party, whose main strength is in western Canada. An unusually large number of three- and four-way contests make it difficult to predict the precise result. But the Bloc is set to win the vast majority of Quebec's 75 seats, while Reform candidates will probably pick up several dozen Alberta and British Columbia constituencies now held by the Conservatives. The potential for growing friction between Quebec and the rest of the country was underlined over the weekend by suggestions that the Conservatives should ally with Reform to prevent the BQ from forming the official opposition. Many English-speaking Canadians wonder whether MPs whose main goal is to break up the country should become Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Mr Lucien Bouchard, BQ leader, said he would fight any attempt to stop the BQ forming the official opposition if it gains the most seats after the Liberals. 'People better not come and tell me that they will not respect the democratic will of Quebeckers,' he said. Mr Bouchard indicated however, that he would not move into the leader of the opposition's official residence in Ottawa. Predictions that the Liberals will gain enough seats to form a majority government have brightened the mood of financial markets. The Canadian dollar soared by almost two US cents last week, and bond prices have regained most of the losses they suffered at the start of the campaign.

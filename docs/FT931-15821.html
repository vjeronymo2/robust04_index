			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Showdown in the Last Chance Saloon: Raymond Snoddy examines the implications of the Calcutt report on regulating the press THE political battle to determine where the line should be drawn between press freedom and individual privacy started in earnest yesterday. According to widespread leaks in Sunday's national newspapers Sir David Calcutt QC, in his report on press behaviour, has decided self-regulation of the press has failed and that tough action should be taken, including fines and a statutory press complaints tribunal. Although there was no official confirmation yesterday, those who gave evidence to Sir David and have seen parts of the report believe the newspapers were broadly correct. Sir David, whose original report on the press and privacy was published in June 1990, was asked to look at how the new Press Complaints Commission - whose establishment he recommended - was working. Ironically, Sir David's second report on the press was called for by Mr David Mellor when national heritage secretary - before his political career was engulfed by tabloid headlines. The months in which Sir David took evidence coincided with a long hot summer of controversial articles about the personal lives not only of Mr Mellor and an actress, but also of members of the royal family. The reported Calcutt recommendations follow closely his recipe in the original report for what should happen if self-regulation failed. There would be substantial fines for newspapers breaching a statutory code of conduct implemented by a press complaints tribunal. The chairman of such a tribunal, replacing the complaints commission, would be a judge, sitting with two lay assessors. These would amount to the most draconian measures taken against the British press in modern times. Under the proposals there would be new criminal offences covering physical intrusion, electronic eavesdropping and taking long-distance photographs of people who are on private property. These proposals were in the original report but not implemented. The leaks came after the report was delivered on Friday to Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, and appear to be the work of journalistic contacts with political sources, rather than a government move to discredit the proposals. Mr Brooke's officials declined to comment yesterday. The press has been worried for some months about what Sir David would recommend. The first signs that the proposals might be tougher than expected came just before Christmas when a small group from the complaints commission was shown two chapters. The group was not told of Sir David's findings, only allowed to check the accuracy of the account of how the commission was set up and what subsequently happened. Those who read the account, it is said, were shocked at the 'arrogant and petulant' version of events. Sir David appeared more concerned that his original recommendations had not been followed to the letter rather than trying to assess what the commission had achieved. Those who have read the Calcutt chapters believe they are biased. Commission members note that when they gave evidence to Sir David they were not asked how the body was working. Sir David was more concerned that it might have strayed into areas such as defending press freedom. In evidence to Sir David, the commission said self-regulation of the press was working. Between January 1991 and July last year, 36 complaints or 3 per cent of the total had been upheld. In 358 cases the commission found no prima facie breach of the code of practice drawn up by the newspaper industry. And 373 complaints were resolved between editor and complainant. Only six complaints on breaches of privacy were upheld. The newspaper industry will have a difficult job arguing that case in the face of political anger over celebrated rows, particularly those involving the royal family and the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Perhaps the most notorious was about recorded telephone conversations, apparently of the Princess of Wales talking to a male friend. They were not only published in The Sun but 'exhibited' by it on a premium telephone line. In spite of the growing furore in parliament and the second reading of the private member's bill introduced by Mr Clive Soley, Labour MP for Hammersmith, on the press at the end of this month, it is unlikely Calcutt's draconian measures will be implemented. What is now considered inevitable - and senior newspaper figures privately agree - is the introduction of measures against the bugging and reproduction of private telephone calls unless the public interest is involved.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            READ ALL ABOUT IT: A YEAR OF CONTROVERSY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Feb '92  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown's affair with former          secretary revealed after report in The Scotsman of injunction          against press.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June '92 Serialisation of Andrew Morton's book on the Princess of Wales          in The Sunday Times.

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Separate exemptions Under the inheritance tax/capital gains tax legislation, are husbands and wives each allowed to make gifts of Pounds 3,000 a year free of liability to tax, or is this amount to be shared between them? Both the Pounds 3,000 annual exemption for inheritance and the Pounds 5,800 annual exempt amount for capital gains tax apply to each person: there is no sharing of relief between husband and wife. Ask your tax office for the free leaflet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

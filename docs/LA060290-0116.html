			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> UTAH MINERS -- VICTIMS OF ATOMIC AGE;  </P> <P> THOSE WHO DUG URANIUM FROM THE EARTH SUFFER A HIGH RATE OF CANCER. THOUGH  OFFICIALS HAD EARLY WARNINGS, THEY DID LITTLE TO EASE THE DANGER. CONGRESS  CONSIDERS COMPENSATION.  </P> <P> The uranium mine is shut now. Has been for years. Air compressors, tools, coils  and pulleys are rusting on the ground. Yet the men who once worked the mine  continue to die.  </P> <P> Lynn Frederick toiled in this mine and was happy to get the work until it  closed in 1966. Each morning he would leave before sunrise and work deep  underground, operating the heavy water drill and carving out chunks of rock  from inside the mountain.  </P> <P> Now, Lynn Frederick is missing a lung. He lost it last January after it was  diagnosed as cancerous. He is not alone.  </P> <P> By the count of the people in this tiny, isolated community in southwest Utah,  31 of the 50 or so men who worked in the uranium mines around here either have  cancer or have died of it. Health experts predict that hundreds more who worked  in uranium mines will be dead before it is over, that the price to be paid here  on the Colorado Plateau will be heavy indeed.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know what uranium was," said Frederick, 62, who now waits for  the day when cancer will claim his remaining lung. "All I knew was that it  meant a steady paycheck."  </P> <P> This is where the legacy of the nuclear weapons industry begins for the  American West, the testing ground of the Atomic Age. And Marysvale is a natural  starting place in the story, because it is one of the spots in the United  States where uranium was first wrested from the earth to make atomic bombs.  </P> <P> As the decades have passed and the events have unfolded, it has become clear  that the estimated 15,000 miners who worked underground to provide uranium for  the nation's defense put themselves at serious risk because few precautions  were taken to protect them from exposure to radiation. It is also a story that  has largely gone untold because it took place in one of the most sparsely  populated areas of the country.  </P> <P> According to figures supplied by the Centers for Disease Control, 350 of 4,146  uranium miners studied since the early 1950s have died of lung cancer -- five  times the normal death rate. Health experts say much of the reason for the  large number of deaths is that the mines were poorly ventilated and, as a  result, miners inhaled an inordinate quantity of radioactive particles.  </P> <P> In a 1951 report on uranium mines, radiologist William F. Bale wrote that  uranium miners were being subjected to radon doses that were 440 times the  maximum allowed then by the Atomic Energy Commission. And his was not the first  warning about the dangers of uranium mining.  </P> <P> Among the victims were hundreds of Navajo Indians, who "were sent into the  mines without any protective clothing, face masks or respirators," said Leonard  Haskie, interim chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council in testimony last March  before a Senate subcommittee. "Because they did not know of the hazards, they  ate their lunches in the mines and drank the water running through the mines.  They also brought radioactive material out of the mines to build their homes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denies Responsibility  </P> <P> There is a sub-plot to this story as well, one in which the Atomic Energy  Commission knew of the dangers of mining for uranium without proper ventilation  but failed to correct the problem. Instead, the AEC, now the Department of  Energy, disclaimed any responsibility for miner safety, saying that it could be  accountable for uranium and the safety of people around it only after it had  arrived at the processing mills.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the U.S. Public Health Service failed to tell miners they were at  risk, even as a secret ongoing study clearly showed that more and more of them  were dying of cancer. To further compound the problem, most of the miners with  cancer, as well as the families of those who have died from the disease, have  been unable to collect workers' compensation. In many cases, the statute of  limitations for filing a claim had run out long ago.  </P> <P> Now, more then 20 years after the last mine was closed down because the U.S.  government had stockpiled all the uranium it needed, the latest in a series of  bills has been introduced in Congress to compensate the miners. The legislation  would establish a $100-million trust fund for those who have contracted cancer  as a result of mining or being exposed to radiation from atomic bomb testing,  people commonly known as "down-winders."  </P> <P> By most estimates, about 25,000 people down range of the Nevada nuclear test  site were exposed to radiation during the '50s when bombs were being detonated  above ground. Critics of the Atomic Energy Commission contend that the people  who lived in the desolate areas of Nevada, Utah and Arizona where the fallout  occurred were exposed to lethal doses of radiation that also killed thousands  of sheep.  </P> <P> Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who introduced the legislation in the Senate,  said in a statement last February that the level of exposure for the  down-winders was "in large part, due to the government's unconscionable failure  to properly care for or warn these victims."  </P> <P> After a Senate subcommittee hearing in 1979, a report titled "The Forgotten  Guinea Pigs" said the "government totally failed to provide adequate protection  for the residents of the area. . . . The greatest irony of our atmospheric  testing program is that the only victims of U.S. nuclear arms since World War  II have been our own people."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposed by Bush  </P> <P> The bill, currently making its way through the legislative process, is opposed  by the Bush Administration and the U.S. Department of Justice, based on the  argument that there are other avenues of relief and that there is no absolute  medical proof that mining and atomic testing led to later diseases. In a letter  written last February, Acting Assistant Atty. Gen. Bruce Navarro described the  bill as too broad, unjustified and expensive.  </P> <P> The House version of the bill seeking relief for the miners and down-winders is  scheduled for a vote on Tuesday. That bill was introduced by Rep. Wayne Owens  (D-Utah).  </P> <P> Miners and down-winders have both sued for compensation in the past, but the  courts have ruled that the federal government is immune from liability. But in  both cases, the courts have said the plight of those exposed should be dealt  with by Congress. In a 1985 ruling against the uranium miners, U.S. Judge  Blaine Anderson of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said: "This is the type of  case that cries out for redress, but the courts are not able to give it.  Congress is the appropriate source."  </P> <P> Stewart L. Udall, the former secretary of the Interior, said the legislation  making its way through the Congress may be the last best hope for the miners  and the down-winders after more than 40 years of being shunted aside. He has  worked for more than 11 years, either as a lawyer or advocate, for those  affected by radiation.  </P> <P> "I think this year is the year of decision," he said in a recent interview. "If  we don't get it this year, that would be the final, unfortunate end to it.  We're asking Congress to make a gesture in the direction of justice."  </P> <P> In Udall's view, the story of the miners on the Colorado Plateau -- which takes  in parts of Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona -- as well as the  down-winders, is about a group of people who are paying the price because the  government believed that atomic weapons had to be built, no matter what the  cost. And Marysvale, in a sense, is a microcosm for them both.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dying Slow Death  </P> <P> Marysvale, like many of the people in it, is dying a slow death. Its roads are  dirt and there is only a single gas station and a couple of rundown motels. The  dominant building in town is the Mormon church, which sits atop a hill.  </P> <P> But Marysvale was not always like this. It was once a 19th-Century Gold Rush  town. During the uranium boom, it had two schools, a theater, five gas stations  and a train depot. In those days, a man could make the hefty sum of $400 a week  in the mines.  </P> <P> And uranium, for certain, was king in this part of the country. Before the  uranium mining, this was a land of hard-scrabble poverty, where a vegetable  garden was essential and new clothes were rare. The people hereabouts took  pride in the fact that the mines were upgrading their lives. And there was no  reason to feel endangered, because it was the government that needed the ore.  </P> <P> "We were innocent," said Joan Anderson, whose husband's right lung was removed  in 1987. "We didn't question certain people -- our parents, doctors, our  government. The public is more educated now, but back then we just didn't  question the government. We trusted them. And remember, we were deathly afraid  of communists. We were determined to get that ore to defend ourselves.  </P> <P> "They needed the ore so damn bad they forgot everything else," she added. "They  wanted the ore out and they were willing to sacrifice their own countrymen to  get it."  </P> <P> So the men went into the mines, unaware that as early as 1948, one of the  Atomic Energy Commission's own scientists, Dr. Merrill Eisenbud, had warned  that there was a danger of radiation exposure. What the miners also did not  know was that there was already a large body of research in Europe which showed  that Czech and German miners who had been exposed to radiation were dying of  lung cancer at uncommonly high rates. And the miners didn't think it terribly  unusual that government doctors came around a couple of times a year to do  their tests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recounts Warning  </P> <P> Victor Archer remembers that because he was one of the doctors. In 1956, he  came west with his family to continue the tests on miners that had been started  in the late '40s by the U.S. Public Health Service. He had been warned in  Washington before he left that talking out loud about the dangers of uranium  mining would not serve him well.  </P> <P> He had heard the story of Dr. Wilhelm Hueper, a researcher with the American  Cancer Institute, who had given a speech about the danger in the mines, only to  have his travel restricted to east of the Mississippi River.  </P> <P> "I resolved to keep my mouth shut and stay out of trouble if I could," said  Archer in a recent interview at his University of Utah School of Medicine,  where he is a clinical researcher. "I took the attitude of the disinterested  scientist. I said, 'Let's learn all we can from this experience.' "  </P> <P> One thing the scientists already knew at that point was the culprit believed to  be causing the health problems. It was not radon itself, an inert gas often  found in mines. Rather, it was the material formed after the radon was released  into the atmosphere by blasting and drilling.  </P> <P> When that happens, radon begins to decay, forming other radioactive elements  that are called daughters. After 13 stages of decay, the radioactive material  that the miners breathed was Polonium-210-lead, which had attached itself to  dust particles that were dense in the shaft because there was little or no  ventilation.  </P> <P> But those were different days, and even though there was a predicted health  danger because of lack of ventilation, no one took it very seriously. Archer  said it became obvious that only a growing tragedy would attract notice.  </P> <P> "It became apparent we were going to have to pile up enough bodies to get their  attention, enough dead to convince them there really was a problem," said  Archer.  </P> <P> So the testing began. And it is still being carried out today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Owners Issue Threat  </P> <P> The public health workers would show up once or twice a year with their  trailers that doubled as medical clinics. They would take sputum samples, but  never say a word about what they were doing, other than in broad, vague terms.  Archer said the mine operators threatened to bar health officials from  conducting their tests if the miners were alarmed about the dangers of their  work. And if the owners barred them, it would ruin the ongoing study.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, life chugged along in Marysvale. The Hoover Cafe had a huge chunk of  uranium ore on its counter for years. Miners would search out the warmest spots  in the underground caves to eat their lunch, not knowing that these were the  places where they were most likely to be bombarded with radiation.  </P> <P> Other miners would bring particularly "hot" rocks home to amuse their families,  showing them how the ore made a Geiger counter jump off the scale. Miners would  occasionally have contests to see who was most radioactive. Some people  fashioned rock gardens out of uranium ore, shining black lights on them at  night to make them glow.  </P> <P> There were no changing rooms at the mine, so the workers came home each night  covered with radioactive dust. Mothers washed their husbands' clothes along  with those of their children.  </P> <P> When Lynn Frederick came home from work, his twin daughters would jump up for a  kiss. But something strange would happen to one of the daughters, Jane Wiley,  who is now a nurse.  </P> <P> "I'd hug him for some loving, but within minutes come down with a nauseatingly  painful headache," she recalled. Years later, the memory of those headaches  still haunts her when she thinks of how her own daughter died of  hydroencephalitis (water on the brain). Her sister's stillborn baby did not  have a skull.  </P> <P> That the Atomic Energy Commission suspected there were dangers in the mines is  without question. An AEC report written in 1952 stated that the exposure to  radon and radon daughters in the mines was "too high for safe operation" and  that the mines should be properly ventilated. Little was done, however, until  1971, when the federal government established mine safety standards. Why the  AEC did nothing is a matter of conjecture.  </P> <P> "They decided for reasons that nobody has ever explained, so you have to  guess," said Udall. "I think they didn't want to be bothered, that they wanted  to get the thing (nuclear weapons industry) on line so they went down that  road."  </P> <P> "You look at it today and it's amazing nobody blew the whistle on them," he  said. "The evidence is powerful and overwhelming that the AEC knew (of the  dangers) at the beginning."  </P> <P> Arden Higgens, who had a tumor removed from his lung in 1983, walked from grave  to grave at the Marysvale cemetery, pointing to the markers of Marysvale  residents who had died of lung cancer.  </P> <P> "Go to cemeteries in nearby towns and you'll see more of the same," he said.  "It makes you real sad to see all of them together like this -- William  Cropper, Dan Rosequist, Byron Hanson, Carl Norton, Alvin Christensen, they all  got the cancer."  </P> <P> Higgens bent over to rearrange the silk flowers at every grave. Above him was  one of the old mines.  </P> <P> "We call it Cancer Hill now," he said.  </P> <P> Researcher Lianne Hart contributed to the reporting of this story.  </P></p>

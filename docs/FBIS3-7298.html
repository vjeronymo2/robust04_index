			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Monday [28 March] called for greater economic  openness, noting that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks  are evidence of increasing calls for Japan to liberalize its  market. Speaking at a working group meeting on steps to boost  imports and improve market access, the third such meeting to be  held under the administrative reform promotion headquarters led  by the premier, Hosokawa said, "we need to establish an  economically open society."    "Our efforts should contribute to shrinking the differences  in prices in Japan and abroad," he added, calling for active  discussion of ways to rectify price differentials.    Previous meetings focused on housing and real estate issues,  and also conferred on information and telecommunications.    The Japanese Government is planning to draw up  market-liberalizing measures based on the discussions of the  three working groups by late June, ahead of July's Group of  Seven (G-7) summit.    At the working group meeting, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  said "drastic measures, not abstract ones," should be  implemented.    Experts from the private sector said that regulations should  be revised to be more in line with international standards.</p>

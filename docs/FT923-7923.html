			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The Property Market: Urban Regeneration Agency will bring government's development activities into 'sharper focus immediately' MR TONY PENDER, chief executive of English Estates, believes that the Urban Regeneration Agency will bring the government's development activities into 'sharper focus immediately', writes Chris Tighe. 'We are putting into one agency a flexible set of tools, an agency which can intervene at all stages of the development cycle,' he says. 'The possible synergy is considerable. Derelict Land Grant and City Grant are demand-led grant structures. In a sense we (English Estates) are the opposite of that.' The new agency will permit greater targeting and, unlike English Estates, will have powers to make compulsory purchase orders, he says. He also sees the new agency as an effective part of City Challenge initiatives, many of which have a strong property element. 'An agency like this could be extremely helpful in pushing things along. The timing is good.' Mr Pender disagrees with critics who say the URA should have had an all-embracing remit, to cut down the plethora of regeneration initiatives. 'If you have too many functions, you end up with an enormous spread of work and a problem of co-ordination.' He does not expect the new agency to solve all the complex problems of declining urban areas. 'I don't believe anybody believes that property of itself is the answer,' says Mr Pender. 'Urban renewal is a means to an end, not an end in itself.'</p>

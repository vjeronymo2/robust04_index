			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS 34TH SENATE DISTRICT;  </P> <P> SCRAPPY LAWMAKER CHALLENGED BY GOP MAVERICK;  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS: VETERAN LEGISLATOR RUBEN AYALA'S STYLE HAS WON HIM HIGH MARKS IN  SACRAMENTO, WHERE HE HAS WON FUNDING FOR A VARIETY OF PROJECTS IN HIS DISTRICT.  </P> <P> State Sen. Ruben S. Ayala is best known around the Capitol for championing a  lost cause: providing more water to Southern California.  </P> <P> For more than a decade, the Chino Democrat has promoted major state water  projects, such as the Peripheral Canal to pump high-quality Northern California  water to the south. The canal plan was defeated by state voters in 1982, and  Ayala has been thwarted from reviving it or winning approval of smaller-scale  proposals by unyielding opposition from Northern California lawmakers.  </P> <P> Ayala's persistence in pushing such projects has drawn fire from  environmentalists. Thomas Graff, senior counsel of the Environmental Defense  Fund, described Ayala as someone who has "almost never met a water project he  didn't like."  </P> <P> But Graff also admitted a grudging admiration for the veteran lawmaker, who is  facing a stiff reelection challenge from Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona).  </P> <P> Graff said that even though he disagrees with Ayala about 75% of the time, he  nonetheless holds a "soft spot" for the senator "because he's a  straight-shooter."  </P> <P> Indeed, Ayala's scrappy style wins him high marks in the Capitol. While many  lawmakers increasingly hide behind aides when confronting tough issues, Ayala  is known for his willingness to face his critics head-on. He also refuses to be  taken for granted.  </P> <P> One veteran lobbyist said that in contrast to lawmakers who take their cues on  issues from legislative leaders or special interest groups, "You have to go in  and see (Ayala) and talk to him and explain the deal and how it affects his  area."  </P> <P> After 16 years in the upper chamber, Ayala is an entrenched member of the  Senate establishment: chairman of the Agriculture and Water Resources  Committee; an ally of Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti; a lawmaker who  has clout to get public works projects built for his booming 34th District,  which encompasses Pomona in Los Angeles County and most of western San  Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Besides water issues, Ayala is not known for his sponsorship of big-ticket  legislation. Unlike many of his colleagues, he has kept his focus on his  district, winning funds for a variety of pet projects -- libraries, community  centers and parks. He flies home just about every weekend and, according to one  former staffer, tries to keep in tune with the district by sifting through  constituent mail.  </P> <P> One of Ayala's few moments in the statewide limelight involved the highly  charged 1979 battle over Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s appointment of actress Jane  Fonda to the state Arts Council. Ayala, suggesting that the actress had  provided "aid and comfort" to the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War, made  the motion to reject her appointment. It passed overwhelmingly.  </P> <P> With less controversy, Ayala has been a longtime champion of the California  Conservation Corps, carrying legislation in 1980 to extend the life of the  agency initially set up to hire unemployed youth to protect the environment.  </P> <P> His critics fault Ayala for failing to grasp details of legislation. One  lobbyist, who asked not to be identified, said Ayala listens, asks questions  and is reasonably attentive, but "doesn't quite get 100% of the picture" on  many issues.  </P> <P> Ayala, 68, dismisses such criticism as campaign rhetoric by those seeking to  exploit the age gap between him and the 50-year-old Bader.  </P> <P> One legislative staffer said that in committee -- where the nuts and bolts of  lawmaking takes place -- Ayala is poorly prepared and may be handicapped by a  loss of hearing.  </P> <P> Ayala acknowledged suffering a hearing problem in his right ear, which occurred  while he was in the Marine Corps. But he maintained that even though he does  not wear a hearing aid, he remains quite capable of hearing "what's going on."  </P> <P> Politically, Ayala is considered a moderate-to-conservative Democrat. One  former Senate staffer described Ayala as "not as liberal as most Democrats and  not as conservative as most Republicans" in the Senate.  </P> <P> A review of five special-interest groups that rate legislators shows Ayala  drawing high marks from traditional Democratic constituencies. For instance,  the political arm of the California AFL-CIO reported that in 1989 he voted a  pro-labor position 82% of the time. And the California Teachers Assn. gave him  an "A" for his record on education issues.  </P> <P> Ayala drew mixed reviews from more conservative groups. The California Chamber  of Commerce said Ayala voted with their interests 41% of the time in 1990.  </P> <P> But the National Rifle Assn. reported that he failed to side with the gun group  on any issue. The NRA has endorsed Bader and has helped mount an independent  campaign on his behalf.  </P> <P> Despite Ayala's stand on water issues, the League of Conservation Voters, the  political arm of the environmental movement, said that he sided with them in  the 1990 legislative session on 79% of their key floor votes.  </P></p>

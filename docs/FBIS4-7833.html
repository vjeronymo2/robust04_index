The order, forwarded to TANJUG, says:    In keeping with our obligations to international  humanitarian  law I order the following:    To take all necessary measures to investigate crimes  committed in the Srpska republic, particularly in Prijedor;    To take all other actions needed to suppress extremism and  secure the safety of members of national minorities who wish to  stay in our republic;    To remove all administrative obstacles to free movement of  civilians who wish to leave in an operation organized by the  ICRC;    To secure police escort for all ICRC convoys, especially in  the Prijedor area;    All our bodies have the duty to provide full safety for ICRC  personnel and civilians who decide to leave the RS under ICRC  protection. Any objections to the conduct of the ICRC personnel  must not be used as a pretext to threaten their safety. The  office of the president of the republic is to be informed about  any objections to the ICRC's conduct;    To secure free passage across the Srpska republic borders to  all ICRC convoys announced in advance and to exercise routine  control;    Failure to comply or fully to comply with the order entails  the highest degree of accountability.    A copy of the order will be forwarded to the ICRC to be used  at checkpoints to avoid any possible misunderstandings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hani al-Hasan, Fatah Central Committee </F> member, by Mufid 'Awwad; place and date not given]    [Text] ['Awwad] To begin with, let us try to put the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in the context of the ongoing  Arab-Israeli contacts.    [Al-Hasan] In order for us to make sense of why it took  three  long weeks to pass the UN Security Council resolution on the  massacre, we need first to ask why the massacre happened. It is  believed by some that the massacre was committed by a murderous,  psychopathic settler. The massacre was really the product of a  debate inside the Israeli security services on how to handle  Palestinian policemen in the impending self-rule authority. The  recruits for the future Palestinian police force can be expected  to be patriotic young men victimized by occupation. The Israeli  security establishment goes on to argue that, driven by an urge  to exact vengeance, many of these Palestinians may take it out  on settlers. The Israeli security establishment also fears a  mounting militant spirit among the Palestinians, buoyed by  confidence that they are achieving success.    There were two trends of thought within the Israeli military  security community. The first was that If the Palestinians  should break the Gaza-Jericho accord by attacks on settlers,  they would reply with the proper means. The second trend,  which, incidentally, has prevailed, argued that right from the  beginning the security forces should create a climate of fear,  warning the Palestinians of the dire consequences of any attacks  they might mount on the settlers after April, 1994, especially  since it was Fatah, in particular, that carried out most of the  armed attacks inside the occupied territories, notably in the  West Bank, since the signing of the Oslo agreement.    Hence Israel's resort to direct and open terror, as seen in  the bloody and savage Hebron massacre, to instill panic and fear  among the Palestinian population.    ['Awwad] So you think the massacre was perpetrated in  implementation of a decision made at the highest Israeli  security levels?    [Al-Hasan] Absolutely. But what Israel did not bargain for  was the scale of the Palestinian popular pressure inside  Palestine and in brotherly Jordan. Israel was further surprised  by the angry and strong Islamic, Arab, and even international  reaction. Acting in character, the Israelis then set about an  operation of damage control.    The talks in Washington were held within the framework of a  feverish Israeli effort and must be seen in this light. Rabin's  visit to Washington was made to shore up his popularity. Tel  Aviv, Tunis, and Washington all wanted to make the most of the  massacre. It must be said that the Tunis leadership failed to  use Israel's crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque to expose its true  ambitions in the occupied land and push for the world to assume  its humanitarian and moral responsibilities toward the  Palestinian people. Now what do I mean by the Tunis leadership  using the massacre?    Let's not bury our heads in the sand. The Palestinian people  are suffering from divisions while Israel is scoring major  successes on the economic and international fronts. Any  right-thinking person will tell you that the concessions made in  Oslo and Cairo need not have been made -- not under any  circumstances. Even President Mubarak's adviser Usamah al-Baz  said that there was a need to restore balance to the Oslo  agreement. Even the Europeans are now talking about the need to  send international forces to protect the Palestinians, and this  is quite important. Simply speaking, the world is interpreting  UN Security Council Resolution 242 so as to mean Israel is  sitting in occupied rather than disputed territory.    The Palestinian leadership has no choice but to make what I  would call a bold decision dictated by the national Palestinian  conscience; namely admit that its political line is flawed. The  split in Palestinian ranks and inter-Palestinian squabbling and  Israel's gains are all the result of a mishandling of the  negotiations.    ['Awwad] Since Madrid?    [Al-Hasan] Yes, since Madrid.    ['Awwad] What do you mean by the political line? You were  one of the Palestinian leaders that laid down the foundations of  a political settlement for the Palestinian issue?    [Al-Hasan] The Palestinians are being forced by Israel to  negotiate with them unilaterally. This is the consequence of an  Israeli argument that the Palestinians must enter into  unilateral talks with Israel. Then there is the argument  advanced by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]; namely, that if you are  unable to get all that you want, you may settle for some of it.  The result has been that Israel began talking about  indispensable security settlements and dispensable political  settlements. Israel thus capitalized on this argument by  insisting that part of the occupied territories will not be  vacated.    ['Awwad] An example?    [Al-Hasan] For example, agreeing in Oslo to delay the  Jerusalem issue to the second phase of negotiations was  dangerous. Israel says the Oslo agreement postpones the  Jerusalem issue. I wonder what Jerusalem they are talking  about. Israel is not talking about East Jerusalem, the small  area it occupied along with Arab and Palestinian areas in 1967,  or about West Jerusalem. It is talking about today's Jerusalem,  according to the occupation authorities' concept of two cities  with boundaries that have been extended close to Bethlehem in  the south, Ramallah in the north, and Jericho in the east. When  we begin to discuss the subject of assuming power in the West  Bank after a few weeks, greater Jerusalem, with an area that is  more than 10 percent of the West Bank, will be excluded from the  areas that will come under Palestinian authority because  Israel's interpretation of Jerusalem is different from that of  the PLO. This should not be accepted at all. Accordingly,  agreeing to the current phased negotiations, that is, a  transitional and then a final stage, means agreeing to splitting  territory. Anyone who partitions land will also partition  rights. Therefore, under no circumstances should we accept  phased negotiations, although we might accept phased  implementation.    In the letter of invitation to the Madrid [conference], the  PLO accepted phased negotiations. This political line, which  now prevails, is responsible for splitting the cause. We are  now seeking security for Gaza and Jericho, but we are supposed  to be seeking security for all Palestinians. The Palestine  question is in a real impasse due to the phased negotiations.  The PLO leadership should have benefited from the obvious  international solidarity with the Palestinians -- people and  organization -- after the Zionist massacre. This great national  Palestinian support should have been employed to prove the  indisputable fact that there can be no coexistence between  settlers and Palestinians; it should have been used to  immediately call for negotiations on the final solution as a new  policy that will dictate new alliances and new coordination.    ['Awwad] Why does Israel insist on phased negotiations?    [Al-Hasan] Israel believes the PLO should not call for the  implementation of Resolution 242 at the first stage of  negotiations because, it says, the PLO is not a party to that  resolution.    ['Awwad] How can the Palestinians break out of this impasse?    [Al-Hasan] The solution lies simply in coordinating with  Jordan, which is a party to 242, and with Syria and Lebanon, for  the sake of negotiating with one voice and one tactic and  advancing or retreating together. The idea of one Arab  delegation to negotiate all issues and deal with withdrawal as  one issue, security as one issue, water as one issue, and mutual  relations as one issue, can be proposed once again.    ['Awwad] But Israel, whose policy is based on the tactic of  dealing with Arab parties separately, will certainly reject the  idea of a unified Arab delegation.    [Al-Hasan] We can then run affairs according to one policy  and one plan on all "tables." For example, Syria and Jordan  emphasize that no economic normalization talks will be held with  Israel unless there is progress in political negotiations and  unless Israel promises to withdraw from every inch of the Arab  territories occupied in 1967, whether they are Syrian, Lebanese,  or Jordanian territories.    ['Awwad] Why doesn't this apply to Palestinians? They used  to say the Palestinian position is weak.    [Al-Hasan] The helpless ones in the PLO said this. However,  in the aftermath of the recent massacre, nobody can say the  Palestinian situation or Palestinian awareness is weak.  Therefore, receiving any Israeli delegation in Tunis before  voting on the Security Council resolution was a big mistake.  The wording of the Security Council resolution itself was very  weak and wsa not in keeping with the horrible massacre.    ['Awwad] As a prominent leader of the Fatah Movement and as  a member of the Fatah Central Committee, do your political ideas  on the peace process and your position on the Oslo accord  reflect the views of the Fatah Central Committee or the views of  a large number of the Fatah Central Committee members?    [Al-Hasan] I speak as a Fatah Central Committee member. I  cannot claim to be speaking on behalf of the Fatah Central  Committee. Still, recently, more Fatah Central Committee  members believe there must be a reconsideration of all that has  happened, and all that is happening. The recent statements  published in AL-DUSTUR reflected this trend. Brothers Muhammad  Jihad and 'Abbas Zaki [Fatah Central Committee members], as well  as many others, see a need to seriously reconsider all that is  happening. As for me, I believe we must mobilize Palestinian  popular forces with clear political positions so they can  pressure the leadership and encourage it to take drastic  measures to change the course of the negotiations.    ['Awwad] When you mention the word leadership, what  specifically do you mean? Do you mean the PLO Executive  Committee, or the leading PLO institutions? When you mention  the word leadership, what do you mean? If you mean the PLO  Executive Committee, four members of this committee have  resigned, not to mention those who tendered their resignations  earlier, that is, in the immediate aftermath of the Oslo accord.  It is true that the PLO has been experiencing a legislative  impasse since the resignation of Palestine National Council  Speaker Shaykh 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih. But, can we say the PLO  leadership is experiencing an executive impasse? If the answer  is yes, what will happen, since the current phase requires  concerted efforts by all in the context of a harmonious  Palestinian leadership that is directly responsible for the  destiny of its own people?    [Al-Hasan] This question is extremely important and serious.  It has been on my mind since you started this interview.    What closes ranks and unifies efforts is a clear political  line. By the same token, what divides is a mistaken political  line. With regard to the Palestinians, they can simply judge  the proposed solution as to whether it is sound or not, in light  of the national consensus it enjoys. This is because  nationalist political forces cannot disagree on national issues.    Hence, we see the organizational impasse facing the PLO, the  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. One-third  of the PLO leadership, in terms of the political quorum  reflecting the various political forces making up the PLO, has  resigned. Only the Palestinian People's Party has continued to  promote the PLO's current policy line. With regard to the  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and the Palestine Liberation  Front, their votes reflect opposition to, not support for, the  current policy line. This means the PLO Executive Committee is  currently denied a political and a numerical quorum,  particularly since three of its members have resigned. In case  new resignations take place, the PLO will face a real impasse.    ['Awwad] This concerns the PLO in general. What about the  Fatah Movement?    [Al-Hasan] With regard to the situation on the ground, there  is a persistent, continuous, and serious Fatah demand that the  course of negotiations be rectified, and the facts made  available to the Palestinian people's masses. This is because  the statements by some officials on the Gaza-Jericho accord were  incorrect and untrue. They have not enlightened the Palestinian  people about the facts.    ['Awwad] Could you elaborate on this, please?    [Al-Hasan] While commenting on the Gaza-Jericho accord, and  the Oslo accord, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has said displaced people  will return home immediately. Undoubtedly, 700,000 displaced  people were overjoyed when they heard this. Nobody can blame  them, because they then thought they would be returning home the  next day.    Now, it seems no more than 10,000 displaced people will be  allowed to return over the next three years. It has been  reported that the number may be increased to 20,000 or 30,000.  All displaced persons must return together. This is common  sense, and this is our conception of a proper solution.    By not allowing the repatriation of displaced people, Israel  wants to fragment rights and territories. When the issue of  releasing Palestinian prisoners was discussed in Taba, the  Israeli delegation rejected a PLO proposal to form a committee  to discuss the issue, contending the provisions enshrined in the  Oslo accord underscore security for Israel. Once Israel's  security is ensured, then pertinent measures can be taken by  Israel, Israeli negotiators argued. That is why the negotiators  formed the security and confidence-building measures committee.  Accordingly, the release of prisoners must promote Israeli  security.    As a matter of course, any level-headed person well-versed  in  conflict management would not have accepted any such ideas, the  centerpiece of which is meant to promote Israeli security. This  is because agreements should be balanced. Mutual interests must  be promoted. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for  engaging in negotiations in the first place.    Given all this, the Palestinian people and the Fatah  Movement  are witnessing calls for reconsidering the course of the  negotiations. However, international pressures on the PLO, the  agency that makes decisions regarding the Palestine question,  are immense. This, of course, does not exempt the Fatah  Movement of its responsibilities, because it is the mainstay of  the PLO. Hence, we would like to say that silence is no longer  golden. We must make an effort to spare the Fatah Movement any  further external international pressure.    ['Awwad] In your opinion, there is some erosion in the  PLO's stand on how to run the conflict. In this regard, there  were two memorandums on how to launch reform, but the  signatories to both memorandums were constrained in one way or  another. So experience proves reform endeavors have not  produced any remarkably positive results. The Palestinian  street does not view many reformists as serious because until  recently they supported and advocated the PLO's political line  and political leadership. What suddenly made the reformists  take their positions? How can a radical change be introduced  into the current political line?    [Al-Hasan] Anyone who studies the history of any political  movement, including the PLO, will see that any history has its  ups and downs. But, this is far from a collapse, which will  indicate, if it takes place, a defect in the issue. Ups and  downs, however, do not necessarily mean a defect, but may be the  result of an upset in the balance of power.    The difference between collapse, on one hand, and ups and  downs, on the other, is that the people, in the second case, are  always supportive. But collapse usually results in the  disengagement of you and your popular base. This is  scientifically true, not a matter of interpretation. When you  propose a political line representing the aspirations of the  masses, these masses will rally around you. Only then will you  have a broad base. The members of the organization will grow in  number and quality and there will be enough money.    When you propose an incorrect political line that does not  represent mass aspirations, the masses will abandon you, your  organization will decompose, your revenues will decrease, your  well-being and credibility will retreat before your people and  the world, and you will collapse.    The crisis is one of the political line. The refugee issue,  as an expression, is no longer mentioned in the refugee  committee. What is being discussed is the return of part of the  displaced people, not the repatriation of refugees. The refugee  issue was postponed until a final solution is found, while  preparations are under way for self-rule to assume the  responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency  on the eastern and western banks. This is why the current  Palestinian political line does not represent the refugees'  ambitions. Therefore, Palestinian circles in Syria, Lebanon,  and the camps reacted negatively and violently against the  agreement and even attacked the PLO leadership because the  current political line does not represent them, and might  sacrifice their interests.    Therefore, I believe any talk about reform or democracy will  produce no results unless a new political line is worked out  that meets the aspirations of political and popular forces.  Only then will circumstances for democratic action be available.    ['Awwad] How can a new political line be worked out? What is  the best mechanism for that?    [Al-Hasan] As I said, the current political line has  produced  negative results. This cannot be denied except by arrogant  people who claim Palestinians are making achievements and  scoring victories on the road to the liberation of the land.    Even after they enter Gaza and Jericho, there will be no  guarantees that everything will take place quietly. The  Israelis will not suddenly become peaceful. As I said, the  recent brutal massacre is a studied security decision, which is  being exploited by Israel to overwhelm Palestinian morale in  preparation for the next stage of negotiations.    Hence, strong political pressure should be placed on that  leadership to prevent it from relinquishing any inch of land in  the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem, and relinquishing the  refugees' rights by creating a new political line to run the  conflict.    ['Awwad] Since the establishment of the PLO and until the  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the Palestinian masses have rallied  around the PLO and its leadership, despite differences of views  on the leadership's policy in running the conflict.    It is noteworthy that as a result of the massacre, the  masses  called for toppling the PLO leadership for the first time in 30  years. Are the demonstrations that the Palestinian people  staged after the massacre a spontaneous expression of the  Palestinian masses' reluctance to support the PLO leadership and  the beginning of popular abandonment of it?    [Al-Hasan] The demonstrations in Jordan and inside and  outside the occupied territories are undoubtedly an alarm to the  leadership that its political line has become so weak that the  masses will raise their voices and reject that line.    We should not fall into the faults of the pan-Arab movement  in the seventies, when they said that Arab unity did not take  place because of the absence of popular awareness. Holding the  masses responsible is shortsighted, and evidence of the  leadership's weakness. The people always have the right  strategic sense and they express their true interests.    Our people believe the displaced will not return, that  massacres against them will escalate, and that the Hebron  massacre is the fiercest of all massacres, but will not  necessarily be the last.    They also believe that Israel will determine Palestinian  entry into Jericho. This means sharing sovereignty, which is a  step toward sharing the land.    In other words, a part of the negotiations is based on the  legitimacy of the occupation, and the wrong political line will,  undoubtedly, serve the occupation and your enemy in the final  analysis.    ['Awwad] Abu-Tariq [Hani al-Hasan], this leads us to an  open and angry question reiterated by the Palestinians: Are  there no skilled Palestinians other than Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Jamil  al-Tarifi, Nasr Yusuf, and the rest of the Palestinian  delegation -- with all due respect to those people -- to  confront Amnon Shahaq, Uri Savir, and others? How do you  explain this?    [Al-Hasan] Once again, I believe the problem lies in the  political line, because it produces people who refuse to take  part in any delegation because they are not convincing in this  line or it produces people who agree to follow orders. When the  political line is weak and a failure, many forces and skills  withdraw because nobody can rectify the wrong political line.    ['Awwad] So, the choices are being made on the basis of  loyalty to the existing political line, not on the basis of who  is capable of handling the conflict?    [Al-Hasan] Yes. I was asked to supervise the multilateral  talks. However, I set a condition of not holding the  multilateral sessions between us and the Israelis in any Arab  country. This means the rejection of normalization with Israel  before realizing a political solution, that is, full Israeli  withdrawal. I could have accepted the offer if the leadership  had responded to this condition.    ['Awwad] You mean no normalization before withdrawal?    [Al-Hasan] Yes. This is in line with the other Arab  parties' stands on this issue. I believe the PLO should abandon  the multilateral talks, or at least not hold them in Arab  countries such as Tunis, where the PLO headquarters is located.  Indeed, holding the multilaterals in any Arab venue will be a  big step toward normalization, but in return for what? Nothing.    Israel so far has been recognized by India, China, and half  the population of the world. It received billions of dollars in  economic aid. It opened closed international markets to its  exports. Israel's economy in 1990 suffered from a reduction in  growth; the growth was minus 2. Today, however, and as a result  of the huge aid it is receiving, Israel's economic growth is  beginning and has reached plus one, and is on its way to become  plus four.    Israel received all this through the political settlement  process, Meanwhile, none of the Arab parties gained an inch of  their occupied territories and not a single Palestinian employee  received a milligram of security.    Why continue providing the Israelis with all the factors of  benefiting from the peace process?    ['Awwad] You said discussing the issue of Jerusalem at a  later stage of negotiations shows the well-known Israeli  intentions toward the city. How do you view the Jerusalem  situation, since it is a sensitive situation that has been  complicated in recent times?    [Al-Hasan] Jerusalem is Palestinian territory to which  Resolution 242 applies. The basic principle is that  Palestinians should have sovereignty over this territory.  Afterwards, all issues on the religious level can be discussed.  As for now, we can only discuss the issues of Israeli  withdrawal and returning the Palestinian territories occupied  since 1967 to the sovereignty of the Palestinians, including  Jerusalem.    We believe developments in the Jerusalem issue are a result  of the wrong political line. The Vatican, for example, is  beginning to talk about its responsibilities toward the  Christian places. This is a big danger. However, when you  adopt such incorrect behavior, the Vatican becomes free of its  commitments toward what you, yourself, have been demanding and  then abandoned or postponed to an unknown stage.    When there was Palestinian and Arab Islamic insistence on a  united stand toward Jerusalem, the Vatican, throughout the past  50 years, was committed to this stand. However, when it found  that some Palestinians are willing to discuss the issue of  Jerusalem from a perspective that is totally different than what  is known, the door opened wide.    The Vatican's interference is a very serious thing. However,  we must admit that it is not the Vatican's fault. Indeed, the  wrong political line is what opened the door. Moreover,  President Clinton started saying that Jerusalem is the capital  of Israel. Vice President Al Gore also began to reiterate that  Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It should be noted that Al  Gore made new statements that were unprecedented by U.S.  officials, in Clinton's era or in the era of those who preceded  him.    The basic issue that must be implemented and championed  deals  with the need to implement the political line. No one thinks  entering Jericho is a good start. On the contrary, the Israelis  have a well-studied plan for the stage following the  Gaza-Jericho stage. This plan began with the Hebron massacre.  In the next stage, Israel will seek to create many problems,  massacres, and obstacles. I strongly believe there still exists  a secret Israeli decision not to withdraw from the West Bank and  to play around with political formulas to guarantee their stay  in the West Bank. This is because their real policy aims at  signing a military agreement with some authority, that will  exist four or five years from now, in order to keep their Army  as an allied Army and not as an occupying Army.    However, this does not mean their plan will succeed because  I  have faith in the Palestinian people. I believe our people on  both sides of the Jordan River can confront Israeli schemes.  The biggest example of this is that the massacre did not weaken  our people. Indeed, our 1948 Palestinians performed their full  job in condemning the barbaric crime.    However, this does not mean that our people's sacrifices  should continues until time eternal. This is especially so  since a successful political leadership is responsible for  accomplishing its goals with minimum material and human losses.  However, what is happening is that we are paying dearly as a  result of our political line in terms of martyrs, money, and  time, while the accomplishments, as we see, are not in keeping  with this long struggle.    ['Awwad] As a Palestinian official and a leading Fatah  member, you and your comrades have well-known stands in  defending independent Palestinian decision making. Based on  this, how do you assess the Palestinian leadership's relations  with the partners in the common Arab destiny?    [Al-Hasan] Anyone who examines the current situation will  simply realize there are Palestinian relations with Arab states,  but there are no common policies between the PLO and the major  Arab forces in the region. Of course, this is a serious  disorder, considering that any political line derives its  strength from the people's support and from its alliances with  its partners and friends. If one of these two elements is  missing, the political line will collapse. The current  Palestinian political line is collapsing because it lacks  popular support and common policies with the Arab states that  are parties to the conflict. Therefore, in the first place,  there must be joint Palestinian-Jordanian policies, then common  Palestinian-Syrian-Lebanese policies, and common policies with  the broader Arab arena, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  Morocco, Libya, and Egypt. This is because common policies can  create a political balance between the Arabs and Israel.    ['Awwad] But, how can you explain the current distinguished  relations between the Palestinian leadership and the Egyptian  leadership?    [Al-Hasan] Egypt supports a phased settlement. But the  brothers in Egypt have already restored their land, so they are  no longer harmed by a phased settlement. I am sure that if  Sinai was occupied, no Egyptian official would accept a phased  settlement on behalf of the Palestinians. The proof is that  President al-Sadat did not accept a phased settlement of Sinai.  In a well-known press statement he said: No to phased  negotiations, yes to phased implementation, and no to the  relinquishment of any inch of Egyptian territory. Our difference  with al-Sadat was because he said Sinai before Jerusalem--in  other words, because he separated Jerusalem and Sinai. On the  contrary, President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir said Jerusalem before  Sinai and the Golan before Sinai. If there had been a common  political line among the Arab peoples, we would have an  important weapon in our hand, namely, summoning the Egyptian  ambassador from Tel Aviv, and expelling the Israeli ambassador  from Cairo. This would jeopardize the entire situation--the  current situation in which Israel is making one gain after  another as a result of Israel's dealing with each Arab side  separately.    ['Awwad] The Palestinian leadership is under pressure to go  back to the negotiating table. There are attempts to beautify  this return to the negotiating table through temptations that do  not include the acceptance of the PLO's conditions to resume the  talks. The question is how Hani al-Hasan sees the future stage  in light of this Arab situation and the imbalance in favor of  Israel?    [Al-Hasan] I have written a lengthy study on the seriousness  of accepting the Madrid paper. I still believe the situation in  the Arab region has not been settled yet. This is because this  entire region will witness many political earthquakes,  especially after the international balance collapsed with the  fall of the Soviet Union. A new balance is being built. Our  region is the center of this new balance, because it is the  center of energy and agricultural fields, which will produce  unique agricultural stuffs in the future, taking into  consideration the growing population of the world. A big  conflict is raging in and around our region. This conflict is  still hidden. The parties to this conflict are Europe, the  United States, Russia, and Japan. The United States needs this  region to be calm because it wants to control oil without any  rivals in order to twist the arms of Germany and Japan and to  obtain economic concessions from them. This is because the  United States, which controlled more than 75 percent of the  world's economy in 1948, now controls only 27 percent. The  United States now spends a billion dollars every day--and I know  what I am talking about--to pay its debts and interest. If the  United States does not mend its trade balance, it will seek the  help of the World Bank in the year 2007. So, the United States  is trying to avoid this by controlling this region of the world.    There is a conflict in the world on the balance required in  the Arab region. Following the change in the situation in Iran,  an agreement was reached to set up a Turkish-Iranian-Pakistani  economic and political axis as a basic part of the regional  balance of power. There is a decision to turn Israel into an  economic and military force in order to maintain part of the  balance in the region or to guarantee this balance.    Former President Bush considered Egypt part of this balance,  but President Clinton does not believe so. Therefore, these  forces want to send us back to the Cold War days and not  recognize a regional Arab force in this part of the world.    During the Geneva meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad  and Clinton, al-Asad accomplished a great deal when he got the  U.S. to decide that Syria will be part of the forthcoming  regional structure.    Therefore, we, the sons of the East and West Banks --  Jordanians and Palestinians -- must discuss the issue from this  angle. Where do we stand in the forthcoming regional structure?  The issue is not that of 2 km in Jericho and 2 km in Gaza. It  is where we stand in the forthcoming regional structure. If  Israel becomes a regional force and the Arabs do not become a  regional force, we will return to 1948 and to Israel's military  and economic belligerence.    Israel -- which spends 33 percent of its annual budget to  repay its debts and its interest, 16 percent for security, and  19 percent for the army -- is in dire need of security to  maintain its role in the forthcoming balance. In other words,  there will be no role for Jordan, Palestine, Syria, or Egypt.  There will be no role for the Arabs.    In accordance with the Oslo accord, the Palestinian-Israeli  talks will resume two years after the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord. During these two years, an international  agreement on the situation in the Arab region will be reached.  Meanwhile, Israel is planning to keep the Palestinians and  Jordanians outside the equation.    Therefore, I believe the real battle is coming. I believe  the problem of the Oslo accord is that it weakened the  Palestinian position in terms of its regional role. The Oslo  accord seeks swift economic prosperity to promote the economy of  greater Israel. What is required now is to reach a  Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese concept to face the  forthcoming stage. The PLO leadership will face darker  political days if it does not immediately change its strategy,  policy, and alliances.    We cannot gamble on Israel's good intentions. Zionism has  continued to exist because more than one-half of the Israelis  announce this clearly, and still consider Hebron and the West  Bank the land of their ancestors. In his Washington address to  the AIPAC [American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee], Rabin  called this land Judaea and Samaria.    Therefore, I call on all national Palestinian forces and the  political forces in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to develop a  concept about our forthcoming regional role on the political,  military, and economic levels to confront the coming plot aimed  at weakening the Arabs and Muslims.    The first task of Palestinian politics is to topple the  economic section of the Oslo accord. This must be the headline  of the coming stage because Israel wants to merge the $3-billion  Palestinian economy with the $67-billion Israeli economy as a  step toward absorbing the land and economy together.    We must know that Jordan is forcibly linked with whatever  takes place in the West Bank and that the Palestinians are  forcibly linked with what takes place on the East Bank.  Therefore, we must resist any call on the East Bank for Jordan  to ignore what takes place in the West Bank as well as any call  for merger with the Israeli economy and ignoring what takes  place in the East Bank.</p>

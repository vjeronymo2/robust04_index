Gene Brown said, however, that the KAL flight was not the first  foreign-based airline to be used in the Mideast crisis by the United States.  </P> <P> He said Saudi airliners have been used at other U.S. military airfields, under  contract to the Military Airlift Command.  </P> <P> Korean Air's role in ferrying supplies was disclosed Friday in Seoul by the  Korea Times, although Korean government officials had declined to confirm the  report.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State's proposed substitute language for 30 CFR 816.100 is substantively the same as the language found in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.101 (a)(2) and (b). The combination of the State's proposed substitute language for 30 CFR 816.100 and the incorporation of 30 CFR 816.101, will provide the Iowa program with backfilling and grading time and distance performance standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa's deletion of 30 CFR 816.100 which requires backfilling, grading, topsoil replacement, and revegetation to occur as contemporaneously as practicable on all lands disturbed by surface mining activities, does not render Iowa's program less effective than the Federal program because contemporaneous reclamation requirements are found elsewhere in the Iowa program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the Iowa program contains time and distance performance standards for backfilling and grading. Moreover, the contemporaneous reclamation requirement for revegetation, incorporated by reference by Iowa at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207), is provided for at 30 CFR 816.113. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the requirement of 30 CFR 816.100 that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously as practicable with mining operations, while there is no specific State counterpart provision, logic maintains that if revegetation is completed contemporaneously, topsoil replacement, which must be done prior to revegetation, is also contemporaneous. Nevertheless, the Director finds that, in order to be no less effective than the requirements of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.100, Iowa must amend its program to explicitly require that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously as practicable with mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(2) to be no less effective than the Federal program and is approving it. The Director also finds that Iowa's incorporation of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 816.101 does not render its program less effective than the Federal program and is approving it. However, the Director is requiring Iowa to further amend its program to explicitly require that topsoil replacement occur as contemporaneously as practicable with mining operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 24. IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207) and 27&hyph;40.64(207), Design Criteria for the Construction or Modification of Coal Mine Waste Refuse Piles <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207) and 27&hyph;40.64(207) by incorporating by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 816 and 817, including 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83, as they existed on July 1, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Iowa's current rules, approved by the Director in a November 6, 1991, rulemaking (56 FR 56578), incorporate the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83 as they existed on July 1, 1987, including the editorial notes at the end of these regulations. These editorial notes state that 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83 are suspended insofar as they ``permit the construction of coal refuse piles using lifts of greater than 2 feet thickness.'' The Director, in the same November 6, 1991, rulemaking, placed a required program amendment on Iowa's program at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(10). This required program amendment directed Iowa to amend its rules to provide design criteria, specifically, for lift thickness and long-term stability. Iowa has chosen, instead, to incorporate the current Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83, as reinstated on June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21764, 21765&hyph;21766), that do not impose specific design criteria for lift thickness and long-term stability, but instead impose performance standards to assure stability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(207) and 27&hyph;40.64(207) regarding design criteria for the construction or modification of coal mine waste refuse piles is no less effective than the Federal regulations and is approving them. Consequently, the Director is removing the required program amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(10). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 25. IAC 27&hyph;40.63(9), Impoundment Inspections <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to revise its rules at 27&hyph;40.63(9) by adding the following sentence to 30 CFR 816.49(a)(10)(i), as incorporated by reference into the State program: ``Yearly inspection of the impoundments shall be done in the second quarter of each calendar year, and the inspection report shall be submitted to the Division with the second quarter water monitoring report.'' The Division, by adopting this revision, is fixing the time of the yearly inspections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The corresponding Federal regulation requires a yearly inspection but does not set a specific time that the yearly inspection must be conducted. Therefore, the State regulatory authority is implicitly given the discretion to provide for such specific time frames. Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.63(9) to be no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulation and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

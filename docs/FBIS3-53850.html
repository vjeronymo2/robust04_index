The source  stated that "a general known for his hard-line position toward  Islamists and his hostility to the Arab, Islamic line is in  charge of the plan." The source stated that this general "has  great influence inside the military and enjoys Maj. Gen.  Nezzar's confidence."    The source added: "According to the report, the general in  question (he declined to reveal his name) assigned a group of  retired colonels in the military security organ to conduct a  secret investigation to identify the quarters behind the bombing  operations not attributed to Islamic groups. The results of the  investigation revealed Maj. Gen. Nezzar's responsibility for  them, including the attempt on his life and the attempt on the  life of Gen. Toufik, chief of the military security organ."    The source stated that a European official "put Dembri in  the  picture with regard to the report, telling him that the general  himself convinced his colleagues and a number of colonels that  Nezzar is responsible for what has happened to the country and  for the losses inflicted on the military and that his insistence  on the method of holding a dialogue with the fundamentalists  will eventually lead to handing over power to the Islamic  Salvation Front." The source added that the European official  stressed to Dembri "the existence of a petition signed by senior  officers, urging Nezzar's removal in preparation for a coup to  be led by the military's hard-line general." The report  indicates that Nezzar's adversaries accuse him of monopolization  and have detected "several secret contacts" he made with  Salvation Front leaders via various channels, "including  assigning Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, former secretary general of  the National Liberation Front, to make contacts with the  Islamists. He was seen frequenting a villa in the Draria area,  west of the capital." The report stresses that Messaadia "was  the target of an assassination or abduction attempt but the  security services foiled it."</p>

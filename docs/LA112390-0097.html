			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mobil Loses Wrongful-Dismissal Case: Mobil Corp. said it will appeal a decision  by a federal court that found a subsidiary had wrongfully dismissed  environmental officer Valcar Bowman Jr.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., had ordered Mobil Chemical Co. to pay  Bowman $375,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages.  Bowman charged that Mobil dismissed him because he would not whitewash reports  documenting Mobil's environmental problems, an act that would have violated  federal and state environmental laws. Mobil said Bowman's 1986 dismissal was  part of a cost cutting program.  </P></p>

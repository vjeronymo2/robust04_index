These figures were described as "very bad and illogical"  by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella during the first meeting of  the administrative council of the Export Foundation.    For his calculations, Di Tella used a basis of $250 billion,  which implies a yearly income of $7,000 per capita and exports  totaling some $15 billion.    Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo also attending the meeting.  He corrected Di Tella, saying that the basis should be $300  billion.    Based on these figures presented by the two ministers, Di  Tella calculated that the goal for Argentine exports for the  year 2000 should be 10 percent of the GDP, that is, between $25  billion and $30 billion.    Speaking in a colloquial tone, Di Tella told the 30 or so  businessmen that comprise the Export Foundation that "the  message being conveyed is that export figures will not be so  ridiculous in the future." The meeting was held yesterday at  the Foreign Ministry.    Di Tella added: "The government must create conditions for  businessmen to export." He said: "The interests of businessmen  are the central issue of President Menem's trips abroad."    Cavallo emphasized: "Great importance is attributed to a  good  exporting record in the mid- and the long-terms if a country  wants to maintain high growth rates." He stated: "It is of  paramount importance to export goods and services."    Cavallo said: "A great deal still has to be done" with  regard  to promoting exports.    During this first meeting of the administrative council,  Cavallo reiterated his concern over news published abroad about  an alleged unrealistic exchange rate in Argentina and a drop in  the real purchasing power. Cavallo, who is the council's vice  president, believes this report is the result of mistaken  studies conducted by Argentine consultants.    He asked those who conduct economic studies to clarify their  guidelines or, he warned: "They could create doubts in the minds  of international investors." He added: "If we transmit a wrong  image abroad, we will all sink together." [passage omitted]</p>

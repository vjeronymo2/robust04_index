			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] After intensive negotiations it is now clear in  principle: An agreement [exists] between Sweden and the  European Union [EU], which will be the basis of possible Swedish  EU membership and which the Swedish citizens will decide in a  national referendum. After talks are concluded, all negotiators  normally say that they are pleased, and Swedish Minister for  Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel was no exception when he met journalists  in Brussels this afternoon.    [Begin Dinkelspiel recording, in English] This is a historic  date, a historic date. We have, for all practical purposes  concluded our negotiations for membership of the European Union.  [end recording]    [Reporter] This is a historic day for Sweden, Minister for  Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said when he met the international press  in Brussels today. [passage omitted] Most of the questions  which were solved in the final spurt concerned agriculture and  the budget. And as to the budget, Sweden had demanded a  so-called phasing-in stage, i.e., a reduced EU membership fee  during the first years. The EU has never accepted this model;  instead, the EU will send money directly to Anne Wibble, and the  finance minister says today that she does not know yet what will  be printed on the check, that means it is not certain what the  EU will call the subsidy. In figures this means that Sweden  will pay the full fee of almost 20 billion Swedish crowns only  in the fourth year of membership. During the first year Sweden  will pay 450 million Swedish crowns more than what the EU is  paying to Sweden in the form of various kinds of support and  subsidies. [passage omitted]    As to the subsidies for agriculture in Norrland, Sweden will  have the right to continue to support the three northern areas.  Money from the EU will be in the form of three different forms  of support, where the so-called environment subsidies cover the  whole of Sweden.    The regional subsidies were a less disputed question during  the last 24 hours because it was already clear earlier that  Sweden would receive subsidies similar to those given to the  poorest areas of the EU. The subsidies will concern 450,000  people in the areas of Norrbotten, Vaesterbotten, and Jaemtland  and, in addition, 11 provinces in Dalarna, western Norrland,  Vaermland, and Gaevleborg.    Two major questions are unsolved because the EU member  countries have not been able to agree among themselves. In  conflict with other countries, Spain demands that Sweden's entry  to the future foreign exchange union be delayed so that Spain  will not be in a worse situation when qualifying itself. Spain  and Britain have demands which concern the number of votes that  can get a proposal rejected in the Council of Ministers. Those  questions are expected to make next week's foreign ministers'  meeting in Brussels a stormy affair.</p>

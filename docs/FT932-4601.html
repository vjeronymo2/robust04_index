			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (22): No let-up for the Big Three - Aero-engine manufacturers are restructuring heavily THERE HAS been no let-up for aero-engine manufacturers. 'We are undergoing the longest and most damaging recession we've ever suffered,' says Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group. 'In some parts of the world, we don't know what kind of airline industry will emerge from this recession which has already taken some large airlines like Pan Am and Eastern out of the game. As for the defence business, it has not gone away for good, but what is clear is that it will be half the size it was,' he adds. The response to the steep business downturn of the three big aero-engine makers - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney in the US and Rolls-Royce in the UK - has followed a common pattern. All three have continued to restructure heavily. GE is cutting a further 4,000 jobs and Pratt another 10,000 jobs in the next 18 months. Rolls-Royce, whose aero-engine workforce has already fallen from 36,500 in 1990 to 29,500 at the end of 1992, is cutting another 5,000 jobs this year. But while aero-engine makers have had to accelerate restructuring, they have also had to continue investing heavily in the development of new products and technologies to take advantage of the recovery when it finally comes and maintain their long-term competitive position in perhaps the toughest of all markets in the aerospace industry. All three are in the throes of costly programmes to develop new large commercial engines to power the new generation of widebody aircraft. GE is investing heavily in the GE90, which reached a thrust level of more than 100,000lb during tests in Ohio this spring. Rolls-Royce is working on the Trent and Pratt on the PW4000 to build ultra-high thrust power plants. The first application for these new engines will be the Boeing 777 twin engine widebody airliner and the Airbus A330 widebody twin. Although the initial 777s and A330s will not require anything like 100,000lb of engine thrust (the GE90, for example, will enter into service with its launch customer British Airways in September 1995 at a thrust rating of 78,700 lb), all three manufacturers expect demand for power to grow as twin-engine widebody aircraft become bigger in the future. Apart from cut-throat competition to sell engines - and none has been fiercer than in the new large commercial engine market - the sector has traditionally faced far longer lead times for product development and profit recovery than other parts of the aerospace industry. Lead times have been steadily growing and have now stretched as long as 50 years for new engine programmes. Rolls-Royce says it takes about 14 years to research and demonstrate a new technology and another 12 years to apply the results to a complete aero-engine product range. But as manufacturers traditionally earn low margins for new engines, they have to rely for their return on investment on the large after-market for spare parts over the 25-year service life of an engine. This matches the current expected life of a modern airliner which, according to Rolls-Royce, is at least 25 years. Margins for new engines have also been squeezed by the present parlous state of airline finances. All manufacturers have had to increase the financial support that they provide to many of their customers to sustain sales during the industry's current three-year slump. 'We are not only having to give away new engines but we are now having to make deals with airlines on spare parts. That's how tough it is,' notes Mr Brian Rowe, the head of GE's aero-engine operations who is expected to retire later this year. During recessions, airlines fly less and require fewer spares thus putting pressure on the aero-engine manufacturers' lucrative spare parts business. But an additional problem facing manufacturers in the more profitable after-market sector of their business has been caused by the steady advance in engine technology. Rolls-Royce says the sharp improvement in modern engine reliability means that it now takes at least five to six years after the sale of a new engine before spare parts income starts to flow. The huge costs and risks coupled with long lead times of developing new engines has forced manufacturers to rely increasingly on widescale international collaboration ranging from joint technological studies and licensing agreements to risk and revenue sharing partnerships and the setting up of joint engine companies. Such partnerships have predominated on the civil side of the business which cannot rely to the same extent as military engines on government research and development support. GE and the French state-owned engine manufacturer Snecma have been collaborating for two decades on civil engines with Snecma holding risk-sharing stakes ranging from 10 to 50 per cent in GE civil engine projects. Pratt has forged a strategic alliance with Motoren und Turbinen Union (MTU), the German engine manufacturer part of Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary. Rolls-Royce has also been increasing its collaborative ventures with Japanese manufacturers taking a 7.5 per cent stake in the Trent. Rolls has also set up a joint company with BMW of Germany to develop engines for business, commuter and regional aircraft. With development costs and competitive pressures constantly rising, smaller manufacturers are finding it increasingly urgent to forge new relationships or expand existing ones with the larger aero-engine groups. This is likely to lead to more consolidation of smaller companies into the big three. Some aerospace analysts have even suggested that three big manufacturers are too many for the market to sustain and that one will eventually have to merge with a competitor. Sir Ralph believes the three majors will survive. 'But I can't see a place for the smaller players,' he adds.</p>

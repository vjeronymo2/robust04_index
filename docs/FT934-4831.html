			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / M&amp;S signs big power contract Marks and Spencer has signed a contract with Northern Electric for the supply of electricity to 160 stores, around half M&amp;S's stores around the country, David Lascelles writes. The deal, worth more than Pounds 10m a year, is one of the first of a new generation of contracts intended to take advantage of the next step in the de-regulation of the electricity market next year. The contract represents an estimated 200GWh of electricity a year. It takes effect next April 1, when anyone with demand of more than 100kWh a year can shop around for electricity rather than be tied to the local supplier. Only consumers of 1MWh or more have this freedom now.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Hongkong Bank to argue its case in letter to MPs HONGKONG BANK will shortly open a new front in its bid for control of Midland by writing to members of parliament to argue its case. According to one of its advisers, the bank will keep its message 'fairly simple' and is likely to stage follow-up meetings with MPs 'in due course'. It is expected to argue that the interests of the UK banking sector could best be served by an injection of new blood and the continuing presence of four strong clearers. The struggle for control of Midland is increasingly being conducted in the political arena. A week ago, MPs received a letter from Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank - Hongkong's rival for Midland  - arguing that the foreign bank's offer failed to address 'the fundamental problems in the UK banking sector' and suggesting they contact a 'Helpline' for further information. Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, has already written to the heads of relevant ministries including Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, setting out the bank's case. Meanwhile, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour frontbench spokeswoman on City and corporate affairs, has written to both Mr Purves and Mr Brian Pitman, the Lloyds chief executive, asking about their proposals. She yesterday criticised the role of Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP with close links to Mr Heseltine, in offering advice to Lloyds. This showed why it was 'difficult for politicians to take consultancies'.</p>

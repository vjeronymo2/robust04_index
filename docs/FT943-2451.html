			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Concern over dollar surfaces again - Currencies Markets will this week continue their long running dollar vigil, but this time it will be politics as well as economics occupying their thoughts. The latest round of the US-Japan trade talks, and the Haiti imbroglio, are coming to a head at the same time. Both hold within them the potential to cause a further sell-off in the dollar. Some observers fear that Haiti, in particular, could do for president Clinton what Iran did for Mr Jimmy Carter. Limited progress with Japan ahead of the September 30 deadline for sanctions would also hurt the dollar. There are few important statistics to focus on, though the July trade figures on Tuesday could unsettle the dollar. Friday's strong capacity utilisation figures, however, have only aggravated market fears about inflation, and speculation is sure to rise about the possibility of a further monetary tightening at the September 27 FOMC meeting. One factor favouring the dollar is that the market has shown much less inclination to sell it in recent weeks. The dollar will also draw comfort from the relative weakness of the D-Mark over the past week. Analysts expect investors to continue to lighten their D-Mark holdings ahead of the October 16 national elections. This week the focus will be on Sunday's election in Bavaria. The key concern will be the performance of the Chancellor Kohl's alliance partner, the FDP. If it looks like it might fail to hurdle the 5 per cent barrier to Bundestag representation, further D-Mark sales can be expected. The latest German M3 figure is also due this week. A good outcome could allow for a further, probably final, cut in interest rates. This could cause further D-Mark weakness. Three of the principal beneficiaries of D-Mark weakness last week were sterling, the Italian lira and the Swiss franc. The fortunes of the lira are likely to turn largely on the budget proposals which are expected out soon. So too the Spanish peseta; budget details are expected on Friday. For sterling the outlook is brighter. Not only are the D-Mark and dollar both under pressure, but there is a case that last week's pre-emptive rise in interest rates has changed the pyschology of the market, dramatically improving sterling's prospects. Also in the spotlight will be the Swedish krona following the weekend poll. Markets will be judging whether the new government has adequate resolve to address the country's fiscal problems.</p>

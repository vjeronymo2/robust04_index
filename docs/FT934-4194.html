			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Gardening: Boxing, a noble art that costs the earth - Robin Lane Fox braves chill winds in pursuit of green formality among the designer vegetables. His bank manager is interested, too I have just had a personal boxing day and it has not exactly been cheap. In the cold winds, I have been planting rivers of green box bushes, which are intended to curl round each other and look suitably smart. You all know those handsome pictures in which evergreen hedges make patterns among the designer vegetables and owners can spell out their initials in monograms of green leaves. I have yet to choose my monogram, but I think that we forget what they cost. Box prices now start at Pounds 150 a 100, and the plants for a low hedge are supposed to go in at intervals of six inches or less. The rectangular outline to a moderate bed will cost Pounds 200 unless, like me, you economise on the spacing and exercise your patience. Remember the price tag when next you see a television long shot of somebody's box-edged potager inside an old brick wall. In the 1960s, big gardens were throwing old box away by the yard: people believed it harboured snails and bindweed and required too many hours from full-time gardeners. As a result, artful growers acquired some spectacular assets. They realised that box will recover even if it is old and looking lanky. Old box is supremely willing to regenerate. Indeed, like donkeys, box trees never seem to die unless dogs cock their legs continually against them. If anyone offers you a leggy box hedge, capitalise on their ignorance and take it before they read this column. At today's prices, what would be the value of all the box at Italy's Villa Lante or France's Villandry, historic gardens which sit on unrepeatable assets? Since the 1960s, we have all forgotten the snails and bindweed and have been hurrying to bring box back. For some while, Roy Strong, former supremo of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum who runs his own considerable country garden, has been championing the movement away from flowers and back to axial green formality; a ground note, too, for distinguished designers like David Hicks. I like flowers, because I can grow them - but I also like green frames which look wonderfully neat and obedient soon after planting. If the cost is too much, what can you do? You have two options, unless you have good friends. One is to take cuttings from the young shoots of someone's box plants early in summer; set them in sandy trenches in semi-shade; keep them watered; and transplant them to good soil during the following year. After another three years, you will have good bushes for a new hedge and, although the delay is a nuisance, I do promise that box cuttings will root with remarkable ease. If you are planning a big box venture but find the prices in garden centres ruinous, you should investigate the specialist growers in Belgium or Holland who now raise most of the box which UK nurserymen import and then sell on to us at higher prices. Indeed, if you need a large quantity, take a ferry over to Belgium and do a deal with a specialist, who will supply you by the thousand. Despite the horrible wind from the east, I have enjoyed planting well-rooted boxes of three and four years old. They look stylish from the start and allow you to weave knots, spell messages, or outline a scene in green mosaic. They are probably very healthy. Box, says my handbook of 1620, is very good for the flux, or French disease. In those days, it meant more than high interest rates in Paris. Over the years, I have learned a few box tricks which are not always explained. My favourite use of box is as a green skirt or pedestal for a statue or urn, raised on a hidden plinth of concrete blocks. The green box skirt hides the cheap plinth and heightens the impact of the ornament: the trick stares at you from the best historic gardens in Italy. When the box has covered the plinth, you clip it flat: big pots can emerge from a high skirt, which is clipped into two levels, like a green step. You should use the bigger box, Buxus sempervirens, for these skirts and allow five years for it to mature. You will need more plants than you expect  -but they add value to a flower pot, which can be cheaper in such a bold setting. The correct edging for vegetables and low knots is Buxus suffruticosa. Be warned that its roots will run sideways among flowers and vegetables and should be cut back yearly with a sharp spade or edger to prevent them from exhausting the adjoining soil. You should clip the leaves late in spring or summer rather than late autumn when they look most in need of trimming. Late cutting can cause brown patches, which are exacerbated by snow and wet in hard winters. Old books from the 16th and 17th centuries are still the best source of knot patterns in which box bushes are twisted into the outlines of a tapestry. Rosemary Verey is an experienced box planter who also supplied me with my bushes: her new book, Garden Plans (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 18.99), shows the patterns which she adapted from an old design for the courtyard of Orchard House, the garden of which opens to the public in the scenic Cotswolds village of Broadway. I am sure that she would agree on my cardinal point: before you pirate an old plan for a knot, be sure that you have allowed enough room on the ground. The besetting sin of most modern imitations is that they cram an intricate design into too small a space. They confuse the eye and are not easy to plant; the box develops into a fussy confusion. It is much better to simplify and suit the complexity to the space available. Verey recommends designs from various Jacobean sources, from Gervase Markham in 1616 or the books of a gardening clergyman, William Lawson, which were published in 1617 and 1618. I have also been helped by the geometric drawings in John Parkinson's Paradisus, published in 1629. These old books have mostly been reprinted later and are more readily available from libraries. I do, however, have a final thought for a small courtyard. In the 1960s, designer Russell Page published a self-assured book, The Education of A Gardener, which has a beguiling picture of the Gothic window of a Berkshire cottage, opening out onto beds criss-crossed with frames of green box in the courtyard below. The pattern here picks up a pattern in the window frames, but why not echo them exactly in a frame of green box on a terrace outside the house? Any shape can be framed in a surrounding rectangle, and the result would tie the house and garden together with a pretty style for a small space without grass. Nowadays, philistines try to force those awful plastic replacement windows on the planners by arguing that they are 'friendly to the Amazon rain forests.' Outflank them by planting a green window horizontally on the surface of the garden, made from a truly green material with a style that will outlive us all.</p>

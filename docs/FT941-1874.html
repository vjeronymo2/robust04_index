			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Profits advance 67% at Incentive Restructuring, cost-cutting and a boost from the fall in value of the Swedish krona pushed up results at Incentive, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the Wallenberg family. Profits jumped by 67 per cent to SKr620m (Dollars 78.57m) in 1993 from SKr371m in 1992, excluding associated companies. Group sales, however, were up just 4 per cent at SKr12.27bn from SKr11.77bn due to the weakness of the company's European markets and divestments related to Incentive's move to narrow its focus on engineering. But a smaller rise in costs and a positive effect from the devaluation of the krona worth SKr100m helped produce the sharp improvement in profits. Profits after counting in contributions from associated companies rose to SKr1.85bn from SKr1.27bn. The dividend is raised to SKr7 per share from SKr6 last year. The result underlined an improving trend in the Wallenberg empire after several tough years. Incentive said the prospects for 1994 were 'relatively favourable,' with higher volumes, improved margins and lower costs set to improve earnings. Earlier this month, Investor, the senior of the Wallenberg companies, said it expected rising profits in 1994, following a sharp turnround in the last quarter of 1993. Incentive said a recently-announced decision to sell the glass-making company Orrefors to Incentive's shareholders would complete a programme of restructuring carried out since Incentive was listed in 1991 after emerging from under the wing of Asea, the Swedish half-owner of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group. Charges of around SKr100m were made against 1993 earnings against costs of breaking up the Hagglunds subsidiary, parts of which were sold off. Last year, Incentive also spent around SKr500m last year acquiring MacGregor-Navire, the shipboard cargo handler, from the Finnish group Kone.</p>

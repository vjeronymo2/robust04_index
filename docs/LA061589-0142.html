			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GOODBY' -- AND 'WHAT NEXT?';  </P> <P> AS LAKERS PACK UP, CENTER QUESTION IS LOOSE BAGGAGE  </P> <P> The end of the Lakers as we have known them arrived Wednesday morning when they  gathered at the Forum.  </P> <P> Playoff shares were determined, off-season plans related and, perhaps, the  disappointment of the four consecutive losses to the Detroit Pistons in the  National Basketball Assn. championship series rationalized. Then, before  parting, goodbys were said -- some for the summer, some for good.  </P> <P> Change is unavoidable, now that the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era has ended.  Abdul-Jabbar's retired jersey eventually will be hoisted to the Forum ceiling  alongside those of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain.  </P> <P> The Lakers knew this day eventually would come. But those expecting the Lakers  to swing a major trade or free-agent signing of a premier center probably will  be disappointed.  </P> <P> "It's going to be fun, a new challenge, to see if we can win without Kareem,"  Magic Johnson said. "The driving force for me now is the '90s. It's a whole new  time with a new center. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten for a while, and I'm going  to go for (another title) again."  </P> <P> Coach Pat Riley, assessing the past and contemplating the future, said the  Lakers still could be the team of the early '90s without radical changes. Riley  already has created a theme for next season, "the Question Mark," referring to  what might have happened had Johnson and Byron Scott not been sidelined because  of hamstring injuries during the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to be a leading contender next year," Riley said. "I don't  think we've got to mess with our four (starters). We've got four corners  filled, and now we have to put somebody in the middle.  </P> <P> "The Question Mark will gnaw at me all summer, and it will be lingering next  year."  </P> <P> Who will that somebody in the middle be? Quality centers are in short supply  and they usually come at the expense of several premier players at other  positions. And West, the club's general manager, said the Lakers are a  championship caliber team as is.  </P> <P> "We'll look around a little bit and see what might be our best options," West  said. "We may not be a lot different than we are today.  </P> <P> "We aren't going to be bankrupt at all next year. We think we have a real fine  team right now."  </P> <P> The Lakers will have half of Abdul-Jabbar's 1988-89 salary -- $1.5 million --  available to acquire a replacement. It does not have to be a center -- and it  might not be -- but the Lakers must use the money before this season or lose it  under salary-cap restrictions.  </P> <P> Other questions also lingered: -- What of power forward A.C. Green, the club's  leading rebounder, who will become a restricted free agent?  </P> <P> Green could receive an offer sheet from another team, which the Lakers most  likely would match, or sign for another season with the Lakers at a significant  salary increase and become an unrestricted free agent after next season.  </P> <P> Green, also the Lakers' fourth-leading scorer and arguably their most durable  player, certainly will receive a major raise from the $269,000 he earned this  season.  </P> <P> Figuring to make in excess of $1 million a season, Green also might be the  Laker most likely to be swapped if the club does the unexpected and makes a  blockbuster trade for a center. "Just because you have (big) names, that  doesn't mean you can't explore and see what those names might bring," said  West, declining to talk specifically about players or the club's needs. "But,  again, we plan to do something we hope will help our team and we like the  players we have now."  </P> <P> Wednesday, Green was noncommittal.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get into it yet," he said. "I want to rest some."  </P> <P> Said Riley: "Everybody probably wants A. C. Other teams are probably thinking  that the Lakers might have a problem signing him and want to trade. But I think  we've got to keep him."  </P> <P>  -- The league will hold its expansion draft today, and David Rivers, the  third-string point guard, figures to be selected by either the Orlando Magic or  Minnesota Timberwolves.  </P> <P> Teams can protect only eight players and can lose only one. But since the  Lakers have only eight players under contract -- Johnson, Scott, James Worthy,  Green, Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, Michael Cooper and Rivers -- they must  offer one of them.  </P> <P> With Rivers perhaps headed elsewhere, the Lakers say they will need to select a  quick guard with their first-round pick -- the 24th overall -- in the college  draft June 27.  </P> <P> "A guard is our priority," Riley said. "One who is multi-dimensional."  </P> <P>  -- Perhaps two of the Lakers' three unrestricted free-agent fringe players  will go elsewhere. Tony Campbell, the ninth man in an eight-man rotation, said  he would prefer to play somewhere else rather than spend another season on the  bench. Jeff Lamp has considered a return to pro ball in Italy, but Mark  McNamara probably will be re-signed because the Lakers' need for a third-string  center appears even greater now.  </P> <P> The center question figures to linger all summer, or at least until the Lakers'  use the $1.5 million to sign someone.  </P> <P> Prospective replacements have been speculated upon for months: Sam Bowie or  Ralph Sampson through trade or Denver's Wayne Cooper through free agency.  However, West has indicated that it might not be a center. Or, if it is, it  probably will be a big body, not a big name.  </P> <P> Should trade opportunities arise, the Lakers will have to dip into a core group  that enabled the Lakers to win consecutive NBA titles and advance to the finals  this season. Teams would be asking for Scott and Green and perhaps Michael  Cooper, but the Lakers seem hesitant to break up what is left of the designated  team of the decade.  </P> <P> Of acquiring a big-name center, West said: "That just can't happen anymore.  There are too many teams.  </P> <P> "What is the biggest premium in the league today? Centers. There aren't enough  around, and that's why I think you've seen teams go to a different style of  basketball. A lot more passing-game kind of things."  </P> <P> Thompson performed capably as Abdul-Jabbar's backup, performing as a reserve in  name only. He averaged more playing time and rebounds than Abdul-Jabbar, and  nearly as many points.  </P> <P> "This team has slowly been undergoing a metamorphosis, and I think Pat himself  has alluded to that," West said. "By the nature of the scoring from our team  today, there is a different look than there was a few years ago.  </P> <P> "I think you'll see this team play similar to the way we have played, maybe a  different look offensively a bit. But that's the coach's decision. I want to  help Pat get the players to implement the way he wants to play."  </P> <P> Said Riley: "You can't get a great, great center. You can't trade for anybody  these days. But if we can find someone who can play defense and get some  rebounds and maybe a few blocked shots, that's all we need. We've got four or  five key players that will go into the '90s, and Jerry will fit the rest of the  pieces together."  </P> <P> Riley said the players acquired for next season will have to fit into the Laker  way of basketball, because he doesn't foresee a drastic change of style.  </P> <P> "We've been a power post-up team for 10 years, so some of the players we get  have to have skills that complement that," Riley said. "With Mychal Thompson  (at center), we're more than competent. We're not as big, but maybe if we can  find (a center) to help him out, we'll be all right."  </P> <P> Johnson said his adjustment will not be drastic, since the Lakers have not  emphasized the center in their offense for about three seasons.  </P> <P> "You don't need a premium center to win, as long as you got other guys coming  off the bench," he said. "The offense doesn't have to revolve around the  center, as we learned with (Detroit's Bill) Laimbeer.  </P> <P> "Our nucleus is still here -- myself, Byron and James. We've done most of the  scoring the last couple of years. You got to make changes just to keep getting  better. I'm not saying by trades, but by draft choices and free agents."  </P> <P> Worthy, the Lakers' leading playoff scorer with a 24.8 average, predicted that  the Lakers no longer will dominate the league but still will be contenders.  </P> <P> "Now, it'll be real competitive," Worthy said. "We'll be almost equal now with  the rest of the West. We can't take anything for granted. We'll have to fight  to win.  </P> <P> "I'm sure we'll have to be more aggressive, more physical, change our style a  little bit that way."  </P> <P> Become bad boys, perhaps?  </P> <P> "No," Worthy said. "Bad men."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> For finishing second, the Lakers will divide $486,875 in bonuses among 12  players and trainer Gary Vitti, and another share will be split among other  team personnel. Each share will be worth $33,776. The Pistons will divide  $691,875. . . . Vitti said that Magic Johnson and Byron Scott will continue  treatment on their hamstring injuries. Johnson, however, ruled himself out of  Larry Bird's charity all-star game in French Lick, Ind., later this month. . .  . Johnson said that not playing in the finals was the most difficult thing he  has had to deal with in his life. "But I'm not going to be what-iffing all  summer," he said.  </P></p>

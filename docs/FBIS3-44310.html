In his annual New Year address, the director of the New  China  News Agency [XINHUA], Zhou Nan, is calling on Hong Kong people  to unite with China to ensure the prosperity and stability of  the territory. He says the end of Sino-British cooperation does  not mean the end of one country, two systems. Linda Li reports:    [Begin recording] [Li] In his New Year address, Zhou Nan  displayed confidence and hope that both China and Hong Kong can  work together to maintain the stability and prosperity of the  territory. He says the fates of China and Hong Kong are closely  linked, so if China prospers, so will Hong Kong. Zhou says  hopes for Sino-British cooperation are dashed. But he promises  it will not pose a problem for Hong Kong.    [Zhou Nan, in Mandarin] We hope that there is cooperation.  However, it takes both sides to cooperate. If one side does not  really want it, well, that does not mean that we cannot carry on  or we will not pursue one country, two systems. No, we  certainly will pursue it.</p>

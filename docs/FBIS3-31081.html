			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 9 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Federal  Government on Wednesday criticized tactless and exaggerated  assertions by special rapporteur of the U.N. Human Rights  Commission Tadeusz Mazowiecki, in his latest report, that more  than 3,000 Moslems had fled the Raska area, the southwestern  part of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.    Addressing the participants in the 50th session of the U.N.  Human Rights Commission in Geneva from January 31 to March 11,  the Yugoslav Government underscored that many Moslems in the  Raska area had been fighting in the war in the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The most murderous Bosnian Moslem units are those in which  the "Sandzak" Moslems i.e. Moslems from Raska (Sandzak being the  Turkish name for this area) are fighting for the interests of  Bosnian Moslem hardline leader Alija Izetbegovic, the Yugoslav  Governement stressed.    In Raska, an area consisting of eight communes -- two of  them  being in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia and six in the Yugoslav  Republic of Montenegro -- Moslems account for one half of the  population and Serbs and Montenegrins for the other half.    Moslems constitute the majority population only in three  communes.    Raska borders with the Bosnian Serb Republic (S.R.) against  which Bosnian Moslems are undertaking offensive actions with a  view to seizing the S.R., joining Sandzak and thus creating a  large Islamic state in Europe.    Last week a trial of a large separatist group who had made  an  attempt to detach Raska from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  commenced in Novi Pazar, the largest town in this area.    The Yugoslav Federal Government pointed out that a large  number of Moslems, as well as Serbs, had left Raska for economic  reasons and gone to live abroad or in other, more developed  parts of Yugoslavia.    The government stated that "only a minority of population  has  left the Raska area because of the disturbed national  relations", resulting from the "extremely aggressive Moslem  fundamentalism," and the immediate vicinity of the brutal war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Yugoslav investigating officers have done their best to  shed light on the kidnapping of the Moslems from Sjeverin and  Strbac, places in Raska, but they have been unsuccessful so far  since "a major part of investigation has to be carried out on  the foreign territory, over which the investigating officers  from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have no jurisdiction,"  the Yugoslav Government pointed out.    Several Moslems from Sjeverin were kidnapped in a bus taking  them to their work over the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  their compatriots from Strbac were kidnapped in a train passing  also through part of the territory of this neighbouring  republic, in February 1993.</p>

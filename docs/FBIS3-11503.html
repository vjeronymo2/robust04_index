			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Rio Group, which is an association of Latin  American countries, today concludes a preparatory meeting for  the Rio Group presidential summit next September. The group is  mainly discussing the social-economic development in the region,  as explained by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim.    [Begin Amorim recording] The subjects are democracy, human  rights, sustained development, and science and technology. This  meeting obviously cannot exhaust all subjects, because it is  merely the preparation for a process that will conclude with a  presidential summit in September. Beside economic and social  development, as well as poverty -- which are essential subjects  -- I believe we will also discuss the possibility of a consensus  on the hemispheric conference. [end recording]    The election of the next OAS secretary general is another  subject to be discussed in this Rio Group meeting.</p>

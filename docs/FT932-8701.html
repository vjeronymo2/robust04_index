			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ulster acquires prosperity without economic strength - Why the 'green shoots' are growing so vigorously in the province FEW British politicians would ever be desperate or brazen enough to point to Northern Ireland as proof that the nation's economic policy is working as planned. But with local elections there later this week and the government trying to put its by-election and local election defeats behind it, the point could well be made in the days ahead. Not only has the province weathered the 1990s economic recession better than any other region of the UK, but those elusive green shoots of recovery are also appearing there in more profusion and with greater vigour than anywhere on the mainland. The latest batch of economic data and forecasts indicate that not only is unemployment falling steadily in Northern Ireland, but according to the London economic consultancy Business Strategies, 'in 1993 every sector of the province's economy is set to outperform the UK'. Any attempt to extrapolate this cheery outlook to the mainland economy must, however, take account of two crucial factors that have helped cushion the severity of this recession in Northern Ireland, and are influencing its recovery. According to Mr Graham Gudgin, director of the Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre, 'unlike the recession in the early 1980s, which was driven by a high exchange rate, this recession has been driven by high interest rates and mortgage debt'. House prices and mortgage debt are much lower in Northern Ireland than in the UK generally, so disposable incomes have been less severely hit, and neither has there been the 'negative equity' problem which is continuing to hold back consumer spending on the mainland. The second factor has been the role played by public-sector spending in the province. Forty per cent of the workforce in Northern Ireland is employed in the public sector, including the security forces, compared to 20 per cent nationally. The higher unemployment levels and higher dependency ratios in Northern Ireland have created the need for a relatively larger Civil Service in the province to deal with the greater demands placed on it for social welfare, education and health services. This is also reflected in the fact that Northern Ireland is a net receiver of Exchequer funds to the tune of Pounds 3.5bn, and is perhaps a warning to anyone wishing to draw a lesson from Northern Ireland's economic performance. As Mr Gudgin said: 'Northern Ireland has done well through the recession, but not for having an inherently stronger economy than other parts of the UK.' Mr Michael Smyth of the department of Applied Economics at the University of Ulster says: 'Northern Ireland has the highest regional population of two-income families, partly due to the large public sector here. So the drop in consumer demand during the recession has been nothing like as severe as on the mainland.' To underline this point, he called up a graph on his computer screen showing how bank lending has continued to grow steadily throughout the recession. 'The latest figures on hire-purchase credit also show that we have definitely turned the corner,' he said. There had been a particularly strong upturn in credit for car purchases during the first quarter of 1993. He was cautious on the longer-term prospects. 'The economy here is demand-driven by public spending and by demand from the mainland. Any real growth will be determined by GB demand and therefore will depend upon recovery there.' Weaker competitiveness will also act as a brake. According to Mr Gudgin: 'One question for Northern Ireland is whether productivity is now out of line with the rest of the UK due to the lower level of redundancies here. There could be a period of very slow growth in employment as the rest of the country recovers.' This view is echoed by Mr David Hitchens of the economics department at Queen's University in Belfast, who specialises in long-range forecasting. 'Competitiveness here is poor compared to Great Britain and the republic (of Ireland), and the basic weaknesses of the economy are likely to remain into the foreseeable future,' he says. Lower levels of management skills and higher levels of long-term unemployment, also due to a shortage of shop-floor skills, are widely considered to be behind lower productivity in the province and which have only recently begun to be addressed by the Northern Ireland Office with additional funds for training. Mr Gudgin points out that of the province's 105,000 unemployed - 14.1 per cent of the workforce - '40 per cent have been without work for more than four years'. The promising signals of recovery in Northern Ireland, recorded in the statistics and surveys of business confidence, thus tell only part of the story. Anyone wishing to draw comfort from them can have little cause for complacency.</p>

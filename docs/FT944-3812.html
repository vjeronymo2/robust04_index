			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Russia sends troops into Chechnya: Forces close in on Grozny  -Yeltsin claims need to 'protect' civilians / Protests in Moscow Russian troops and armour were sent into the republic of Chechnya yesterday in a move which President Boris Yeltsin claimed was intended to 'protect' civilians and restore order in the self-declared independent state. Liberal politicians in Moscow greeted the intervention with horror, warning that it heralded a lurch into authoritarian rule in Russia. In the Chechen capital of Grozny, about 1,500km south-east of Moscow, President Dzhokar Dudayev said the move would throw a 'bloody blanket' across the north Caucasian region. The attack, launched early yesterday morning, came from three directions - the eastern republic of Dagestan, the north western military base of Mozdok and Vladikavkaz to the west. Reporters in the Mozdok area counted two columns of 200 tanks. The Russian forces were late last night reported to be about 10 miles from Grozny. In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin said the troops had been ordered not to use force, but to 'protect' the civilian population. Jet aircraft streaked over the capital last night, and gun fire could be heard on the outskirts of the city as panicking civilians fled. Russian television said up to 40,000 troops had moved in. Two brief clashes were reported, with local reports of up to four people dead and more than 10 wounded. Chechen information minister Movladi Udugov last night claimed 40 Russian troops and six armoured personnel carriers had been captured on Chechnya's eastern border. US president Bill Clinton said Washington was concerned by the developments in Chechnya. But he added: 'It is an internal Russian affair and we hope that order can be restored with a minimum amount of violence and bloodshed.' Moscow has long condemned the Chechen government as a criminal regime and says Mr Dudayev's fighters are gangsters and terrorists. Mr Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, declared Chechnya independent in 1991. Moscow does not recognise the claim. The Yeltsin government sees the Chechen state as a threat to Russia's territorial integrity. It fears the Chechens could encourage other dissident ethnic groups to declare independence. A special commission under Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, was reported to be working on a plan for reforms in Chechnya. Delegations from Russia and Chechnya were due to meet today for scheduled talks in Vladikavkaz, in the neighbouring region of Ingushetia. Mr Yeltsin was quoted by the Tass official news agency as saying: 'A threat of full-scale civil war (in Chechnya) carries a threat to talks, to the free expression of the will of the Chechen people. We should avert a breakdown in talks.' Last night, Mr Taimaz Abubakarov, the Chechen finance minister, said in Grozny: 'The president (Dudayev) has told me - go there and talk. There will be talks. The Chechen government has never denied and does not deny now that this problem can be resolved peacefully.' However, Mr Abubakarov said he would not talk with leaders of the Chechen opposition, who launched a strike against Grozny two weeks ago. Russia insists that talks include the opposition. Leading liberal politicians in Moscow, including Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the largest liberal group, Russia's Choice, called a rally yesterday in Pushkin Square in protest at the invasion.

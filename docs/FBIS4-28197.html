			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore says U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor's statement that the republic has not contacted the  United States about hosting the first ministerial conference of  the World Trade Organization [WTO] is incorrect. A Foreign  Ministry spokesman said Singapore's permanent representative to  the UN [in Geneva], Mr. Kesavapany, had informed all GATT  contracting parties, including the U.S. The Singapore Embassy  in Washington had also taken up the matter with a senior  American trade official.    According to REUTERS news agency, Mr. Kantor has again  objected to Singapore's hosting the WTO meeting. Mr. Kantor  first raised his objection last month although U.S. officials  said he was expressing his personal views.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman also said REUTERS' assertion  that Singapore [words indistinct] the entire bill which is a  departure from conference protocols was also incorrect. It is a  normal practice for the host country to meet all the  organizational expenses plus additional costs incurred by the  GATT Secretariat for meetings outside its premises in Geneva.  The recent GATT ministerial meeting in Marrakesh, the Uruguay  Round conference in Uruguay, and other GATT meetings in  Brussels, Belgium and Canada have all followed this practice.</p>

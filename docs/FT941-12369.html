			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Barclays chief to be paid Pounds 737,500 Mr Martin Taylor, the new chief executive of Barclays, the largest high street bank, is to be paid at least Pounds 737,500 this year including a bonus of Pounds 150,000, the bank disclosed yesterday, John Gapper writes. Mr Taylor, 41, a former Financial Times journalist who was recruited by Barclays from Courtaulds Textiles, of which he was chairman, will be among the highest paid UK bank directors as a result of the two-year contract which started this month. Mr Taylor's contract will give him a basic salary of Pounds 500,000 for each of the two years. In the second year he will receive a bonus determined by Barclays' normal directors' bonus formula, and he will revert to a one-year rolling contract in 1996. In addition to the basic salary and the Pounds 500,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, Mr Taylor will receive contributions to two pension schemes totalling Pounds 87,500.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent gets support from firmer bond prices FIRMER bond markets in the D-Mark bloc supported some bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT met profit-taking as the DAX index tested 1,700. It reached an intraday high of 1,698.14 but closed more soberly at 1,685.29, up 8.12, after a gain of 10.14 to 687.20 for the FAZ at midsession. Volume climbed from DM6.5bn to DM9.5bn. In the early going the stock market was supported by firmer prices in the German bond market, where the Bundesbank's average bond yield dropped another 8 basis points to 8.03 per cent. Banks saw the benefit, Commerzbank rising DM3.50 to DM261 and Dresdner by DM5.50 to DM354. There was no outcome, during the session or in the post-bourse, to the pay talks between the steel industry and its employees. The sector weakened after its recent gains, Klockner-Werke dropping DM3 to DM116; other sectors on the move included retailers on the downgrade, and constructions improving with Bilfinger &amp; Berger DM20 higher at DM970. PARIS came off the day's high but still closed firmer as dealers started to square positions ahead of the liquidation of the January account tomorrow. The CAC 40 index went as high as 1,878.27 before closing at 1,867.91, up 2.06, in turnover estimated between FFr2.6-2.7bn after Monday's FFr2.7bn. BSN dropped FFr45 or 3.9 per cent to FFr1,109 with 229,960 shares traded, as the market took the view that a bid from the Agnelli family was unlikely before the Cob made a decision on the recent sale of Perrier treasury stock to Saint Louis, an Agnelli ally. Thomson-CSF lost FFr6 or 3.8 per cent to FFr150.50 with 223,100 shares traded on reports that the government was considering merging the company with Aerospatiale, the state-owned aircraft group. Analysts said the Airbus crash on Monday night also weighed on Thomson, which is partially responsible for the avionics in the aircraft. MILAN fell for the second day as investors started an uneasy vigil for Fiat's 1991 operating profit details. The letter to shareholders had been expected today, but analysts said its release had been delayed until January 28. The Comit index, which failed to break through 550 during the recent rally, lost 6.29 to 539.96 in provisional turnover of L120bn after Monday's L103.5bn. Among industrials, Fiat fell L164 to L5,175 and lost another L15 in after-hours trading. Pirelli dropped L42 or 3.4 per cent to L1,180 following Monday's marathon extraordinary meeting during which shareholders accused the management of mismanagement and withholding information in a failed bid for Germany's Continental. However, the L518.6bn capital increase was approved. ZURICH mirrored Frankfurt with a firmer bond market. The all-share SPI index added 5.1 to 1,110.4 after peaking earlier at 1,113.6. Saurer, the textile machinery and metallurgy group, climbed SFr200 to SFr1,850 ahead of a press conference tomorrow. EMS-Chemie bearers added SFr80 to SFr5,050 after the company said that it planned to split its registered and bearer shares to reduce the weight of the share prices. AMSTERDAM, inspired by a firm bond market and new year investment from abroad, closed almost one per cent firmer. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 1.3 at 121.1. Philips, the electronics group, was 70 cents firmer at Fl 32.90 while the food group CSM was also in demand, rising 50 cents to Fl 89.00. MADRID ended flat in moderate trading, despite a strong opening, with the general index down 0.02 at 252.62. Turnover rose to Pta18.5bn from Pta15bn. Repsol closed Pta30 higher at Pta2,825 with a large block order boosting volume. Some utility issues showed strong gains: Catalana de Gas put on Pta110 to Pta5,970 while Fecsa advanced Pta9 to Pta713. Insurers Mapfre lost Pta85 to Pta4,805, and Union Fenix fell Pta95 to Pta4,555. STOCKHOLM fell in active trade as an overnight decline on Wall Street triggered profit-taking after four days of gains. The Affarsvarlden General Index closed down 11.0 at 978.2. Volume remained heavy at SKr498m. The insurance sector fell 2.2 per cent and forestry, a strong performer in the past three sessions, slipped 2.0 per cent. OSLO lost 1.4 per cent on profit-taking, the all-share index closing 6.50 lower at 454.17 in active turnover of NKr341m. Oils and oils-associated stocks went both ways, as Norsk Hydro fell NKr3 to NKr158 while Saga Petroleum free shares ended NKr3 higher at NKr99. BRUSSELS focused on Gechem and firm Acec-UM as it closed 1.7 per cent higher on the first day of the new forward account. The Bel-20 index closed up 19.88 at 1,181.69 in high turnover of BFr1.22bn.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Jan 21  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1143.13  1142.38  1142.50  1141.06  1139.95  1138.17  1137.08  1136.99  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1143.13        Day's Low  1135.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Jan 20     Jan 17     Jan 16     Jan 15     Jan 14 1135.91    1135.24    1131.02    1140.52    1112.87  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

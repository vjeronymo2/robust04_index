			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Coast Guard issued ballast water control regulations on April 8, 1993, for vessels entering the Great Lakes after operating beyond the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Such vessels are required to exchange their ballast water beyond the EEZ. While the regulations are viewed as an excellent start toward addressing the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species introduction problem, Congress now realizes that it is necessary to implement ballast water controls for vessels entering the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ. The Hudson River is connected to the Great Lakes through the New York State Barge Canal System which allows for the movement of commercial and recreational vessels throughout waterways of New York State and provides direct access to the Great Lakes. As a result of this connection, species released from vessel's ballast water into the Hudson River can migrate, or can be transferred by vessels navigating the canal system into the Great Lakes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Solutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Congress has noted that high seas ballast exchange is ``not a panacea'' for prevention of unintentional introductions of nonindigenous aquatic species. Other means of infestation such as attachment to anchor chains and vessel hulls contribute to infiltration. Moreover, the effects of ballast water exchange on high seas and coastal ecosystems are not yet completely known. Nevertheless, ballast water exchange currently appears to be the most cost and labor effective means of reducing the probability of new infestations. Alternative approaches may be warranted in some situations, or may replace ballast exchange entirely, depending upon knowledge obtained through a Task Force set up by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> International Recognition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The need for control of the introduction of nonindigenous species has also been recognized by the international maritime community. The ballast water control regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes that were issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, in large part, were based on ballast water control guidelines adopted by The Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization at its 31st session in July 1991. The resolution (MEPC 50(31)) which accompanied the issuance of the guidelines recommends that member countries issue guidelines for the control of nonindigenous species into their ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> United States Legislation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> On November 4, 1993, Congress amended (Pub. L. 102&hyph;587) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 4711(b)). This amendment extends the Act's applicability to vessels entering the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The Act, as amended, attempts to prevent the spread of injurious nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes through the ballast water of these vessels. The Act mandates that the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Task Force created by the Act, issue regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels entering a U.S. port, north of the George Washington Bridge, on the Hudson River, after operating beyond the EEZ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current regulations contained in 33 CFR part 151, subpart C, issued under the Act, cover vessels entering the Great Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ and require the retention of ballast water or the exchange of ballast water beyond the EEZ, by vessels subject to the Act. Further, as authorized under the Act, those regulations permit the use of environmentally sound alternative ballast water management methods that the Coast Guard determines are as effective as ballast water exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species, thereby providing the needed flexibility to approve additional ballast water management methods that, in the future, may prove to be even more effective than ballast water exchange. These requirements, as well as the other requirements contained in subpart C of part 151, would satisfy the requirements of the amendments to the Act if applied to vessels navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. Therefore, few changes to the regulations issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, covering vessels entering a U.S. port on the Great Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ, are required to implement the requirements of the amendments to the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

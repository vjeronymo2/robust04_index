			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Cash without tears, across EC frontiers: Improving the system of European cross-border money transfers Sending money across the European Community is an experience calculated to remind consumers that they still live in a patchwork of national economies and banking systems rather than a truly integrated market. While cash machines and credit cards have made it possible to obtain cash in seconds virtually anywhere in the EC, sending money is a different matter. Most methods are liable to take days and are only available at a charge of anything from Pounds 5m to Pounds 30. The contrast with the cheap, rapid, and reliable money transmission services which the domestic banking systems of most European countries now offer consumers is glaring. In the summer of 1990, the European Commission flung down the gauntlet in front of the banks and published a preliminary discussion document about ways of providing cheaper and more efficient cross-border money transfers. A refined version of that document should be published on Wednesday, the fruit of several months' research by two Commission working groups. The Commission stresses that this is not a 'bank-bashing exercise'. Indeed, directors of retail banks and national central banks are well represented on the working groups. But officials expect resistance from the banking community, which they may decide to combat with a more forceful approach, perhaps by imposing legislation and investigating possible excessive charges. The impetus for improving the system comes from the imminent arrival of the single market. 'There's not much point in telling people they can sell and buy across borders if it takes a week to get their mon-ey,' says one Brussels official. The Commission estimates that some 200m separate cross-border transactions of less than Ecu2,500 (Pounds 1,777) are made annually, a figure bound to increase when EC trade barriers come down on January 1 1993. The fee for each payment varies between Ecu7 and Ecu40 (Pounds 28.44) depending on the urgency of the transfer, and whether the sender wants to pay the receiving bank's fees. According to the Commission's conservative estimates, that means it costs the client about 20 times more to make a payment across EC borders than it does to make a similar domestic transfer. But reliable statistics on volume, costs and fees are hard to obtain. To an extent, the Commission has had to fall back on anecdotal evidence. 'We hear a sufficient number of stories about serious people taking thousands of pounds or francs in notes across frontiers (to avoid transfer fees) to suggest there is a certain volume of demand which is not being fulfilled,' says one official. According to the Commission, many small businesses, both buyers and sellers, abandon attempts to trade across borders rather than have their margins eroded by banking fees. The smaller the transaction, the worse the problem: among the most vociferous critics of the current situation are specialist publishers, used to sending one or two books to other EC clients who incur transfer fees out of proportion to their small bills. The banks argue that harmonisation of systems should wait until the EC introduces a single currency towards the end of the decade, eliminating the need for the costly clearing of foreign currency. But Commission officials are sceptical about this argument. They point out that banks in Belgium and Luxembourg still charge each others' clients as though they are making cross-border payments, even though the two countries have enjoyed the benefits of currency union for some 70 years. In any case, they believe currency exchange and telephone charges make up a much smaller proportion of the fee to the customer than the administrative commission charged by the sender's bank and the correspondent branch. The Commission's ideal solution would be to link the automated clearing houses (ACH) - the inter-bank cheque-processing centres - in each EC country, and turn them into a single system. But there are obstacles. The cost is high, the technological difficulties daunting and inter-bank clearing arrangements vary. Mr Bert Morris, chief executive, support services, at National Westminster and chairman of BACS, the British inter-bank automated bulk clearing system, says: 'You have to bear in mind that not everyone in Europe wants ACH linkages; the French and Germans in particular are wary of this approach. We may well end up with a basket of measures to meet different needs.' If the banks cannot provide a system of easy cross-border transfers, several other financial institutions are eager to do so. Both Visa International, which operates a wide variety of clearing and payment systems as well as its credit cards, and American Express, have put forward proposals to the Commission. 'We are talking about a cross-border money transfer market which is probably larger than the European travellers' cheque market which is around Pounds 20bn,' says Mr Patrick Bowden, assistant general manager at Visa's European headquarters in London. Visa envisages building a network with banks from France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK and Scandinavia which would enable sums of money to be sent through the Visa system, with price and delivery times guaranteed in advance. The principal American Express offering appears to be the Moneygram. This system telegrams money across borders within minutes, but it is fairly expensive - a money order costs a minimum of Dollars 35. Distribution outlets could be broadened to include, for example, post offices. One snag for both Visa and American Express is that the large banks in some European countries, particularly Germany, view them as American interlopers and are deeply suspicious of them. Not that the banks are unaware of the cross-border payment market. Some already offer limited services aimed at customers who need to make or receive regular payments across frontiers: pensioners or migrant workers. Other banks have combined into groups to offer their customers branch services in other EC countries. One such system is IBOS, established by Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander in Spain, Banco de Comercio y Industria of Portugal and Credit &amp; Commerce de France. Another has been set up by Lloyds Bank working with Credit Agricole in France, Banco Ambrosiano Veneto in Italy, Bayerische Vereinsbank in Germany, Rabobank Nederland in the Netherlands, and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya in Spain. The Commission has welcomed such initiatives, but it is convinced of the need for a basic 'safety net' standard, which all customers could rely on without having to bank with a particular group or own a certain credit card. The Commission's document will make recommendations, including: A 'consumer's charter' to ensure that consumers know their rights. When making a cross-border payment the client should be told how it is done, much it costs, and how long it will take. In addition, the sender should pay all the fees, including those of the correspondent bank; A right of redress through a national banking regulator if there are problems; Improvement of cross-border links between national domestic clearing systems. Some southern member states may need grants to improve their domestic payment systems - perhaps from EC funds set aside for improving trans-European networks; A minimum threshold - probably Ecu10,000 per transaction - below which national authorities will be unable to insist on cross-border transfers being notified to central banks, a practice which adds to costs in countries such as Portugal and Greece. According to one Brussels official, the carrots for improving the system are the commercial advantage of being first into the growing market, and the promise of central funding. The stick is the threat of legislation. If legislation proves necessary, the Commission - wary of interfering in commercial policy decisions - will not force the banks to build an expensive infrastructure. Instead, Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for competition and financial services, would probably lay down certain firm legislative criteria, applying the same consumer standards to cross-border payments as to domestic banking. So far, Brussels has been generally impressed by the banks' response to its gentle pressure. But if the same groups fail to improve their performance, the indications are that bank-bashing will begin in earnest.</p>

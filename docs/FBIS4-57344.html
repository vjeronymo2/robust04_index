			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has ruled out the  possibility of the government converting the real in dollars or  in other currencies. He declined, however, to make comments on  the exchange rate.    The minister said savings accounts will not be modified, and  that they will continue to be adjusted by the TR [Reference  Interest Rate]. He did not identify, however, the factors that  will be taken into account for calculating the TR.    Ricupero announced that this week he will set the rules for  conversion of school monthly fees into real value units.</p>

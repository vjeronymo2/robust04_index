A Grant Bagratyan news conference was scheduled to  coincide with this minor anniversary. [Video shows Grant  Bagratyan at news conference] The head of the cabinet took  almost an hour and a half to report on work of the cabinet,  during which it became clear that in spite of the difficult  situation in 1993, the harsh blockade by both Azerbaijan and  Georgia, and the energy crisis, the parameters of national  income from industry and agriculture -- even when taking into  consideration the decline from the previous year -- can be  considered an accomplishment. Evidently, the fact that prices  increased 110-fold while salaries increased by a factor of 3.5  times can also be considered an accomplishment. Living  standards decreased by 55 percent. However, this situation  undoubtedly has objective reasons: a general crisis in all  spheres, military spending, and conversion to a national  currency.    Inflation was somewhat slowed and [word indistinct] was  somewhat stabilized at the juncture of 1993 and 1994. In a  word, we are much better off than we could have been. By the  way, Bagratyan held his news conference after his meeting with  the Russian prime minister. [Video shows interview with Grant  Bagratyan]    [Begin recording] [Bagratyan] The worsening of the situation  in Armenia causes a worsening in Russia also, even if on a  smaller scale. Each country is dealing with its own problem,  but at the same time they are already trying to take notice of  each other. This situation will continue for a year or a year  and a half. After that, the recreation of the ruble zone will  be the task which would, I would say, allow for larger  integration. The question facing us now is not integration, but  prevention of disintegration. [end recording]</p>

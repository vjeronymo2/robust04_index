			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of a statement by National Security Minister Neriman </F> Imranov in Baku on 10 May -- recorded]    [Text] We all know the work President Geydar Aliyev has  carried out during the past few months to find a peaceful  solution to the Karabakh dispute. He has told the world that he  is prepared to work to have the Karabakh dispute peacefully  resolved, providing the Armenians agree to withdraw from  Azerbaijan's occupied territories, the peaceful people are  allowed to return to their property, the state border between  Azerbaijan and Armenia is reinstated, and Karabakh's  administrative, political, and economic status is outlined.    But the Armenian occupiers, who pretend to support peace, do  not intend to withdraw from Azerbaijan's territory. Instead,  they want to intensify and broaden the war. They want to occupy  more territory in Azerbaijan.    The Armenian leaders' adventuring initiative during the past  few days is disgusting. The ruling circles in Armenia and the  political parties that support them have decided to establish  Armenian cities and towns in Azerbaijan's occupied territories,  including Kelbadzharskiy, Kubatlinskiy, and other rayons, by  transferring Armenian families from Armenia and several CIS  countries to settle in them.    How do the Armenian ruling circles plan to achieve that? As  the first step, they have allocated land to the families they  have already transferred to the rayons. They have given them  long-term and interest-free credits and exempted their sons who  reach conscription age from military service. They have also  met the travel expenses of the Armenians who arrive to settle in  Azerbaijan's rayons and taken measures to educate their sons in  Armenia and several countries in Europe.    All that is a part of a planned adventurist policy to seize  Azerbaijan's territory. Azerbaijan's people must know that  policy's intentions and objectives. Azerbaijan's president,  leaders, and people will not allow them to achieve their goals.  The Armenian occupiers' policy is a defiance of the entire  world. Considering that, Azerbaijan's people, regardless of  their nationality, religion, and social standing, and regardless  of which political party they support, must rally around the  Republic's president and wage a united struggle against the  occupiers. That is what is required.</p>

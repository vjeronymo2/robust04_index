			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / German unions 'favour wage limits in east' MS Birgit Breuel, president of the German Treuhand privatisation agency, said yesterday that trade unions now favoured wage restraint in east Germany to boost faltering economic growth there. 'If you talk to trade unions, they know there will have to be changes,' she said in London, where she is presenting the agency's borrowing plans to banks and investors. Ms Breuel stressed she did not want to interfere in wage negotiations between employers and workers but added that trade unionists could now 'easily see that, the higher the wage rises, the more you will lose jobs'. Lower wage increases in the east would involve shelving plans to achieve east and west German wage equality in key industry sectors by 1994. This proposal has, however, been submitted under plans for a 'solidarity pact' which Chancellor Helmut Kohl is negotiating in an attempt to remedy Germany's growing economic difficulties. High wage rises in east Germany since monetary union in July 1990 have been blamed for exacerbating unemployment east of the Elbe. This in turn has increased the need for substantial financial transfers, now running at a net DM150bn (Pounds 53.7bn) a year - which is the main factor behind high German interest rates. Concerning the agency's borrowing plans, Mr Paul Hadrys, Treuhand's chief financial officer, said it planned DM100bn-DM130bn in capital market borrowing over the next few years. Terms for a first bond issue of between DM8bn and DM10bn will be set next week. Mr Hadrys said the international bond market would provide 'the main pipeline' through which the Treuhand would conduct its overall borrowing programme. Ms Breuel said the 3,800 or so companies still in the Treuhand's portfolio were suffering from falling export orders from the former Soviet Union. But this gave them a greater incentive to adjust efficiency to meet standards required on western markets. 'This can be brutal - but there is no alternative.' She defended the agency against charges that it had shown complicity with former members of the East German Communist party, who have allegedly profited from some sell-off schemes. She said the Treuhand was under fire from critics suggesting that it employed too many ex-communists and those complaining its operations were virtually run by west Germans. 'It's very difficult to steer a middle course.' Earlier this summer Mr Wolfram Krause, the last east German on the agency's board of directors, left the Treuhand. This followed controversy over his former links with the Stasi, the East German secret police. Critics have charged that Mr Krause left because of an internal power struggle. But Ms Breuel said the former director departed of his own volition after publicity about his contacts under the communist regime. 'He said he could no longer stand being in the newspapers every day.' The Treuhand had dismissed 500 managers in companies under its wing, and 25 of its own employees, after discovering they previously worked for the secret police. Cases of alleged 'Stasi connections' were always extensively discussed with individuals before action was taken, Ms Breuel said.</p>

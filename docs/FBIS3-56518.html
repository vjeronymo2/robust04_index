"When we get the timetable, we can say whether we agree to  it  or not," he said. "But, it shouldn't affect the final deadline  of troop pullout, which we are in principle prepared to accept."    The head of the Estonian delegation noted that Estonia's  chief requirement is that Russian combat units should leave  Tallinn.    The next round of Estonian-Russian negotiations was  scheduled  to begin tomorrow near Moscow, but it was postponed due to  Russia's top negotiator Vasili Svirin's sickness. Reinart said  the new date will be set within a week.    Reinart affirmed that his appointment as head of the  Estonian  delegation is not going to change the delegation's work.    "The general direction of the talks is anyway set by the  foreign minister, and we work closely together with (Estonian  Foreign Minister) Juri Luik," Reinart told BNS.    Reinart was appointed head of the Estonian delegation last  week. He succeeded former Defense Minister Juri Luik, who was  appointed Foreign Minister.</p>

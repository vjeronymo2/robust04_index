			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Lamont may stir Tory Euro-fears TORY tensions over Europe may be highlighted at the party conference next month with a speech at a fringe meeting by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. He will speak about Europe at a conference event organised by the Conservative Political Centre. His reputation as a closet Euro-sceptic will ensure that his words are carefully scrutinised for the slightest hint of deviation from the government line. He has not yet had to make statements expressing loyalty to the government's position on Europe. The Tory leadership yesterday continued its efforts to keep as much as possible of the party united on Europe. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, emphasised the need for European Community governments to heed public opinion. In a speech in London to MEPs of the European People's Party, the centre-right group, Sir Norman said people wanted 'a Europe which accords with their interests and does not trample over their traditions and national identities'.</p>

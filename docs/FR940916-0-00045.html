			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the priority in paragraph (e) for General Shipyard Facilities that have engaged in naval vessel construction is mandated by section 1359(a)(3) of the Shipbuilding Act with respect to amounts appropriated by the Secretary of Defense and available for transfer to the Secretary of Transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.10&blank;Citizenship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section sets forth the citizenship requirements for Title XI applicants and certain other parties that must establish U.S. citizenship prior to acquiring a legal or beneficial interest in a Vessel financed under Title XI of the Act. The exceptions to this requirement are Eligible Export Vessels and Eligible Shipyards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that Section 298.10 should be deleted because Title XI of the Act no longer contains a citizenship requirement. Another commenter stated that the intent of Congress was to eliminate the citizenship requirement for all vessels financed under Title XI, not just Eligible Export Vessels. One commenter stated that the citizenship requirement in the 1936 Act applies only to a ``fishing vessel or oceanographic research or instruction or pollution treatment, abatement or control vessel or Eligible Export Vessel.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter pointed out that the parenthetical phrase in new paragraph (e),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exemption <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , should exclude ``operators'' in order to exempt those entities from being required to prove U.S. citizenship. Another recommended deletion of this section because all U.S. citizenship requirements have been deleted for Title XI and stated that as long as U.S. Coast Guard requirements are satisfied, MARAD should impose no additional requirements on U.S. citizens that could result in discrimination and additional costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: The position of MARAD is that Section 1101(b) of the Act (46 App. U.S.C. 1271(b)), which was not amended by the Shipbuilding Act, requires that Vessels, other than Eligible Export Vessels, be owned by citizens of the United States as defined by section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended, 46 App. U.S.C. 802, (the ``Shipping Act''). There is no legal requirement that a shipyard be owned by a Section 2 U.S. citizen. Review of the Shipbuilding Act and Title XI does not support the commenter's suggestion that the citizenship requirement for Vessels only applies to ``fishing vessels or oceanographic research or instruction or pollution treatment, abatement or control vessel.'' Likewise, a review of the legislative history of the Shipbuilding Act reveals no statement to eliminate the citizenship requirement for all Vessels financed under Title XI. The statute explicitly requires Section 2 citizen ownership of such Vessels, other than Eligible Export Vessels. If a bareboat charterer or other operator desires possession and control of U.S.-flag Vessels, the Shipping Act requires that it be a U.S. citizen or obtain MARAD's prior approval to charter or operate the Vessel. Consistent with that requirement, it has always been MARAD's policy that Title XI Vessels may not be bareboat chartered to, or be operated by, non-U.S. citizens. There is no reason to change this position now. Accordingly, bareboat charterers and other ``operators'' of U.S. flag Vessels will remain subject to section 298.10(a). No amendment to paragraph (e) is warranted in view of MARAD's disposition of the citizenship issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 298.11&blank;Vessel Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concerning paragraph (a),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Construction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , certain shipyards claimed that many component parts are manufactured abroad and are not available in the United States, and others pointed out that U.S. Coast Guard U.S-built requirements relate to vessels operating in the coastwise trade, which are the most restrictive of all. Accordingly, they recommended excepting Eligible Export Vessels from these requirements; or that foreign made components are excepted so long as they are ``physically joined'' in this country; or amendment of this section to permit use of foreign made components so long as they do not exceed 49 percent of the Vessel's weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD Response: Paragraph (a),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States Construction <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , has been amended to remove the requirements for fabrication in the United States of components of the hull and superstructure for Eligible Export Vessels. Corresponding changes in &sect;&sect;298.13 and 298.21(c) will make it clear that even though foreign components of the hull and superstructure may be included for Eligible Export Vessels, these costs will not be eligible for Title XI loan Guarantees. The intent is to allow hull and superstructure components from worldwide sources so as to allow the maximum integration of foreign and U.S. shipyard production as U.S. shipyards may desire for economic and/or competitive reasons in order to penetrate the international commercial market, without financing the foreign components of the hull and superstructure. Nonetheless, consistent with MARAD's policy since 1986, raw and improved products, such as unshaped, unmolded and unpunched steel can be imported and used in the production of the hull and superstructure without being excluded from Actual Cost as they are not deemed to be ``components'' of the hull and superstructure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Class, condition, and operation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , was amended in the interim final rule to allow Vessel classification by members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) ``to be ISO&hyph;9000 certified'', rather than restricting classification authority to the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). With respect to Vessel classification, all but one commenter favored allowing Vessel classification by all members of the IACS; the ABS stated that this amendment would be contrary to law at 46 U.S.C. 3316(b) and could place the government's security in serious jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Transport in Docklands RARELY HAS a UK government agonised so long and hard about an apparently simple question. But where to relocate 2,000 Department of the Environment civil servants will ultimately be decided by Downing Street, after scrutiny by a special sub-committee containing five Cabinet ministers. Two years ago, in its enthusiasm for private sector funding of infrastructure projects, the government persuaded Olympia &amp; York, creators of the biggest development in London's Docklands, Canary Wharf, to contribute Pounds 400m to the Pounds 1.7bn cost of extending the Jubilee line into east London. Since the value of Canary Wharf would rise if it were linked to central London by underground, it seemed fair that the project's owners should help pay for the line. In fact, the Pounds 400m was to be staggered over many decades. If the payments were made in one lump, they would be worth only Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m. In the event, Canary Wharf's capacity to pay even its modest contribution has been undermined by its financial difficulties. It is now in the control of administrators, who are under no legal obligation to make the contribution. Yet the Treasury has insisted there will be no Jubilee line if the sums are not paid in full. The administrators acknowledge that Canary Wharf is more likely to re-emerge as a going concern if the line is built. But they feel they have only one source of funds for a first tranche of the payment: the government itself. Two months ago, the government disclosed that it had chosen Docklands as the new home for officials of the Department of the Environment and that it had a short-list of three possible sites, including Canary Wharf. Thereupon the administrators offered either to sell a building to the government and afterwards remit the proceeds for the Jubilee line or lease the building, refinance it and again remit the proceeds. In this way, what should have been a straightforward evaluation of the value for money offered by the three buildings has become embroiled in far bigger issues. A further complication is the government's fear that it will be accused of bailing out a friend, if it moves to Canary Wharf. What must the government do? First, whether or not to relocate civil servants must be kept separate from decisions about transport investment in London as a whole. Relocation of the civil servants seems to make sense, however, because of the low rent. Second, whether or not a developer makes a modest contribution should not determine the line's fate. The government must, instead, do what has never been properly done: assess whether the benefits of the Jubilee line outweigh the costs. Third, any evaluation must take account of the additional transportation that is on the way. By this time next year, the completion of a Pounds 1.65bn road-building programme will enable traffic to pour into the area. In addition, the Docklands Light Railway will have been converted into a mass transit system at a cost of Pounds 800m. The government should make its decisions in the light of the future interests, first, of taxpayers at large and, second, of people who live or work in London, whose concerns also include the sensible long-term planning of the capital. All else - not least the prestige of those who promoted Docklands and the money sunk into it - should be disregarded.</p>

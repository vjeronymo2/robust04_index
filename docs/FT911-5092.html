			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Polish steelworks seeks privatisation Poland's Huta Katowice steelworks, one of the country's largest plants, is suffering a severe cash squeeze and pressing the government to let it be privatised, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The steelworks failed to make a Zl 73bn (Pounds 4.3m) payment to the state budget last month, part of a tax on capital assets in the state sector which is due to provide some 8 per cent of budget revenues. Management has told the plant's 16,000 employees that a fall in exports and domestic sales in the first quarter and a failure by customers to pay bills could halt production. However, the government is reluctant to agree to privatisation, which would mean the plant no longer paying tax.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The EU Ambassador in Tirana Mr. Elio Germano Pronounces on </F> the Blocking of 35 Million ECU Granted to Albania by EU"]    [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The EU ambassador in Albania  Mr. Elio Germano pronounced today on Radio Tirana on the  blocking of EU [European Union] assistance to Albania. Mr.  Germano said "Actually the European Union has not taken a  decision on the 35 million ECU granted to Albania and in fact we  cannot speak of a Greek veto but of their reserve expressed in  one of the meeting of the Council of the Finance Ministers of  the European Union, which they had not taken it back yet."  European ambassador pointed out that we cannot take a decision  on financial issues in the community, if there is no unanimity  on it. He stressed that European Union wants to rediscuss the  issue in the meeting of the foreign ministers of twelve  countries, on June 13th.    "We hope to take unanimous decision on this particular  issue," said he, stressing "that it cannot be concealed that a  tension exists, an obstacle between EU country member which  Greece is and a country with which Europe has agreements of  trade and cooperation, and once more according to this agreement  an integration of Albania is foreseen, and above all your  country is not a common partner but a privileged one. The Greek  Government has expressed considerations of political nature, but  it should be stressed it is only its stand," he clarified.</p>

Speaking at the signing, the Vice-President of the Beijing  Legend Group, Liu Jinduo, said that his company plays a vital  role in the domestic micro computers market as well as in  developing Chinese character processing software.    "Our cooperation with Intermec has brought us to the new  high- tech domain of bar code data collection technology," he  said.    Intermec President Timothy A. Koogle said that his company  is  willing to be a firm backer for its Chinese partner.

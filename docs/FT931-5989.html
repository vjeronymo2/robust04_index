			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: DFDS declines despite rising sales DFDS, the Danish shipping and haulage group, returned annual pre-tax profits of DKr100m (Dollars 11m) compared with DKr144m in the previous 12 months. Sales rose to DKr5.93bn from DKr5.33bn in the corresponding period. An unchanged dividend of DKr60 per share - 6 per cent - was proposed. The board attributed the slide in profits to the slump in leading markets, including the UK and Sweden, and to the devaluations of the Swedish krona and sterling against the Danish currency. Passenger traffic on the Scandinavian Seaways ferries to the UK was down. The Tor Line freight service was adversely affected by conditions in Sweden and in Britain. The increase in sales was attributed by the company to an improvement in the haulage division, which has strengthened its position in the European markets. This year will be a difficult one due to the slump in main markets, the group said. It predicted a further reduction in operating profits.</p>

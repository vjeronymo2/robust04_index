			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Inman named as US defence secretary President Bill Clinton yesterday named retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman to be the next US defence secretary, to fill the gap left by the resignation on Wednesday of Mr Les Aspin. Mr Inman said he had not wanted the job, but had agreed to take it out of a sense of duty. He also said that he had voted for former President George Bush in the last election, but had been convinced of Mr Clinton's 'absolute commitment' to building a bipartisan consensus on defence policy. In his new post, Mr Inman will have to take charge of a vast and unwieldy bureaucracy of which Mr Aspin has not seemed fully in control. He will also have to tackle serious defence budget problems as well as the difficult issues surrounding US involvement overseas in areas such as Haiti or Somalia. While there seems to have been no specific last straw provoking Mr Aspin's departure, he had gradually lost Mr Clinton's full confidence. The appointment is still subject to Senate confirmation, but Mr Inman enjoys broad support among members of both parties, and is not expected to face any serious obstacles. A Texan, now aged 62, he became at 49 the first naval intelligence specialist ever to earn the rank of four-star admiral. He rose as a naval intelligence officer to head the National Security Agency, which runs much of the US's electronics surveillance, from 1977 to 1981. He became deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1981 - the price exacted by Congress for accepting President Ronald Reagan's choice of Mr William Casey, his campaign manager, to head the CIA - but resigned the next year after policy disagreements. He will be the first former career officer to serve as secretary of defence since General George Marshall, who held the office under President Harry Truman. Although Mr Inman has won high praise from Congress, his private sector career has been less glittering. His three years at the head of Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp, a joint venture set up to strengthen US research in advanced computing, went well enough, but he had to resign from his next business, Westmark Systems, after the failure of its leveraged buy-out of Tracor Holdings, a defence contractor. Mr Inman said at the time that he found Congress less arduous to deal with than the commercial banks. 'Congress will give you a good scrubbing, but only to make sure there's some value in the money they're giving you. The banks will whipsaw you and drive you bankrupt if they get the chance,' Mr Inman said. He also served on the proxy board set up to preserve the US military secrets handled by International Signal and Control, the ill-starred US acquisition of Ferranti, the British defence group to which receivers were appointed recently. Mr Inman acknowledged yesterday that he had not succeeded at all the jobs he had turned his hand to. 'I have not done them all as well as I would have liked, but I have worked hard at them,' he said at a White House ceremony announcing his nomination. 'I would hope to spend a lot of my time on bringing best business practices to the Department of Defence.'</p>

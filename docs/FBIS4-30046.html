			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government is  studying the possibility of making inter-Korean summits a  regular dialogue channel once the proposed inter-Korean summit  is realized in July, informed official sources said Thursday.    The government is also considering opening a hot line  between  Seoul and Pyongyang so that President Kim Yong-sam and his North  Korean counterpart Kim Il-song can discuss key issues over the  phone at any time. He noted the hot line is necessary for  discussion of important issues to ensure the common prosperity  of all Koreans as well as peace and stability on the peninsula.    The official said the summit should not be a one-off event.  "It is desirable to regularize the summits in such a manner as  to hold a second meeting in Pyongyang if the first meeting is  held in Seoul," he said.    Some Koreans favor a third site other than Seoul or  Pyongyang, citing as a precedent the first summit between West  and East Germany. The official, however, emphasized that it  must be held in either Seoul or Pyongyang from a symbolic  standpoint.    "The earlier the meeting is held, the better it will be," he  said, voicing hope that it would come in early July.    Meanwhile, the government will soon discuss matters related  to the summit based on the principle of denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula agreed between Seoul and Pyongyang, and the  agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, exchanges and  cooperation which was signed at a prime ministers meeting in  1991.</p>

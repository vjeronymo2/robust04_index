			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Observer: Busting the opposition Elections in east Asia are assumed to be very much male affairs. Hence no surprise that posters for the seven presidential candidates in today's South Korean election depict one middle-aged politician after another - all short hair-cuts dressed in business suits. The only hint of femininity in the placard for Kim Ok-sun is her pink tie. A former opposition MP, the 58-year-old Kim is making history as the first woman to run for president in her country. Ever since she entered politics in the 1960s, she has donned masculine attire in an attempt to blend in. 'Men's suits and ties are the uniform of politics,' is her view. Contrast the approach of Hsu Hsiao-dan, a candidate in parliamentary elections tomorrow, this time in conservative Taiwan, where breasts - her own - have featured at the forefront of her campaign, which is running the slogan 'let Taiwan be as firm as my breast and politics as honest as my body'. Accused by an opponent of having starred in a pornographic movie, Hsu exposed a breast at a political rally to demonstrate she did not have the film star's prominent mole. In her first, unsuccessful, election race in 1989, she bared her breasts for democracy more regularly, but has since toned down the act. However, she still pledges to strip off in parliament if it would aid the passage of a bill.</p>

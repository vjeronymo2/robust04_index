			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Four new funds will seek to offer stability - Unit Trusts / Futures and options will be used to reduce the risk. But will the average investor find it easy to understand what they actually do? REDUCING THE risk of equity investment may prove one of the themes of the 1990s. Guaranteed funds (discussed on page 11 of this Review) are one approach, but an alternative was launched by Fidelity - a futures and options fund. Futures and options have a rather racy reputation, but they are frequently used to reduce risk. In effect, they can be a form of insurance against a sharp fall in a particular market. That is the aim of four new 'stabiliser growth' unit trusts from Fidelity, based on the UK, American, European and Japanese markets. An investor's money will not rise as fast as the index in a bull market, but it will not fall as quickly in a bear market. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, with an initial charge of 5.25 per cent and an annual charge of 1.5 per cent. But the marketing flaw in these products is that the investor does not know what his 'maximum loss' will be. If the market fell 50 per cent, Fidelity's fund might fall, say, 15 per cent, and that is a risk that many cautious investors will not accept. Nor will the average investor find it easy to understand what a futures and options fund actually does. So although these funds are more tax efficient than many guaranteed funds, it is hard to see them taking off in the UK. Fidelity may have to prove the concept through years of successful operation. THE INCOME FACTOR LOWER INTEREST rates and the unpredictability of investment returns have led to a greater emphasis on income among managers currently launching investment vehicles. M &amp; G says its Managed Income Trust is aimed at the large number of people who have difficulty with their choice of unit trust. Designed as a fund of funds, to invest in the range of M &amp; G unit trusts, the Managed Income Trust will hold a varying proportion of its portfolio in fixed-interest securities and gilts, up to a maximum of 40 per cent. Fund manager Chris Whitaker , who joined M &amp; G from County NatWest in 1991, said the initial breakdown of investments would be around 20 per cent in fixed interest securities, predominantly gilts, with a small proportion of cash: possibly 5 per cent either directly in cash or in the M &amp; G Treasury fund launched this month (see below). About 55 per cent of the fund would be spread across the group's UK unit trusts, with the balance going into a basket of funds invested in Europe, the Far East and internationally. Recognising that market movements before February might make a change of strategy necessary, Mr Whitaker said M &amp; G saw the UK market as still having some upside, though the pre-Christmas run-up in the market seemed to have removed some of the potential for a traditional new year rally. M &amp; G's Managed Income Trust will pay monthly income, at an estimated rate of about 5 per cent gross annually if the fund is held via a personal equity plan. Charges will be an initial 4.5 per cent and an annual 1.5 per cent, with no additional charges on the unit trusts held by the fund. The trust will be available at a fixed price of 25p per unit during the launch period, which runs from February 6 to February 26, and the minimum investment will be either Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 50 a month. FUND WITH A CHEQUEBOOK UNIT TRUSTS are showing further signs of adapting to an era in which investors are looking for alternatives to the building society. M&amp;G's new Treasury fund, by investing in UK Treasury bills and other money-market instruments, aims to offer a yield higher than that obtainable from most building society instant access accounts. Income will be payable monthly, and investors will be given a chequebook, allowing them to transfer funds (subject to a minimum of Pounds 250) into a bank or building society account. There is no initial charge, but an annual fee of 0.6 per cent; the minimum investment is Pounds 5,000. Such funds are relatively commonplace in the US; and, indeed, the most obvious competitor in the UK is the cash account operated by the US group Fidelity. Money market funds are never likely to offer the best possible rate in the market, but are sure to provide a rate which is highly competitive. In contrast, some building society accounts offer a top-of-the-range interest rate to attract investors, only to lower rates to below-market levels after a year or so. All too often, inertia (or ignorance about the rate change) stops investors from moving their money at the right time. Eventually, such funds may offer the ability to make standing orders and even cashpoint withdrawals. But, although the Fidelity fund has now topped Pounds 100m, UK money market funds are simply not yet big enough to make such services profitable at the low level of fees charged. AN EASIER ROUTE INTO PIBS PERMANENT INTEREST-bearing securities have many attractions for investors in the current world of low rates. Pibs offer a high, fixed income and come with the backing of building society names which most investors can recognise. The problem is that the market is illiquid, and some Pibs come in large (Pounds 50,000) denominations. Holders of securities will rank well behind depositors in the queue for repayment, should the society go bust. So careful selection in this area is needed. This is where ExBal, a new unit trust, claims it can help. It will invest around 60 per cent of its portfolio in Pibs, with the remainder in the zero-coupon shares of investment trusts to provide scope for capital growth. The snag with this structure is that it sharply brings down the yield - the main reason why private investors might be attracted to Pibs in the first place. The initial yield on the trust was 6.5 per cent at launch, and that had slipped to 6.3 per cent by mid-January. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge 1 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 750. Exeter Fund Managers, who run the trust, are specialists in the split-capital area. GOLD LOSES ITS GLITTER ALL THAT glitters has been distinctly unprofitable for unit trust investors over the past five years. Of the 10 worst-performing trusts over the five years to January 1, five were gold funds. In the 1980s and early 1990s, gold has consistently failed to show the kind of 'safe haven' characteristics that it showed in the 1970s. Even the Gulf War failed to spark a rally. The price of bullion has been stuck between Dollars 300 and Dollars 400 per ounce in the 1990s. Some disillusioned central banks have recently offloaded part of their holdings. With expectations for world inflation still low, it is hard to see what could cause the gold price to rally. Which may be bad news for investors in trusts such as Waverley Australasian Gold, which turned Pounds 100 into Pounds 39.18 over five years. Top-performing funds: pages 30 and 31</p>

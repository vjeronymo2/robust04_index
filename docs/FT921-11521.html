			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Tunnel builders Given that the Taylor Woodrow share price has halved in the past 12 months, underperforming the sector by 30 per cent, yesterday's 7 per cent fall might seem neither here nor there. Indeed, the setback is only the latest sign of the company's fall from grace; but a wider issue for investors is the message Taylor is conveying about the size of provisions UK and French contractors may have to take on the Channel tunnel. These are highly sensitive times for the 10 companies grouped together in Transmanche Link (TML), which are not only involved in tense negotiations about cost over-runs with Eurotunnel but are busy drawing up their 1991 accounts. Not surprisingly, therefore, this week's reliable rumours that Taylor Woodrow is considering a Pounds 15m tunnel-related hit for 1991 plus possibly the same again for the current year have been greeted with ill-disguised anger and astonishment by other members of the consortium. Judging the outcome of the Eurotunnel-TML talks, or the timing of their conclusion, remains as hazardous as ever. But however unwelcome for those with less robust balance sheets and uncertain dividends, the apparent gulf between TML's claim and Eurotunnel's offer thus far suggests the Taylor Woodrow figures are not extravagant. Or time could prove the contrary, confirming the suspicion that Taylor is happy to throw as much bad news as possible into 1991. The confusion will not only act as another brake on the contracting shares. It may dampen the traditional New Year enthusiasm for Eurotunnel.</p>

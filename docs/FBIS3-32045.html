A total of 3,439,405 Guatemalans cast their votes on 30  January to approve or reject 37 articles of the Constitution.  Among other things, the reforms shorten the legislative and  presidential terms and restructure Congress and the Supreme  Court of Justice.    After accounting for the votes cast in 280 of the country's  330 municipalities, Guatemala's Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE]  confirmed early today that barely 16.01 percent of registered  voters had participated in the referendum.    After the preliminary results were released, President  Ramiro  de Leon Carpio, during a news conference held at TSE's  computation center, called for a "national agreement" to  overcome the country's political, economic, and social crisis.  De Leon admitted the results indicate an exhaustion of the  democratic system, which demands from political,  entrepreneurial, union, and popular sectors, as well as the  Church, greater responsibility and participation in the  country's leadership.    Hours earlier, before arriving at the TSE, de Leon expressed  his satisfaction over the yes vote's "triumph" and said, albeit  minimum, this result was an expression of the people's will and  must be respected.    According to the TSE, 5,054 polling sites had reported, and  843 were pending at 0100 (0700 GMT). The reported 5,054 sites  had produced 319,550 yes votes, 61,212 no votes, 84,820 void  votes, and 6,768 blank votes.    Electoral authorities said the results of all polling sites  will be reported in a few hours, because the votes of many  distant villages with scant communications have yet to be  accounted for.    Speaking to the press at 0030 (0630 GMT), de Leon demanded  the establishment of a "Governability Pact" to overcome the  country's serious backwardness. He urged the guerrillas to sign  peace to make it possible for the country to move forward. The  president pledged to sign peace with the rebel National  Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity [URNG], establish economic and  social peace, and launch a moral "bloodless" revolution.    De Leon Carpio stated that henceforth Guatemala will begin  to  march on the path of stability and governability, after pledging  to strongly promote economic plans and security measures.    The head of state affirmed the referendum met the Guatemalan  people's expectations, but he expressed regret over the high  rate of abstention, something that must be of concern to the  political parties, he said. He reiterated, however, that  "regardless of the result, democracy is getting stronger."    Regarding the possibility that the Social Multisector Forum  (Foro Multisectorial), which represents unions, mass, and  business groups, may challenge the vote result, de Leon warned  it is uncalled for, because the law does not demand a percentage  in the referendum.    Sunday's voting took place under a tense climate due to  terrorist threats and bomb explosions, as well as due to the  rejection of political and social organizations that urged the  people to vote "No" or cast a blank vote.    Upon arriving at the TSE last night, the president admitted  voter abstention "happens everywhere in the world," but he  attributed the low turnout to last week's attacks,.    With the approval of the amendments, the term of the  president and the Legislative Branch is cut from five to four  years, and the Supreme Court term from six to five years. The  president's confidential expenditure and the shared vice  president's responsibility in the president's activities will be  eliminated. The amendments ban the Monetary Board, the  regulator of the economy, from authorizing the Bank of Guatemala  from finance state, decentralized, autonomous, and private  nonfinancial entities. Budget allocations for the country's 333  municipalities went from 8 percent to 10 percent of fiscal  revenues.    The government's ability to transfer funds from its  investment programs to its operations plans or to repay the  public debt will be eliminated. In addition, extraordinary  expenses related to the national budget will be suppressed.    Concerning the Judicial Branch, the Supreme Court of Justice  will consist of 13 magistrates instead of the current nine, and  this institutions' practice of nominating its own candidates to  magistrate positions will be annulled.    The District Attorney's Office (MP) will no longer represent  the state, which from now on will be represented by the Attorney  General's Office. In addition, the Guatemalan Prosecutor  General's Office is created.    The legislative reforms are expected to become effective  within 60 days; fifteen days afterward the TSE will summon  elections to renew the current Congress within a 120-day period.    Newly elected deputies will be sworn in one month after the  elections and will replace the current deputies whose term was  scheduled to concluded on 14 January 1996, the date when the  congressmen elected during the 1995 general elections were  slated to take over.    Eighteen months after the new reforms have entered into  effect, the president must forward a bill to Congress aimed at  modernizing the government system.    Congress, in turn, will determine the mechanisms to modify  the Comptroller General's Office, the District Attorney's  Office, and the Supreme Court of Justice.    Sunday's referendum, which entailed a $2-million  expenditure,  was held under strict security and military patrols, and public  transportation was halted.</p>

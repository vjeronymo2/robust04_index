			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-su: "Important Issues Arising From </F> Making Further Achievements in Electrification of Railway Lines"]    [Text] To solidify the material and technological  foundation of railway lines is an important demand to guarantee  the successful accomplishment of the party's revolutionary  economic strategy by solving the problems in transport in a  smooth way. One of the questions arising from this is to make  further and better achievements in the electrification of  railway lines.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "It is  necessary to complete electrifying the still-unelectrified  sections of railway lines and to quickly introduce heavy-duty  cars to the railway lines by producing many eight-axle electric  locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars."    To make further and better gains in the achievement of  electrification of the railway lines is one of the important  tasks for solidifying the material and technological foundation  of the railway lines.    An important factor indicating the material and  technological  foundation of the railway lines is railway transport capacity.  Railway transport capacity largely depends on the kind of power  used.    Electricity and internal combustion are examples of power  sources used for railway transport. Generally speaking, the  efficiency of steam power and internal combustion power is much  lower than that of electricity. Therefore, to help further  increase the proportion of usage of electric power by making  further and better achievements gained in the electrification of  the railway lines serves as an essential demand for solidifying  the material and technological foundation of the railway lines.  This can increase railway transport capacity.    To make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines makes it possible to  actively introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, thereby  helping solidify the material and technological foundation of  the railway lines.    To accelerate the introduction of heavy-duty cars into the  railway lines is one of the ways to increase the transport  capacity by solidifying the material and technological  foundation of the railway lines.    When we introduce heavy-duty cars to the railway lines, we  can quickly increase the transport capacity even without laying  many new railway lines.    The introduction of heavy-duty cars into the railway lines  will increase the capacity of railway transport, and an  important condition for this is the electrification of the  railway lines.    If the haulage capacity of locomotives is low, they cannot  properly haul heavy-duty cars. To increase the haulage capacity  of locomotives, it is necessary to use electric power.    From an early day on, our party has actively pushed for the  electrification of the railway lines by putting forth a chuche-  oriented policy to suit the actual conditions of our country,  which has abundant electric power resources. Under our party's  leadership, our country has already achieved great success in  the electrification of the railway lines. In recent years  alone, a total of 800 km of railway lines has been electrified.  Therefore, the main railways lines have basically been  electrified. The feeder lines have also been electrified to a  considerable extent.    When we electrify some still-unelectrified feeder lines and  industrial lines by making further and better achievements in  the electrification of the railway lines, we can transport more  cargo more quickly with the existing transport means, thereby  smoothly guaranteeing the demands for transport in the people's  economy.    To increase the production of electric locomotives is a  high-  priority demand for making further and better achievements in  the electrification of the railway lines.    Importantly, the extent railway lines have been electrified  is indicated by the amount of cargo hauled by electric power,  and electric locomotives are the basic means of hauling cargo in  the electrified sections. Thus, when we increase the number of  the electric locomotives, we can haul more cargo with electric  power.    Under the party's wise leadership, when more railway lines  have been electrified quickly, we can haul an enormous amount of  cargo with electric power if we are equipped with more electric  locomotives.    It is important to produce a proper mixture of various  kinds of locomotives, including electric locomotives used for  the railway lines that have not yet been electrified and the  electric locomotives used for switching cars; as well as to give  priority to producing more eight-axle electric locomotives used  for hauling heavy-duty cars. When this is realized, we can  further increase the scope and proportion of cargo hauled by  electric power without suffering from various kinds of  restrictions.    What plays a vital role in electric locomotives is the  electric motor for power. Electric locomotives largely depend  upon the electric motor for power. Therefore, in order to  quickly increase the production of electric locomotives, it is  necessary to give firm priority to the production of highly  efficient electric motors.    One of the important factors to make further and better  achievements in the electrification of the railway lines is to  increase the supply of electricity to the electrified railway  line sections in conformity with the practical demands.    At the moment, heavy-duty cars, such as the eight-axle  electric locomotives and 100-tonne freight cars, are being  widely introduced into railway transport in accordance with the  policy of introducing heavy-duty cars into the railway lines;  and a struggle to have each car haul more cargo than the haulage  draft is being vigorously staged under the flame of "the 5.18  no-accident, on-time, traction- standard-surpassing movement."  This reality demands eagerly that the supply of electricity be  further increased. To this end, it is necessary to actively  push ahead with the construction of new intermediary electric  power substations between the operating sections of the  heavy-duty cars, while mapping out a series of technological  countermeasures to increase the capacity of the existing  electricity supply facilities.    The work of electrifying some still-unelectrified lines  should be accelerated.    What is important here is to map out a detailed, concrete  plan to implement a correct priority order, and to implement the  plan in a useful fashion through the finish-one-by-one method.    The success of completing the electrification of some still-  unelectrified lines largely depends upon how to lay more tracks  and set up electric poles. Therefore, it is necessary to carry  out the technological guidance in a substantive way so as to  help work out a wonderful design for this and carry out the work  in accordance with the demands of the technical regulations and  the standard manufacturing procedure. In particular, it is  necessary to work out a measure to secure railway tracks and  electric poles in a foresighted way and pay special attention to  preventing corrosion of structures caused by the electric field.    The work to make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines can successfully be carried  out only with the vigorous support from various sectors of the  people's economy.    The metal industry is the sector that takes the biggest  share  in this support. When this sector provides, in a timely  fashion, sufficient supply of various metal materials, including  copper wiring, aluminum wire, silicon steel sheet, and rolled  steel, according to the kind, quality, and gauges of those  materials, we can increase the production of electric  locomotives, increase the capability of electricity supply, and  quickly push ahead with the laying of new electric railway  tracks.    To make further and better achievements in the  electrification of the railway lines is one of the important  tasks which should be carried out in smoothly solving problems  in transport to suit the practical demands for thoroughly  carrying through the party's revolutionary economic strategy.    The railway transport sector should achieve innovations in  making further and better achievements in the electrification of  the railway lines with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude, thereby more smoothly guaranteeing the growing  demands for transport and making active contributions to the  implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy.</p>

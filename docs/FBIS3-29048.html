			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korea  may hold a high-level meeting here around Feb. 21 in order to  resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, a Western diplomatic  source said Monday.    "Ambassadors Hwang Pyong-tae of South Korea and Chu  Chang-chon of North Korea nearly met here through arrangements  made by an influential ethnic Korean living in Beijing last  November when negotiations between the United States and North  Korea were making hardly any progress," the diplomat said. That  meeting failed to take place, he said, but chances that the two  Koreas will get together behind the scenes are bright because of  recent developments, the diplomat said, asking for anonymity.    The United States has said it will refer the matter to the  U.N. Security Council unless North Korea and the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reach agreement on inspections  before the IAEA convenes a Board of Governors' meeting on Feb.  21.    According to the source, the South Korean Embassy here  received a proposal from the North Korean Embassy in a  councilor-level contact urging that they arrange a Hwang-Chu  meeting.    The South Korean Embassy has studied the proposal but  withheld any decision because North Korea was already in contact  secretly with the United States in New York and because the  timing was wrong, the diplomat said. In addition, the two Koreas  have an existing channel for such contacts, he added.    The source said, however, a view is gaining strength within  the South Korean Government that Seoul must determine  Pyongyang's true nuclear intentions as its talks with the United  States and the IAEA appear to have reached their limit.    Besides, South Korea must know the North's position on the  issue because President Kim Yong-sam is expected to discuss it  at a summit with Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he visits  China in March, the source said. Consequently, there is a  strong possibility that Hwang and Chu will hold a secret meeting  in Beijing in the near future, the source said.</p>

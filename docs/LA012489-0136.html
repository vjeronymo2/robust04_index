			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> NEW TWIST IN TREATING BACK PAIN  </P> <P> A growing number of back pain specialists are now preaching what would have  been medical heresy a decade ago: that vigorous, aerobic exercise is often the  best way to help a hurting back and that bed rest often does more harm than  good.  </P> <P> The turnabout in thinking is apparently the result of improved body chemistry  science and the increasing willingness of back specialists to question their  own long-held assumptions. It has been hastened recently by publication of a  new Danish study that found that an especially strenuous exercise program was a  much more effective treatment for low back pain than either light exercise or  rest.  </P> <P> The Danish program, which was tested on 105 backache sufferers, depends on a  sequence of three exercises so demanding that the Copenhagen researchers who  described it in the journal Lancet -- as well as American experts questioned by  The Times -- cautioned that the program should only be initiated with a  physical therapist in attendance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Options  </P> <P> The American experts said the Danish regimen is only one of an increasing array  of exercise options being chosen by progressive back pain specialists. Many of  the programs, they said, can be safely followed at home, without direct medical  supervision.  </P> <P> "I think most of us have been comfortable for years in prescribing (mild)  exercise for many forms of low back pain," said C. David Tollison, director of  Pain Therapy Centers, of Greenville, S.C.  </P> <P> "But when you emphasize the word intensive, which is consistent with the  philosophy many of us have sort of preached for the last year or two, it goes  from an area of universal agreement to an area of some level of controversy,"  he said.  </P> <P> Tollison and Dr. Mark D. Brown, a professor of orthopedics at the University of  Miami School of Medicine and another back treatment expert, said changes in the  therapy recommended for heart patients and new mothers -- which emphasizes a  rapid return to normal exercise and life style -- prompted orthopedists to  question the traditional prescription for the back.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Opposite Effect  </P> <P> In fact, said Tollison, Brown and Dr. Paul Nutter, a Seattle back pain expert,  bed rest or long periods of inactivity actually have the opposite effect of  what is intended because muscle structures that support the back, in the back  and abdominal area, become deconditioned.  </P> <P> When that happens, Nutter said, and a back pain patient stands and moves about,  ligaments -- not muscles -- then tend to hold the body erect, and the result  can be even more intense back pain and the risk of serious injury. Intensive  aerobic exercise, the three experts said, builds strength in the back so  exercise has the effect of preventing pain, not risking it.  </P> <P> "The reason you do aerobics is not so much to increase strength as to increase  endurance," Nutter said. "As you stay in the upright position, your abdominal  and back muscles are able to hold your body erect."  </P> <P> There is also a fear dynamic in many patients, Tollison said. Often, he said,  back pain patients are apprehensive about pain since they erroneously assume it  indicates they have sustained a serious injury. But the average case of low  back pain is not the precursor of a major spinal catastrophe, they said.  </P> <P> Just as important but less understood, perhaps, Brown said, is the biochemical  role of exercise. Within the last decade, neuroscientists have started to  understand the function of a family of body chemicals called endorphins, which  produce a natural morphine-like pain relief when their production is  stimulated.  </P> <P> One of the factors that stimulates endorphins, Brown said, is vigorous aerobic  exercise.  </P> <P> This observation, the experts said, has led to the rethinking of back exercise  theories first developed as early as 1937 in which back pain treatment included  cautious, gentle exercise but avoided anything more vigorous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Confirms Earlier Work  </P> <P> In this climate, the new Danish study has added confirmation to earlier work by  Tollison and at least a half dozen other researchers. Tollison has published  studies of 4,100 patients at his clinics that conclude vigorous exercise is  valuable treatment modality.  </P> <P> The new Danish study, by a team at the University of Copenhagen, divided  research subjects into groups that received one of three forms of treatment --  traditional rest, light exercise and intensive exercise -- over a three-month  period. The intensive exercise group performed vigorous programs of sets of 50  repetitions of three different exercises that emphasized trunk lifting, leg  lifting and pull-ups.  </P> <P> "We were surprised to find such a pronounced difference," the Copenhagen group  reported. The researchers said the intensive nature of the program and its  length were credited with its success. "On theoretical grounds," the  researchers concluded, "the treatment should probably be lifelong."  </P> <P> Tollison advocates exercise programs designed for home use that rely on a wider  variety of movements, ranging from calf stretching and back arching to pelvic  tilts and exaggerated sit-ups. The program, Tollison emphasized, should only be  started after a complete medical review.  </P> <P> "I think there is a psychological benefit, as well," Tollison said. "You give  an individual some control over his own destiny, instead of going off to bed  and lying there."  </P></p>

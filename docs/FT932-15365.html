			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Aids directs attention to condom market: The background to the latest MMC inquiry THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission is preparing a report on the UK's condom market, which is worth about Pounds 45m at retail prices, due for publication by the end of this year. The last MMC inquiry into the market - in 1982 - introduced a complicated price-control system requiring calculations abstruse enough to confound the keenest market analyst. What the 1993 investigation will find is a market radically altered by the impact of Aids, and yet largely unchanged in terms of the companies which dominate production. In 1982 the biggest seller by far - with about 95 per cent of the market - was the Durex brand. Durex, produced by LRC Products, part of London International Group (LIG), still has the largest share of the market - 75 per cent, worth almost Pounds 34m at retail prices. Mates Healthcare, owned by the Australian corporation Ansell, is the second-largest brand, with about 20 per cent. Two other brands have recently made minor inroads into the UK market. Sagami Rubber, a Japanese company, entered the market in August 1991 with the launch of the Le Condom brand, which was already a leading brand in continental Europe. The Jiffi brand, owned by Sime International, the world's largest rubber company, was relaunched in August last year. All kinds of marketing techniques have been used to try to break the Durex grip, ranging from Mates' early advertising attempts to remove the embarrassment factor, to Jiffi's producing condoms flavoured with banana, lemon, orange, strawberry, chocolate cocktail and pina colada. Durex and Mates have set up educational campaigns with leaflets, posters and sampling aimed at 'safer sex' counselling but also with the marketing spin-off of gaining brand awareness. Condom sales stood at about 152m annually last year, 20 per cent up on the 1987 figure, when the government first began promoting condoms as part of its 'safer sex' advertising campaign. Between 1980 and 1986 about 112m were sold annually, with the real boost coming from the Aids scare. In 1988 sales soared to about 140m. Total advertising expenditure to support all brands jumped from Pounds 173,000 in 1986 to Pounds 1.53m in 1987 and Pounds 1.87m in 1988 - when television advertising was first approved - but by 1991 had fallen back to Pounds 346,000. Of that 1991 figure, by far the largest chunk was spent on Mates (Pounds 260,000), with Sagami's Le Condom accounting for the balance. In 1982 the MMC concluded that LRC's domination of the market operated against the public interest 'in that its prices might be expected to become excessive'. In response, LRC undertook to limit the growth in its average realised price (calculated by dividing its total UK turnover by the total UK volume) to 1.5 per cent below an index of costs. On the face of it the 1982 MMC inquiry did nothing to alter Durex's monopoly position, defined by the 1973 Fair Trade Act as existing if 'one person or company supplies or is supplied with at least one quarter of the goods of a particular description in the UK or any part of it.' So why the inquiry now? Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, outlined the reasons on March 1 when he recommended the inquiry in the light of a market vastly changed by the Aids threat. He said: 'I shall be particularly interested in the MMC's view on the way in which the price control mechanism has been applied and whether this has damaged the prospect of successful competition from Mates and other suppliers'. In other words, the OFT appears to have tacitly admitted that, far from operating in the public's interest, the 1982 price-control mechanism may have stifled competition, precisely when consumers may have been most eager for greater choice. LIG is putting a brave front on the latest MMC inquiry, in spite of its unofficial acknowledgement that the price-control mechanism - which reading between Sir Bryan's lines, looks set to be scrapped - has worked in its favour and against its competitors. One LIG executive said: 'De facto they are as controlled as we are on their prices. They certainly can't charge more than we can. We think our competitors will be as anxious to wriggle off the price hook as anybody.' The condom business is quintessentially about branding and for many Durex is synonymous with condoms. Bound up with that, particularly in this market, is consumer need for reassurances about safety and reliability. The MMC inquiry may decide to remove price controls, but that will not necessarily bring down prices consumers pay nor will it necessarily make it any easier for new competitors to enter the market. An industry analyst said: 'The barriers to entry are not great, it is not expensive to establish a factory producing condoms in the Far East. 'But you are talking about a fairly unique product, people are not happy lingering around the counter, arguing over price or brands. They tend to see the familiar product and make a lunge for it.'</p>

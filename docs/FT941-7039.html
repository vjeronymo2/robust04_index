			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales surge helps lift Astra 53% to SKr7.8bn Astra lifted pre-tax profits by 53 per cent to SKr7.8bn (Dollars 975m) in 1993, maintaining its momentum as one of the world's fastest-growing pharmaceutical groups. The performance was powered by surging sales of the group's two main drugs, Losec and Pulmicort, and the weaker krona. The dividend was raised 60 per cent to SKr1.60 per share. The Swedish group is to establish an American depositary receipt (ADR) programme in the US from the autumn. Sales climbed 45 per cent to SKr22.6bn. Excluding currency factors, the increase was 21 per cent, well ahead of the market's 5 per cent growth. The group said earnings would again develop favourably in 1994, as sales continued to outperform the market. However, it warned that the pace of the increase would slow, because it would not derive the same currency benefits this year. In the fourth quarter, pre-tax profits climbed 20 per cent, to SKr2.04bn, on sales of SKr6.5bn, up 50 per cent. The rate of profits increase slowed because of big currency gains in the final quarter of 1992. Sales of Losec, an anti-peptic ulcer agent, surged 64 per cent to SKr7.11bn, while overall sales of the drug, including through licensees, were up 76 per cent at SKr12.7bn. Losec is now reckoned by Astra to be fifth biggest selling drug worldwide, with a market share of more than 30 per cent in Europe, 14 per cent in the US and and between 5 and 6 per cent in Japan. Pulmicort, an anti-asthma agent with between 35 and 40 per cent of the European market, saw sales rise 56 per cent to SKr2.96bn. Astra has emerged relatively unscathed from government clampdowns on healthcare spending. However, local currency sales in Germany, its biggest market, fell 3 per cent last year, compared with a market decline of 10 per cent. Sales growth of 48 per cent in the UK and 52 per cent in France helped to compensate for this. Total group sales, excluding currencies, were up 25 per cent in Europe and 20 per cent in the US, compared with market growth of 2 and 4 per cent respectively.</p>

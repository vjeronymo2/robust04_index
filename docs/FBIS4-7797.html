			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Slota, chairman of the Slovak National </F> Party, by Robert Casensky and Michal Musil in Bratislava; date  not given: "Slovak National Party Chairman Jan Slota: `Prague  Is a Bastion of Dark Forces'"]    [Excerpts] [DENNI TELEGRAF] Do you believe that the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] will win the elections  and Vladimir Meciar will return to power for the third time?    [Slota] The HZDS will achieve the largest percentage of  votes, in my opinion. That is what I believe. I am convinced  of this because, in the course of the past two weeks, I have  taken part in several conferences in the east and south of  Slovakia--in the Magyarized city of Filakovo, for example, where  Slovaks represent 30 percent of the population. I think that my  prediction that the Slovak National Party [SNS] would win  between 15 and 18 percent of the vote is realistic. If we  assume that the HZDS might reach approximately 30-35 percent of  the vote, this would essentially mean the possibility of forming  a majority [HZDS-SNS] government.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Where lies the originality of your party  that might have it attract 15 percent of voters, as you predict?    [Slota] The SNS is the oldest political party in Slovakia,  with a tradition of over 130 years. From the very beginning, we  have pursued the main programmatic goal of obtaining for Slovaks  the rights of a state-forming nation, even though it was not a  state-forming nation at the time. [passage omitted] We have  achieved statehood and have a Slovak Republic, yet the rights of  a state-forming nation have not yet been achieved, and the  interests of Slovaks remain unfulfilled. We still cannot say  that these interests are clear and comprehensible to the nation.  This is because there still exist forces posing as  representatives of this nation that, by their interests and  their conduct, are seeking the exact opposite.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess the dismissal of the  former Meciar-led government and your subsequent transfer to the  opposition?    [Slota] I would call it a normal putsch. It was a normal  putsch staged by people who no longer had any business being in  this parliament. They had betrayed their own parties and  movements. They had betrayed their programs and voters. The  voters did not vote for people but for programs. They voted for  a program and for a party. Had these people in parliament been  men of principle, they would have left parliament. But, instead  of leaving, they staged a putsch. There was no political  destabilization in Slovakia [as claimed by the then opposition].  They overstepped the borders that would bring about a  stabilization of the situation.    It is self-evident in Western parliaments that a deputy who  leaves his political party can only act as an independent  deputy. On no account can he set up a new party because he did  not receive anyone's mandate to do that. They represent only  themselves. They do not represent any voters because, at the  time of the elections, there did not exist any alliance or  democrats [reference to Alliance of Democrats, set up by  deputies who broke away from the HZDS]. Whom do they represent?  No one. [passage omitted] We all speak about democracy and  brandish the word in all its variations enough to make you sick.  For example, who will ever remember that the French Government  adopted a discriminatory language program that runs clearly  counter to the Copenhagen [CSCE] agreements? No one criticizes  that; it is completely in order. But, when the Slovaks want to  enshrine some language as official, the world almost collapses  and the globe almost begins to turn in the other direction.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Why did Vladimir Meciar not obtain the  necessary number of signatures for a referendum on excluding  these "defectors" from parliament?    [Slota] We naturally accept that Michal Kovac is the head of  the Slovak Republic. Nevertheless, I cannot help but say, in my  capacity as deputy, that, when we discount various provocateurs  who made deliberate mistakes, 350,000 out of the 420,000  signatures that had been collected were definitely legally  valid. I daresay, however, that, even had there been 700,000  valid signatures, the president would have found some pretext  not to call the referendum. I am convinced of that.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Under the Constitution, however, the  president must call a referendum when there are 300,000 [figure  as published, correct figure is 350,000] signatures asking for  one. In other words, one could almost speak about fraud in this  case.    [Slota] You were the one who said that. I clearly said that  he would have found a pretext.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Speculations have appeared in the Czech  press about attempts by the Czech Social Democratic Party to  restore Czecho-Slovakia.    [Slota] I beg your pardon, these are utopian delusions. I  personally think that the best thing for the Slovak and Czech  nations would be to cooperate, but with everyone staying in his  own backyard. [passage omitted]    [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you personally assess the fact that,  through the medium of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL],  former communists have returned to government after less than  five years? The same thing has happened in Poland. and  everything suggests that the situation in Hungary will not be  too different.    [Slota] Look, I am known for being an anticommunist out of  principle. Naturally, I am not pleased by this and regret very  strongly that these "neocommunists" have regained power after  such a short time. This is very dangerous, also from the  viewpoint that, if left-wing forces are victorious in Hungary as  well, a left-oriented bloc would again come into being. I  personally believe that this is one of the greatest dangers, not  just for Slovakia but also for Central Europe as a whole.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Shortly before the declaration of the  Slovak state, you supposedly said that those who opposed the  declaration of Slovakia's independence would be steamrollered  and tried in court. Could you return to that statement, provided  you actually made it?    [Slota] I said it in a completely different context. About  two sentences were torn out of the interview. It was an  instance of irresponsible work by journalists. I am convinced  that they are paid by certain forces in the Czech Republic  because Prague is a bastion of these forces, which always try to  portray people with different opinions in such black colors.  Unfortunately, one who gives such an interview and does not  authorize it does not have a chance to comment on its text--for  example, when he is abroad at the time of publication--so they  portray him in such colors as their character and ethics permit.  I can only add that I meant it figuratively when I said then  that people opposed to Slovak statehood would be steamrollered.  And the Public Against Violence [VPN] movement, which was a  clear advocate of the Czechoslovak state from the very  beginning, really has been steamrollered. What I said then in  figurative terms has become a reality. As for the courts, I  would really protest fundamentally against such a statement  being attributed to me.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Your unusual assessment of Mr. Zhirinovskiy  has intrigued the public. Could you return to this issue and  tell us whether the assessment that appeared in the press was  not distorted? You have supposedly invited him to Slovakia.    [Slota] Because I am an honest person, I reply to every  journalist. When I was asked directly my view of Zhirinovskiy,  I replied: "He is an interesting man." And, because I am a  dynamic person, they immediately started portraying Zhirinovskiy  and me as good friends and such. In my entire life, I have  never seen him with my own eyes, nor have I ever heard him with  my own ears. I only know his picture from television and the  commentaries about him. The only thing I have claimed is:  Zhirinovskiy is an interesting man. The whole world writes  about him. Were he not interesting, they would not write about  him and would not show him on all of the television channels.  Is he interesting, or is he not? In my opinion, he is. And I  do not know what is wrong with saying that, whether my attitude  toward him is positive or negative. As I have said already, I  do not have any attitude toward him. That is all.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] And what about the invitation?    [Slota] I do not know of any invitation. If someone from  Slovakia has invited him, I do not know about it.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] How do you assess current Slovak-Hungarian  relations?    [Slota] Look, relations between Slovakia and Hungary should  be, first and foremost, friendly. When these relations are  unfriendly, it is to the detriment of both sides. Unfortunately,  there exist certain forces--naturally, on the Hungarian  side--that bring permanent pressure to bear on Slovakia, with  their excessive demands. I was in Filakovo, and the Slovaks  there are afraid. They represent 30 percent of the town's  population and are afraid of saying anything critical about the  Hungarians. They are afraid and frightened. It is abnormal for  a member of the state-forming nation to be afraid on his own  sovereign territory. It is absurd. Look, the Czechs had the  very same problems [with the Sudeten Germans] in 1938, and they  managed to cope with them. This is not to say that I agree with  the system that was used. I disagree with it, of course, with  the killing of the civilian population and all that. You know,  everyone should therefore sweep his own doorstep first and only  then criticize someone else. They deported 3.5 million people,  and you are going to advise us on how to deal with the situation  in southern Slovakia. This is not well intentioned, to put it  moderately. The Benes decrees should definitely be abolished.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] So it is the existence of Benes that is a  problem for you and, naturally, also for us?    [Slota] I personally believe, and have said so on a number  of occasions, that speaking about Benes is a waste of time. He  always had some plan [plan] and it was called airplane  [aeroplan]. [sentence as published] The entire Czech nation had  to pay dearly for this man.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Slovakia, too?    [Slota] Of course, indirectly and by proxy, Slovakia had to  pay, too. After all, he made it possible for the communists to  seize power. Had he been a man of principle, developments might  have taken a completely different course.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] A while ago you spoke about journalists who  distort statements, and not just yours, and about your  conviction that they receive their pay from certain circles.  Could you be somewhat more specific?    [Slota] You are asking me something that you should be able  to answer yourselves. Ask yourselves who is paying you.    [DENNI TELEGRAF] Thank you for the interview.</p>

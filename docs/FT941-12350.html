			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Not yet a pretty sight, but safe - Beirut is again a place to do business. Mark Nicholson offers some tips These days only the deeply skittish are scared of doing business in Beirut. Unless, of course, you include the fear of being hoodwinked or outwitted in what, since Phoenician days, has been one of the Mediterranean's sharpest trading cities. Now that Lebanon has settled into peace after its bloody civil war, trade is picking up. The UK last week renewed export insurance cover to Lebanon for the first time since 1977. At the same time Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was in London selling the country's Dollars 10bn reconstruction plans. The French and Italian governments are also taking a positive view of Lebanese prospects. Post-civil war Beirut is not the prettiest place to do business - though the blocks of hollowed and lacerated buildings are morbidly fascinating. Neither is it the most efficient. The telephone system can sometimes leave you yearning nostalgically for the Phoenicians' pigeon post, and some trips across town at rush hour are best undertaken in the company of a fat novel and a mask to filter the petrol fumes. But it is safe enough. There has been no shooting or shelling since 1990, and there is no longer any hostage-taking. But visitors ought not to tempt providence. Roaming around the Hizbollah enclave of Beirut's southern suburbs, for instance, would excite suspicion, while jogging its streets in a stars-and-stripes sweatshirt would not be a good idea. There is no cause to be too nervous of men in fatigues with guns, who are everywhere, along with the odd armoured car or tank. Lebanese and Syrian army checkpoints are also common, though usually offer no impediment. However, soldiers in Beirut do not like being photographed. And you should carry a passport, particularly at night or when leaving the city. Getting around Beirut is fairly straightforward. Battered Mercedes cabs are easy to find in the centre and short hops cost only a dollar or two (just about everything in Beirut can be paid for in dollars; taxis, restaurants and many shops will quote you dollar prices first). Most drivers speak some English and know their way around. But get the directions clear, or ask the hotel to write them down. For a series of morning meetings, cabs can be hired from the hotels. Rates, which can be exorbitant, are directly related to your ability to bargain - a pricing principle that applies to most transactions. A common charge is about Dollars 35 for a morning. Grabbing a cab on the street is always cheapest, but if you are going far from the centre, ask the driver to wait. Getting to Beirut is also becoming easier - aircraft arrivals were up 26 per cent in the third quarter of last year and are rising. The airport is simple but effective, and historians will enjoy the sight of Middle East Airlines' fleet, which still includes a few doughty 707s. In most airports in the developing world, the degree of delay, intrusiveness, bloody-mindedness and bureaucracy at the airport is often a good indicator of things to come. Beirut scores suitably high on the no-nonsense scale. Once there, despite the obliteration of Beirut's more upmarket hotels during the war, accommodation is comfortable if not always lavish. The seafront Summerland and Coral Beach Hotels are reckoned to be the city's most plush, and cost from Dollars 150 a night. In and around Hamra Street in west Beirut, the Bristol and slightly cheaper Cavalier and Mayflower Hotels offer good rooms and excellent service. And, at the Bristol and Cavalier at least, there are direct-dial, international phone lines, at about Dollars 7 a minute to the UK. Telephone calls are Beirut's chief headache. The old rotary exchanges are hopelessly inefficient and will stay so until 500,000 contracted new lines are installed over the next year or so. Reaching an outside line from a hotel can, on occasion, take about half an hour. Dialling some 'difficult numbers' in different areas of the city is often only an exercise in finger abuse. Many Beirutis, therefore, have portable phones that use US networks, which means dialling through New York to speak to someone across town. Such calls must be among the most crackly per dollar/minute in the world. To cheer yourself up after a frustrating phone call, you could visit one of Beirut's restaurants. Lebanese food is, as the locals will keep reminding you, the best in the region. Traditional mezze dishes, such as hummous, babaganoush and tabouleh, are generally freshly prepared. Seafood is excellent. Locals consider Nasr, Yildizlar, el Pasha and Istambouli among the best places to eat. There are several good Italian restaurants, including the Spaghetteria, and French ones, such as Retro and the Vieux Quartier, which is arguably Beirut's best and certainly its most pricey. Lunch is a pre-eminent business institution. Forget about bringing prospective business partners gifts: offer them a two-hour lunch a la francais and, while being sensitive to your associates' religion, wash it down with a little of Lebanon's respectable wine. Otherwise, there are few rules of business engagement in Beirut that do not apply elsewhere. The city's business community is more cosmopolitan than any other in the Middle East though, as elsewhere in the region, personal contact and trust are at a premium. Most business people speak good English, but the years of French rule have also left an enduring legacy, especially among Beirut's Christians. As for 'baksheesh', Lebanese businessmen are far too sophisticated for any such crude transactions, which is not the same as saying 'commissions' will not be required at some point. For your non-working hours, there is a wider selection of extra-curricular activities than in almost any other Arab capital. These range from casual jazz bars, such as the Blue Note in Ras Beirut and the Soho-style Scoozi's bar-restaurant in Verdun, to the nightclubs of Jounieh, 45 minutes' drive north. Cinemas play newly released, and uncensored western movies. The old souk has been shelled out of existence, and is a focus of Lebanon's ambitious rebuilding plans. But there are plenty of chic western-style shops, with commensurately high prices. As for sport, there is that old Lebanese chestnut about being able to ski in the morning and swim in the afternoon. The determined visitor can indeed do so for part of the year: either on ski-threateningly thin snow, or in life-threateningly cold water, or probably both. Executives who consider this a vital part of their trip might more comfortably try Vancouver. There are, however, both beaches and ski resorts less than an hour's drive from Beirut which are pleasant enough to enjoy on their own at the suitable time of year. Swimmers should be aware, however, that Lebanon's laisser-faire waste-disposal policies are thought by some to have led to nuclear waste being ejected into the sea. There are few other hazards confronting business visitors to Beirut. The comforts of the city - which Life magazine described in 1966 as 'Las Vegas-Riviera-St Moritz flavoured with spices of Araby' - are being restored. It will be at least two or three years, however, before the government's redevelopment plans create the nucleus of a banking and financial centre, and perhaps 20 years before the current artists' impressions materialise into a shiny new Mediterranean city. All that, of course, also depends on a broader Middle East peace settlement. But Lebanese businesses, at least, are trying not to let the vagaries of that hold them back.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: London Attention in the gilt markets this week will focus on the timing of the next UK base rate rise. With few major events expected, domestic factors are likely to drive gilt movements. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, hold their regular monthly monetary meeting on Wednesday. Expectations have risen that rates will be raised at this meeting. But many economists suspect that a rise is more likely to be delayed until January. Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets says: 'The politics of putting up interest rates just before Christmas are very awkward. Also I can't believe that the Bank would want to imply that it did not approve of the last budget.' Ms Katy Peters of Daiwa also believes a rate rise is less likely this month. As she says: 'The budget's inflation forecast means there will have to be some quite aggressive tightening. But I think the markets have already priced in a move.' Meanwhile, Wednesday's auction of 10-year gilts will be watched closely for indications of the level of gilt demand. Today's figures on November's M0, the narrowest measure of money supply, are not expected to have much impact although many economists expect them to show the annual growth rate has slowed.</p>

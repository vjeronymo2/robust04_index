			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Slow US growth weighs on Bush PRESIDENT George Bush flew his faltering re-election campaign to Texas and California yesterday, weighed down by the excess baggage of a US economy that continues to disappoint. He left Washington as the Commerce Department reported preliminary estimates that gross domestic product in the second quarter of this year had expanded at a real annual rate of only 1.4 per cent, less than half the revised 2.9 per cent increase of the first three months. Earlier estimates for first quarter growth had been 2.7 per cent. In Texas, the president conceded that 'the economy is not growing fast enough' but he added, 'we should resist the urge to exaggerate our problems.' Senior administration officials hold to the prediction that growth would average an annualised 3 per cent in the second half of the year. Mr Bush insisted: 'We've got to act now to guarantee that." But, in yet again blaming the Democrats in Congress for 'dillying and dallying' over his economic recovery plan, he offered no new policy solutions to an economic problem that is seriously undermining his electoral chances. It is providing the surging campaign of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, with ammunition and it is inducing some Republican conservatives to start demanding that Mr Bush step down, rather than ditch Vice-President Dan Quayle, as others have suggested. In fact, on Wednesday night, the Senate Finance Committee agreed a Dollars 21.8bn tax bill containing some elements proposed by the president, among them the creation of 25 urban enterprise zones, a 15 per cent tax allowance on new investment undertaken over the next year and a Dollars 2,500 tax credit for new home buyers. Excluded, however, was a general capital gains tax cut which Mr Bush had favoured. Lex, page 16</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Laughing Gas While the Monopolies and Mergers Commission reports appear to give British Gas a framework for the next decade, the company can not act on it yet. The Department of Trade and Industry is clearly in favour of early competition, but the MMC proposals would delay a free-for-all in the domestic market beyond 2000. That alone is enough to cast doubt on whether the recommendations will be accepted. The limbo for British Gas shareholders will thus last a few months longer - hence yesterday's cautious share price response. Still, working on the assumption that the DTI votes in favour of the changes, shareholders have several reasons to be pleased. Overall, the essence of the MMC's conclusions is that if a more competitive market structure is to be introduced, customers, rather than British Gas's shareholders, should bear the cost. In the absence of a genuine competition, the MMC panel would seem to have awarded British Gas an away win. In the central recommendation on divestment of its trading activities, British Gas has been left with a viable business which it can sell or demerge, and which faces only limited further competition in the next few years. It could easily have been required to lose market share without compensation. The company is also being allowed to pass on the costs of restructuring its business to customers. The price cap on the total business has also been eased, bringing in an additional Pounds 300m of profits over three years to make up for last year's reduction of the tariff threshold. When the transport and trading businesses are finally separated, British Gas will be able to charge the demerged trading company at the rate currently charged to third parties. Its pipeline business will then be making profits of at least Pounds 800m a year. With the higher rate of return on new assets, British Gas's overall rate of return will climb as it invests in new pipes, as will its profits as the capital employed in the business grows. The delay in competition will also increase value for Gas's shareholders - either by boosting the price of the trading arm if it is sold, or protecting its profits if it is demerged. All of which leaves British Gas in a better position than it was last August, albeit somewhat short of the peaches and cream paradise the company was seeking. The dividend looks secure, though given that finances will remain tight, and the company is some distance short of its target of a twice-covered payout, any dividend increases are likely to be slow. That said, the 45 per cent yield premium to the market looks too high, even though other utilities have higher dividend cover. All the more so since many of them are just about to go through the regulatory mill.</p>

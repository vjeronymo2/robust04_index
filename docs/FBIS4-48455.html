			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 18 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler said on  Wednesday he would be available to run South Africa's next  election if he was asked. The judge was speaking at the IEC's  final media briefing at the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters on  Wednesday.    He made his remarks as several hundred election monitors  gathered outside the IEC's offices demanding a bonus of up to  7,000 R[rand] each for overtime worked and for having helped to  provide a free and fair election.    The day-long demonstration was just one of several that have  occurred throughout the country in the wake of an election  characterised by chaos and allegations of irregularities.    The judge said he would recommend that a skeleton IEC be  kept  running until the next elections due in 1999 and that these  elections should not be run by a government department.    He said it was imperative that a voters' roll be prepared.    Asked whether he would be available to run the next  elections, Mr. Kriegler said: "Yes, if they want me again. I  think I've learnt too much to fall down the drain. If they are  unwise enough to ask me again, I would probably be available,"  he said.    Mr Kriegler said he wanted to clear any mispreceptions that  the final result came from haggling between the political  parties and not from the IEC's own counting efforts. He said  while parties had entered discussions on irregularities, the  final results reflected what the IEC had counted. "The results  we announced were totally and wholly based on our own count  through our backup system," he said.    His deputy, Pretoria Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, said he  would  not be available to help with the next elections. "It was a  challenging job and we enjoyed it," he said. He said the IEC  had delivered to South Africa a new president and a new  parliament. "We did it," he said.    Mr Moseneke, meanwhile, has been offered election monitoring  posts in countries around the world, among them Mozambique,  Denmark and Malawi.    The IEC will prepare a final electoral and financial report  by the end of June.</p>

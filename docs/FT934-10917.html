			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Observer: The foaming Tiber It was a visibly shaken Carlo De Benedetti who made his way yesterday to a grilling in Rome's Regina Coeli prison on the shores of the Tiber. The Olivetti chairman, fighting a separate legal battle over a six-year sentence for his role in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano in the 1980s, faced questions about kick-backs to win public sector contracts, for which the group allegedly paid about L10bn. De Benedetti suffered the first embarrassment earlier this year after being forced to backtrack on previous denials that payments had been made; now, after the transfer of inquiries from magistrates in Milan to those in Rome, comes the stigma of an interrogation in jail. But at least the venue is appropriate. De Benedetti's inquisitors are holding him in a prison that was once a convent - and both the investigating magistrate and the public attorney who want to lead him to the confessional for his putative sins are women.</p>

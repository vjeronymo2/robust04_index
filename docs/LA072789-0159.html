			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: THERE ARE LEANER AND LIGHTER ALTERNATIVES FOR BACK-YARD  BARBECUES  </P> <P> We hate to risk being accused of raining on that great American institution,  the summer barbecue. But as nutritionists, we must point out that hamburgers  and frankfurter, accompanied by macaroni, potato salad and potato chips -- the  stuff of traditional barbecues -- are best reserved for a very occasional  treat.  </P> <P> But hold on, and don't put the grill in storage: Believe it or not, you can  find culinary happiness in alternatives that are lower in fat, calories and  sodium.  </P> <P> These leaner, lighter choices begin with a focus on chicken and fish, both  excellent candidates for the outdoor grill. For chicken, the key to variety  lies in marinades that extend well beyond the usual sauces (invariably some  shade of red) sold in the supermarket.  </P> <P> One favorite, reminiscent of the Caribbean, is a mixture of oil, lime juice and  minced onion seasoned with tarragon and hot pepper sauce. Teriyaki sauce,  seasoned with a little brown sugar and mixed with a few drops of sesame oil,  white vinegar and mustard is another good option to brush onto chicken.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Indian Touch  </P> <P> For a marinade of chicken legs with an Indian touch, season one-quarter cup  each of lemon juice and oil with six cloves of minced garlic, one tablespoon  minced ginger root, one tablespoon ground cumin and several generous dashes of  hot pepper sauce. Indeed, it is possible to grill anything from chunks of white  meat on skewers or pounded breast, brushed lightly with oil, to quarters with  the bone left in. To get the job done more quickly, precook chicken in the  microwave oven.  </P> <P> For fish, the sheer variety of choices, including shellfish such as shrimp and  scallops, and the different combinations of herbs are all you need to create an  endless parade of tastes. The teriyaki mixture we've suggested for chicken goes  equally well on fish, especially tuna steaks and bluefish. The flavor of salmon  steaks may be enhanced with sprinklings of thyme, sage, parsley and pepper  before grilling. If you want to serve it with a sauce, try yogurt with plenty  of minced cucumber folded in and seasoned with dill, grated onion and white  pepper.  </P> <P> Rosemary, lavender leaves, crushed fennel and cumin seeds are another good herb  blend for seasoning fish. And, of course, in the summer months nothing is  better than fresh, chopped basil.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayonnaise Alternatives  </P> <P> As for accompaniments, our program begins with a farewell to mayonnaise. Yes,  it does a nice job of holding potatoes, macaroni, cole slaw and even rice  together, but at around 100 calories a tablespoon, it's a good idea to seek  alternatives. A delicious side dish to go along with chicken is a lentil salad,  popular in France in the summer but rarely seen here. To prepare it, a cup of  lentils, providing six servings, is cooked with an onion stuck with two cloves  and a bay leaf until tender. They are then drained, tossed with a minced onion,  about two tablespoons each of oil and wine vinegar, chopped parsley, a little  salt and freshly ground black pepper.  </P> <P> A rice salad is another neglected option. Cooked rice is simply tossed with a  little oil, lemon juice or wine vinegar, minced parsley and green onions. If  you want more volume for calories, extend the salad by adding sliced water  chestnuts, blanched bean sprouts and some lightly cooked green beans. You might  also try seasoning it with cilantro, or Chinese parsley leaves.  </P> <P> We also recommend a French potato salad, prepared by tossing sliced, small  cooked potatoes with white wine vinegar, a little oil, and seasoning it with  chopped parsley, chives and tarragon.  </P> <P> Grilled vegetables are an increasingly popular feature at barbecues, and that  is all to the good. Easily cooked on skewers or in pans specially designed for  the task (or sometimes right on the grill itself), they require only a slight  brush of oil and, if desired, a strategically chosen herb or two. At a cost of  very few calories they provide taste, color and texture, not to mention  vitamins, minerals and fiber. If you'd rather stick to raw vegetables such as  carrot sticks and pepper rings, or even raw broccoli and cauliflower, try a dip  made by adding a teaspoon of curry powder to a cup of low-fat yogurt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Favor of Fruit  </P> <P> For dessert, we strongly favor fresh fruit. But if you're in the mood for  something more elaborate than a watermelon slice or a bowl of cherries, we  suggest fruit lightly poached in a syrup of equal parts of sugar and water. Our  favorites include nectarines, apricots or peaches served with a puree of  raspberries or strawberries. And if you're feeling extra fancy, a small bit of  liqueur goes a long way toward enhancing the flavor.  </P> <P> As you can see, it's well within your grasp to eat festive, outdoor meals  without either throwing nutritional principles out the window or sacrificing  the great tastes of summer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Metamucil Fares Well in Cholesterol Study  </P> <P> Question: I recently heard on the radio that a "bulking agent" commonly used to  promote normal bowel movements also lowers cholesterol. Is that true?  </P> <P> Answer: Results of recent studies do suggest that psyllium hydrophilic  mucilloid, more familiar as Metamucil, does lower serum cholesterol. Psyllium  is a water-soluble, gel-forming fiber derived from the husks of blond psyllium  seeds. It belongs to a group of soluble fibers that include gums, pectins,  mucilages and certain hemicelluloses that have been shown to lower serum  cholesterol.  </P> <P> In the trial reported most recently, a group of men and women with mild to  moderate elevation of serum cholesterol were placed on the National Cholesterol  Education Program's "Step One Diet" to reduce serum cholesterol. On that diet,  30% of the calories come from fat, 55% from carbohydrate and 15% from protein.  It provides no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily.  </P> <P> After 12 weeks, subjects judged appropriate to the trial were divided into two  groups. One group was given packets of Metamucil, the other an inert cellulose  fiber. They were instructed to take the fiber in water three times a day before  meals.  </P> <P> The group adhered to the regimen remarkably well. Compared to those who  received the inert fiber, subjects who took the psyllium achieved an additional  reduction of almost 5% in total cholesterol level, and an 8% reduction in  low-density lipoprotein associated with increased risk of heart attack.  Moreover, the use of psyllium did not have adverse effects on other important  health indicators, among them blood pressure, blood sugar levels and HDL  cholesterol levels, associated with decreased risk of heart attack.  </P> <P> Some subjects did suffer mild gastrointestinal complaints, but these were  considered transient and minor. None was serious enough to require  discontinuation of treatment.  </P> <P> The authors of this study, which was conducted at the Hennepin County Medical  Center in Minneapolis, Minn., were frank to point out that the amount of  soluble fiber can be increased by diet, and they emphasize that the psyllium  seed was used in addition to a diet for lowering serum cholesterol. The  decision to use Metamucil as a cholesterol-lowering adjunct to your diet should  be made only after a discussion with your physician to determine if it is  appropriate.  </P> <P> Q: Can you tell me how to choose one of the "preferred" margarines, if one is  trying to control serum cholesterol?  </P> <P> A: The nutrition-labeling panel is the best guide. Directly below the number of  grams per serving, on most margarines you will find two other numbers. The  number next to the "p" is for the amount of polyunsaturated fat it contains;  the "s" is for the amount of saturated fat. To select those you describe as  "preferred," choose among the many options where the amount of polyunsaturated  is larger than the amount of saturates. And, the larger the better. The two  numbers will not add up to the total amount of fat, because the margarines also  contain monounsaturates.  </P> <P> People often inquire about why margarines advertised as "rich in  polyunsaturates" contain a more saturated fat, such as partially hydrogenated  soybean oil, as the second ingredient. The explanation is simply that, without  it, you would have liquid oil, not solid margarine.  </P> <P> Q: I have always avoided buying meats packaged in heavy plastic wrap. While the  price is often less than for meats in standard packaging, I have been put off  by the unusually dark color. I assumed that it meant either that it was a lower  grade of meat or that additives had been added to prolong freshness. While  staying with a friend recently, she bought and served a large piece of  vacuum-packed meat. It tasted perfectly fine, but before I'm sold on it I'd  like an explanation for the color difference.  </P> <P> A: The dark color indicates neither a quality difference nor the use of  additives. It is the result of a lack of exposure of the meat to oxygen.  </P> <P> The type of cuts you are describing are called subprimals. Whole beef carcasses  are usually split into five large primal cuts, which are then divided into  subprimals. Most beef is now cut into subprimals at the packing plant,  vacuum-packed immediately and shipped to the supermarket. Those available  directly to consumers are usually the best parts of those cuts, with much of  the bone and other waste already trimmed.  </P> <P> When the package is opened, the meat "blooms" -- turning the bright color with  which you are familiar. Vacuum-packed meats do have an odor, described as sour  or off when opened, but it disappears within an hour after opening. These meats  have not been previously frozen, so they can be stored in the freezer as is or  cut into smaller pieces and repackaged.  </P></p>

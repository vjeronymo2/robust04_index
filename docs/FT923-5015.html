			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Bonn's policies undermining business, warns industry chief MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has lost contact with the German business community, and current government policies will sooner or later ruin the economy, a prominent industry leader said yesterday. The resignation this week of Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of BDI, the federation of German industry, showed the gravity of this 'disastrous development', said Mr Dieter Harthe, chief executive of the federation of medium-sized businesses, BVMW. Instead of working with industry to develop sound financial and economic policies, the government produced a 'constant flow of half-baked ideas'. Mr Kohl thought Germany's Mittelstand of around 300,000 medium-sized companies was good only for paying taxes and listening to his sermons, Mr Harthe added. The collective experience and knowledge of the BVMW's membership was not being used. 'The government keeps on demanding better performance (from industry) without creating the necessary policy framework. That in the end will break the economy's back,' he said. Mr Harthe's comments reflect widespread nervousness about the economic downturn and the government's apparent paralysis, and indicates how far Mr Kohl's stock has fallen in business circles. His popularity among the electorate, especially in eastern Germany, is also in rapid decline. The chancellor's lack of interest in business is well-documented, but it has led, perhaps inevitably, to his being singled out as the main target for industry's venom as the economy has weakened. The Bundesbank, the German central bank, is also understood to be concerned about the lack of co-ordination in Bonn's fiscal and economic policies. A recent flow of ideas for boosting the economy, including proposals for tax changes, road tolls and suggestions of forcing non-investing high earners to buy government bonds to support the east, has compounded the impression that Bonn is uncertain of how to conduct its economic policy. Mr Weiss, meanwhile, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the cause of his resignation was an internal dispute within the BDI federation. During his 20 months in office, the federation had maintained good contacts with 'ministers important to us', he said.</p>

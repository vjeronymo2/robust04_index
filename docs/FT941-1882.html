			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Visa forms global 'electronic purse' consortium Visa International, the international payments group, and a number of bank-led groups from around the world have agreed to work together on common standards for so-called 'electronic purse' cards - payment cards which could replace small-value cash transactions. The consortium includes groups based in Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Taiwan and the US, all of which have been working independently on cards which incorporate electronic chips. The aim is to agree a common specification for the cards, so that different cards could all be 'swiped' through a single terminal at a retailer's desk, Visa said. Unlike credit or debit cards, electronic purse cards would act like cash. The value stored on a card would be reduced with each purchase, and they could be recharged by debiting a user's account. Issuers of cards hope they will replace most small cash purchases. The Visa-led consortium does not include groups in Australia and Singapore that are developing their own smart payment cards, or a UK-based venture announced recently between National Westminster and Midland called Mondex. Visa said it hoped these groups would join in, along with MasterCard, the rival international payments group.</p>

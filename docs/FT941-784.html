			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / S Africa unveils steps to keep fiscal discipline South Africa yesterday unveiled temporary measures aimed at maintaining fiscal discipline in the country's public finances until a new government can draw up a budget after next month's first all-race elections. The measures seek to maintain the course set by the 1992-93 budget as well as meeting the fiscal and monetary policy requirements to which the multiparty Transitional Executive Council (TEC) agreed in a letter of intent it signed as a prerequisite for obtaining a Dollars 850m (Pounds 579m) loan from the International Monetary Fund in late 1993. In a demonstration of the co-operation in South Africa's transition to democracy, the TEC and the Department of Finance unveiled the measures jointly. In the past, the annual budget had been presented to parliament in mid-March. No new date has been set, but the 1994-95 budget is likely to be promulgated by a newly elected national assembly several months into the current fiscal year. The TEC has decided to use existing legislation which allows government departments to spend 45 per cent of the previous year's budget allocation in the first four months of the new fiscal year, and 10 per cent a month thereafter up to a ceiling equal to the previous year's allocation. Mr Estian Calitz, director-general of the Department of Finance, said this mechanism allowed for redistribution of expenditure within departments as long as overall government spending did not exceed these limits. Total government spending is projected to rise by 8.3 per cent to R124.8bn (Pounds 24bn) in 1994-95 from R115.2bn the previous year, a small decline in real terms. South Africa's inflation rate averaged 9.7 per cent in calendar 1993; latest figures released yesterday showed the February figure unchanged from January's 9.9 per cent. Revenue was projected to climb faster to R98.7bn from R90.1bn, to produce a lower deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product of 6.4 per cent, against 6.8 per cent in 1992-93. Considering the projections were based on an unchanged tax regime and included estimates of one-off costs such as financing the election, the 'underlying deficit' was closer to the 6 per cent target identified in the letter of intent to the IMF, Mr Calitz stressed. Mr Tito Mboweni, African National Congress representative on the TEC's finance sub-council, said the presentation of budgetary guidelines and a fiscal overview of the economy 'underscored the management of the transition process'. The presentation was made to the National Economic Forum, representing government, business and organised labour, as well as representatives of local financial institutions. 'A balance has had to be found between two imperatives,' Mr Mboweni said. The transitional administration had to ensure continuity of services and sound fiscal management through the interim period, while taking into account the 'new policies and priorities' a new government would want to address in its first budget.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tirana, January 7 (ATA) -- The leading council of  the Party for Democratic Prosperity [PPD] in Macedonia, the  biggest party of the Albanians in this former Yugoslav Republic,  examined in one of its meetings the problem of the education of  the Albanians in Macedonia. It asked for new possibilities for  their education, because the number of the Albanians enrolled in  schools in Macedonia is small.    The juridical commission of this party is working to prepare  a draft law for the creation of private higher schools to be  presented to the Macedonian parliament. There is hope that this  parliament may help solve the problem of education in the  Albanian language in Macedonia.</p>

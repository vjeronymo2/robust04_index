			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Fall in RPI boosts hopes of lower rates: Retail sales growth remains disappointing A SHARP DROP in inflation last month, together with disappointing growth in shop sales, yesterday revived hopes that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will cut interest rates around Budget day. Intense price competition, particularly among food retailers, pulled the retail prices index down by 0.1 per cent in October, cutting the annual rate of inflation to 1.4 per cent last month from 1.8 per cent in September. As a further sign of falling inflationary pressure in the UK, BP yesterday announced it was cutting petrol prices by 9p a gallon, 2p a litre. Underlying inflation - the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments - also dropped 0.1 per cent on the month, returning the year-on-year rate of underlying inflation to a 25-year low, reached in May, of 2.8 per cent. This compares with 3.3 per cent in the year to September and the government's target ceiling of 4 per cent. The fall in the headline rate means that inflation has now been below 2 per cent for 10 consecutive months, the longest run below this level since 1960. The sluggish picture on prices coincided with and reflected other official figures that showed retail sales growth slowing in October. Together the figures underlined the patchiness of the recovery and consumers' reluctance to spend. Last month retail sales volumes rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent compared with the previous month to stand 3.2 per cent higher than a year ago. This was the lowest year-on-year rate of growth for five months. Share prices rose on heightened expectations that bank base rates may be cut from the 6 per cent level set in January. The FT-SE 100 share index closed up 22.5 at 3,120. Gilts prices rose about a point in response to the low inflation figures. But interest rate speculation hit sterling, which closed in London down a pfennig at DM2.5175 and fell almost a cent to Dollars 1.477, before regaining some ground in New York. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said the figures showed the UK had a 'once in a generation' opportunity to break out of inflationary cycles. 'I really do think it is time we broke out of the British belief that unless we have got inflation we haven't got a buoyant economy,' he said. But the weakness of shop sales is likely to increase pressure on Mr Clarke to minimise further tax rises in the November 30 Budget for fear of damaging demand. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said the inflation and retail sales figures illustrated the weakness of the recovery and called for interest rates to be cut now in the interest of the economy and not when it was politically right for the chancellor. The latest drop in inflation reduces the chance that underlying inflation will breach the government's 4 per cent target ceiling over the next few months. The outlook, according to the Central Statistical Office, is that inflation will remain subdued as big retailers compete to slash prices. The most buoyant area of retail sales was household goods, 2.3 per cent higher in the latest three months, compared with the previous three-month period. Compared with a year ago, they were 10.1 per cent higher. Seasonally adjusted retail sales values rose by 0.1 per cent on the month, and their year-on-year rate slowed to 5.4 per cent in October from 6.1 per cent in September.

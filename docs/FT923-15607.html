			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / China auctions company A bankrupt state company is to be auctioned for the first time in China, writes Yvonne Preston in Beijing. According to the official China Daily, foreign buyers are welcome to bid for Guangchang Color Printing Equipment company, based in Shenzhen, the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong. Bad management and low profits put the company heavily in debt, the newspaper added, and made it the first bankruptcy to occur in Shenzhen, with debts amounting to 2m yuan (Pounds 197,000). Auctioning off the company's property would protect the interests of creditors, the paper said. Past practice has been to hand bankrupt enterprises to government departments.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Brazil renews talks with IMF in hope of stand-by loan BRAZIL yesterday reopened talks with the International Monetary Fund in the hope of obtaining a new stand-by loan pact. Far from a certainty, given the country's continuing economic instability, an IMF accord is crucial for concluding an agreement with foreign bankers over restructuring Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29bn) of commercial debt and for obtaining much-needed new resources. After spending yesterday with IMF staff, Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, will today meet Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, the first encounter between a representative of Brazil's new government and a top Fund official. Mr Haddad is unlikely to get a warm reception. Mr Camdessus has been sympathetic to Brazil but patience with Latin America's biggest economy seems to be wearing thin. The rapid collapse of Brazil's last stand-by accord, agreed in January last year for Dollars 2.1bn, followed nine letters of intent and two accords in 11 years. Talks originally planned for December were cancelled because Mr Haddad had no programme to present. The government is still developing its anti-inflation plan, but Mr Haddad has a little more to show with the recent passage of a fiscal reform bill through the lower house of Congress. Rather than starting from scratch negotiating a new letter of intent, he hopes to adapt the old agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira. It is not likely to be easy. Unlike Mr Moreira, a close friend of Mr Camdessus, Mr Haddad is unknown in Washington, and inflation appears to be moving out of control. Figures released by Sao Paulo University put inflation for January at 27.45 per cent, more than 2 percentage points up on December and more than the previous accord predicted for the whole of this year. Reuter adds from Washington: Mr Haddad said he was seeking Dollars 2bn from the IMF and another Dollars 2bn from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank this year. He said Brazil needed Dollars 1.6bn to guarantee debt restructuring negotiations with foreign banks; Dollars 1bn of that would come out of the agencies' loans and the other Dollars 600m from Brazil's hard currency reserves.</p>

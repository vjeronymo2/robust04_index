			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS TRY TO DEFEND TOP MOSCOW ROLE  </P> <P> Its authority openly challenged and its policies increasingly questioned, the  Communist Party sought Friday to defend its constitutionally guaranteed  "leading role" in the Soviet Union by arguing that moves to reduce its power  would slow the country's political and economic reforms.  </P> <P> The party newspaper Pravda acknowledged in a somber and lengthy editorial over  half of its front page that the party is now facing one of its most severe  trials as it attempts to deal with the country's deepening economic crisis and  to proceed with the reforms amid growing doubts about its ability to lead the  nation and widespread uncertainty about its strategy for change.  </P> <P> Although Pravda admitted the eventual possibility of a different role for the  party in the future, the importance of the editorial was its effort to rally  the party in advance of a crucial meeting today of its policy-making Central  Committee and an equally patent attempt to calm the mounting fears here that  the nation is blundering into a dead end.  </P> <P> Many party members "have lost the will to fight in the face of the multitude of  constantly arising problems," Pravda said. "A mood of insecurity and pessimism  is now prevalent."  </P> <P> The current political atmosphere is unusually contentious, adding to the  atmosphere of crisis and further undermining public confidence.  </P> <P> The Moscow party committee held a special meeting on Friday evening to urge the  party's ruling Politburo to remain "resolute and firm" in its stand and not to  take "hasty and insufficiently considered political decisions." Rumors had been  spread, it said, with the intention of "splitting the party's Central  Committee," but it gave no details.  </P> <P> Two rallies, each organized by party officials, have been held in Leningrad  recently to support the latest reforms. More than 40,000 gathered there this  week to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev against what they said was an  attempt to oust him. At the earlier meeting, Gorbachev was denounced for  carrying reforms too far. "We don't let you kill communism with perestroika,"  one banner warned Gorbachev, attacking his reform program.  </P> <P> Open challenges are growing from nationalists in the Baltic republics of  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan  and Georgia and, to a lesser extent, in Byelorussia, Moldavia and the Ukraine.  </P> <P> The party and its top leadership are expected to come in for sharp criticism  when the Congress of People's Deputies, the national assembly, meets here  Tuesday for its semiannual session.  </P> <P> Radicals, led by Andrei D. Sakharov, a Nobel Peace laureate, and four other  Congress members meanwhile are attempting to organize a nationwide two-hour  symbolic strike, modeled on one last month in Czechoslovakia, to demand  revision of the constitution to end the party's preeminent role in political  life here.  </P> <P> Rumors of a major political shake-up at the Central Committee meeting abound,  having spread across the country more than a week ago -- but without any  consensus on whether liberals or conservatives would win in the implied  showdown today.  </P> <P> The principal item on the Central Committee's agenda is the economy and the  government's efforts to resolve the present problems in the next year or two,  with more fundamental reforms to be phased in over five or six years.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov is scheduled to provide the 250 committee  members with a preview of the five-year, step-by-step program of economic  reform worked out by Leonid I. Abalkin, the vice prime minister in charge of  economic policy, and to seek their approval for it.  </P> <P> But the likely debate will be as much about where the country is headed as  about how it will get there as the realization grows that 1990 will probably  prove to be the decisive year for the success or failure of perestroika and  thus a year that will shape the fate of the country for a long time to come.  </P> <P> The role of the party is an essential element of that debate, and there is an  unprecedented and growing challenge to Article 6 of the Soviet constitution  proclaiming the Communist Party's leadership of the country.  </P> <P> Similar provisions were recently stricken from the Czechoslovak, East German,  Hungarian and Polish constitutions, and the Soviet party is clearly resolved to  stay ahead, if it can, of the nation by demonstrating its leadership.  </P> <P> The Parliament in the Soviet Baltic republic of Lithuania voted this week to  remove this provision from its constitution and re-establish a multi-party  political system there. Armenia, Estonia and Latvia are preparing to do the  same.  </P> <P> "The talk is about destroying this obsolete system, making the party a true  political and ideological fighting force, acting within the limits of the  constitution," Pravda said. "However, one cannot but notice the obvious: under  the cover of 'ultra-radical' ideas, attempts are being made to diminish and, if  possible, devalue the party's authority, to elbow it out of the political  arena."  </P> <P> Such radical moves are winning wide support, Pravda acknowledged, but in  practice they would mean handing over power to the politically ambitious --  people without a clear program for solving the country's problems or even a  commitment to socialism.  </P> <P> The solution, Pravda argued, is not in stripping the party of its pre-eminent  political role -- at least not now in the midst of transition -- by amending  the constitution or shifting all power to elected bodies.  </P> <P> The party would not, as the reforms progressed and its own character changed,  retain forever this privileged position, Pravda said, and these constitutional  provisions could be changed as the whole constitution is rewritten.  </P> <P> "With full certainty, we must declare that we shall not cling to the letter of  the concrete formula," Pravda said in its editorial. "Any constitutional  formula or provision, including Article 6, can be revised and modernized, right  down to its complete removal. This should be done within the framework of the  fundamental and constructive revision of the entire text of the constitution,  and such work has already started.  </P> <P> "But in this connection a question arises: Will a revision of just one article  be feasible? And on an urgent basis, too? We must sort out the issues without  the artificially whipped emotions and irresponsible appeals. We must weigh  whether all this pushing will benefit perestroika."  </P> <P> The party's proper response is to reinvigorate itself, Pravda argued, and to  demonstrate through correct policies its right to lead the country.  </P> <P> "Perestroika needs the party, but a renewed, active and strong party," the  paper said.  </P> <P> Pravda, attempting to rally party members in advance of the elections that  begin on Sunday in the country's 15 constituent republics, admitted that the  party is facing a tough fight but warned against "defeatist attitudes."  </P></p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Mathematical reality concentrates the minds of party leaders: US Democrats beginning to accept the battered presidential front-runner from Arkansas, drawbacks and all AFTER Mr Bill Clinton's victories in the New York, Wisconsin and Kansas primaries on Tuesday, the Democratic Party establishment in Washington is bracing itself at last to acknowledge that the Arkansas governor is virtually certain to be the party's presidential candidate in November. 'There are some rudimentary mathematical realities of the present situation,' said Mr Ron Brown, party chairman, who has tried to have members coalesce quickly behind one candidate so as to begin the battle against President Bush. Those realities are that Mr Clinton has won about 1,264 of the 4,288 delegates who will select the Democratic candidate at the party's convention in New York in July. If he wins half of the delegates still to be allotted in primaries and caucuses - and he should do considerably better in some states, especially Arkansas - and half of the officials and committee members who will attend the convention as super-delegates, he will have assured himself of the 2,145 delegates needed to secure the nomination. If Mr Jerry Brown, former governor of California and the only other Democratic candidate still campaigning, were to win every delegate still uncommitted - a most unlikely proposition - he would fall short of the required total. There remains a remote chance that no clear nominee will emerge, leaving room for party leaders to pick another candidate at the convention, but this is largely a fantasy of Washington pundits and of nostalgic power-brokers who forget that they rewrote the party's rules to make such an outcome near-impossible. Besides, the other possible candidates usually mentioned, such as Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, epitomise the Washington power structures that voters have resoundingly repudiated in state after state. Many Democrats, especially those Congress members whose fortunes in their re-election contests in November will be closely tied to those of their party's presidential candidate, remain uncomfortable. The steady drip of stories about Mr Clinton's problems with marriage, marijuana and the Vietnam war draft has not proved fatal, but has compounded the voting public's discomfort with a candidate who often appears evasive and too clever by half. But the governor has proved himself a tough and resilient campaigner, Also, in the more substantive realm of policy debate, he has scored telling points over Mr Bush. Among the Republicans, the president's road as candidate now appears free of danger, for the rebellion of Mr Patrick Buchanan, the right-wing television commentator who challenged him in the early primaries, has largely subsided. Even so, the administration still appears in disarray. It has struggled to produce statements of policy on the economy and health care, and has appeared unable to follow through on them. While senior Republicans say publicly that they hope Mr Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, because he would be easy to beat, White House officials acknowledge that they have begun to shift their policy stance in recognition of Mr Clinton's emergence as a candidate who could represent the option of change. Yet Mr Bush retains great advantages as an incumbent whose image is already well-formed for voters, most of whom still know little of his probable opponent, Mr Clinton, except that he may or may not have committed adultery and that he may or may not have dodged the Vietnam draft. For both candidates, however, the very low turnout in every primary except that of New Hampshire, the first state to hold one, is the most ominous sign. Both have a lot left to do in order to reach voters.</p>

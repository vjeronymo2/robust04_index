			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits The news that United Biscuits may be experiencing hunger pangs for a Spanish cookie company has unsettled the UK company's shares, if somewhat prematurely. UB stresses its interest in buying the biscuits business of Royal Brands is preliminary. Besides, UB appears well aware of the market's fears about it over-stretching itself following acquisitions in Australia and the US. It promises not to do anything to jeopardise its steady rehabilitation with disappointed shareholders. Nevertheless, UB must be tempted to have a nibble. Royal Brands is an attractive business. Its biscuits arm, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales, may be worth Pounds 100m. In better circumstances, this would hardly be a lot of money for UB. It may, however, prove heavy enough with the company's gearing standing at more than 80 per cent. The suspicion is that Royal Brands' owner, Tabacalera, is trying to entice UB into an auction with RJR Nabisco. It claims the US company has already made a firm offer for half the business. This would be a dangerous game for UB. What Nabisco is playing around at is baffling. After disposing of its European food business following its enormous leveraged buy-out in 1988, Nabisco now appears to be trying to build it all back up again. At least it can claim some familiarity with Royal Brands' biscuits division. It sold it to Tabacalera.</p>

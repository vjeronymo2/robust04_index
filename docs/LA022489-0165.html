			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 18-YEAR DEPUTY HELD IN PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS  </P> <P> A sheriff's deputy arrested in connection with a series of prostitute murders  in South-Central Los Angeles was identified today as Rickey Ross, 40, a  narcotics investigator who has been with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department for 18 years.  </P> <P> Ross, who had been smoking a substance believed to be cocaine with a prostitute  when he was arrested about 1:30 a.m. Thursday, was under investigation in the  murders of three street walkers in the area where at least nine prostitutes  have been killed recently, police said.  </P> <P> Ross was spotted with the woman in his unmarked car by police officers  patrolling South-Central Los Angeles, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said at a  news conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> At Least Nine Murders  </P> <P> Police have been investigating a recent series of slayings in the area of at  least nine and possibly as many as a dozen "strawberries" -- women who trade  sex for drugs -- since August, 1985.  </P> <P> A gun was recovered from Ross' car, and after a ballistics test linked the gun  to the three killings, Ross was placed under arrest by investigators who had  accompanied him to his home in the San Bernardino County city of Rialto.  </P> <P> Gates said the woman in the car had no indication that Ross was a deputy.  </P> <P> "He did not stop her (by) using his badge," Gates said. "He only identified  himself (as a deputy) after the officers stopped him."  </P> <P> Police were investigating whether Ross was linked to the other recent slayings,  Gates said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said Ross, married with two children,  ages 20 and 5, is currently assigned to a unit at Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> "He has a very fine record," Block said. "He has been a very effective  investigator in the narcotics bureau."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Known to Be a Prostitute  </P> <P> The name of the woman in the car with Ross was not released. A police news  release said she was a prostitute. Gates said she told officers that she was  getting scared before they arrived because she had been "well briefed" by  police on the area's killings.  </P> <P> The woman told investigators "simply that he (Ross) wanted to go to the trunk  of his vehicle," Gates said.  </P> <P> The gun that was recovered was in the trunk, although the woman didn't know  that.  </P> <P> A 77th Street Division police unit on routine patrol spotted Ross' car parked  near the Harbor Freeway and Gage Avenue. The car pulled away from the curb in  an "erratic" manner as the police officers approached and they made a traffic  stop, the chief said.  </P> <P> The officers alleged that Ross was under the influence of an intoxicating  substance. Gates said the woman told investigators they had been smoking  cocaine but he noted that tests were still being conducted to confirm the type  of substance.  </P></p>

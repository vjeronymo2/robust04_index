			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Shulyar, chief editor of INFO-TEK news </F> agency: "Will the Switch-Off Effect Work? Fuel and Energy  Complex: Two Months' Results"]    [Text] Despite the extremely grave financial crisis, the  explosive situation in mining regions, the prestrike situation  of the Tyumen oil workers, and the unusually cold February --  despite all these factors, Russia's fuel and energy complex is  continuing to operate in fairly stable conditions. The  reduction in energy resource production volumes is comparable to  the rate of decline in 1993.    This is demonstrated by current data on the work of the  Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the first two months of  this year submitted by sector structures (see table).    The decline in oil extraction, not counting extraction by  joint enterprises, corresponds approximately to last year's  level -- 12-14 percent. Among major joint-stock oil companies,  "Surgutneftgaz" has seen the smallest reduction (20 percent).    Regarding gas extraction, the picture is more rosy: Some of  the decline (0.4 percent) is taking place at the expense of oil  extraction associations, whereas the "Gazprom" Russian  Joint-Stock Company has actually increased extraction slightly  in comparison with last year (by 116 million cubic meters). Two  associations that are not part of the "Gazprom" Russian  Joint-Stock Company have increased extraction by even larger  amounts -- the "Norilskgazprom" state enterprise (by 3 percent)  and "Yakutgazprom" (by 12 percent).    During January and February 1994 exports of Russian oil  outside the Commonwealth were a few percentage points lower than  last year's level, amounting in absolute terms to 11.5 million  tonnes (about 20 percent of extraction). Russian gas exports to  countries outside the Commonwealth was maintained at last year's  level of 17.8 billion cubic meters (or 17 percent of extraction).    Owing to the insolvency of consumers in the former USSR  republics, volumes of oil and gas deliveries to these consumers  have continued to decline. The former republics' debts for  energy resources supplied as of 1 February 1994 were already 2.5  trillion rubles [R], of which R1.5 trillion are owed by Ukraine  (including R1.2 trillion for supplies of natural gas), and R390  billion are owed by Belarus (of which R310 billion are for gas).    The overall snowballing of the amount owed by consumers of  the fuel and energy complex, which has already passed the  R16-trillion mark, is bringing the complex to a standstill. It  has no choice but to take the traditional chance that the  debtors will pay up, or...shut off the oil spigots and gas  valves on the pipes, which is what the "Gazprom" Russian  Joint-Stock Company has already partially done in relation to  Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. It seems that this "incentive"  for drawing partners into true market relations is starting to  work.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |February actual figure          |January-February                |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |          |1994      |1993      |percent   |1994      |1993      |percent   |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Extractio-|22.5      |27.5      |81.9      |49.8      |57.9      |86.1      |  |n of oil  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |and gas c-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |ondensate |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |million t-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |onnes exc-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |luding ex-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |traction  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |by joint  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |enterpris-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |es        |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Extractio-|51.6      |52.1      |99.2      |108.8     |109.2     |99.6      |  |n of gas  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |billions  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |of cubic  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |meters    |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Extractio-|24.3      |26.6      |91.4      |49.0      |53.4      |91.7      |  |n of coal |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |million t-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |onnes     |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Electrici-|71.8      |74.6      |96.2      |146.5     |154.0     |95.1      |  |ty produc-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |tion acco-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |rding to  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |Ministry  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |of Fuel a-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |nd Energy,|          |          |          |          |          |          |  | billions |          |          |          |          |          |          |  |of kilowa-|          |          |          |          |          |          |  |tt hours  |          |          |          |          |          |          |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

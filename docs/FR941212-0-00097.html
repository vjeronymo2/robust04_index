			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) Is for rent, damage, or other payments involving the acquisition, use, possession, or disposition of real property or interests therein by and for the DA, except as authorized by &sect;536.50(b). Real estate claims founded upon contract are generally processed under AR 405&hyph;15. (See DA PAM 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;46.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Is not in the best interests of the United States, is contrary to public policy, or is otherwise contrary to the basic intent of the governing statute (10 U.S.C. 2733); for example, claims by inhabitants of unfriendly foreign countries or by or based on injury or death of individuals considered to be unfriendly to the United States. When a claim is considered to be not payable for the reasons stated in this paragraph, it will be forwarded for appropriate action to the Commander, USARCS, together with the recommendations of the responsible claims office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war or engaged in armed conflict with the United States, or any country allied with such enemy country unless the appropriate settlement authority determines that the claimant is and, at the time of the incident, was friendly to the United States. A prisoner of war or an interned enemy alien is not excluded as to a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property in the custody of the Government otherwise payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Is for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard or a civilian employee that is incident to his or her service (10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(3)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Is listed in &sect;536.75, except for claims listed in &sect;536.75(n) and (r). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims having multiple remedies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Claims cognizable under other subparts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Claims based upon a single act or incident cognizable under this subpart and subparts H or K will be first considered under the latter subparts; if not payable under any of those subparts, the claim will be considered under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A claim may not be paid under this subpart if it is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act (subpart E) or the Foreign Claims Act (subpart J). (See 10 U.S.C. 2733(b)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Where a Status of Forces Agreement or other agreement provides for host country adjudication of a claim, the treaty process may be the claimants exclusive remedy (see subpart G). Where a foreign country is responsible for adjudication of the claim under the terms of such an agreement, it may not be paid under the provisions of this subpart. If the foreign country refuses to recognize legal responsibility for the claim, or to consider it under applicable treaty provisions, the chief of a command claims service or, where the estimated value of the claim is within USARCS authority, the Commander, USARCS may authorize adjudication of the claim under this subpart. The mere fact a foreign country fails to pay the claims on its merits is not sufficient basis for invoking this authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Claims based upon multiple acts or theories of liability. Where claims cognizable under this subpart are based upon more than one act or injury and where one or more of the acts or injuries are also cognizable under the FTCA (subpart D) (for example, claims alleging acts of medical malpractice both in a foreign country and in the United States or claims alleging negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), the claims will be processed as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Meritorious claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is not cognizable under subpart D, the claim may be considered and paid under this subpart. However, the settlement agreement must expressly release the United States from any further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim is over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS prior to final action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the primary cognizable act or incident upon which the claim is based is cognizable under subpart D, the claim will be first considered under subpart D. If the claim is determined by proper authority to be nonmeritorious under subpart D but meritorious under this subpart (for example, negligence occurred overseas but none occurred in the United States or there is no negligence in the conduct of a noncombat activity), it may be considered and paid under this subpart. However, an agreed settlement must be reached that expressly releases the United States from further liability under the FTCA or any other statute or regulation for all acts or incidents upon which the claim was based. If the claim was presented in an amount over $25,000, any proposed settlement will be coordinated with USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Nonmeritorious claims. Where claims are based upon multiple acts or incidents, some or all of which may be cognizable under subpart D (Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)), extreme care will be taken prior to any disapproval based upon this subpart. Whether a claim is covered by Cognizability under the FTCA is a litigable issue. Such claims will be disapproved under this subpart only as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A claim presented in an amount not over $25,000, may be disapproved by an office with settlement authority having jurisdiction over the claim only if the claim is determined to be nonmeritorious under both this subpart and subpart D; however the disapproval procedures established in subpart D must be fully satisfied. In such cases, the disapproval notification will advise the claimant of his or her concurrent rights to appeal the disapproval under this subpart or to institute suit under the FTCA. (See &sect;536.63.) In case of doubt concerning the applicability of this paragraph, the question will be referred to USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT LAND-USE PLAN APPROVED BY SENATE  </P> <P> The Senate on Thursday approved and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian a bill to  temporarily exempt cities in Los Angeles County from a tough new law designed  to ensure orderly growth around airports, including those in Palmdale, Van Nuys  and Burbank.  </P> <P> Current law, which took effect this year, requires the county to formulate  comprehensive land-use plans for 17 airports by June 30, 1991.  </P> <P> Until plans are completed, cities are required to apply to the county for  approval of major construction projects as far as two miles from airports.  </P> <P> Under the bill, approved 32 to 1, the county's deadline to complete the plans  would be extended six months and cities would be exempted from asking the  county for a project-by-project review.  </P> <P> Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach), who authored the bill, said it  would provide extra time for the county to prepare the plans to ensure that  building projects near airports are compatible with flight traffic.  </P> <P> Among the supporters of the exemption are the League of California Cities and  Palmdale.  </P></p>

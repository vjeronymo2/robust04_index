Their papers include calls for the earliest possible start  of  channelling of southern China's rich water resources into North  China, strengthening of agricultural production and grass-roots  education, opening up of a Euro-Asia economic zone, and ways to  address the situation in Taiwan.    He said that the democratic parties' proposals have greatly  helped the Chinese Communist Party's work, as they are the  results of actual investigation and meet many of the needs of  reform and opening.    He said that by offering such advice, the democratic parties  have effectively given their roles full play in discussing and  participating in the country's political affairs, and made new  contribution to country's modernization drive.</p>

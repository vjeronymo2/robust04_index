			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Selling wave leaves Taiwan at 7-month low MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets continued to display weakness in the absence of Tokyo, which was closed for a public holiday. TAIWAN closed at a seven-month low on a wave of late selling after the weighted index broke below a support level of 3,800 points. The index fell 44.4, or 1.2 per cent, to 3,782.10, its lowest finish since the 3,775.19 recorded on February 12. Turnover, at TDollars 9.81bn, remained very thin but exceeded the TDollars 9.34bn registered on Tuesday. Sharp falls were seen in finance and electronic shares, sectors which had declined relatively slowly during the market's correction in the past few months. AUSTRALIA continued its downward correction, dragged lower by a weaker Wall Street, hectic futures trading and a heavy fall in News Corp. However, a firmer golds sector, after bullion prices improved overnight, helped to cushion falls in key stocks. The All Ordinaries index finished 9.3 down at 1,903.6 in light turnover of ADollars 422m. A 42-cent drop in the recently strong News Corp to Dollars A10.16 helped to drag the All Industrials index 18.3 lower to 3,002.4, while the All Resources index shed 2.2 to 1,061.3. Elsewhere in the media sector, Telecasters North Queensland jumped 20 cents to Dollars A2.10 on the back of the Ten Group's rise in annual net profits, announced on Tuesday, and its own pre-tax return to the black. TNQ is part of a consortium which owns Ten Group. The gold shares marker recovered 40.8 to 1,743.8 after suffering a setback of about 180 points over the previous two days. Plutonic advanced 20 cents to ADollars 6.20, while Placer Pacific and Homestake each gained 10 cents at ADollars 2.60 and ADollars 1.48 respectively. NEW ZEALAND declined for the fourth consecutive day, led down by forestry issues, but brokers were unable to pinpoint specific reasons for the fall. The NZSE-40 index lost 14.17 at 1,949.05, making a 50-point drop since last Wednesday's close. MANILA finished mixed, but some analysts believed it still looked set for another climb, after Tuesday's profit-taking. The Manila index eased 2.24 to 1,952.16. Manila Electric 'B' shares rose 5 pesos to 277.50 pesos and ABS-CBN, the broadcaster, put on 1 peso at 62.50 pesos. PLDT slipped 20 pesos to 1,360 pesos following an overnight fall on Wall Street. SEOUL suffered a day of lethargic and cautious trading, which left the composite index 3.93 lower at 691.44. Rumours that smaller companies might default on debt obligations also sparked a sell-off in low-priced shares. HONG KONG was firmer, although shares lost most of their morning gains on profit-taking spurred by political and regulatory concerns. The Hang Seng index finished 14.92 higher at 7,488.77. It was up 67.17 points earlier. The market was unsettled by worries that attitudes were hardening in the Sino-British talks in Beijing and by reports that the Commercial Crime Bureau had raided a number of companies as part of an investigation of the Allied Group. Allied Group ended 9 cents down at HKDollars 1.02, Allied Properties lost 15 cents to HKDollars 1.40 and Allied Industries shed 10 cents to 81 cents. Utilities led a blue-chip surge in the morning before falling back. China Light closed 25 cents up at HKDollars 42 and HK Telecom gained 10 cents at HKDollars 12.40. HSBC rose 50 cents to HKDollars 82 and Jardine Matheson also 50 cents to HKDollars 14.92. SINGAPORE was sent lower by profit-taking in highly speculative Malaysian shares which have risen sharply recently. The Straits Times Industrial index retreated 11.14 to 2,001.35. BOMBAY relinquished its early gains on profit-taking and the BSE 30-share index finished 7.16 lower at 2,800.48.</p>

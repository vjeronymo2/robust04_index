			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (20): Mind the tax trap if you take income - Single-premium bonds THE SINGLE-premium bond is the life industry's answer to the unit trust  - with a small amount of life assurance as the icing on the cake. Each insurance company selling investment bonds sets its own minimum for the level of one-off lump sum or single premium to be accepted, generally in a range from Pounds 250 to Pounds 2,500. Charges are similar to those for unit trusts - an initial 5 per cent plus an annual 1 per cent for management. Investment bonds come in three main varieties: With-profits bonds: Last year, investors took a 'safety-first' attitude and poured into with-profits bonds, which add on non-reversible bonuses each year, in a manner similar to with-profits endowments. For example, Norwich Union took Pounds 700m into its with-profits bond, three times the 1990 total, straining its liquidity and threatening future pay-outs to policyholders. The company reacted by pulling down the shutters on future business in the bonds from independent financial advisers, or brokers - in effect a 95 per cent cutback, although NU's tied agents are still allowed to sell the bonds. Unit-linked bonds allow investment in a selection of specialised funds holding gilts, international equities, money-market instruments or property. They offer the facility to switch between funds without incurring entry charges - an advantage over unit trusts. Decisions about switching among the funds may be taken by the investors themselves or turned over to the insurance company or to a broker for a fee. This led to 'broker bonds', carrying the name of the broker making the investment decisions rather than the insurance company holding the money. These were investigated by the Securities and Investments Board, which at first seemed intent on a total ban but then settled for imposing tighter regulations. Unit-linked bonds are commission-heavy. Investors choosing between unit trusts and bonds should realise that, on a Pounds 10,000 investment, this is eqivalent to choosing between an investment paying Pounds 300 in commission (unit trusts) and one paying possibly Pounds 600 (bonds). You are unlikely to be told this. Instead, arguments presented to investors emphasise features such as tax treatment and the costs of switching underlying investments, often ignoring a potentially damaging tax trap. Guaranteed income bonds provide a fixed rate of return for a set number of years, paying back the original capital at the end of the term. A guaranteed growth bond will repay the original capital after a set term plus a specified return on the capital - for example, matching any increase in the FTSE-100 index. But guarantees are always paid for by the investor. Such a guarantee is only a pledge to follow the changes in share prices, taking no account of dividends, which will be pocketed by the insurance company. Interest rate levels have also boosted sales of guaranteed income bonds, with 10 per cent seen as the 'magic' rate, sure to attract large numbers of investors. Brokers are increasingly competing on guaranteed bond rates by using the commission they receive to augment the rate offered by the insurance company. They have plenty of scope to do so. Commission on a Pounds 10,000 guaranteed-income bond could be up to Pounds 150, while some brokers estimate that selling a bond on an 'execution only' basis, without advising an investor costs only about Pounds 10 in form-filling time. The tax position: A basic-rate taxpayer has no income or capital gains taxes to pay on part or complete withdrawals from a bond. Higher-rate taxpayers may be charged 15 per cent tax (the difference between the 40 per cent higher rate and 25 per cent) when a with-profits or unit-linked bond is fully surrendered or cashed in on the death of the holder - the charge would be only on the part of the proceeds exceeding the original premium. But, thanks to the rules on partial withdrawals, even millionaires can remove themselves from the higher-rate tax bracket with the help of investment bonds. Investors can withdraw up to 5 per cent a year of the amount originally invested without having to pay higher-rate tax. This can continue for up to 20 years, when all of the original value has been used up. Although higher-rate tax is due when the bond is finally cashed in, investors are able to claim top-slicing relief on any profit they have made. This works by averaging the profit over the number of years the bond has been in place and adding the result to the investor's income, to arrive at any higher rate tax due. For example, a profit of Pounds 10,000 on a bond fully cashed in 10 years after the original investment, amounts to an average profit of Pounds 1,000 to be added to the investor's income for that final year. The higher-rate tax figure arrived at in this way would be multiplied by 10 to produce the tax bill. The serious catch with investment bonds is that investors who exceed the 5 per cent annual withdrawal can find themselves paying 15 per cent tax on a gain when their bond is showing a loss. An investor who put Pounds 20,000 into a bond before October 1987 could have been left with units worth considerably less three years later. Under the 5 per cent rule, he would have been able to withdraw up to 15 per cent, or Pounds 3,000, from the bond without any immediate tax penalty. But a withdrawal of Pounds 10,000 would land him with a bill for 15 per cent (Pounds 1,050) on his Pounds 7,000 'gain'. Theoretically the tax treatment would even out in succeeding years, though this seems unlikely, given the dent made in the investment.</p>

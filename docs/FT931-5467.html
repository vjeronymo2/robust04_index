			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: France moves to fight bid for OCP THE FRENCH industry ministry has contacted 20 medium-sized drugs groups in a bid to fight off the German takeover offer for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler. In the latest example of direct government intervention to protect French companies from foreign takeover, the ministry is urging the groups to each take 1 per cent of the OCP's capital. The ministry is trying to form a consortium to outbid Gehe, Germany's second largest medicine wholesaler which last month made a FFr1.8bn (Dollars 329m) offer for OCP. Dr Dieter Schadt, chairman of Gehe, said: 'Considering it is 1993 and the start of the single European market, we are simply amazed.' He refused to say whether the group would be willing to pay more for OCP if a consortium made a bid. The identity of the groups that have been approached has not been released but they are not all French. One of the foreigners has expressed a willingness to back the government's move. Paribas, the Paris-based merchant bank, is advising OCP's leading shareholder, the French Bourely family, which opposes the German takeover. Banque Indosuez and Lazard Freres are representing OCP and Gehe respectively. The ministry appears to be having difficulties generating interest. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals unit of the state-owned chemical group, may take part, but does not want to take control of OCP. Laboratories Beaufour, a medium-sized pharmaceuticals group, confirmed that it was ready to participate. However, Elf Sanofi, the drugs arm of the Elf Aquitaine oil group, said it was not interested, as did Laboratoires Servier, a small pharmaceuticals maker.</p>

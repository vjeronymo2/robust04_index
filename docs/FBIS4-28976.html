Our party is excellently carrying out  its mission and duty as a guide of the cause of socialism  because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has strengthened  and developed our party to be the chuche revolutionary party for  the past 30 years since he began to lead our party's work,  regarding the party's leadership as a life line of the cause of  socialism.    Throughout the entire period of leading the revolution and  construction, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published  many immortal classic works and gave perfect answers to the  theoretical and practical problems arising in building the  working-class party. With outstanding and tested leadership, he  led the cause of building our party to a shining victory.    The achievements by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in  the cause of our party building are the greatest of the immortal  achievements he has made in the revolution and construction.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Our party  has firmly adhered to the principles of revolutionary party  building and thoroughly embodied them in party building and  party activities, thereby pioneering a new road of party  building and strengthening and developing our party to be the  chuche revolutionary party that we have today.    The wisdom of the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il with which he has strengthened and developed the WPK  into the chuche revolutionary party of invincible might lies in  his putting forth the policy of modeling the entire party  membership on the chuche idea in conformity with the inevitable  demand of the party's development and energetically leading the  struggle for its realization. Modeling the entire party  membership on the chuche idea is the revolutionary party  building program that makes all the party members who compose  the party enthusiastic chuche-type revolutionaries, firmly  builds the party ranks, and conducts the party work and party  activities thoroughly as required by the chuche ideology,  theory, and method, thus strengthening and developing our party  forever to be the chuche revolutionary party.    Modeling the entire party membership on the chuche idea is  the general objective of our party building, and comprehensively  summed up therein are the strategic task, mission, and method of  our party building.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the  sacred struggle to model the entire party membership on the  chuche idea and made great achievements in the cause of party  building. The achievement the dear comrade leader has made in  strengthening our party is, more than anything else, his  bringing up all the party members to be the core elements of the  revolution and firmly building the party ranks into the militant  ranks of the chuche-type revolutionaries.    The dear comrade leader firmly established the party's  monolithic ideological system by defining the basic line of  party building and saw to it that all the party organizations  persistently keep up and continuously deepen the work. As the  party's monolithic ideological system has been established under  the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, all  the party members have been armed more firmly with the chuche  idea, and the chuche ideological system has been firmly  established in the party.    The dear comrade leader originally defined the basic duties,  contents, and method of the party's ideological work in  conformity with the prevailing development of modeling the  entire society on the chuche idea, and energetically led the  work, thus bringing up all party members to be the core elements  of the revolution.    Under the wise leadership of the dear comrade leader, a new  change has been brought forth in the party's ideological work,  and the party is filled with the revolutionary ethos of  cherishing loyalty as one's revolutionary faith and fidelity,  protecting and defending the party and the leader politically,  ideologically, and at the cost of one's life, and implementing  the party's line and policy unconditionally to the end, prepared  to face any hardship.    Another of the achievements the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il made in strengthening our party is that he has realized  the party's ideological volitional unity and cohesion at the  highest level. Realizing the party's unity and cohesion is the  task of key significance in the revolutionary party building,  and it is an important problem that determines the fate of the  party and the success of the revolution.    Always giving priority to strengthening the party's unity  and cohesion in party building, the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il has brilliantly realized it under the uplifted banner  of unity.    The unity and cohesion our party achieved today are  invincible ones that have made complete, unconditional unity in  ideology, volition, and action, upholding the great leader and  the dear comrade leader as the center of unity. Thanks to the  great unity and cohesion, our party is vigorously pushing ahead  with the socialist cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, as the  vanguard of revolution.    Another of the achievements the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il made in consolidating the party is that he has  thoroughly established the revolutionary work system and iron  discipline within the party. Setting up the well-arranged work  system and iron discipline within the party is a significant  demand of principle arising in the revolutionary party building.  When the well- arranged work system and iron discipline are  set up within the party, the party's militant might can be  strengthened in every way and the party can triumphantly fulfill  its duty and mission as a guide of socialism and communism.    Judging that establishing the revolutionary party work  system  is one of the basic problems in enhancing the party's militant  role and function, and iron organizational discipline within the  party, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has brilliantly  solved this problem.    Ceaselessly changing the method of work in accordance with a  new party work system comes up as an issue of principle in  building the working-class party. Party work and party  activities can be realized through the method of work, and  establishing the revolutionary method of work is of significance  in setting up the party work system.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has set forth an unique  line of carrying out the work with people as a key party work,  and let all problems arising in party building and party  activities be solved through the work with people and the  organizational, political work. The dear comrade leader has  thoroughly embodied the chuche work system and the great  leader-way work system initiated by respected and beloved leader  Comrade Kim Il-song and thus made the great leader's idea and  leadership be brilliantly realized in party work and party  activities.    Paying close attention to setting up anti-Japanese guerrilla  work method in the entire party, the dear comrade leader has  energetically led to improve the work method of the party  organizations and functionaries. As the result of establishing  anti-Japanese guerrilla work method, the revolutionary work  ethos of which functionaries, like commanders of anti-Japanese  guerrilla, go down to the producer masses with a strapsack on  their back; live and work with them; seek a right methodology to  the problem with them for the realization of the presented task;  and set out on work in a big way and push it ahead audaciously.  Hence, the party's features have been newly changed and the  party's method of work and ethos have been fundamentally renewed.    In this way, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has sought  all keys of victory in strengthening the party in the entire  course of leading the work of revolutionary struggle and  construction. He has also achieved brilliant accomplishments in  implementing the cause of building our party by strengthening  the party ideologically, organizationally.    The problem of inheriting the party's revolutionary cause  has  been brilliantly solved. This is the most proud victory  achieved by the cause of building our party. Amid the struggle  for modelling the entire membership on the chuche idea, the  governing body of the party has been firmly strengthened to  inherit our party's idea and leadership, the party's  organizational, ideological basis has been firmly consolidated,  and the party's system of leadership has been established. In  doing so, our party has been further strengthened as a great  party with absolute authority and prestige.

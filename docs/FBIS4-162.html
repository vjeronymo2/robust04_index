			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greg Arda] </F>   [Text] Durban April 2 SAPA -- KwaZulu Police [KZP]  Commissioner Lt-Gen Roy During said on Saturday [2 April] there  was nothing "clandestine" or "sinister" about his force's  attempt to buy guns from Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission].  He described the deal as an "ordinary, above-board business  transaction" and rejected any insinuation it was clandestine.    In a statement, Gen During accused Eskom of backing out of  the deal because it was afraid of dealing with "political  adversaries of the African National Congress". "We find it  ludicrous that any publicity should be given to this matter, and  particular, that any sinister connotations should be ascribed  to, what is considered by us, as an ordinary above-board  business transaction."    Gen During said at no stage did the KZP conceal its identity  as the buyer. The KZP and the "negotiators for both parties were  at all times fully aware of all the circumstances surrounding  the transaction".    Eskom on Friday said it had suspended two employees pending  a  Goldstone Commission investigation into the deal which could  have seen 1,000 weapons sold to the KZP before the transaction  was cancelled by the company.    Gen During said Eskom should have been fully aware that the  arms were destined for the KZP because a signed letter from  himself accompanied a required export permit for the weapons to  a self-governing territory. The deal was done through an  "authorised weapons dealer", he said.    Eskom had been paid for the arms, and although the KZP  considered the company's cancellation of the deal as a  contractual breach, the force had accepted this, Gen During said.    "Representations made by senior Eskom officials to the  effect  that they regarded the matter as a politically sensitive one,"  Gen During said, had led the KZP agreeing to calling off the  deal.    "I'm compelled to conclude that Eskom management fear some  form of reprisal arising from these events and in a pathetic  attempt at exonerating themselves from any blame daring to deal  with the political adversaries of the ANC, they have now  requested the Goldstone Commission to investigate the matter.    "I believe that the Goldstone Commission has far more  important issues at hand with which they should be presently  occupied, other than to sensationalise a matter like this," Gen  During said.</p>

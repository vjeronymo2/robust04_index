He met with the Saeima's  [parliament] deputy chairman, Aivars Berkis, and with  representatives from various fractions. The guest was mainly  interested in the solution of the question of citizenship in  Latvia. Mr. Berkis pointed out that the bill passed in its first  reading is the basis of further work on the bill on citizenship  which should ensure survival of the Latvian nation. At present,  there are 1.7 million citizens in the Republic of Latvia. 79 per  cent of them are Latvians. Max Van der Stoel pointed out that he  understands the necessity of the use of such criteria for  granting citizenship as the knowledge of the Latvian language  and residence in Latvia within a certain number of years.  According to Max Van der Stoel, Latvian citizenship should not  be granted to people who, holding high posts, acted against  Latvia's interests. However, he cannot understand the necessity  of using the system of quotas. At the end of the talk, Mr.  Berkis pointed out that it is impossible to form a two-community  society in Latvia. Max Van der Stoel reminded that in the  previous year, 10,000 representatives from other nationalities  left Latvia and there is no reason for thinking that their  number will increase in future.</p>

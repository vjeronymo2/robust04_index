			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: Festival of Britten with the Nash - Concert The Nash Ensemble's programme in the Festival of Britten may have looked like a filler, but it certainly did not feel lightweight in the event. Rather than relax when they approached small-scale works, both Britten and Shostakovich were as likely just to compress serious thoughts into a more concentrated space. The only joviality on Tuesday at the Barbican Hall came at the beginning. In 1939 Britten supplied incidental music for a BBC radio adaptation of TH White's The Sword in the Stone. The music must have been long forgotten by the time two present-day composers, Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews, dug it out to compile a suite ten years ago, but it was a minor piece of archaeology worth undertaking. This is in no way a great score, not even important; but it is difficult to escape the feeling that Britten was actually enjoying himself. The cock-a-snook parody of famous motifs from Wagner is amusing given the book (the film score to Excalibur hit upon the same idea without the laughs) and there is enjoyment, too, in his use of the chamber ensemble. At this point in his career there was no keeping Britten's inventiveness down. The other Britten piece came from the end of his life: Phaedra, the solo cantata written for Janet Baker, when the composer's energies could not stretch to the opera which was her due. Its intensity, compressing Phaedra's life experience into 15 minutes, was perfectly conceived for the work's creator; less so perhaps for Jean Rigby, although her fine vocal dignity and sense of deep emotion honestly conveyed brought their own rewards. One problem was the need for clearer words, as earlier in Shostakovich's Seven Romances on poems by Alexander Blok. (The Barbican is a difficult venue for intimate works.) Joan Rodgers was the soprano in the Shostakovich, not demanding attention as Vishnevskaya used to, but seducing the listener with more suppliant tone. The music seemed here less hard, less uncompromising than before; it is in any case not the composer's most memorable. As always, the Nash Ensemble deserves praise, both for its playing and the imaginative programming. Trios by Debussy and Ravel, familiar Nash territory, completed a generous evening's music, but how diffuse seemed the Debussy, how uncharacteristically magniloquent the Ravel, in comparison.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Pay threat to Russian economy THE Russian government was yesterday struggling to retain control of its economic reform programme after Mr Boris Yeltsin, the president, reportedly conceded large pay rises for miners and abandoned the target for a balanced budget in the first quarter of the year. Mr Yeltsin, who met representatives from Russia's biggest coalfield, the Kuzbass, on Wednesday, was reported by the Interfax news agency to have conceded their case for higher salaries. Such a concession to the powerful mineworkers would open the way to further wage demands by other industrial workers. At the same time, the chairman of the Russian central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, told the Russian parliament that monetary reform was 'senseless - a complete waste of time and energy' at a time of unrestrained monetary growth. Mr Matiukhin said Russian internal debt had risen to Rbs375bn - though other figures published yesterday showed the Russian debt to be even higher, at Rbs572bn. The bank chairman said that he expected to print Rbs34.3bn in the first quarter of 1992, a significant rise over the same period last year.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Tory MPs warn against further cuts: Reductions cause alarm in Commmons TORY backbenchers yesterday issued stern warnings to the government against further defence cuts, as they emphasised how far the armed forces were already stretched in meeting existing commitments. In a series of interventions that seemed directed at least as much towards the Treasury as towards Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, senior Conservative MPs lined up to stress that they would not support reductions beyond those in the current expenditure plans. Tory reaction in response to Mr Rifkind's Commons statement on the defence white paper was led by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee. He argued that because there could be no cuts in the commitments undertaken by the armed forces, 'it must follow that no further cuts in resource can be made by the Treasury to the funds which are made available to the Ministry of Defence'. Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, a leading member of the Conservative backbench defence committee, said many Tory MPs recognised that UK forces were 'fully stretched'. They did not want Mr Rifkind to have to announce further cuts next year as a result of the annual public spending discussions. Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary, renewed Labour demands for a full-scale defence review. He said defence-spending reductions must be planned and managed on the basis of security and defence, not merely Treasury demands. He added: 'In reality there is increasing demands on our armed forces but with fewer tanks, fewer ships and fewer men and women . . . Nothing has changed. Overstretch will go on.' The starkest warning came from Mr Winston Churchill, a Tory member of the Commons defence committee, who was among those expressing deep concern at the cut in the number of destroyers and frigates. 'We will no longer be able to fulfil our capabilities that we have in the past in the event that we ever have to fight a significant conventional war in the future,' he told MPs. Mr Rifkind disagreed, and insisted that changes were justified since the end of the cold war and the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Old threats would not re-emerge overnight, and if they seemed to be reappearing, the government would have a duty to revise defence capabilities. Following calls by former defence minister Mr Archie Hamilton for a review of the military presence in Northern Ireland, Mr Rifkind reassured Ulster MPs. He pledged that military numbers there would be reduced only if it were justifiable on security grounds.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Abiola supporter forced out in Nigeria NIGERIA'S interim government moved closer to winning the backing of the country's national assembly this week when Mr Iyorchia Ayu, a leading opponent, was forced to stand down as speaker of the Senate, writes Paul Adams in Abuja. The senate, the upper house of a two-chamber national assembly, reconvened on Monday for the first time since President Ibrahim Babangida stepped down on August 26. The military remained in real control but left day to day administration to an interim government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan, who leads a civilian cabinet. Mr Shonekan has promised fresh presidential elections in February, but there has been speculation he would extend his term if given backing for such a move by the assembly. Mr Ayu, a strong supporter of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the annulled presidential poll last June, can stand for re-election at tonight's session of the Senate, but the mood of the house appears to have been shifting towards support for Mr Shonekan. Of the chamber's 91 members, 55 voted for a motion to elect new principal officers. The vote came at the end of two days of heated exchanges between supporters of the government and of Mr Abiola. The assembly is to work alongside the interim government of Mr Shonekan until an elected head of state is installed. Since re-convening, the Senate has been preoccupied with political infighting and has yet to consider the banning of the June presidential poll, validity of the interim government and its proposed agenda, including fresh elections in February.</p>

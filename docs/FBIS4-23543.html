			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 8 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] on Wednesday expressed concern over the  "one-sidedness and sectarian" terms of reference of the proposed  "truth and reconciliation commission". In a statement in  Johannesburg the organisation said all interested parties,  including the PAC, should be invited to discuss these terms as  well as the definition of a political crime before they were  finalised.    "Of particular concern is the sectarian disqualification of  the alleged killers of American student Amy Biehl from amnesty  or indemnity," the statement said.    According to the PAC, their act was political in the sense  that they were involved in a campaign in support of a South  African Democratic Teachers Union strike initiated by the  African National Congress in the Western Cape.    "The trust commission must take into consideration the  definition of the enemy by those who purportedly committed  violent acts," the statement said.</p>

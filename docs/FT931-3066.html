			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Observer: BBC power supply While there may be plenty of reasons for a wholesale clear-out at the top of the BBC in the wake of the John Birt affair, there is one big reason why the authorities should hesitate. Nearly half of the executives on the BBC's board of management have been replaced over the past couple of years and five of the 12 governors are due to retire over the next four months. Some might argue that turnover of top bods has already been too speedy for comfort. After all, the reason for extending Lord Barnett's term as vice-chairman to July 1993 was so that he wouldn't retire at the same time as chairman Marmaduke Hussey. If Hussey is forced to walk the plank, then the government will have to find a new chairman, as well as a vice-chairman and replacements for sensible folk like trade unionist Bill Jordan, Marks &amp; Spencer boss Keith Oates, and thriller writer P D James. Given the calibre of the governors remaining on the board, there is an argument for the BBC breaking with tradition and asking at least a few of the outgoing bigwigs to stay on.</p>

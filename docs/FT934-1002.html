			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Greece's idea of EU future fails to impress Greece yesterday proposed setting up a committee of 'wise men' to study a future European constitution when it takes over the presidency of the European Union in the New Year, but the plan met a cool response from larger member states. Britain, France and Germany yesterday all expressed polite reservations about the idea floated in Brussels by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs. The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht debate' on the future of the European Union has been circulating recently, driven partly by fears that the 12-strong EU could become unwieldy if it takes in Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Mr Pangalos, an outspoken Greek socialist, said his idea of a high-powered independent group of constitutional experts was modelled on the 'Dooge committee', which paved the way for the 1985 Single European Act creating an integrated market by 1992. He added that he was frustrated by recent debate about the institutional impact of enlargement, because it focused on secondary issues such as the number of European Commissioners and the balance of voting power between large and small states. He suggested that the committee could produce a report for heads of government at the European summit in Corfu in June, well in advance of the scheduled 1996 conference which will review Maastricht. 'It is better to have talks about institutional questions now rather than have the question rise up continually like the Loch Ness Monster,' he said. The Greek government takes over the EU presidency from Belgium on January 1. Mr Pangalos described the presidency's goals as tackling unemployment, implementing the European Commission White Paper on competitivness and growth, and producing new initiatives on health, education, culture and consumer protection. On external affairs, he hinted at plans for a new EU 'joint action' on nuclear non-proliferation and new measures to strengthen the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yet Mr Pangalos accused the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia of harbouring territorial claims against the northern Greek province of Macedonia and of engaging in other 'provocations' through the design of its flag.</p>
